                  A preventive maintenance policy that considers information provided by observing the failure history of a repairable system is proposed. For a system that is to be operated for a long time, it is shown that the proposed policy will have a lower expected cost than a periodical one which does not take into account the failure history. Statistical inference using both maximum likelihood point estimates and bootstrap confidence intervals is discussed. The proposed policy is applied to a real situation involving maintenance of off-road engines owned by a Brazilian mining company. A simulation study compares the performance between the maintenance policy proposed and the periodical one.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many equipments used in everyday life are not discarded after they fail. This means that, immediately after a failure, a repair is made which makes the equipment operational once more. On the other hand, some prescheduled maintenance actions are also performed periodically. Hence, for instance, a car owner should make some non-scheduled repairs (e.g. replacing a flat tire) and also take the vehicle to a dealer to be serviced regularly. Designing appropriate maintenance policies helps to maintain the equipment running longer and, hence, minimize operation costs.

Since the early work of Barlow and Hunter (1960), much of the literature regarding optimal maintenance of repairable systems has assumed both minimal repair (MR) and perfect maintenance (PM). MR, also known as as bad as old in the engineering literature, is a corrective action performed after each failure which, supposedly, returns the system to exactly the same condition it was immediately before it failed. Prescheduled PMs or as good as new actions are preventive actions which completely renew the system. However, since the MR assumption is too restrictive, attention has been given recently to imperfect repair (IR) models, which assume that the repair action after a failure is neither minimal nor perfect, in the sense that it restores the system to a condition which is somewhere in between the as bad as old and the as good as new conditions (see, for instance, Kijima, Morimura, & Suzuki, 1988; Doyen & Gaudoin, 2004; Pan & Rigdon, 2009).

Let N(t) be the number of failures up to time t. In MR models, the failure history of the system does not affect the failure intensity and hence, the process N(t) has independent increments and is usually modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Therefore, the optimal PM policy should determine an optimal PM periodicityτP
                     , in the sense that PMs should be performed at times τP
                     , 2 τP
                      and so on. More precisely, denote by λ(t), CR
                      and CM
                      respectively the intensity of the process and the fixed costs of the MR and PM actions. Let

                     2011), Oliveira, Colosimo, and Gilardoni (2012) and Gilardoni, Oliveira, and Colosimo (2013). We note that a slightly more general set up is possible, in the sense that one could assume above (and also in the rest of the paper) that the costs of the PM and MR actions are random variables which are independent of the history of the system and have expected values CM
                      and CR
                     .

The optimal policy mentioned above is a periodical age-dependent policy, in the sense that the unit is maintained at a fixed age τP
                      (for a classification of maintenance policies see Wang, 2002; Das & Sarmah, 2010). There is an extensive literature regarding extensions of the periodical age-dependent policy, including systems which are subject to several types of failures or allowing the optimal policy to perform a PM after the system has reached a predetermined age or a fixed number of failures, whichever comes first (Chien & Sheu, 2006; Colosimo, Santos, Gilardoni, & Motta, 2010; Huynh, Castro, Barros, & Berenguer, 2012).

The maintenance policy (1) can be easily extended for IR models since, from a purely mathematical point of view, an IR model is a general counting process with a random intensity λ(t). Let

                      [compare with (1)]. However, when one has access to the failure history of the equipment when deciding the maintenance policy, the previous solution is not optimal for IR models. From a mathematical viewpoint, the reason is that, since the resulting process N(t) will not have independent increments, the failure history provides information about the future reliability of the system. Consequently, it should be taken into account when determining the optimal policy. For instance, if it has been decided to perform a PM at τP
                      and there is a failure just before that moment, the IR assumption implies that the repair will improve the reliability and, therefore, it will make sense to wait to perform the PM until some moment after τP
                     . Notwithstanding, most of the literature regarding IR models still focus on the idea of optimal periodicity (cf. Kijima et al., 1988; Yevkin & Krivtsov, 2013). Hence, the objective of this paper is to understand how the information provided by the failure history of the system can be used to determine maintenance policies for IR models which improve the optimal periodical policy mentioned above.

We begin by considering a situation whereby one has access to the failure history up to time s. Based on that information, and assuming that the system is deteriorating over time (see Definition 1 and Lemma 1 below for a precise definition of this concept), we find an optimal maintenance policy which minimizes the total expected cost of operating the system for an additional T units of time. More precisely, we consider operating the equipment between s and 
                        
                           s
                           +
                           T
                        
                      and determine the optimal number of PMs n
                     * and the optimal times between successive PMs 
                        
                           
                              τ
                              1
                              *
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              τ
                              
                                 n
                                 *

                     . We call this situation static in the sense that the only information available is the failure history up to s (i.e. no new information becomes available while the optimal policy is being implemented). In the special case that the maintenance period T → ∞, we find that (i) the first PM should be performed at a time instant

Suppose that the operator of the equipment obtains now this static policy using the information provided by the failure history up to s and, after a short period of time ds, recomputes the policy using the information up to

                      and so on. Now the time of the first PM is being recalculated every time and will stay always ahead of the current time, unless, for some time t, we have that the corresponding

Besides the static and the dynamic approach discussed in Sections 3 and 4 and the Monte Carlo study in Section 6, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the notation and gives a brief introduction to counting processes (CP) and IR models. We also introduce the notion of a system which is deteriorating continuously over time, which we call Continuous Wear-out (CWO), and show that it is equivalent to the intensity of the process being itself a submartingale. In order to implement the dynamic policy τD
                     , one has to estimate the threshold 
                        
                           ϕ

                              B
                              
                                 −

                      for the IR model. Hence, Section 5 discusses how to obtain maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and bootstrap confidence intervals for the Kijima et al. (1988) virtual age model. Section 7 contains an application regarding maintenance of off-road engines used in a mining company. Final remarks are given in Section 8.


                     Counting processes. From a modeling point of view, an IR model is a CP such that the failure regime changes every time a failure occurs. Hence, to set up the notation that will be used in the rest of the paper, we begin this section with a brief review of the theory of CPs. The reader interested in more technical details can consult Andersen, Borgan, Gill, and Keiding (1993) or, for a gentler introduction to the topic, Aalen, Borgan, and Gjessing (2008).

Since the trajectories t ↦ N(t, ω) are non-decreasing for (almost) all ω, it is immediate from the definition above that N(t) is a submartingale. Hence, by the Doob–Meyer decomposition, there exists a unique increasing predictable process Λ(t) such that

                           Φ

                           =

                           (
                           t

                     . In a sense, the ROCOF function ϕ(t) is an unconditional version of the intensity λ(t). Hence, for an NHPP, for which λ(t) is deterministic, the intensity and ROCOF functions coincide.

Below we will also be interested in a family of functions which are somewhere in between the intensity and the ROCOF functions, insomuch as they measure the rate of failures at a given time conditional on some distant past. The reason is that, in order to decide a maintenance policy for the time interval 
                        
                           (

                           )
                        
                      given the failure history up to time s, the operator of the repairable equipment under consideration will have to consider

                        Definition 1
                        We say that the CP N(t) has the CWO property if the maps 
                              
                                 t

                                 t

                            are (P-a.s.) increasing for all t > s ≥ 0. The process has the strict continuous wear-out (SCWO) property if the maps 
                              
                                 t
                                 ↦

                                 (

                            are strictly increasing for all t > s ≥ 0.

From a mathematical viewpoint, CWO means that the conditional expectations are increasing. Hence, the following Lemma is not surprising.

                        Lemma 1
                        
                           A CP N(t) has the CWO property if and only if the intensity λ(t) is a submartingale.
                        

If the process has the CWO property, we have that

                     Likelihood functions. There are essentially two ways to observe the failure history of an equipment such as those we address here. Either the system is observed up to a certain predetermined time T, or it is observed until reaching a fixed number of failures n. We say that the observation (design) is respectively time or failure truncated. The likelihood for the failure truncated case is quite simple:

We consider here the following situation. At time s the operator of the equipment has the information 
                        
                           F
                           s
                        
                      and should decide on a maintenance policy for a period of T > 0 units of time starting at s. In other words, we have the information 
                        
                           F
                           s
                        
                      at time s and should decide how many times and when to perform PM in the time interval 
                        
                           [
                           s
                           ,
                           s
                           +
                           T

                     . We will assume that no further information will become available during this period. We are especially interested in the properties of the optimal policy when T is large. We will also assume that the process satisfies SCWO and hence, that the ROCOF function ϕ(t) is strictly increasing.

We begin by noting that under this set up the system is renewed at 
                        
                           s

                      and from then on the problem proceeds without information. Hence, we have the following Lemma, which suggests that in order to obtain an optimal policy in the general set up one has to understand the structure of the optimal policy in the no information case.

The previous section discussed a static situation in the sense that the operator of the equipment learnt the failure history 
                        
                           F
                           s
                        
                      and had to program a maintenance policy using that and only that information. However, it may be more realistic to consider a situation in which the optimal policy can be revised as more information becomes available over time.

Suppose that at each time s the operator learns 
                        
                           F
                           s
                        
                      and revises the previous maintenance policy computing PM
                     *(s, T). For large T, it should then be clear that the only relevant equation is (14). In other words, suppose that PM
                     *(s, T → ∞) specifies a PM at

                      is no longer relevant. Therefore, if we consider a process where new information is becoming available continuously over time and the corresponding policies are being revised accordingly, a PM will occur if and only if (14) holds for

                      for some s. In other words, a PM will occur at t if and only if (2) holds. More precisely, in this case the maintenance policy is a (random) stopping time

Implementation of the dynamic policy (2) is straightforward: one needs to compute (an estimate of) the single quantity

                     In other words, at each failure the operator computes the right hand side of (20). This is the waiting lapse until the next PM provided that no new failures occur before it. On the contrary, if a new failure occurs before the PM is performed, (20) is computed again to obtain a new PM lapse and so on.

                     A similar reasoning applies if the system is maintained according to τP
                      although, since τP
                      is deterministic and fixed, the cost per unit of time will be in this case

                     The following theorem states that, for a system that is deteriorating over time, the right hand side of (21) is smaller than that of (22).

                           Suppose that the process N(t) has the CWO property and is uniformly integrable and that the intensity λ(t) has only negative (downward) jumps. Then

First, note from Lemma 1 that the intensity λ(t) is a submartingale and hence has a Doob–Meyer decomposition

In order to estimate the right hand side of (19) we proceed as follows. First, we maximize numerically (24) to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs)

                              ^
                           
                           ,
                           
                              η
                              ^

                     . The mean Φ(t) and ROCOF ϕ(t) functions are now (deterministic) functions of the model parameters. Hence, at least in theory, the MLEs could be substituted by their expression in terms of (β, η, θ) to obtain the MLE of those functions. However, since there is no closed form for Φ(t) and ϕ(t), we used a Monte Carlo step inside the estimation procedure instead. More precisely, once that

                      following the procedure explained below. In fact, we take the Monte Carlo size M large enough to make the approximation error at least one order of magnitude less than the MLEs error. Hence, in practice, the relevant uncertainty in the final estimates would depend only on the precision of the MLEs.

We note that, since the right hand sides of (19) and (20) do not depend on the history of the system, the Monte Carlo simulation has to be done only once during the entire process.

Due to the fact that Φ(t) and ϕ(t) are estimated using an auxiliary Monte Carlo simulation, the calculation of standard deviations using the Delta Method is difficult. Instead, we propose to compute confidence intervals based on a parametric bootstrap. Suppose we want a confidence interval for τVA
                     . A bootstrap sample of τVA
                      can be obtained as follows:

In this section we present a simulation study conducted in order to provide a better understanding of the economic impact of implementing the dynamic policy proposed in the previous sections. Monte Carlo experiments were carried out to estimate the costs per unit of time for the dynamic and periodical policies in different scenarios. We note that the comparison addresses a point which is slightly different from the result in Theorem 5, in the sense that here we are comparing

The simulations were done using a script written in R, a language and environment for statistical computing (www.R-project.org, v.2.15). The performance of each policy was measured computing the mean cost per unit of time for the periodical and dynamic policy. For each scenario, failure times were generated for

both the periodical and the dynamic policies.

The η value remained fixed at 15,000 units of time since it is essentially a scale parameter and has no important consequence in the comparison of the policies. The procedure to run the simulation for each scenario and policy is described below.

For the periodical maintenance policy, we first obtained the optimal PM period τP
                      for each scenario. Then, for each of the Monte Carlo replications, failures were generated up to τP
                     . The observed number of failures was then used to compute the actual cost per unit of time, 
                        
                           [

                     number of failures]/τP
                     . The average of the

                      replications of these actual costs is reported in Table 1 under the columns labeled periodical, together with their standard deviation.

Since the truncation time τD
                      is random, the procedure for the dynamic policy is more complicated. We first computed the right hand side of (20) using

                                 (
                                 t
                                 )

                      to obtain a provisional value of τD
                     . Then, we generated a failure time for the given scenario and replication. If the failure occurred after the provisional τD
                     , we stopped and computed the corresponding cost per unit of time 
                        
                           [
                           
                              C
                              M

                           ×
                        
                      0]/τD
                     . Otherwise, we recomputed the right hand side of (20) to obtain a new provisional τD
                      and generated a new failure. If this new failure occurred after the tentative τD
                     , we stopped and computed now the cost 
                        
                           [

                      1]/τD
                      and so on, until a PM was effectively realized. The average and standard deviation of the

                      replications of the cost per unit of time for each scenario is reported in Table 1 under the columns labeled dynamic.

In addition to the point estimates for the cost reported in Table 1, Fig. 3
                     
                      plots the same point estimates versus β and θ. The main findings are described below.

                        
                           •
                           For both policies, the mean costs decrease as the efficiency of repair θ decreases [see Fig. 3(a) to (c)]. In other words, the better the repair the lower the mean cost. However, this effect is more evident for the dynamic policy. In addition, for the same degree of repair, the mean costs for the dynamic policy are lower than the respective ones for the periodical policy. We note however that we have assumed that repair actions with different degrees have the same cost. A very important point to be observed from Table 1
is that the differences in costs between the two policies are inversely proportional to θ. In general, as we get closer to MR (i.e. θ↑1), we have lower differences between the costs under the two policies.

For smaller values of the cost ratio CM
                              /CR
                              , the mean costs per unit time for a given policy tend to be practically the same, no matter the effect of the repair. This pattern can be observed for both policies, although it is more evident for the dynamic policy. In practice, this result indicates that if one is dealing with much higher CR
                               costs, there is not much difference if one assumes IR of any degree or MR.

For both policies, an increase in β leads to a decrease in the mean cost. This can be explained by the fact that, under such policies, a stronger convexity for the intensity function determines shorter intervals between PM actions and, consequently, less failures are observed in the systems.

Finally, the point estimates of the mean costs are consistently lower for the dynamic than for the periodical policy.

Off-road trucks are used to transport loose materials such as minerals and waste in mining operations. Good performance of this equipment is essential for the financial health of this kind of business. Due to the high costs involved, a great concern is the implementation of sound maintenance policies in order to prolong their life and reduce expenses generated by the occurrence of unexpected failures. In the case studied here, the company wanted to adopt a maintenance policy that favored preventive maintenance, as opposed to repair actions taken after failures. More precisely, the company declared that a repair was 23 percent more expensive than a maintenance (i.e. the cost ratio

                              C
                              R
                           
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           1.23
                        
                     ).

The data set consists of 208 failure times, in hours of operation, recorded for a sample of 193 diesel engines used in off-road trucks. The number of failures per engine ranged from zero up to 4. Out of the 193 engines, 52 were time truncated due to the fact that their last inspection time corresponds to a preventive maintenance.


                     Fig. 4 (a) plots the mean cumulative number of failures versus time. The convex shape of this function indicates that failures tend to occur more frequently as the system age increases. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume SCWO and to search for a PM policy in order to avoid frequent failures.

                               hours, the optimal time to the first PM must be recalculated according to (20) and so on.

We proposed a dynamic method to estimate the optimal PM policy for repairable systems. This dynamic policy updates the optimal PM time continuously as the information provided by the failure history of the system becomes available.

The dynamic policy was derived for a fully general IR model, in the sense of a system whose failures occur according to an arbitrary counting process, with the only restriction that the system is deteriorating continuously over time. This assumption, which we called Continuous Wear-out, was shown to be equivalent to the intensity of the counting process being itself a submartingale. When compared to the usual periodical maintenance policy of Barlow and Hunter (1960), we proved in Theorem 5 that, if both used over a long period of time, the dynamic policy will tend to incur in lower operating costs than the periodical one.

In Sections 5 and 7 we considered implementing both the dynamic and periodical policies in the context of the ARA1 virtual age model (Doyen & Gaudoin, 2004; Kijima et al., 1988). We showed how to obtain MLEs for the model parameters and used a Monte Carlo step to compute approximations to the MLEs of the ROCOF and related functions, for which there is no closed form expression. Our proposal also includes a parametric bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals for the model parameters and for the periodical and dynamic maintenance policies.

Finally, to better understand the implications of the dynamic policy, as well as the result proved in Theorem 5, Section 6 reported on the main findings of a simulation study conducted in order to compare the performance of the periodical and dynamic policies. It showed that the expected operating cost per unit of time may be much lower when using the dynamic policy, especially when either (i) the cost ratio CM
                     /CR
                      is large or (ii) the effect of the repair is far from the MR case.
