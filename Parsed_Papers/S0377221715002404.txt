                  When procuring a product from a supplier, a buyer faces the problem of designing a payment scheme to screen the supplier’s quality level and cost. We explore an instalment payment (contract) consisting of an initial payment to the supplier as soon as the product is put in use, followed by a deferred payment that is contingent upon the product in normal operation within a certain period. We find that when the high quality supplier has a higher cost than the low quality supplier, and the suppliers’ financing costs are lower than a certain threshold, the optimal instalment payment has two options: an initial-payment-only option preferred by the low quality supplier and a deferred-payment-only option preferred by the high quality supplier; otherwise, the optimal contract degenerates into an initial-payment-only option. Thus, our research complements past work on moral hazard where no initial payment is proposed. Moreover, we show that the buyer has an incentive to assist with the supplier’s financing. Finally, we compare the instalment payment with the rental contract and show that when the supplier’s financing cost is low or the quality difference among different supplier types is small, the rental contract is more likely to be preferred by the buyer than the instalment payment.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

When sourcing from a supplier, the downstream buyer’s key concern is how to encounter information asymmetry on the supplier’s quality level and cost. In this paper we first investigate the role of the instalment payment contract in screening this two dimensional information asymmetry, and then compare it with the rental contract. Here, the instalment payment consists of an initial payment remitted when the product
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Usually, the product can be a machinery, tool, truck or equipment. We call it a product throughout the paper.
                      is put into use and a deferred payment made after the product has been in normal operation or has demonstrated desired performances for a specified period of time. This deferred payment can be viewed as a reward: if the product remains in good condition for a certain period, then the buyer will reward the supplier. On the other hand, the rental contract refers to the “pay-as-you-go” contract that the buyer just rents the product from the supplier and returns it to the supplier as soon as the product is not used.

Our research questions are as follows: when to use the instalment payment scheme or the rental contract? If the buyer chooses the rental contract, then what is the optimal rental contract? Furthermore, if the buyer decides to adopt the instalment payment scheme, then what is the buyer’s optimal instalment payment scheme? As a low quality product is more likely to fail before paying the deferred payment, thus this payment arrangement makes it too costly for the low quality supplier to imitate the high quality supplier. So, this underlying logic implies that the buyer should always adopt the deferred payment method to screen the supplier’s quality level. But that being the case, why do we observe the pay-on-delivery arrangement in practice (Beil, 2010)? Here, the pay-on-delivery arrangement refers to a practice in which the chosen supplier receives only a fixed initial payment, independent of the supplier’s type or whether the provided product fails during its service. That is, in this arrangement no deferred payment takes place at all.

In this paper, we investigate the questions above by considering a two echelon supply chain, in which the buyer procures a product from the supplier. There are two dimensions of asymmetric information: the supplier’s quality level and cost (of getting the product), both of which can be either high or low. So, there are at most four types of the supplier: high quality and low cost, high quality and high cost, low quality and low cost, and low quality and high cost. As a screening game, the supplier exactly knows its type but the buyer does not. However, the buyer can design and offer a menu of contracts with different options to let the supplier tell the truth.

For the relationship between the supplier’s quality level and cost, we mainly consider three cases: the substitutable case (in which there exist a high quality and high cost type and a low quality and low cost type), the complementary case (in which there exist a high quality and low cost type and a low quality and high cost type), and the independent case (for each quality level, high or low, the buyer might be dealing with both a high and low cost type). It is worth noting that the supplier with high quality incurs a low cost is supported in practice (Lapré, Mukherjee, & Van Wassenhove, 2000; Srinidhi & Balachandran, 1996): first, the high quality supplier enjoys a sound basic infrastructure or better economies of scope, e.g., better trained and more experienced workers or a more scientific organisation of manufacturing; second, being at a more advanced stage along the learning curve, the high quality supplier reduces waste, thereby producing products in a more economical way and incurring a lower cost.

We analytically find that the optimal instalment payment scheme critically depends upon the relationship between the supplier’s quality level and cost. Specifically, in the substitutable case, unless the supplier’s financing cost is too high, the buyer offers an initial-payment-only option and a deferred-payment-only option. The low quality supplier prefers the first option, while the high quality supplier prefers the second option. So, the instalment payment leads to a separating equilibrium, which can screen the supplier’s private information. Also, it is in the buyer’s interest to assist with the supplier’s financing to reduce the supplier’s discount rate, since by doing so, the supplier increases his discounted value of the deferred payment.

However, in the complementary or independent case, an initial-payment-only option is offered by the buyer, because the deferred payment is not effective in screening the supplier’s type as the high quality supplier can always imitate the low quality supplier. Therefore, we help to provide theoretical supports for the well-established pay-on-delivery arrangement in practice. Also, we provide theoretical supports to the common practice of ruling out the supplier type with low quality but high cost, since doing so greatly reduces the information rent (which is referred to as the profit the agent derives from having information not provided to the buyer) the buyer pays to other supplier types. Here, for exposition, we call this type the least competent type.

Additionally, we complement Babich and Tang (2012), who found that the buyer should adopt the deferred payment without any initial payment to motivate the supplier’s high level of effort under moral hazard. Here, moral hazard refers to situations in which the product’s quality depends upon the supplier’s actions (e.g., putting forth high or low level of effort) that are unobservable to the buyer. Besides moral hazard, the second category of asymmetric information is adverse selection (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991), in which the buyer cannot observe the product’s quality. So, our work uncovers the fact that under adverse selection, the buyer should adopt the deferred payment for the high quality supplier only in the absence of the least competent supplier. Otherwise, the buyer should only use the initial payment. So, managers who want to take advantage of a deferred payment before deciding the exact payment scheme must know which kind of information asymmetry they are dealing with (moral hazard or adverse selection). If it is adverse selection, then as explored in our paper, the manager needs to understand the relationship between the supplier’s quality level and its cost, i.e., whether the buyer is facing the substitutable, complementary or independent case.

As a primary theoretical contribution to the contract design literature under asymmetric information, we identify the buyer’s key tradeoff in encountering the adverse selection issue: a payment later is discounted more by the supplier than an earlier payment (defined as the valuation difference effect). However, paying later rather than earlier makes the buyer more likely to screen the supplier’s quality level simply because as time goes on, the lower quality product is more likely to fail (defined as the screening effect).

Furthermore, based on this tradeoff, we explore the effect of the rental contract on screening the supplier’s private information. In terms of the buyer’s profit, the instalment payment dominates the rental contract with a fixed rental rate mainly because of the valuation difference effect. Allowing the rental rate to be time dependent, the instalment payment is preferred by the buyer in the complete information and the independent cases, while for other cases, only when the supplier’s financing cost is low enough (such as the supplier is not very small or does not have a restricted access to the financial market when compared with the buyer) or the quality difference among different supplier types is small, the rental contract dominates the instalment payment.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        It is worth noting that our comparison between the instalment payment and the rental contract is from the operational perspective. In reality, several non-operational reasons limit the application of the rental contract. First, the purchased machine can be chosen as the mortgaged asset for applying loans; however, no rented machine can play such a role since it is not recognized as the buyer’s asset. Second, sometimes buying a machinery can enjoy the tax deduction, e.g., the cut of purchase tax. Also, in the ever-increasing adoption of the value-added tax system, buying a machinery rather than renting one provides a reduced tax base. So, these non-operational factors favour buying the product instead of renting it. None of these factors is considered in our comparison because of our focused attention in the operations management field.
                     
                  

The comparison of the instalment payment scheme and the rental contract under adverse selection fits with the case of procuring some medical equipment from an intermediary in China, especially when the inspection is destructive or time-consuming. More justification on this application is listed in Appendix. We find that when the supplier is large enough to have a deep pocket (or gets convenient and efficient access to the credit market), the rental contract is preferred by the buyer over the instalment payment. Hospitals in China usually deal with large suppliers, so our model predicts the popularity of the rental contract. Our prediction agrees with the practice, as the majority of MRI equipment is rented by the Chinese hospital.

Last but not least, to solve our multidimensional adverse selection is far more complicated than the conventional one-dimensional adverse selection problem, because the single crossing property (which is crucial for the existence of the separating equilibrium under one-dimensional adverse selection) does not hold in general. So, the techniques employed to draw up the buyer’s optimal contract vary greatly among these three cases and can be applied to solve similar problems with instalment payment. That is our technical contribution.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Section 3 studies the basic model under complete information. Section 4 analyzes the buyer’s contract design problem, while Section 5 presents a general payment as a continuous function of time including the rental contract. Section 6 gives a few concluding remarks. All proofs are given in the supplement. Throughout this paper, we use the terms increasing and decreasing in a weak sense unless otherwise noted.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There are three streams of related research. The first is quality management research. The relationship between the quality level and the production cost comes from the state-of-the-art research on the learning curve. This includes the work of Fine (1986), Srinidhi and Balachandran (1996) and Lapré et al. (2000). They found that one firm can provide a high quality product at a low cost at the advanced stage of the learning curve. Under complete information, Lee, Rhee, and Cheng (2013) looked the coordination of a decentralized supply chain under revenue-sharing, buybacks contracts and quality compensation contracts given the supplier’s quality uncertainty. Different from theirs, we are in a decentralized supply chain under asymmetric information.

Warranty studies in quality management also deal with a payment contingent upon the failure being taken within a certain period. See the comprehensive reviews by Blischke and Murthy (1996) and Blischke, Karim, and Murthy (2001). Murthy, Solem, and Roren (2004) reviewed research on product warranty logistics, ranging from deciding the location of repairing service centers to transporting the material needed for warranty servicing, and managing spare parts inventory. Chien and Chen (2008) solved the optimal policy of ordering spare parts for a non-repairable product with a limited-duration lifetime when a proportion of the sales price was refunded if the product failed during the warranty period. In the context of one product and deterministic demand, the optimal policy of purchasing spare parts under a trade-off between product availability for replacement and costs of product obsolescence was studied in Sahyouni, Savaskan, and Daskin (2010). Heijden and Iskandar (2013) further considered this problem for a general case of multiple products and random demand. Shafieea and Chukovab (2013) reviewed the effect of warranty terms on the manufacturers’ corrective and preventive maintenance effort. Esmaeili, Gamchi, and Asgharizadeh (2014) investigated a three-level service contract between a manufacturer, an agent and a customer. Different from these papers, our work is on the deferred payment instead of warranty design.

The second stream of research comes from the studies on asymmetric information in economics and operations management. Our main model falls into the category of the multidimensional adverse selection. Crocker and Snow (2011) solved a multidimensional adverse selection problem in the insurance market. Figalli, Kim, and McCann (2011) studied a general framework of multidimensional screening under certain mathematical properties of the objective functions. State-of-art works by Crama, Reyck, and Degraeve (2008, 2013) explored designing optimal licensing contracts for single-phase or multi-phase R&D projects. Different from their studies, we check how does the relationship between the quality premium and cost affect the principal’s contract design.

A closely related research in this second stream is the supply chain management under asymmetric information. Specifically, among these studies with unknown information about the supplier’s quality, Lim (2000) considered the buyer’s optimal contract design consisting of the reward and initial payment when both the reliability and cost of third party logistics provider are unknown to the buyer. The reward was granted to the supplier when the logistic service was done, and thus no endogenous payment time was considered. In her paper, the service provider’s reliability and cost were independent. In addition to this independent case, we explore the complementary and substitutable cases and solve the optimal instalment payment scheme in each case. Lim (2001) treated the supplier’s quality level as given and studied how to screen different suppliers’ quality levels through the inspection intensity and a contractible penalty. Instead, we focus on exploring the buyer’s choices with regard to the instalment payment and the rental contract.

Note that there are papers using the same adverse selection framework while on issues other than the supplier’s quality level, e.g., Ha (2001) investigated the unit production cost, and Liu and Song (2014) studied the fixed order cost.

In the moral hazard category, Reyniers and Tapiero (1995) wrote a seminal work on the role of the buyer’s inspection in motivating the supplier’s quality enhancement efforts. Babich and Tang (2012) explored the role of a deferred payment in motivating the supplier’s quality enhancement effort, and no initial payment was proposed, while our work reveals how to use the deferred payment to cope with the adverse selection issue. Also, our work is applicable to a far more general setting because we consider a general situation, in which the high quality product can cost more or less to produce than the low quality product.

The last stream of research is from supply chain finance, which also deal with designing the optimal payment timing. See the literature review in Bing, Chen, and Cai (2012) and Zhou, Zhong, and Li (2012). Different from ours, this stream of research does not study the information asymmetry on quality.

We consider a supplier (he) selling a product to a buyer (she). The buyer will use the product to complete a project. Based on reliability theory and reliability engineering, the service life of the supplier’s product in normal operation can be reasonably modelled as an exponential distributed random variable with a constant failure rate λf
                     . So, the supplier’s quality level can be characterized by λf
                     . The buyer’s project starts at time 0. Given a completion time T of the project, the probability that the supplier’s product works well during the whole project is

                                    λ
                                    f
                                 
                                 T
                              
                           
                           ,
                        
                      i.e., the probability that the product works well for more than a duration of T. Also, the value (to the buyer) of the supplier’s product in normal operation until the project’s completion is vn
                     , and the failure of the product brings a value vf
                      ≤ vn
                     , then the total expected value is

                        We thank an anonymous referee for the suggestion on adding the comparison between warranty and deferred payment, since in nature both deal with a payment contingent upon the failure being taken within a certain period. The warranty of the medical equipment covers more than 1 year, while the deferred payment is usually due about 1–6 months. So, when the buyer makes decisions on the deferred payment, the effect of warranty on his future benefit from the equipment is well taken into account. In other words, the buyer’s values vn
                            and vf
                            are the corresponding values covered by the warranty.
                      By setting v = vn

The payment from the buyer to the supplier consists of two parts: an initial payment x and a deferred payment y committed to be paid at time t ∈ [0, T] if no failure of the supplier’s product has occurred. Given the exponential distribution of the life time of the supplier’s product, the supplier can get the deferred payment y with a probability

                      is the supplier’s discount rate. We assume that both players are risk neutral

                        This assumption, which follows from the work of Corbett and Tang (1999), is made to simplify our analysis, since even under a risk averse setting, the basic tradeoff in adopting the deferred payment identified in our paper still qualitatively holds. Thus, a more general setting complicates the analysis without adding additional findings.
                      and normalize the supplier’s outside reservation value to be 0.

If the buyer has complete information about the supplier’s quality level, then the only constraint on the buyer’s payment is the supplier’s individual rationality (IR) constraint, which guarantees the supplier’s participation as follows:

                     where αb
                      is the buyer’s discount rate. In practice, as noted in Babich and Tang (2012), the buyer is a larger firm with a higher credit rating than that of the supplier. Therefore, the supplier’s discount rate is higher than the buyer’s: αs
                      ≥ αb
                     ,

                        5
                        In the supplement we present a special case of identical discount factors, i.e., αs
                            = αb
                           .
                      which reflects the fact that the supplier is smaller and thus has a more restricted access to the credit market than does the buyer. In the terminology in supply chain finance, the supplier has a higher financing cost, or the buyer has deeper pockets than does the supplier (Bing et al., 2012).

We have the buyer’s optimal decision in the following proposition.

                        Proposition 1
                        
                           To maximize her profit under complete information, the buyer sets xF
                            = c, yF
                            = 0 and tF
                            = 0.
                              6
                           
                           
                              6
                              Since the deferred payment y = 0, the determination of t, namely the time to pay this deferred payment, is trivial. For simplicity, we set t = 0 in this case.
                           
                        

No deferred payment is used because the buyer pays the supplier at time 0. The reason is that any deferred payment y at time t is valued as 
                        
                           y

                      by the supplier at time 0 and valued as

                      by the buyer at time 0. Because the buyer’s discount rate is smaller than the supplier’s discount rate, a deferred payment is

                      times more valuable to the buyer than to the supplier. So, when there is no need to screen the supplier’s quality level, the buyer makes only an initial payment to the supplier. The supplier’s profit is only his reservation value under complete information. Thus, all benefits are extracted by the buyer and the buyer’s profit is maximized. For exposition, we call this the first best result for the buyer.

Here, we consider two-dimensional asymmetric information about the supplier’s quality level and cost. Specifically, there are two types of supplier’s quality level: high quality λh
                      and low quality λl
                      with λh
                      ≤ λl
                     .

                        7
                        Here, for ease of using the subscript later, high quality is characterized by 1/λh
                            ≥ 1/λl
                           ; that is, the expected longevity of the high quality product in a good state 1/λh
                            is longer than that of the low quality product 1/λl
                           .
                      To the buyer, working with each quality level can generate revenues

                      ≤ λl
                      results in Rh
                      ≥ Rl
                     . That is, the buyer benefits more from a high quality supplier. Also, there are two types of cost: high cost ch
                      and low cost cl
                      with ch
                      ≥ cl

Denote by pij
                      the ex-ante probability that the supplier’s quality level is λi
                      and the cost is cj, i, j ∈ {l, h}. If phl
                      = 0 and plh
                      = 0, then the high quality supplier is more costly. This is the substitutable case defined in Section 1. On the other hand, if phh
                      = 0 and pll
                      = 0, then this is the complementary case: the high quality supplier is a low cost one, while the low quality supplier is the high cost one. The last is the independent case, which means that it is possible to have both high cost and low cost types for each quality level, so all four supplier types are possible.

For exposition, for x, t and y, the subscript “ij” is used to denote the option in the menu of contracts for the supplier with type ij. Also, vectors in boldface u:= (uhh, uhl, ulh, ull
                     ), where u = x, t, y, refer to all the possible values. The sequence of events is as follows:

                        
                           (1)
                           The buyer offers a menu of contracts to the supplier specifying the instalment payment parameters (xij, tij, yij
                              ).

If the supplier rejects the contract, the game ends; otherwise, the supplier reports its type ij and starts to work for the buyer.

The supplier receives the initial payment xij
                               immediately after delivering the product to the buyer.

If no failure takes place before time tij
                              , the supplier gets the deferred payment yij
                              .

                     That is, the buyer’s problem becomes the maximisation of her own profit subject to the supplier’s IC and IR constraints. Since the exact formulation of the IC and IR constraints depends upon the specific relationship between the supplier’s quality level and cost, i.e., whether the case is substitutable, complementary or independent, to determine the buyer’s optimal contract, it is necessary to check each case.

Interestingly, from Proposition 2 the high quality supplier earns no information rent due to his cost disadvantage (compared with the low quality supplier). On the other hand, it is the low quality supplier who gets the information rent unless his cost is very high: there exists a threshold of the low quality supplier’s cost ch
                        /eλ
                        , which is the high quality supplier’s cost ch
                         adjusted by the quality premium (in the form of the quality difference λ). If cl
                         is lower than the threshold, the low quality supplier enjoys an information rent; otherwise, he only makes his ends meet. So, in a two-dimensional adverse selection model like ours, the low quality supplier earns an information rent if and only if his cost is lower enough. The larger the cost difference is, the lower the threshold will be. Hence, the larger the quality difference, the less likely the low quality supplier will earn the information rent.

Indeed, choosing when to pay the deferred payment, the buyer has to make a tradeoff. On one hand, the longer the deferred payment takes (indicated by a larger t), the less likely the low quality type will choose this option, since his product is more likely to fail. For exposition, we call this the screening effect (of the deferred payment). On the other hand, the buyer has to pay more to the high quality type, as the supplier discounts more aggressively than the buyer: given a deferred payment schedule t, one unit payment at time t is valued as 
                           
                              e

                         by the buyer at time 0, which is

                                 −
                                 
                                    α

                                 )
                                 t
                              
                           
                         times more valued by the supplier. This valuation difference 
                           
                              e
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    α
                                    s
                                 
                                 −
                                 
                                    α
                                    b
                                 
                                 )
                                 t
                              
                           
                         is due to the dissimilar discount rates increases in t; thus, the larger t is, the more the buyer will lose from this valuation difference. For exposition, we call this the valuation difference effect (of the deferred payment).
                           10
                        
                        
                           10
                           In Proposition 1, there is no screening effect under complete information, so only the valuation difference effect exists. This drives the buyer’s choice of only an initial payment.
                        
                     

When αs
                         is large enough (relatively to αb
                        ), implied by a very large α, the valuation difference effect dominates the screening effect. So, facing an impatient supplier with a higher discount rate or a small supplier with a limited access to the credit market, the buyer offers only an initial payment to both supplier types. On the other extreme with a very small αs
                        , 
                           11
                        
                        
                           11
                           For this case, a good example is α = 0 such that both the buyer and the supplier have the same discount rate. Hence, the valuation difference effect vanishes. As a result, for three subintervals of 
                                 
                                    t
                                    
                                       h
                                       h
                                    
                                    *
                                 
                               specified in Proposition 2, only the last subinterval exists while the former two disappear.
                         the supplier is large enough to have deeper pockets or gets convenient and efficient access to the credit market. The valuation difference effect is dominated by the screening effect, and the buyer chooses to make only an initial payment to the low quality type and only a deferred payment to the high quality type. Both supplier types receive only their own costs, and the high quality type strictly prefers the deferred payment option while the low quality type is indifferent between these two options. For the median value of α, the valuation difference effect is weighted about the same as the screening effect. The buyer offers two options: one is only the initial payment cl
                         and the other is only the deferred payment. The low quality type is indifferent between these two options, while the high quality type prefers the second option because it lets him take advantage of his high quality, which translates into less likelihood of product failure.

Moreover, Proposition 2 shows that the deferred payment time 
                           
                              t

                                 h
                              
                              *
                           
                         depends upon αs
                         and αb
                         only through their difference α. Similarly, 
                           
                              t

                                 h
                              
                              *
                           
                         depends upon λl
                         and λh
                         only through λ. Before further discussing the relationship between 
                           
                              t

                         and α or λ, it is helpful to have the following lemma.

                           Lemma 1
                           
                              There exists

                                       (

                                       )

                              increases in α if and only if λ ≥ 
                                 λ
                               (α).
                           

A large enough λ just reflects a nontrivial quality difference between the two supplier types. Moreover, using the data from Babich and Tang (2012), i.e., αs
                               = 0.2, αb
                               = 0.1
                                 12
                              
                              
                                 12
                                 Because e
                                    −0.1/e
                                    −0.2 ≈ 0.105, the supplier’s unit finance cost is about 10.5 percent higher than the buyer’s.
                              , and letting λh
                               = 0.25 and phh
                               = pll
                               = 0.5, the numerical result shows 
                                 λ
                               (0.1) = 0.025. That is, λl
                               = 1.1λh
                              , or the life expectancy of the high quality product in normal operation is about 10 percent longer than that of the low quality product. This is not restrictive. As shown in Campanella and Corcoran (1982) and Ittner, Nagar, and Rajan (2001), the trouble-free service life of the same vehicle parts from one firm can be more than 1/3 higher than the other firm. Also, 
                                 λ
                               (α) increases in phh
                              /pll
                              . Thus, when phh
                               is very small or correspondingly pll
                               is very large, 
                                 λ
                               (α) is relatively very small. For instance, given the data above, 
                                 λ
                               (0.1) = 0.02 when phh
                               = 0.4 and pll
                               = 0.6. That is, the expected service life of the high quality product in normal operation is about 8 percent longer than that of the low quality product.


                        Lemma 1, together with Proposition 2, implies that the metric β:= αphh
                        /(λpll
                        ) critically determines the linear structure of the optimal deferred payment time. This metric is larger when the quality difference λ becomes smaller (thus the need for screening the quality level is weakened), or the valuation difference effect measured by α gets more significant, or the probability of having a high quality supplier is more likely (phh
                        /pll
                         is larger). When this metric is large enough falling in the first segment of Proposition 2 (which corresponds to the case of the valuation difference effect dominating the screening effect or a more likelihood of having a high quality supplier), no deferred payment is adopted since the benefit of screening the low quality supplier is limited. When this metric is small enough falling in the third segment of Proposition 2 (corresponding to the case of the valuation difference effect dominated by the screening effect or a less likelihood of dealing with a high quality supplier), the low quality supplier is indifferent between two offered options while the high quality supplier strongly prefers the option with deferred payment, thus the buyer is successfully screening out different supplier types, so that no prior information of the supplier type is needed in designing the optimal contract. When this metric is medium falling in the second segment of Proposition 2 (corresponding to a case of the equal importance of the valuation difference effect and the screening effect or the equal likelihood of both supplier types after being adjusted with the quality difference λ and the discount rate difference α), no cost information is needed in designing the optimal payment time because the main concern for the buyer is driven by striking a balance between these two effects.

Based on Lemma 1, we have the following proposition, which is also vividly shown in Fig. 1a.

                         will be. That is, a higher supplier’s financing cost leads to a faster deferred payment. The reason is that, due to a larger αs
                        , the valuation difference effect is weighted more by the buyer than the screening effect, so it makes the deferred payment sooner. However, the relationship between

                         and λ, the metric on the difference in the supplier’s quality level, is more complicated. In particular, when the valuation difference effect dominates the screening effect,

                         is independent of λ. On the other hand, when the screening effect dominates the valuation difference effect,

                         decreases in λ since a larger λ implies that it is more costly for the low quality type to imitate the high quality type, even a lower

                         is enough to make the deferred payment less attractive to the low quality type. When neither the screening effect nor the valuation difference effect is dominant, if the difference in the cost is not too large (ch

Next we investigate the sensitivity of the buyer’s profit to the parameters. Proposition 2 implies that in equilibrium the buyer’s expected profit is

                              * 
                              decreases in αb and λl when v is large enough.

                                 The exact low bound on v is very complex, as shown in the proof.
                              
                           


                        Proposition 4 shows that it is in the buyer’s interest to deal with a supplier with a smaller discount rate, e.g., the supplier has a deeper pocket, or better access to the credit market, or higher liquidity guaranteed by a large percentage of working capital in the balance sheet. The reason is that as long as the valuation difference effect is mitigated, the deferred payment to the high quality type takes less time as a result of a smaller 
                           
                              
                                 t
                                 
                                    h
                                    h
                                 
                                 *
                              
                              ,
                           
                         thus increasing the buyer’s profit. Also, this finding implies that the buyer’s financial assistance to the supplier, e.g., directly subsidizing the supplier’s financing or underwriting the supplier’s borrowing, is to the buyer’s own benefit. To our knowledge, we are the first to uncover the link between the buyer’s assistance with the supplier’s financing and the information rent paid by the buyer. This possibly opens a bridge linking the growing body of the research on supply chain finance and that on quality management.

Moreover, when the project has a greater value for the buyer implied by a higher v, the buyer’s profit decreases in λl
                        . Given 1/λl
                         as the metric of the quality level of this supplier, the higher this quality metric is, the more profit the buyer will enjoy. Meanwhile, the buyer’s profit increases in 1/λh
                        . One reason for this is the increased Rh
                        ; the other is that, given λl
                        , under a smaller λh
                         the screening effect is even more pronounced, since under a deferred payment, it costs the low quality type even more to imitate the high quality type.

                              so no deferred payment is designed for each supplier type.
                           

The contract design problem for the buyer is very simple now, since she will offer both supplier types the same initial payment and no deferred payment. Instead of no premiums in the substitutable case, now the high quality type enjoys an information rent ch
                         − cl
                         as a result of the presence of the low quality and high cost type (indicated by plh
                         > 0). The reason is that the high quality type has both the quality and cost advantage over the low quality type. As a result, for an option accepted by the low quality type, the high quality type can always imitate himself as the low quality type without violating his own IR constraint. In other words, the screening effect disappears now, and only the valuation difference effect remains. Thus, the buyer is happy to pay the supplier as soon as possible. Recall that under complete information, only an initial payment comes into being in the same spirit: only the valuation difference effect holds.

Moreover, for the low quality type, the individual rationality constraint is more stringent than the incentive compatibility constraint. Because of his cost disadvantage, it is in the buyer’s interest to offer an initial payment that is equal to this type’s cost. This also offers an important managerial insight for the supplier. As shown in Proposition 5, the high quality but low cost supplier is in a good position to enjoy the information rent. So, in comparison with Proposition 2, from the perspective of the high quality supplier, it is in his interest to move along the learning curve to more advanced stage due to the magnet of the information rent.

The buyer’s profit Π
                        * = pllRl
                         + phhRh
                         − ch
                         decreases in λh
                         and λl
                        , because Rh
                         decreases in λh
                         and Rl
                         decreases in λl
                        . Thus, the buyer should help both supplier types to improve the quality level. However, Π
                        * is independent of αs
                        , implying that the buyer has no incentive to help with the supplier’s financing when the high quality type is at an advanced stage along the learning curve.

Now, we study the independent case. There are four supplier types and the buyer’s problem is

Interestingly, in the independent case the payment terms for all supplier types are the same; hence, the buyer’s optimal contract design becomes very simple. It is clear that the option for the high cost type can always be accepted by the low cost type with the same quality level. That is, the low cost one can always imitate the high cost one due to the former’s cost advantage. So, the buyer will choose the same option for the supplier types with the same quality level but different costs. Also, the payment to the high cost type is set to be his cost, since otherwise the buyer can increase her profit by reducing this payment. On the other hand, for a type with a low cost, his profit is just a premium gained from his cost advantage over the high cost type. Thus, the payment to him is actually a cost-plus contract (Beil, 2010).


                        Lim (2000) revealed the same findings: the IC constraints for all types are binding when the supplier’s reliability and cost are independent. In addition, we identify conditions for the existence of the pay-on-delivery arrangement under asymmetric information because the pay-on-delivery arrangement is the same as only an initial payment option in our setting. Specifically, in the complementary and independent cases, the screening effect vanishes and the valuation difference effect drives the buyer to choose only the initial payment term.

In other words, the existence of the least competent type makes other types imitate this type, which increases the information rent paid by the buyer. So, the buyer will make the least competent type earn as little as possible only to cover his cost. Therefore, the buyer’s profit is Π

                         and λl
                        , but is independent of αs
                        . This implies that the buyer now has no incentive to assist the supplier with financing. Similar logic holds when there are two supplier types with either the same quality level or the same cost.

From Corollary 1, given the coexistence of the high quality type with both a high and low costs (i.e., phhphl
                         > 0 and plh
                         = pll
                         = 0) or the low quality type with both a high and low costs (i.e., plhpll
                         > 0 and phh
                         = phl
                         = 0), the low cost supplier can always imitate the one with high cost and the same quality level. Thus, information rent is paid to the low cost one. The story is a little different when two suppliers have the same cost but different quality. In this case, no information rent can be earned by either supplier. Note that (i) of Corollary 1 can be derived from Proposition 2 by setting λ = 0 (when two supplier types only differentiate in their costs). Similarly, (ii) of Corollary 1 can be reached from Proposition 2 under ch
                         = cl
                         (when two supplier types only differ in their quality levels).

In the previous sections, we considered two or four supplier types. What is the optimal payment scheme when there are three supplier types? The answer is in the following corollary.

In Corollary 2(i), given the presence of three types, without the least competent one, the buyer can use the deferred payment to screen the low quality and low cost type. However, with a high quality, the low cost type enjoys an information rent which is impossible to squeeze. Comparing Proposition 2 (phl
                         = 0) with Corollary 2(i) (phl
                         > 0), the positive value of phl
                         does not change the equilibrium fundamentally. The only difference lies in that phh
                         in Proposition 2 is replaced by phh
                         + phl
                         in Corollary 2, reflecting that the payments from the buyer to the high quality and low cost type and the high quality and high cost type are the same. Similarly, Corollary 2 together with Proposition 6 shows that different supplier types with the same quality level receive the same payment. Thus, the findings with the two supplier types in Corollary 1 can be generalized to a three type setting.


                        Corollary 2 implies that the buyer should adopt the deferred payment if and only if the least competent supplier is not present; otherwise, she should only use the initial payment. In other words, the nonexistence of the least competent type is very important to mitigate the information rent paid to other types, because it eliminates the possibility that other supplier types could imitate this least competent type. This finding has a very important implication, as shown in the following subsection.

Our work in the previous section focuses on the optimal payment employed to elicit the private information that the supplier is reluctant to reveal. Different combinations of the supplier types are explored. Note that the combination of the supplier types the buyer faces is exogenously given, which corresponds to one particular case of the buyer’s uncertainty about the supplier type. An ensuing question arises: If the buyer can choose, which supplier type will she be most willing to eliminate? For example, given the independent case with four different supplier types, we can calculate the buyer’s expected profit Π
                        4. If one supplier type, such as the least competent type, is eliminated, there remains three possible types, under which we can calculate the buyer’s expected profit Π
                        3. Clearly, Π
                        4 − Π
                        3 is the value of the information that allows the elimination of one supplier type. Note that to simplify our exposition, we assume that no fixed cost is incurred in eliminating each supplier type. Possibly a fixed cost of gathering the relevant information is incurred during the elimination process. However, such a positive fixed cost can be easily incorporated into our calculation of the value of information, since as in the example above, it affects neither Π
                        4 nor Π
                        3.

In this way, we can consider the value of information gained from eliminating a particular supplier type in each case (when there are no less than two supplier types). Given the identified value of information gained from ruling out certain supplier types, we can easily figure out eliminating which type the buyer does benefit most by simply comparing the value of information accordingly.

We start with the independent case, including all the four supplier types {hh, hl, lh, ll} (the high/low quality and high/low cost). As no extra information is known about which type the supplier is likely to be, it is reasonable to assume that the buyer deals with each supplier type with equal probability, i.e., pij
                         = 1/4, i, j = l, h. Another assumption is that after one type is eliminated, the probability of having each of the remaining three supplier types is equal, i.e., each has a probability of 1/3 because the buyer gains no more knowledge about which type is more likely to exist. Corollary 2 implies that the buyer is most willing to eliminate the least competent supplier. The reason is very simple: through comparing the four subcases of three types, the one with the least competent type earns the lowest revenue for the buyer, while the expected payment to the supplier is the highest.

Given the possibility of three supplier types, which one is the buyer most willing to eliminate? An assumption here is that, after one type is eliminated, the possibility of dealing with either of the remaining two is equal. Since there are four cases of three supplier types, namely, phhphlpll
                         > 0, phhphlplh

                                       then the buyer benefits most when the low quality and low cost supplier is eliminated; otherwise, the buyer prefers to eliminate the high quality and high cost supplier.

                        Proposition 7 shows that the buyer prefers to eliminate the least competent type with low quality and high cost first. When such a type is not present, the buyer prefers to eliminate the low quality and low cost supplier first when the value of the project is high enough to the buyer, as reflected by a large enough v; otherwise, the buyer prefers to eliminate the high quality and high cost first. When there are two supplier types, it is easy to show that as long as there exists the least competent type, the buyer prefers to eliminate it. In the absence of the least competent type, if the project is very valuable, then the buyer benefits more by eliminating the low quality and low cost type first; otherwise, the high quality and high cost type needs to be eliminated.

Note that we have assumed that no extra information is known about which supplier type is more likely to exist. When this assumption is relaxed, given the probability distribution describing the information the buyer has on the likelihood of the supplier type, by the previous analysis in Propositions 2, 5 and 6 which are derived under a general pij, i, j = l, h, we can easily compare the buyer’s profit in each case and derive the corresponding recommendation about the supplier type elimination.

Here, we consider a general version of the rental contract allowing the payment as a continuous function of time. Denote by z(t) the accumulative payment from time 0 to time t. Clearly, z(t) increases in t. The instalment payment is a special case of allowing the payment rate dz(t)/dt to be nonnegative only at two time epochs: the initial payment takes place at t = 0 and the deferred payment happens at a later time epoch given the product still in normal operation. In the following, we restrict our focus on the payment rate with zero rate for all the time after the product is failed. This assumption is reasonable in practice. Also, it can lead to a fair comparison between the general payment rate contract and the instalment payment, since in the above analysis of the instalment payment we transform the buyer’s profit to a case in which the failure of the product brings no value, under which the buyer will always set the payment rate to be zero.

At first thought, a general payment rate as a continuous function of time will improve the buyer’s profit (over the instalment payment). This guess is true for the substitutable and complementary cases, though the computation of the optimal general payment is far more complex, because no structural results can be predicted and exhaustive search should be used to solve the optimal solution. However, (as proved in our Appendix due to the page limitation) in the complete information and independent cases, the buyer’s expected profits are always lower under a general payment rate than the instalment payment. The major reason is due to the valuation difference effect, as elaborated in the following.

Before further discussing the general payment rate, we introduce a rental contract. Like the general payment rate, the payment under the rental contract from the buyer to the supplier is also continuous in time, only with one major difference: the ownership of the terminal value of the product. Under the rental contract, the supplier gets the terminal value of the rented equipment, while under the instalment payment the buyer will get the terminal value. Obviously, if the terminal value is large, then the buyer prefers the instalment payment. We assume in the following that the terminal value is 0 to omit the effect of the terminal value.
                        15
                     
                     
                        15
                        The terminal value is exogenous and can be easily added to adjust the comparison result.
                      Under this zero terminal value assumption, the rental contract can be viewed as one form of the general payment rate. So, the following comparison between the rental contract and the instalment payment is equivalent to comparing the latter with a general payment contract.

One advantage of the rental contract is that the rent paid to the supplier stops immediately after the product is failed. In comparison, under the instalment payment, there exists a positive probability of the product failed after paying the deferred payment. In other words, the transfer payment under the rental contract is based on the usage of the product, so no coin is paid as soon as the product fails. However, this benefit is not free. We start with the complete information case to illustrate the drawback of the rental contract. We first consider a fixed rental rate r (that is, z(t) = rt), under which given the product in normal operation at time t, the un-discounted payment is rt in total, so the discounted present value of the total payment at time 0 is

                      from (RSIC1) and (RSIC2) above, so no screening role can be played by this single rental rate contract. Then, the same as in the above complete information case, because of the valuation difference effect the instalment payment dominates the rental contract. Recall that, for the complementary and independent cases, no deferred payment is adopted by the buyer. Thus, like the complete information case, due to the valuation difference effect, the rental contract with a fixed rental rate is dominated by the instalment payment.

The following proposition summarizes results under a fixed rental rent contract.

                                    Rental contract is dominated by the instalment payment in terms of the buyer’s profit.
                                 

If the rental rate is piece-wise linear with two pieces: the rate is t
                     1 when t is smaller than a threshold, and t
                     2 otherwise. For exposition, we call this rental contract two-rate rental contract, in which the rental rate paid by the buyer before the time threshold is called the early rental rate, while that after the time threshold is called the late rental rate (It is the case of the payment rate z(t) as piece-wise linear with two pieces). In the complete information case, like the fixed rental rate above, it is easy to show that due to the valuation difference effect, the buyer’s profit is lower under the rental contract than under the instalment payment. For the substitutable case, now the buyer offers a contract with two options: the first option is

As in Fig. 2
                      (λl
                      = 0.1 in (a), while αb
                      = 0.1 in (b); other parameters include phh
                      = pll
                      = 0.5, ch
                      = 1, cl
                      = 0.75, αs
                      = 0.2 and λh
                      = 0.2), when α or λ is small, the buyer’s profit is higher under the rental contract than under the instalment payment. The reason is that with a small α the negative effect brought out by the valuation difference effect on the rental contract is rather limited. On the other hand, when λ is small, the screening role paid by the instalment payment is rather restricted, so the rental contract turns out to achieve a better performance in improving the buyer’s profit.

Interestingly, in the complementary case which the instalment payment fails to screen the supplier’s type, now the two-rate rental contract can screen the supplier’s type. As shown in Fig. 3
                      (with phh
                      = pll
                      = 0.5, cl
                      = 0.75, αs
                      = 0.2, αb
                      = 0.1, λl
                      = 0.1 and λh
                      = 0.2), the rental contract can lead to a higher profit for the buyer than the instalment contract.

The underlying reason is that a low quality product is more likely to fail, thus with a low probability it is still in normal operation after the time epoch when the later rental rate is due, so the high late rental rate has little impact on this low quality type’s expected profit. On the other hand, the late rental rate is valued with a greater weight by the high quality type than the low quality type, since the high quality product is more likely to stay in normal operation as time goes on. As a result, two options, one with a high early rental rate and a low late rental rate while the other with a low early rental rate and a high late rental rate, result in a separating equilibrium to screen different supplier types. Moreover, similar logic as in the substitutable case above, when α is small or the quality difference λ is small, the rental contract is even more likely to be preferred by the buyer.

For the independent case under two-rate rental contract, the low cost type can always imitate the high cost one with the same quality level, and the individual rationality constraint of the high cost type must be satisfied (applying the same steps in the proof of the independent case under the general payment rate in Appendix) we can easily get that the discounted present value to each supplier type is the same. Meanwhile, due to the valuation difference effect the buyer prefers the instalment contract in this case.

As a brief summary, in the complete information and independent cases, the buyer’s profit is higher under the instalment payment than under the rental contract. For other remaining cases, when the supplier’s financing cost is low or the quality difference among different supplier types is small, the rental contract is preferred by the buyer; otherwise, the instalment payment is a better choice for the buyer. It is worth noting that the negative valuation difference effect on the rental contract implies that under the rental contract it is in buyer’s interest to help the supplier’s financing to reduce the discount rate difference.

Allowing a rental rate contingent upon on t certainly will improve the buyer’s profit under the rental contract. After all the latter is a special case of the former. However, the key factors affecting the buyer’s profit under a general rental rate or payment rate are the same as the two-rate rental contract: in the complete information case or the independence case, the valuation difference effect determines the dominance of the instalment payment over the rental contract. In the substitutable or complementary cases, when α is small (the valuation difference effect is limited) or when the quality difference λ is small (the screening role played by the instalment payment is restricted), the rental contract is more likely to be a better choice for the buyer.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Different from past research on asymmetric information on the supplier’s quality level in a discrete time setting (e.g., Lim, 2000, 2001), our paper considers this quality issue in a continuous time setting. The buyer has to make a tradeoff when deciding when to pay the deferred payment: a payment later (whether it is a deferred payment or a rent flow) is discounted more by the supplier than an earlier payment (defined as the valuation difference effect). However, paying later rather than earlier makes the buyer more likely to screen the supplier’s quality level simply because as time goes on, the lower quality product is more likely to fail (defined as the screening effect). Building on this basic tradeoff, we reveal the buyer’s optimal instalment payment scheme and rental rate (when the rental rate is fixed or piece-wise linear with two pieces) in various settings in terms of the relationship between the supplier’s quality level and cost.

Our paper points out several important managerial insights. First, to use the instalment payment, the buyer has to distinguish which type of asymmetric information (moral hazard or adverse selection) she is dealing with and the relationship between the supplier’s quality level and cost. Second, it is important for the buyer to cross off the low quality but high cost supplier type. In addition, we found that when the supplier’s financing cost is low or the difference of quality level among different supplier types is small, the rental contract is preferred by the buyer; otherwise, the instalment payment should be used.

Moreover, under instalment contract when the high quality supplier costs more than the low quality supplier and the rental contract, we show that it is in the buyer’s interest to assist with the supplier’s financing. This finding aptly positions our research in the interface between the supply chain finance and quality management literature, as payment time or the payment term on a broad scale is one critical ingredient of supply chain finance.

Though we assume risk-neutral players in our analysis, the above tradeoff between the screening effect and the valuation difference effect still holds when both players are risk averse, so an optimal deferred payment time must be chosen to balance these two effects.

As a theoretical research in the context of two-dimensional adverse selection, our work makes two main assumptions: (1) No inspection is considered in our model. So, our model fits with the case in which the inspection is destructive, or very costly, or time-consuming, or very inaccurate, which is plausible for a certain class of products with a specific set of fire-resistance, flexibility and strength specifications. A model combining the optimal payment and inspection mechanism can be a future direction. (2.) The terminal value of the product must be small enough; otherwise, a large enough terminal value will weight the scales in favour of the instalment payment contract over the rent contract.

An intermediary is sometimes relied by Chinese public hospitals to purchase equipment from upstream manufacturers (especially in developed countries). For the purpose of our research, we focus on the interaction between the intermediary and the downstream hospitals.

Some intermediary, like the one where our MBA student stays, works only as a trading broker and does not participate in the manufacturing process. So, the quality is not directly decided by the intermediary. However, as a result of directly interacting with upstream manufacturers, reasonably the intermediary possesses better information about the products’ quality than the hospitals. So, we assume that the intermediary can accurately observe the product quality.

These public hospitals in China are independent of either the intermediary or upstream manufacturers, so they do not participate in the manufacturing process. If the quality is known to (or can be completely determined by) the hospital, then it becomes the complete information case in Section 3. Besides this special case, we consider a general case in which quality and cost are unknown to the buyer, and the buyer can only estimate the likelihood of the equipment being high/low quality. The estimation of this likelihood in the form of a probability distribution can be done by the buyer from available records.

This general case is reasonable since public hospitals in China are far away from the upstream manufacturers (especially in developed countries). Also, due to the fast advance of the modern technology in manufacturing medical equipment, hospitals usually do not have the professional experts to completely design or control the equipment quality. Meanwhile, usually the manager or sales representative of the intermediary has a short-term incentive to lie about the quality, which may make the disclosure of quality information to the buyer incredible.

Therefore, reasonably we consider the issue of letting the intermediary reveal his private information to buyers as an adverse selection problem. In line with the complementary research by Babich and Tang (2012), we call the downstream hospital as the buyer, and the intermediary as the supplier in the following. In the terminology in mechanism design (Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991), the buyer is the principal, and the supplier is the agent.

For exposition, we focus on the case of the quality level that cannot be affected by the supplier’s effort. In fact, our model can be easily extended to the case in which the quality level cannot be affected by the supplier’s unobservable effort, that is, the product can be affected by the supplier’s observable effort (e.g., preventive effort): when the supplier’s preventive effort is standardized, e.g., the regular maintenance, reasonably it is observable to the buyer, who can specify the exact level of effort and require the supplier to exert it. As a result, the quality level in our model can be treated as that under the optimal preventive effort. In other words, in our paper the primary concern for the buyer is how to screen the private information possessed by the supplier. All observable efforts can be easily incorporated into our model.

It is worth mentioning that usually the inspection mechanism is used to screen the supplier’s quality. However, inspecting the specially designed equipment is too costly and time-consuming. Additionally, inspection can damage the equipment or cause deterioration of the medical equipment that is manufactured with a specific set of fire-resistance, flexibility and strength specifications.

Also, the buyers are often powerful enough to offer a take-it–leave-it contract to the supplier as reported by our MBA student from the medical intermediary. So, we use a standard principal-agent framework to conduct our analysis. Indeed, our model characterizes the case of a powerful buyer, which we believe represents a very important part of the real world problem in which the principal, who has information disadvantage, designs a contract to let the supplier tell the truth; otherwise, if the supplier is more powerful and possesses information advantage, then it becomes a trivial case in which the supplier is in a monopoly position and takes all the surplus of the buyer.

Lastly, there is no reputation concern, because usually the manager or sales representative of the intermediary has a short-term incentive to lie about the quality, which makes the disclosure of quality information to the buyer incredible.
