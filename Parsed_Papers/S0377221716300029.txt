                  Pairwise comparison is a key component in multi-criteria decision making. The probability of rank reversal is a useful measure for evaluating the impact of uncertainty on the final outcome. In the context of this paper the type of uncertainty considered is related to the fact that experts have different opinions or that they may perform inconsistent pairwise comparisons. We provide a theoretical model for estimating the probability of the consequent rank reversal using the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function. The model is applied to two alternative weight extraction methods frequently used in the literature: the geometric mean and the eigenvalue method. We introduce a reasonable framework for incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process and calculate the mean value and cross-correlation of the average weights which are required in the application of the model. The theoretical results are compared against numerical simulations and a very good agreement is observed. We further show how our model can be extended in applications of a full multi-criteria decision making analysis, such as the analytic hierarchy process. We also discuss how the theoretical model can be used in practice where the statistical properties of the uncertainty-induced perturbations are unknown and the only information provided by the pairwise comparison matrices of a small group of experts. The methodology presented here can be used to extend the pairwise comparison framework in order to provide some information on the credibility of its outcome.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision making is the process of choosing a specific course of action among several alternatives and is encountered in many areas of human activity (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jimenez, & Salvador, 2007). In situations where complex decisions need to be taken involving high stakes, it is desirable to base these decisions on the combined opinions of several experts in the field rather than simply rely on the skills and intuition of an individual decision maker. In the context of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) (Triantaphyllou, 2000; Yager, 2004) the first step is to identify a set of criteria on which the decision should be based and then decide on their importance. The pairwise comparison (PWC) method provides a convenient and reliable means to rank both the criteria involved in the decision making process and the alternative courses of action (Saaty, 2008a). In the context of PWC, instead of letting the experts rank the various criteria or alternatives directly, they compare these criteria in combinations of two. This can reduce the influence of subjective point-of-views associated with eliciting the weights directly.

PWC plays a key role in structured decision making systems and especially in MCDM methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the analytic network process (ANP) (Saaty, 2008b). In this context, PWC has been extensively used on numerous application areas (Chan et al., 2006; Gerdsri & Kocaoglu, 2007; Huang, Chub, & Chiang, 2008; Lee & Kozar, 2006; Liberatore & Nydick, 2008; Zahedi, 1986). PWC has also been applied on a stand-alone basis or on the context of a different decision making framework (Abildtrup et al., 2006; Dede, Varoutas, Kamalakis, Fuentetaja, & Javaudin, 2010; Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2004; Fan & Liu, 2010; Kok & Lootsma, 1985; Traulsen, Pacheco, & Nowak, 2007). Several contributions have attempted to highlight many methodological aspects of the method (Barzilai, 1997; Boenderb, Graan, & Lootsma, 1989; Choo & Wedley, 2004; Deng, 1999; Kwiesielewicz & Van Uden, 2004; Mamat & Daniel, 2007; Marimin, Umano, Hatono, & Tamura, 2002; Mikhailov, 2004).

One important aspect of PWC is that the final outcome is undermined by uncertainty, which originates from the fact that the experts may produce inconsistent pairwise judgments or that their point-of-views can differ. Uncertainty modeling by itself is of paramount importance and has been the subject of many studies (András, 2007; Aull-Hyde, Erdogan, & Duke, 2006; Carmone, Karab, & Zanakis, 1997; Hahn, 2003; Harker, 1987; Hongyi & Kocaoglu, 2008; Klir & Folger, 1988; Saaty & Vargas, 1987; Stam & Silva, 1997; Shunsuke, Obata, & Daigo, 1998; Wang & Dong, 2009; Wang, Dong, & Yan, 2012; Wang, Yeung, & Tsang, 2001; Yager, 2002; Yuan & Shaw, 1995). The probability of rank reversal PRR
                      (Saaty, 2003; Saaty & Vargas, 1984) is often a useful measure for evaluating the impact of uncertainty. We may define the probability of rank reversal theoretically, by considering the weights W
                     1 ,…, WN
                      where N is the number of alternatives, calculated by PWC in the case of an infinite group of experts (M→+∞). In practice, since the group size M is finite (M<+∞), the calculated weights wi
                      will in general turn out different than Wi
                      and hence the ranking may also be different thus introducing an uncertainty in the final outcome. This uncertainty may originate in the difference of opinion among the experts which may bias the result compared to a large (asymptotically infinite) group of experts. The experts may also complete the pairwise comparison in an inconsistent manner (Saaty, 2003). The probability of rank reversal can be formally defined as (Dede, Kamalakis, & Sphicopoulos, 2015):

                     In our previous work (Dede et al., 2015), we have investigated the convergence properties of the probability of rank reversal in PWC with respect to the size M of the group of experts. The results dictated that there is not much to be gained by increasing the number of experts beyond 15, even if the uncertainty level is large. Moreover, we examined the problem of how the probability of rank reversal can be estimated numerically using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Although this is a valid approach, it is often preferable to have a theoretical model for estimating the probability of rank reversal. A theoretical model is often much more straightforward to implement and requires much less computational time than MC simulations. It can also form a solid basis for understanding and extending the PWC application framework. In this paper we discuss how the probability of rank reversal PRR
                      can be estimated theoretically. We show that instead of using MC simulations, the PRR
                      can be estimated through the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function (MVNCDF). This approach is formulated for two alternative weight estimation methods: the eigenvalue (EV) (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and the geometric mean (GM) method (Crawford, 1987). We show that the MVNCDF yields accurate results compared to MC simulations regardless of the number of criteria and the weight estimation method used. This approach seems to be useful for any potential decision maker willing to investigate the accuracy of the results in real decision problems in practice. We also show how the approach can be extended in the application of a full MCDM analysis, such as the AHP.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly summarize the PWC method and discuss how one can incorporate uncertainty in the pairwise comparison matrices. In addition, we discuss the statistical nature of the uncertainty-induced weight perturbations in PWCs and calculate the mean values and the correlation matrices of the average weights required in the MVNCDF estimations. We also elaborate how the PRR
                      can be calculated using the MVNCDF and how the results can be applied in AHP. In Section 3, we validate our theoretical model against MC simulations. Section 4 provides some insight on how the model can be applied in a practical situation where the uncertainty parameters are unknown and can only be inferred by the pairwise comparison matrix elements of a limited number of experts. Some concluding remarks and future outlook are presented in Section 5.

The judgment of the mth expert concerning any two criteria is stored in a square pairwise comparison matrix P
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) and each matrix element Pij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) reflects the relative importance of criterion Ci
                         compared to Cj
                        . In order to complete the pairwise comparison matrices, two alternative methods widely used in the literature can be considered. In the first approach (referred to hereafter as method “A”), each expert is required to grade the relative importance between any two criteria Ci
                         and Cj
                         by assigning values between 0 and 100 (Gerdsri & Kocaoglu, 2007). Assuming that i
                        <
                        j, the mth expert assigns a value between 0 and 100 in the element Aij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) of a matrix A
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) comparing the importance of criterion Ci
                         to criterion Cj
                        . For example, if an expert assigns Aij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )
                        =60, then this implies that the weight of Ci
                         is 60 percent compared to the total weight of both criteria, while that of Cj
                         is 40 percent. Using the upper triangular elements of A
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ), the elements of the pairwise comparison matrix are calculated setting Pij

Saaty (2008b), the nine-level scale shown in Table 1

In the absence of uncertainty, i.e. if all experts had identical opinion and carried out perfectly consistent comparisons, then in the case of method “A” one would obtain the ideal weights Wi
                         for the alternatives and the pairwise matrices would be given by Pij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )
                        =
                        Wi
                        /Wj
                         for every value of m, 1≤
                        m
                        ≤
                        M. We may therefore think that the elements Pij
                        
                        =
                        Wi
                        /Wj
                         are the elements of an ideal pairwise comparison matrix P obtained by every expert when no uncertainty is present. For method “B”, we assume that each element of the ideal pairwise comparison matrix Pij
                         is determined by the value of Table 1 closest to Wi
                        /Wj
                        .

In practice we expect that each expert will complete a different pairwise comparison matrix and hence the weights wk
                         and quite possibly their ranking may turn out different than that obtained by Wi
                        . We understand that the distribution of the ideal weights Wi
                         will have an important bearing on PRR
                        , since the probability of rank reversal should increase when the differences between the Wi
                        ’s are small and hence the effect of uncertainty-induced perturbations will be more pronounced. Without any loss of generality, we can choose the ordering of Ci
                        , so that Wi
                        
                        
                           −
                        
                        1 ≥ Wi
                         for 1≤
                        i
                        ≤
                        N implying that the criteria are labeled in such a way that criterion Ci
                        
                        
                           −
                        
                        1 has greater or equal importance compared to criterion Ci
                        . We define L as the ratio between the maximum and the minimum weight L
                        =max{Wi
                        }/min{Wi
                        }. This ratio is a measure of the non-uniformity of the ideal weights and in the presence of uncertainty, we expect that PRR
                         will increase as L approaches to unity. Assuming for simplicity that the weights Wi
                         lie on a straight line it is easy to show that:

                        Eq. (6) is derived by assuming that the weights lie on a straight line and that they have unity sum,

                        . Alternatively, the original weights could also be determined by a nonlinear distribution such as the beta distribution Bi

The addition of perturbations in the pairwise comparison matrices is a common way of incorporating uncertainty (Escobar & Moreno-Jiménez, 2007; Genz & Bretz, 2002; Paulson & Zahir, 1995; Zarghami, Szidarovszky, & Ardakanian, 2008). Note that (7) does not guarantee that the sum of the weights ∑
                           iWi

                        ) is equal to 1 but according to Eq. (9), the elements Pij
                        
                        (

                        ) do not depend on the normalization of the Wi

                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) are determined by the elements of the scale in Table 1 which are closest to the right hand side of (8). We will discuss the impact of the actual perturbation statistics in Section 2.4.

At this point, it is useful to summarize the assumptions introduced in our model. Regarding the original weights Wi
                        , these are chosen to lie on a straight line, mainly for reasons of simplicity. The results presented in the next sections hold regardless of the distribution of Wi
                        . Regarding the uncertainty-induced perturbations, these are assumed random, naturally reflecting the way in which the experts carry out their PWCs, incorporating their subjective point-of-views and inconsistency errors in their judgments. Several authors in the literature use a similar approach (Hahn, 2003; Hahn, 2006; Hauser & Tadikamalla, 1996; Mikhailov, 2004; Paulson & Zahir, 1995; Saaty & Vargas, 1987; Zarghami et al., 2008). The perturbations are taken zero mean because otherwise, the weights calculated in the limit of a very large group of experts (M→∞), would not converge to the weights Wi
                        . This is shown in Section 2.3. The perturbations Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) are considered identically distributed and this holds for Δwi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) as well. One could postulate a more general model, where the statistics may vary from expert to expert. However the application of the central limit theorem discussed in Section 2.4, indicates that the weight statistics wk
                         are not altered and the MVNCDF still applies with suitable modifications of the covariance matrices given in Section 2.5.

The statistical independence of the perturbations across the pairwise comparison matrices of the experts (i.e. for different m) is a consequence of how they complete their comparisons, typically independent of one another, without knowledge of each other's point-of-view. This implies that when summing up the weights wk
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) with respect to m in (3) in the eigenvalue method for instance, these should be considered independent. As we will discuss in Section 2.4, their mean value wk
                         therefore converges to a normal distribution as a consequence of the central limit theorem (Rice, 1995). We will also show in Section 2.4, that in the eigenvalue method, the weights wk
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) are a linear combination of the pairwise comparison matrix element perturbations. Therefore, if we postulate that the perturbations of the elements within the same pairwise comparison matrix of an expert (i.e. the same m) are independent themselves, the distribution of each individual wk
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) will converge to a normal distribution. Whether the independence between the elements of the same pairwise matrix always holds is a much more involved subject and even if some level of dependence exists, it is rather difficult to choose an appropriate model for this correlation. We have therefore decided to ignore these correlations, since the assumption of normal statistics for the outcomes wk
                         in the eigenvalue method is reasonable anyway on account of the statistical independence of wk
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) for different experts, as explained in detail in Section 2.4. Similar arguments hold for the logarithmic weights estimated by the GM method as discussed further below.

We now briefly summarize the MC method for the estimation of PRR
                         adapted from (Dede et al., 2015), which will prove useful in validating our theoretical model. The activity diagram for the numerical estimation of PRR
                         is shown in Fig. 2
                        
                        
                        . Initially, given the value of L we estimate the ideal weights Wi
                         using (6). We then perform a number of MC iterations and in each iteration we calculate the weights Wi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) for a group of M experts using (7), randomly selecting Δwi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ). We then generate the perturbations Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) and the corresponding pairwise comparison matrices P
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) according to (8). Once the elements of P
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) are evaluated, we apply the procedure described in Section 2.1 to evaluate the weights wi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) and then average wi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        ) over m, using (3) for the case of EV or (5) for the GM method, to estimate the average weights wi
                        , checking whether a rank reversal has occurred. Repeating this over many MC iterations (≥104), we can calculate the PRR
                        .

In Section 2, we discussed two alternative methods for completing the elements of the PWC matrix. Fig. 3(a) and (b) depicts the probability of rank reversal for both approaches, in the case of EV and GM method, respectively, where N
                        =4 and L
                        =2. We use the procedure outlined in Fig. 2, varying the number of experts M from 4 to 40. For each PRR
                         value we used NMC
                        
                        =105 iterations. Three perturbations strengths are considered, namely s
                        =
                        sw
                        
                        =0.4, s
                        =
                        sw
                        
                        =1 and s
                        =
                        sw
                        
                        =1.4 corresponding to a maximum allowable deviation of ±20 percent, ±50 percent and ±70 percent. Inspection of the results reveals that PRR
                         is practically the same for both completion methods, regardless of whether EV or GM method is used. This implies that the outcome of PWC is undermined at the same manner regardless of the completion method, which should not come as a great surprise since the elements of the pairwise comparison matrices in method “B” are quantized versions of the elements of method “A”. In light of the similarity of the results obtained by the two methods in the following we need only carry out the analysis for method “A”.

We should pay attention to some of the assumptions made above in previous sections. Regarding the mean value of Δwi
                           (m
                        
                        ) it is natural to assume that 〈Δwi
                           (m
                        
                        )〉=0, otherwise a large group of experts would produce different weights than Wi
                        . The reason for choosing 〈Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )〉=0 is similar: If all experts share the same opinion, i.e. Wi
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )
                        =
                        Wi
                         then the weights produced by a large group of experts should be equal to Wi
                        . To verify this, Figs. 4(a) and 5
                        (a) show the weights obtained by the PWCs, for the case of EV and GM method respectively, for M
                        =103 in the case where s
                        =2, N
                        =6, L
                        =2 and where 〈Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )〉=0. As shown in the figures, the weights wi
                         calculated by 103 experts are almost identical to Wi
                        . We therefore deduce that when 〈Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )〉=0, the weights wi
                         do converge to their ideal values Wi
                         when either the EV or the GM methods is used for the extraction of the weights. In the same context, Figs. 4(b) and 5(b) show the corresponding weights for the EV and GM method respectively in the case where 〈Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )〉 is nonzero and instead equal to 0.4. It is interesting to see that there is a noticeable difference between wi
                         and Wi
                         in this case and in fact wi
                         correspond to a larger value of L, i.e. a positive 〈Δwij
                        
                        (
                        
                           m
                        
                        )〉 has the effect of making the weights more distinct. This can be understood from (8). Comparing the average value of μij
                        
                        =〈Pij

                        )〉 in the case where 〈Δwij

                        μ
                        >0, we easily see from (8) that

                         implying that the experts tend to produce more biased comparisons, which will further distinguish the values of the weights. We therefore conclude that the perturbations should be taken zero mean because otherwise, the weights calculated in the limit of a very large group of experts (M→∞) would not converge to the weights calculated by the ideal matrix P.

In this section we theoretically investigate the statistical nature of the weight perturbations, under the uncertainty model proposed in the previous section. Considering the EV method, we start from the first order variation Δx
                        1
                        (

                        where in the first approximate equation, we used Taylor's expansion to first order, (1+Δβ/β)−
                        1
                        ≅1−Δβ/β. The second approximation in (12) is based on the fact that the term (Δa/a)(Δβ/β) is of second order and can therefore be ignored compared to 1+(Δa/a
                        −Δβ/β) which contains up to first order terms. Substituting the values of a and β in (12) we obtain:

The Gaussian-like behavior is to be expected in the case of the GM method is used. In this case however, it applies to the logarithmic weights zk

                        Eq. (15) states that the logarithmic weights zk
                         are the sum of NM random variables most of which are independent, and hence zk
                         will also asymptotically be a Gaussian random variable. Although the above conclusions are derived in the limiting case where NM→∞ we can numerically show that the shape of the PDF for wk
                         and zk
                         in the case of the EV and GM methods is approximately Gaussian for finite values of N and M as well. The results are shown in Figs. 6
                         and 7
                         for a typical weight assuming N
                        =4 or N
                        =6 and M
                        =15, NMC
                        
                        =105, L
                        =2, sw
                        
                        =0 and s
                        =1.5 for the EV and GM methods respectively. Also shown is the Gaussian fit. We clearly see in Fig. 6, that in the case of the EV, the PDF of the average weight wk
                         is indeed very well described by a Gaussian distribution and this is also the case for zk
                         in Fig. 7. Similar results are obtained for the rest of the weights as well as for other values of N, M and s. The fact that the PDF of the weights or the logarithmic weights are nearly Gaussian is consistent with the central limit theorem discussed above and illustrates that the precise statistics of the perturbations will mainly influence the two parameters determining the normal distribution, i.e. its mean value and standard deviation. This is an interesting conclusion, implying that as long as the judgments among different experts are sufficiently uncorrelated, then the underlying uncertainty model plays a minor role in the statistical behavior of the weights, other than determining the aforementioned parameters of their PDF.

                        Eqs. (16)–(21) can be used to determine the mean values and the covariance matrix of the weight perturbations that can be used to calculate the MVNCDF which as previously discussed provides an estimate for PRR
                        .

In a similar way we can estimate the PRR
                         through the MVNCDF in the case where the GM method is used for the estimation of the weights from the PWC matrices. Taking into account the uncertainty model, analyzed in the Section 2.2, the average weights wk
                         can be expressed as follows:

                        Eqs. (22)–(30) determine the covariance matrix and hence the MVNCDF can be used to provide an estimate for the PRR
                         in the case of GM method as well. The above equations hold regardless of the initial weight distribution Wi
                        .

In the previous section we have proposed a model for the estimation of PRR
                         from pairwise comparisons using the MVNCDF. It would be interesting to apply this methodology for the evaluation of the PRR
                         of the final ranking of the alternatives in a full MCDA method involving several PWCs matrices to estimate the weights. We sketch this in the case of the AHP as one example in this section, but similar analysis could be applied for other MCDA techniques as well.

We assume that the hierarchy includes N criteria and V alternatives. In order to rate the alternatives, one must first evaluate the weights of the criteria, denoted by wk
                        , where k is an integer between 1≤
                        k
                        ≤
                        N. The alternatives should also be pairwise compared according to each criterion and for each alternative one obtains the relative scores sik
                         under criterion Ck. Assuming that wk
                         and sik
                         are calculated using GM method, the final ranking priorities ti
                         of the alternative i (1≤
                        i
                        ≤

                         while can be calculated using the framework presented in Section 2.5 and specifically (24) and (26), while δij

                         can be estimated, we may apply the MVNCDF to obtain the probability of rank reversal for the final outcomes of the AHP.

Alternatively, if we use the EV method for the estimation of the weights and relative scores, then the final rankings ti

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we compare our semi-analytical model against Monte Carlo simulations. We typically vary the number of experts M from 4 to 40, and in the case of Monte Carlo simulation we use 105 iterations to estimate the probability of rank reversal PRR
                        . Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows a surface plot of PRR
                         as a function of s and sw
                         for M
                        =4 experts and N
                        =4 criteria calculated using the MVNCDF for the case of the EV method. Fig. 8(c) and (d) show the corresponding surface plots in the case of the GM method. We readily see that the values of PRR
                         obtained by the MVNCDF or the MC are fairly close. We estimated an average relative error of 6.3 percent and 6.1 percent in the values of PRR
                         when using the semi-analytical method of Section 2.5, for the EV and the GM method respectively. Similar results are obtained for the case where M
                        =16 shown in Fig. 9
                         where the agreement between the two approaches is even better. In this case the average error was calculated 3.1 percent and 3 percent respectively. A better agreement is to be expected with increasing M, since there are now more terms in the sums and hence δwk
                         and δzk
                         are even better described by a Gaussian random variable.

In both cases, we deduce that the values of PRR
                         obtained by the theoretical method in Section 2.5 are quite accurate. Inspection of the results reveals that considering the GM method in most cases the probability of rank reversal are lower than the PRR
                         estimated using the EV method. This is an interesting observation, which seems to slightly favor the application of GM over EV method in multi-criteria decision making processes. In any case, the theoretical model provides a correct estimate for the PRR
                        .

In Section 2, we discussed how the ranking is influenced by the degree of uniformity of the ideal weights Wi
                         and consequently the value of L. Fig. 10
                        
                        (a) and (b) show the probability of rank reversal obtained for several values of the ratio L defined in Section 2 in the case of the EV and the GM methods respectively. The case of L
                        =1 was not considered, since it corresponds to the case where the criteria all have the same weight and hence it makes no sense to study rank reversal. Once again the results reveal a good agreement between the theoretical model and the Monte Carlo simulations carried out for both EV and GM methods. Increasing the value of L has the effect of reducing PRR
                         since the values of Wi
                         become more distinct and consequently the outcome of the PWC is more resistant to uncertainty. For s
                        =
                        sw
                        
                        =1 (i.e. medium-to-large uncertainty level), Fig. 10(a) shows that PRR
                         converges to zero and is actually significantly lower for L
                        =4 or 6. The results are in agreement with the findings of authors’ previous work (Dede et al., 2015) which dealt with the behavior of the numerically estimated P
                        RR. In the figures we can see that for group sizes smaller than ten (M
                        ≤10), PRR
                         is not negligible. Increasing M leads to a gradually slower decrease in PRR
                        . In the cases where s
                        =
                        sw
                        
                        =1, PRR
                         is almost zero for M
                        >30. In any case, increasing the expert group size yields significant decrease in the uncertainty of the outcome only when the original group size is small: adding five more people in a group of M
                        =5 experts reduces PRR
                         significantly. But adding the same number of experts to a larger group, say M
                        =15, will not result in a much better PRR
                        . This point is particularly important in practical situations since it is generally difficult to locate people with the required level of expertise that would be willing to participate in the decision making process. The figure indicates that increasing the group size beyond M
                        =15 will make little difference in terms of protecting the outcome against uncertainty.

Ιt would also be interesting to investigate the accuracy of the theoretical model when the number of criteria N is varied. Fig. 11(a) and (b) illustrate the convergence of PRR
                         for varying number of criteria N in the case of EV and GM method respectively. The figure considers three different values of N
                        ≤8. The model easily allows to consider cases where N
                        >8, but in practical situations, performing PWC with that many criteria would result in a large number of pairwise comparisons required. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the validity of the theoretical model for the estimation of PRR
                         holds independently of N for both EV and GM methods. Moreover, it seems again that the GM method results are somewhat smaller PRR
                         than the EV method.

In Fig. 12
                        
                        , we calculate PRR
                         for Wi
                         given from a Beta distribution (see Fig. 1), for a
                        =2, b
                        =5 assuming that s
                        
                        =
                        
                        sw
                        
                        =1.2. The figure illustrates that the way that the original weights are chosen has no significant impact on the accuracy of the theoretical model. In light of this, the conclusions drawn for a linear distribution of Wi
                         also hold for other weight distributions.

In this Section, we describe how the proposed theoretical model for the estimation of PRR
                      can be used in practical situations, where the decision maker has no prior knowledge of the statistical parameters involved (i.e. Wk, s and sw
                     ). Our method is based on the fact that these parameters can be inferred by the elements of the pairwise comparison matrices obtained by the experts. The estimates 
                        
                           s
                           ˜
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              s
                              ˜
                           
                           w
                        
                      for the perturbation strengths s and sw
                      are determined through the second central moments of the pairwise comparison elements. Using Eq. (7) we can easily show that the sum of the moments of the upper diagonal elements is given by:

                      we could try least square fitting the approximation to the left hand side of (38) to its right hand side. This would lead to a constrained multi-variable minimization problem which may be hard to solve. We instead choose to minimize the following parameter:

                      estimated in this manner, it is interesting to investigate the values of the estimates

                      and

                     . We use Monte Carlo simulation where in each iteration we generate the pairwise comparison matrices of a group of M experts and then calculate the estimates of the above quantities. Fig. 13(a) and (b) shows a plot of the PDF of 
                        
                           s

                      and 
                        
                           
                              s
                              ˜

                      assuming L
                     =2, N
                     =4, M
                     =15 and for a relatively high level of uncertainty s
                     =
                     sw
                     
                     =1. We see that for both quantities, the PDFs are peaking close to the value of the original statistical parameters which is an initial validation of the proposed estimation method.


                     Fig. 14
                      shows the PDFs of the estimated probability of rank reversal

                              ˜

                     from the pairwise comparison matrices for the same parameters as before for (a) N
                     =4 and (b) N
                     =6. In case of N
                     =4, the PRR,
                      calculated using the original statistical parameters is ≅7 percent and ≅5 percent, for the EV and GM methods respectively. Fig. 14(a) suggests that the estimation method provides a reasonable approximation for the value of the PRR
                      since the higher PDF values are obtained in the vicinity of the original PRR
                      values. Similar observations are drawn in the case where N
                     =6, shown in Fig. 14(b). In this case, the PRR
                      calculated using the original statistical parameters is ≅28 percent and ≅25 percent for the EV and GM methods respectively.

When inspecting the figures we should bear in mind that the underlying issue is to estimate the order of magnitude for the PRR
                      rather than obtain an accurate value for the probability itself, which is rather difficult to obtain given the small number of pairwise comparison matrix realizations we have available from a small group of experts. In fact, in practical situations, we should rather be concerned for the cases where we underestimate the order of magnitude of the probability, since in this case the decision maker may mistakenly suppose that the ranking is credible, while it is not. On the other hand, if we overestimate the order of magnitude, the consequences are not severe, since the decision maker can have the experts repeat the comparisons or even add more experts to the group.

In light of the above remarks, Fig. 15
                     (a) and (b) show the probability Plog
                      that the logarithm 
                        
                           
                              x
                              ˜
                           
                           =
                           
                              log
                              10
                           
                           
                              
                                 P
                                 ˜
                              
                              RR
                           
                        
                      of the estimated probability of rank reversal is lower than 50 percent of the logarithm x
                     =log10(PRR
                     ) of the original PRR
                     . We have assumed N
                     
                     =
                     4 and N
                     =6, respectively. The rest of the parameters are the same as those used in Fig. 14(a) and (b). The figure shows that in both cases, the value of Plog
                      decreases significantly as the group size is augmented. For N
                     =4 we see that the value of Plog
                      is only ≅5 percent even for a small number of experts, say M
                     =8, for both weight estimation methods. Such a small value of Plog
                      is a clear indication that the proposed estimation scheme works very well, even for a small group of experts.

Comparing Fig. 15(a) and (b) we deduce that there is a small increase in Plog
                     , as the number of criteria is increased, but nevertheless this probability is below 10 percent. We should also note that the figures correspond to much different probability of rank reversals: in case of M
                     =8, for N
                     =4, the original probabilities of rank reversals are about ≅16 percent and ≅13 percent for the EV and GM methods respectively while for N
                     =6 the corresponding values are ≅39 percent and ≅37 percent. This implies that the scheme works for both small and considerable probability of rank reversals.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we consider the implications of uncertainty related to the fact that experts have different opinions or that they may perform inconsistent pairwise comparisons. Towards this end, we have discussed a theoretical method for calculating the probability of the consequent rank reversal, which quantifies the uncertainty of the outcome of pair wise comparisons. The method is based on the MVNCDF of the successive average weight differences. This was carried out both for the eigenvalue and the geometric mean methods of estimating the weights. Our approach relies on reasonable assumptions regarding the perturbations of the PWC matrices, taking into account both the difference of opinions among the experts and the inconsistency in the completion of the pairwise comparison matrices. Based on these, we theoretically calculated the mean value and cross-correlation matrices of these differences that are needed in order to correctly use the MVNCDF. The applicability of the MVNCDF can also be derived under more general assumptions, as discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.4. The value of the theoretical method is two-fold: first, it simplifies the estimation procedure, since we no longer need to rely on tedious and time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations used in numerical estimations of the probability of rank reversal. Second, much like any theoretical model, it can constitute a good starting point for further developing and extending the PWC framework. We also show how our results can be applied in determining the credibility of the final outcomes in two variants of the AHP method. We have compared the results obtained through the MVNCDF, with those obtained through numerical simulations and a good agreement is observed. The results obtained by either method also show a slight advantage of the geometric mean method over the eigenvalue method in terms of the probability of rank reversal. Finally, we discuss a procedure for estimating the probability of rank reversal in practice, where the statistical parameters are unknown. We show how that these parameters can be estimated just from the pairwise comparison matrices of the experts and that the error in the probability of rank reversal is reasonable. The methodology presented in the paper can be used to extend the pairwise comparison framework in order to provide some information on the credibility of the final outcomes of the decision making process. The proposed method could be applied from any decision maker willing to estimate the PRR
                      and investigate the accuracy of the results and hence the stability of a right decision in real decision making problems in practice. Besides, nowadays an effective decision seems to be of paramount importance, especially in a demanding business environment.
