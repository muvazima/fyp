                  Natural data sets often have missing values in them. An accurate missing value imputation is crucial to increase the usability of a data set for statistical analyses and data mining tasks. In this paper we present a novel missing value imputation technique using a data set’s existing patterns including co-appearances of attribute values, correlations among the attributes and similarity of values belonging to an attribute. Our technique can impute both numerical and categorical missing values. We carry out extensive experiments on nine natural data sets, and compare our technique with four high quality existing techniques. We simulate 32 types of missing patterns (combinations), and thereby generate 320 missing data sets for each of the nine natural data sets. Two well known evaluation criteria namely index of agreement

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Natural data sets often have missing values in them. The imputation of missing values as accurately as possible is an important data pre-processing task. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature for imputing missing values [1–6].

An early approach is to use the mean of all available values of the attribute, having a missing value [7], as an imputed value. Another initial approach to deal with missing values of a data set is to remove the records having missing value/s [8]. Mean imputation can generate more erroneous outputs than the simple record deletion approach [9]. However, the deletion of records may also reduce the usefulness of a data set for a statistical analysis and data mining [9].

A more advanced approach called “Expectation–Maximization (EMI)” [1] relies on correlations between attributes and mean values of the attributes. A record may have some missing values and available values. EMI considers that the deviation of a missing value (belonging to an attribute) from the mean value of the attribute is proportional to the deviation of an available value (belonging to another attribute) from the mean value of the second attribute.

In order to impute a missing value EMI uses the whole data set, whereas another recent technique called IBLLS [5] divides a data set in both horizontal and vertical segments by identifying k-most similar records and correlated attributes, respectively. It then locally imputes a missing value by applying a framework [4] within each segment separately. However, EMI and IBLLS impute only numerical missing values.

In this paper, we propose a novel imputation technique called A Framework for Imputing Missing Values Using Co-Appearance, Correlation and Similarity Analysis (FIMUS). The basic idea of the technique is to make an educated guess based on the co-appearances of the values, correlations between attributes and similarity of values belonging to an attribute. Moreover, unlike many existing techniques [1,5] FIMUS is also capable of imputing categorical missing values, in addition to numerical missing values.

We evaluate FIMUS on nine natural data sets [10] by comparing its performance with the performance of four high quality existing techniques namely DMI [6], SVR [11], EMI [1] and IBLLS [5]. Two evaluation criteria called index of agreement 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , and root mean squared error 
                        
                           (
                           RMSE
                           )
                        
                      are used. Our experimental results indicate (based on statistical sign test) that FIMUS performs significantly better than DMI, SVR, EMI and IBLLS on all data sets.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents some related works on missing value imputation. Our technique (FIMUS) is presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents empirical evaluations, and Section 5 gives concluding remarks.

A number of missing value imputation techniques have recently been proposed [11–13,2,4,14]. For imputing a missing value

                      is categorical then the technique uses the most frequent value of the same attribute within the k-NN records. While simplicity is an advantage of kNNI, the technique can be found expensive for a large data set since it searches the whole data set for each record having missing value/s. Moreover, the selection of a suitable value for k may be a challenging task for a data miner [16].

Some existing techniques such as Local Weighted Linear Approximation Imputation (LWLA) [13] can automatically determine a suitable value of k. In order to determine k automatically, for a record

                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i

                     . Finally LWLA imputes a real missing value

                      utilizing the similarities and the jth attribute values of the records belonging to the best k-NN.

Another recent technique called DMI [6] also imputes a missing value

                      based on a set of similar records,

                           D
                        
                     , of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     . Similar to LWLA, DMI finds 
                        
                           |
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           |
                        
                      (i.e. the size of the set of similar records) automatically. However unlike LWLA, DMI uses an existing decision tree algorithm such as 
                        
                           C
                           4.5
                        
                      
                     [17] in order to find

                     , where

                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      is the set of records belonging to the leaf that represents 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     . The technique also identifies that the correlations of attributes within the records belonging to a leaf are generally higher than the correlations of attributes within the records of the whole data set. Therefore, DMI applies the EMI algorithm [1] within the records of each leaf separately, for imputing numerical missing value/s. It was evident that DMI achieved a better imputation accuracy and data quality than EMI [18]. However, a decision tree algorithm may produce some heterogeneous leaves, where the records belonging to a heterogenous leaf may not always be very similar to each other. The application of DMI on such “not so similar” set of records may result in a low imputation accuracy for DMI [19].

Another group of techniques [20,11,21,22] uses classifiers such as a support vector machine or a neural network for imputation. For example, a technique called Support Vector Regression (SVR) [11] first divides a data set D into

                      contains records with missing values. For each attribute

                     , having missing values, SVR builds a model by using a support vector machine. The model contains a set of significant records, and referred as support vectors. Finally SVR imputes a missing value

                      of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                        
                      using the jth model.

For imputing missing values, a technique [22] makes use of a three layered perceptron network where the number of neurons in both input and output layers are equal to the number of attributes of the data set D, where the possible values of each attribute are 1 or 0. The technique first generates a perturbed data set, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                      from D by artificially creating some available values as missing. It then trains the network by using the values of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                      in the input layer and the values of D in the output layer. The missing values of D are imputed by using the trained neural network. It is shown that the technique achieves a high imputation accuracy while it requires a high computational cost. The time complexity of a neural network can be reduced by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the training process of the network [21].

Genetic Algorithms (GA) can also be used to estimate a suitable set of parameters of a Fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM), which can then be used to impute missing values [12]. An existing technique [12] imputes the missing values of D two times. The first time it imputes using an SVR and the second time it imputes using an FCM with a set of user defined parameters. It then compares the two sets of imputed values obtained by the SVR and FCM, in order to test their mutual agreement. If the mutual agreement of the imputed values is not high enough then the parameters of FCM are re-estimated by using a GA technique. FCM then uses the new parameters in order to impute the missing values again. The process of re-estimating the parameters of FCM and the imputation of the missing values continues until the FCM and SVR imputed values are similar to each other. Of course in this approach the SVR imputation quality is assumed to be very high.

We argue that typically a data set D maintains some natural patterns in it. For example, the possibility of the appearance of a value

FIMUS generalizes the values of a numerical attribute into several categories in order to be able to compute the co-appearances of the values with other values belonging to other attributes.

                        . This type of categorization enjoys its simplicity, but due to artificially making the equal size (in terms of range of values) for each category it may not always capture the natural groups/categories. Defining and finding accurate categories from a numerical attribute is a challenging task [23]. Hence, the actual co-appearance values may not be captured by the estimated co-appearances.

For categorizing the values of a numerical attribute, a number of methods have been proposed in literature [23,24]. However, it is difficult to find the best categorization method which is suitable for data sets having different characteristics (such as domain ranges, and the distribution of domain values) [23]. Some recent categorization methods including Proportional Discretizer (PD) [24] and Fixed Frequency Discretizer (FFD) [24] have been suggested as the best methods [23]. PD suggests that the number of categories

It is worth mentioning that for categorizing a numerical value v both PD and FFD focus on the number of records in each category instead of the actual numerical value v. If the number of records in a category is

                        th numerical values are the same. Therefore, the same numerical values can be categorized differently by PD and FFD. However, FIMUS always groups a set of the same numerical values in the same category since it groups them according to their actual values. In our opinion, it is a sensible approach to categories the same numerical values into the same category instead of categorizing them into different categories.

For a better understanding, in Fig. 1
                         we present the process of categorization by PD, FFD and FIMUS. In this example, we categorize the numerical attribute “Salary” of a toy data set that has been presented in Table 2a. In this example, FFD considers

                         categories where the number of elements in each category can be different. For example, Category 1 has 6 elements since it ranges from 84 to 
                           
                              84

                        . Therefore, two elements having the same value will always be grouped in the same category by FIMUS.

In this study, we empirically evaluate the quality of the categories obtained by PD, FFD and FIMUS. We use two natural data sets namely Credit Approval and CMC [10]. We first artificially create a set of missing values in the data sets. The actual values of them are known to us. We then run FIMUS three times on each dataset and thereby produce three imputed data sets for each natural data set. In the first run we use PD for the categorization purpose within FIMUS. Similarly in the second and third runs we use FFD and FIMUS Categorization (i.e. the regular categorization approach used in FIMUS) in FIMUS. The three imputed data sets are then evaluated (since the actual values of the missing values are known to us) through two evaluation criteria namely 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         
                        [25] and RMSE 
                        [3]. In these empirical tests we use the same experimental settings (that is Missing Level, Missing Model and Missing Pattern) as the remaining experiments presented in Section 4.2.


                        Fig. 2
                         indicates that FIMUS using its own categorization (i.e. FIMUS Categorization) produces a better imputation accuracy than FIMUS using PD and FFD for the categorization purpose, for the both data sets and the both evaluation criteria. Moreover, the categorization approach used in FIMUS is very simple. Therefore, in this study we use this categorization approach in all experiments. However, it is also worth mentioning that any existing categorization methods can be used in our proposed imputation technique called FIMUS. A better categorization approach is likely to produce a better imputation accuracy in FIMUS.

Typically any categorization method leads to a loss of information [24]. Additionally they can also lead to a loss of relationship between the attributes. Let us assume that the two records

Therefore, instead of imputing a missing value, of a record, based on only the other available values (categories) of the record, FIMUS imputes the missing value by taking into account other available values and their similar values. For example, let us assume that for a record

                        . FIMUS uses the co-appearance of x and 
                           
                              l

                         and m, and x and n in order to estimate the possibility of x being the correct imputation. The influence of m and n are weighted according to their similarity with l. Many existing imputation techniques [15,5] consider a group of similar records (such as the k nearest neighbors) of a record

                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         having a missing value. In a way, they also take into account the influence of similar values (such as m and n) in addition to the influence of l.

We test the impact of the property (i.e. considering similar values) on two real data sets namely Credit Approval and CMC [10] by imputing missing values according to FIMUS using the property at various degrees, and then evaluating the imputation accuracy (since we actually know the original values). Two evaluation criteria namely

                        [25] and RMSE 
                        [3] are used. We use a similarity threshold 
                           
                              (

                         that varies from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the imputation is done by considering “the available values and their similar values” (following the unique property of FIMUS), and 1 indicates that the imputation is done by considering only the available values. Moreover, 
                           
                              λ

                         indicates the influence of “considering only the available values” is 20% and “considering available values along with their similar values” is 80%. Fig. 3
                         shows that we get better

FIMUS systematically studies various information from the co-appearance matrix, correlation matrix, frequency and similarity of values in order to impute a missing value. Typically, the number of missing values in a data set is small and therefore, the original information is not heavily disturbed due to the existence of small number of missing values.

                         into categorical values, in this study we use the Pearson’s contingency coefficient [27] to get correlation values between two attributes. The values of the Pearson’s contingency coefficient vary between 0 and 1, where a high value indicates a strong correlation. Note that, for calculating correlations between categorical attributes FIMUS is not restricted to Pearson’s contingency coefficient or any other particular method. A user can choose any other method such as Cramer’s Coefficient (V), Phi

                         statistic is calculated based on the co-appearance matrix (as shown in Table 3), which is also known as the contingency table. Since FIMUS uses the co-appearance matrix (i.e. the contingency table) in other calculations, it is sensible to use the metrics (i.e. Pearson’s contingency coefficient, Cramer’s Coefficient (V), and 
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                        ) that rely on the co-appearance matrix.

                         contingency table only when two attributes have two values each. In our case, it is more likely to have a non-

                         contingency table since the attributes may have different domain sizes. Therefore, a user may choose either the Pearson’s contingency coefficient or Cramer’s Coefficient (V) for the correlation calculations.

Typically the values of both metrics follow the same trend. If the Pearson’s contingency coefficient for a case

                        . Therefore, the use of one or the other should not heavily influence the accuracy of FIMUS. We run an initial empirical analysis on two data sets where we implement two versions of FIMUS; one using the Pearson’s contingency coefficient and the other using the Cramer’s Coefficient (see Table 1
                        ). We also find that the accuracies of both versions of FIMUS are very similar to each other and clearly superior to other techniques.

In the first round the candidate value “25–29” receives the highest vote, while in the 2nd round “25” achieves the highest vote. Therefore, the final imputed value is 25 for Age of R10.

                     . The existing techniques have been shown to be better than many other techniques including Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) [30], LLSI [4], and ILLSI [2].

We apply the techniques on nine real data sets, as shown in Table 7
                        , that are available in UCI Machine Learning Repository [10]. All the data sets have both numerical and categorical attributes. There are already some records in the Adult, Credit Approval and Autompg data sets having missing values. In our experiments we first remove the records having missing values and thereby get 30,162 records for Adult, 653 records for Credit Approval and 392 records for Autompg with no missing values. We then artificially create missing values in the data sets in order to impute them by different techniques. Since we know the original values of the artificially created missing values, we can evaluate the accuracy/performance of the imputation techniques.

The imputation performance generally depends on both the amount and type of missing values [3]. Two data sets having the same number of missing values can have different types of missing values. For example, in one scenario (type), a data set may have at most one missing value per record. However, in another scenario a data set may have multiple missing values in a record. The possibility of a value being missing generally do not depend on the value itself [1]. In the experiment we therefore, use various types of missing values [3,6,31] such as simple, medium, complex and blended, as explained below.

A simple pattern allows a record to have at most one missing value, whereas a medium pattern allows a record to have minimum 2 attributes with missing values and maximum 50% of the attributes with missing values. In a complex pattern a record can have minimum 50% and maximum 80% attributes with missing values. In a blended pattern we have 25% records having missing values in simple pattern, 50% in medium pattern and 25% in complex pattern.

In our experiments, we also apply two types of missing models namely Uniformly Distributed (UD) and Overall. UD model ensures that each attribute has equal number of missing values. However, in Overall model the attributes may not have equal number of missing values, and in the worst case scenario all missing values may belong to one single attribute.

We also use 4 Missing Ratio, that is 1%, 3%, 5% and 10% missing values. Therefore, we have a total of 32 combinations (id

                        ) of Missing Ratio, Missing Model, and Missing Pattern as shown in Table 10. For each of the 32 combinations, we generate 10 data sets with missing values. Therefore, for each of the nine real data sets we generate all together 320 data sets with missing values.

We use two well known evaluation criteria namely Index of agreement

                         and RMSE for 32 missing combinations (id 1, 2,⋯,32) in Table 8
                        . Each value in the table is the average of 10 imputations carried out on 10 data sets (with missing values) generated for each combination of missing ratio, missing model, and missing pattern. For example, the average RMSE value from the data sets generated for “1%” missing ratio, “Overall” missing model and “Simple” missing pattern is 0.096 for FIMUS. In the table bold values indicate the best results among the five techniques. Moreover, in the last row of the table, we present a score of each technique for each evaluation criteria, where a score indicates that out of 32 missing combinations, a technique performs the best among all the techniques. FIMUS performs significantly better than DMI, SVR, EMI and IBLLS in terms of both evaluation criteria for all 32 combinations of missing patterns.

                         and RMSE, FIMUS outperforms other four techniques for all 32 combinations of missing patterns on Chess data set (see Table 9
                        ), GermanCA data set (see Table 10
                        ), and Pima data set (see Table 11
                        ). FIMUS also performs better than the four techniques on Yeast, CMC, Credit Approval, Housing and Autompg data sets as shown in Table 12
                        . There are all together 288 combinations i.e. 32 combinations/data set ×9 data sets. According to the results based on RMSE, FIMUS performs the best in 275 out of 288 combinations, whereas DMI performs the best in 9 out of 288 combinations. Besides, according to

                         FIMUS performs the best in 267 out of 288 combinations while DMI performs the best in 13 out of 288 combinations. Fig. 5
                         shows the percentage of combinations (out of 288 combinations), where FIMUS, DMI, SVR, EMI and IBLLS achieve the best result. For example, FIMUS achieves the best average in 95.49% cases in terms of RMSE.

We now present aggregated performances based on RMSE for all techniques on nine data sets in terms of missing ratios, missing models, and missing patterns in Fig. 6
                        . The figures demonstrate that FIMUS performs better (i.e. lower average RMSE values) than other techniques for all missing ratios, for all missing models, and for all missing patterns. Similarly, Fig. 7
                         demonstrates that FIMUS performs better (i.e. higher average

                         values) than other techniques for all missing ratios, for all missing models, and for all missing patterns on 9 data sets.

                         presents the overall result (average of all 32 combinations) for each data set. For all data sets FIMUS performs clearly better than all other techniques in terms of RMSE (Fig. 8(a)) and

                         (Fig. 8(b)).

We now analysis the results by using a statistical sign test [32] for all 32 combinations. The sign test results indicate that FIMUS performs better than the other techniques at

                        , and right-tailed in terms of RMSE (see Fig. 9
                        (a)) and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         (see Fig. 9(b)) for all nine data sets. Figs. 8 and 5 can give an overall idea on the performance of FIMUS.

Unlike EMI and IBLLS, FIMUS DMI and SVR can impute categorical missing values in addition to numerical missing values. Therefore, we also compare the imputation accuracy of FIMUS and DMI for categorical missing values. In Fig. 10
                         we present the overall result (average of all 32 combinations) of RMSE values for FIMUS, DMI and SVR on all nine data sets. FIMUS performs clearly better than DMI and SVR for all data sets.

We now present the average execution time (in milliseconds) for 320 data sets (32 combinations×10 data sets per combination) with missing values for each real data set in Table 13
                        . We carry out the experiments using two different machines. However, for one data set we use the same machine for all techniques. The configuration of Machine 1 is 4×8 core Intel E7–8837 Xeon processors, 256GB RAM. The configuration of Machine 2 is Intel Core i5 processor with 2.67GHz speed and 4GB RAM. FIMUS takes less time than DMI and IBLLS, whereas it takes slightly more time than EMI to pay the cost of a significantly better quality imputation.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Similar to many existing techniques [1,20,11,21,22] our proposed technique considers all records of a data set for the imputation of missing values, instead of considering different horizontal partitions for the imputation of different missing values [5,13,6]. However, unlike the existing techniques the proposed technique makes use of the co-appearances of the attribute values belonging to two attributes. A high co-appearance between a pair of values indicates a high possibility of the appearance of a value of the pair in a record, if the other value appears in the record. To facilitate the co-appearance calculation the proposed technique categorizes the numerical values.

Another unique property of the proposed technique is the use of the similarity among the values. While imputing a missing value of a record the proposed technique not only uses the available values of the record, but also the similar values of the available values.

Additionally, the proposed technique considers the correlations among the attributes while imputing a missing value. Unlike some existing techniques such as IBLLS [5] that consider the attributes that have high correlations with the attribute having a missing value and ignore the influence of all other attributes, the proposed technique considers all attributes according to their correlation strengths.

FIMUS performs the best in 95.49% of the total experiments in terms of RMSE (Fig. 5(a)) and in 92.71% of the total experiments in terms of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                      (Fig. 5(b)). Moreover, it achieves the overall best result for all data sets in terms of both evaluation criteria (Fig. 8). The sign test results indicate a clear superiority of FIMUS over the existing techniques that are used in the paper (Fig. 9). In terms of the execution time required FIMUS performs better than DMI, SVR and IBLLS while it performs slightly worse than EMI, perhaps to pay the cost of a high quality imputation (Table 13).

Like all other techniques FIMUS also achieves a better imputation accuracy in the simple pattern than the accuracy in the medium and complex pattern (Figs. 6 and 7). A possible reason for the trend is the existence of a single missing value in a record for the simple pattern compared to the existence of multiple missing values in a record for the other two patterns. When there is only one missing value in a record then we have many available values in the record, and therefore, we can make a good estimate of the missing value. It is clearly more challenging to impute the missing values of a record when there is a very low number (say 1 or 2) of available values and high number (say 8 or 10) of missing values in the record.

The figures (Figs. 6 and 7) also show a trend of better imputation accuracy for the blended pattern than the medium and complex patterns. The blended pattern has a combination of records having the simple, medium and complex pattern. Therefore, due to the influence of the simple pattern the results of the blended pattern are better than the medium and complex pattern.

Some of the data sets (i.e. Adult, Chess, CMC, GermanCA and Credit Approval) used in the experiments have higher number of categorical attributes than numerical attributes (see Table 7). Let us call these data sets as the Type A data sets. The Type B data sets have higher number of numerical attributes than categorical attributes. We observe that the difference between the imputation accuracy (in terms of RMSE and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        
                     ) obtained by FIMUS and an existing technique is higher in the Type A data sets than Type B data sets.

For example, the average of the differences (of RMSE values) between FIMUS and DMI is 0.037, over all Type A data sets. Similarly the average differences (of RMSE values) between FIMUS and SVR, FIMUS and EMI, and FIMUS and IBLLS are 0.050, 0.044 and 0.124, respectively. Whereas, for Type B data sets the average differences are 0.017, 0.033, 0.025 and 0.038, respectively. Therefore, FIMUS enjoys a better superiority (i.e. bigger differences) over the existing techniques in the Type A data sets than in the Type B data sets.

A possible explanation to this could be as follows. FIMUS needs to artificially categorize numerical attributes. The artificial categorization quality may not be very high resulting in a less accurate imputation than the case where the attributes are already categorical. The high quality categorical values (of natural categorical attributes) help FIMUS to impute missing values more accurately than the case where numerical values are artificially categorized. This observation indicates that with a better discretization/categorization method we can expect a better imputation accuracy by FIMUS. However, please note that even with the current setting FIMUS significantly outperforms (according to the sign test results) the existing techniques in both Type A and Type B data sets.

The main innovation of the study is the imputation of a missing value using 3 key properties of a dataset namely the co-appearances of the values belonging to different attributes, the similarity of values belonging to an attribute and the correlations of the attributes. Moreover, the proposed technique can adjust the influence of the similar values on the imputation of missing values. It can also impute both numerical and categorical attributes. The imputation accuracy of FIMUS is clearly better than the high quality techniques used in this study on the nine datasets.

We have also identified a few limitations of the technique. One of the limitations is its overall time complexity, which is

                      and for low dimensional data sets (such as those used in this study)

                     . Hence, the complexity of FIMUS for a low dimensional data set is 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . However, for high dimensional data sets such as biomedical data sets FIMUS can suffer heavily due to its complexity of 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 m
                              
                              
                                 5
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . Another limitation of FIMUS is that it is not designed to impute missing values in a time series dataset. Since FIMUS uses co-appearance and correlations, if a time series dataset contains only one attribute such as temperature against a time series then FIMUS may not be useful on the dataset. If a time series dataset contains multiple attributes such as humidity, temperature and precipitation then FIMUS can be more useful in imputing missing values. Nevertheless, FIMUS is unable to take advantage of time information while imputing missing values. All the techniques discussed in this study have the same drawback on time series datasets. Another limitation of FIMUS is the categorization (of numerical attributes) required by it. It is commonly known that categorization often causes information loss. Therefore, a better categorization technique can produce a better imputation.

Our future research plans include a further improvement of FIMUS in time complexity for high dimensional data sets, modification of FIMUS to suit time series data sets, and development of a better categorization method.
