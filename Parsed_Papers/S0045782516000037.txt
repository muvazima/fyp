                  In this paper, a discontinuous Galerkin method for a nonlinear shear-flexible shell theory is proposed that is suitable for both thick and thin shell analysis. The proposed method extends recent work on Reissner–Mindlin plates to avoid locking without the use of projection operators, such as mixed methods or reduced integration techniques. Instead, the flexibility inherent to discontinuous Galerkin methods in the choice of approximation spaces is exploited to satisfy the thin plate compatibility conditions a priori. A benefit of this approach is that only generalized displacements appear as unknowns. We take advantage of this to craft the method in terms of a discrete energy minimization principle, thereby restoring the Rayleigh–Ritz approach. In addition to providing a straightforward and elegant derivation of the discrete equilibrium equations, the variational character of the method could afford numerous advantages in terms of mesh adaptation and available solution techniques. The proposed method is exercised on a set of benchmarks and example problems to assess its performance numerically, and to test for shear and membrane locking.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Shell structures are perhaps the most challenging setting for numerical analysis in solid mechanics. The primary difficulty encountered is locking, wherein the approximation power of the numerical method diminishes as the shell thickness is reduced. The problem is similar to that faced in nearly incompressible elasticity. Shear-flexible shell theories are generally formulated with two kinematic fields: the displacement of the shell mid-surface, and some representation of the rotation of fibers originally transverse to the shell surface. The root of the locking problem is that when standard finite element interpolations are used for both fields, the pair of approximations spaces taken together do not represent the thin-shell limit well. In particular, this incompatibility prevents the transverse shear strains from vanishing, leading to spurious shear energy. The problem is exacerbated as the shell thickness 
                        t
                      tends to zero, since the bending energy is smaller than the transverse shear energy by a factor of 
                        
                           
                              t
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , and the spurious shear energy caused by the incompatibility of the discrete function spaces becomes dominant.

The goal for numerical analysis of shear-flexible plates and shells is a method that converges uniformly with respect to the thickness, while remaining simple. These requests are somewhat antagonistic, and the search for acceptable compromises has generated a large body of literature (see the review by  [1] and the references therein). Most approaches operate on the shear energy by replacing the rotations in the shear strain term with some lower order projection. There are two main techniques applied to effect this projection: one avenue followed has been mixed methods, in which the shear strain is added as an unknown, such as  [2–6] for Reissner–Mindlin plates, and the well-known MITC elements  [7–9] that extend this idea to curved shells. The other main approach, popular in commercial finite element codes, is to use a reduced integration rule  [10–12] with some suitable stabilization of the attendant rank deficiency  [13–15]. Both approaches have drawbacks: for mixed methods, the energy minimum problem is transformed into a saddle point, which leads to indefinite stiffness matrices that are more difficult to invert. From the perspective of formulation, mixed method elements must satisfy the Babuška–Brezzi (inf–sup) condition to be convergent, and proving this for any element is not a simple task  [16,17,6]. On the other hand, reduced integration methods are simple to formulate and to implement, but are ad hoc, without rigorous stability and accuracy guarantees.

                        1
                        Under some restrictions, reduced integration approaches are equivalent to mixed methods  [18,12]. However, this equivalence breaks down under nonlinear or anisotropic material behavior.
                      Furthermore, it can sometimes be difficult to detect when hourglass modes are excited in complex engineering problems (e.g. high-rate dynamic problems with nonlinear constitutive behavior), which can make the use of under-integrated elements unsafe.

The development of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods has provided new means to attack locking problems, as evidenced by the formulations in  [19–21] for nearly and fully incompressible elasticity and in  [22] for Stokes flow. In particular, the last 10 years has seen the development of several locking-free DG methods for Reissner plates  [23–26]. In  [24–26], the flexibility in the choice of the approximation spaces afforded by discontinuous Galerkin methods is exploited to ensure satisfaction of the natural compatibility conditions of the thin plate limit. These families of elements are locking-free without recourse to mixed methods or reduced integration. Notwithstanding these advances for plates, DG methods have barely been explored for the analysis of curved shear-flexible shells. The notable exception is the work of Güzey et al. on linear shells with their embedded discontinuous Galerkin method  [27,28].

In this article, the discontinuous Galerkin approach is extended to the nonlinear analysis of finitely deforming, shear-flexible shells. In the proposed method, locking is alleviated without a projection operator by extending the compatibility strategy of Arnold et al.  [24] to shells. An advantage of this approach is that locking is avoided without the introduction of generalized force unknowns. This paves the way to casting the method in terms of a minimum principle. To this end, a discrete potential energy functional is proposed, as in the DG method of Ten Eyck and Lew for nonlinear elasticity  [20] (also related are the DG elasticity methods in  [29,30] derived from three-field mixed variational principles). The discrete equilibrium equations follow as the first variation of this functional, which furnishes an elegant means to derive the method. The variational structure also confers numerous benefits. Symmetry of the bilinear form and hence the stiffness matrix is guaranteed, since it is the second variation of a scalar potential, which is always symmetric. The tools of mathematical optimization may be brought to bear for solution, including powerful existing software libraries. The energy principle also provides a physically meaningful basis for error estimation for mesh adaptation that applies even in nonlinear problems, in which there is no natural norm  [31–33]. It is worth noting that discontinuous Galerkin methods are particularly well-suited to 
                        h
                        p
                     -adaptation.

The structure of this paper is as follows. A review of the adopted shell theory, the classical directed surface theory in the form developed by Simo and Fox  [34], is given in Section  2. In Section  3, the new nonlinear DG shell method is proposed. (In addition, the linearized kinematics version is provided for the purposes of making normed error measurements and applying linear benchmarks in the next section.) As in any discontinuous Galerkin method, a key step is the projection of the derivative operator, sometimes called the DG derivative. The character of the shell as a two dimensional surface embedded in three dimensional space merits special attention; accordingly, a full derivation of this operator is given in Section  3.4. In Section  4, details of an implementation strategy are provided to promote adoption of the proposed method and further development. This includes the computation and storage strategy of the DG derivative. Explicit forms of the nodal forces are provided. (Explicit forms of the element stiffness matrices are additionally provided in the Appendix.) Numerical studies are presented in Section  5 as a preliminary assessment of the performance of the proposed method and to test for locking. These tests indicate that the method is promising as an analysis tool for both thick and thin shells.

Throughout the paper, the notation of Simo and Fox  [34] is largely used. Scalar quantities are indicated by italic type, and vectors (in

Lower-case Greek letters are used to index two-dimensional tensor components, while lower-case Roman letters will be reserved for three dimensional components. A tensor index appearing twice in the same term implies summation over the range of the index.

The adopted shell formulation is that of a classical single director Cosserat surface, in the form developed by Simo and Fox  [34]. For completeness, and to fix notation, the theory is summarized in this section.

                           In general, a collection of parameterizations will be needed to cover

                        . It follows from the choice of the unit sphere as the director manifold and the invariance of 
                           h
                         that the shell is assumed to be rigid in the thickness direction.

                         Identical definitions exist for the reference configuration. Eq.  (5a) gives the components of the metric tensor; (5b) measures the deviation of the director from the surface normal, that is, the relative shearing of the normal fiber; (5c) defines a curvature-like tensor. It is simple to prove that the kinematic tensors in (5) are invariant with respect to changes in frame, which is a direct consequence of the use of convected coordinates.

The components of the metric in the dual basis follow from the identity

The above form of the stress resultant relations is useful for writing the equilibrium equations in weak form. However, for building the constitutive framework, it is helpful to deduce the work conjugate pairs in terms of tensors intrinsic to the shell manifold. In  [34] it is shown that the stress resultants can be decomposed in terms of effective stress resultants

The components labeled “indeterminate” are so in the sense that they perform no work; therefore, in the weak form of the equilibrium equations they are irrelevant and may be ignored. In particular, the components of the stress couple resultant about the director,

The utility of the effective stress resultants is that they are work conjugate to the variations of the kinematic surface tensors in (5). The free energy density function may be further specified to depend on the kinematics solely though the surface tensors, as in

                         Eq.  (15) is the virtual work equation of the shell.

For the purposes of finite element discretization, the weak form of the equilibrium equations (14) suffices. However, for completeness, the equilibrium equations in strong form are recorded here. Assuming sufficient smoothness, the divergence theorem applied to the virtual work yields

                         in general, and the surface normal vector suffers jumps across element edges. When treating smooth shells, it is inconvenient to have jumps in the reference configuration, as these jumps would need to be stored and subtracted out of the DG derivatives to avoid inducing spurious strain energy in the reference configuration. To circumvent this problem, a unique value is assigned to all spatially coincident director nodes on element boundaries by arbitrarily selecting one of the nodal values. It bears emphasis that the orientation of the reference director field does not affect the response of the shell, but rather only the deviation from it during the deformation. In our numerical implementation, the nodal values from the element with the smallest global index are chosen for this purpose.

                           T
                        -junctions, can be detected and handled during this pre-processing step; see, e.g.,  [35]. Such complications are not treated presently.

                         in the discrete setting as well. This implies that the director field has two degrees of freedom at each node. The parameterization described above eliminates drilling degrees of freedom identically. This is at variance with many other shell discretizations that rely on additional assumptions and ad hoc numerical techniques to control drilling degrees of freedom.

A common feature of discontinuous Galerkin methods is the projection of the gradient onto a discrete function space. Following the primal formulation of DG methods in  [37], the projection will be used to define a discrete derivative operator. (Applying the terminology in  [20], this operator will be called the DG derivative.) The DG derivative formulated here operates with respect to the convected coordinates instead of the more common fixed Cartesian frame. An explicit derivation is given for the DG derivatives of the discrete mid-surface position space

The definition of the DG derivative is completed by choosing a numerical trace operator. The choice of numerical trace affects the numerical properties of the method, including consistency, accuracy, and the bandwidth of the stiffness matrix; a discussion of these issues is presented in  [37]. In this work, simple average traces are employed:

                         of the stress resultant relations (9) have been used. Stable equilibrium positions may be found by searching for stationary points that are local minima.

Note that the minimization approach can be extended beyond elasticity to materials with dissipative behavior by recourse to variational constitutive updates   [38]. In this technique, an incremental functional would take the place of (44). Alternatively, the variational viewpoint can be abandoned, and (47) may be regarded as the definition of a DG weighted residual weak form of the equilibrium equations.

The equilibrium problem can be solved iteratively with Newton’s method by linearizing the virtual work about the current state in the direction of another set of admissible variations. Writing

                         Symmetry of the bilinear form is guaranteed, as the second variation of a scalar potential is always symmetric. The stiffness matrix, being the representation of the bilinear form in the chosen basis, inherits this property. The bilinear form is naturally decomposed into three parts

Each iteration of Newton’s method yields linearized corrections that must be applied to update the configuration of the shell. The geometry of the director manifold must be considered carefully to keep the nodal directors in the unit sphere. At Newton iterate

                         The previous definition of the elastic tensor is retained. The stiffness matrix for the linearized method can be found by taking the fully nonlinear stiffness matrix in Appendix and eliminating the geometric stiffness terms. As is standard, there is no distinction between the reference and current configurations in the linear theory. As a consequence, the update formula in Algorithm 1 is disregarded.

A strategy to implement the weak form in (47) in a standard finite element code is given in this section. In our implementation, calculation of the shape function data is handled through the Gmsh mesh processing library  [39]. The Gmsh library also provides geometric information and adjacency relationships of the triangulation that are convenient for implementing DG methods.

The DG derivative operator is applied by pre-computing and storing the action of the lifting operator on the basis functions of the kinematic fields. The details of this computation are recorded in this section. It is shown that the representation of the lifting operator is of the same form as the familiar shape function derivatives, and thus can be stored in a similar data structure.

The DG derivative is taken with respect to the convected coordinates, and thus the formulation of the DG derivative in Section  3.4 involves integrals over the parameterization space. This is somewhat different than typical discontinuous Galerkin methods, where the ambient space and the manifold of the domain are both the same Euclidean space, and the DG derivative is taken with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system. Of course, the parameterization space for every element is identical, in the sense that each element maps from a copy of the master element according to the isoparametric approach. The upshot is that the lifting operator can be computed once and for all on the master element in the convected coordinates

                         is the number of position nodes per edge. The positive sign is used for the degrees of freedom on the edge 
                           e
                         belonging to the current element, and the negative sign is taken for degrees of freedom on the edge belonging to the neighbor element. (With the strong enforcement of boundary conditions, the lifting operator vanishes on edges on the essential boundary of the domain, and thus these edges are omitted in the summation over 
                           e
                        .)

The lifting operator of the director field is computed in an analogous way. The corresponding DG derivative is written

As in standard finite element method implementations, the nodal forces and stiffness matrix are assembled element by element. The internal nodal forces are given in this section in explicit form amenable to computer implementation. The internal virtual work can be rewritten as a sum of elemental contributions in the form

                         may be easily identified. Since the edge lifting operates on the kinematic jumps at the element boundaries, all of the nodes inside the dashed circle in Fig. 4
                         are needed to compute the DG derivative in the shaded element.

                           This requirement holds for the nodes in the displacement interpolation and the nodes in the director interpolation.

                         are needed to compute the strains inside the shaded element, and in turn, forces are generated on each of these nodes. It is interesting that the use of an extended set of degrees of freedom bears some similarity to subdivision shell elements  [40–42]. However, discontinuous Galerkin methods only couple degrees of freedom through face adjacencies; no coupling is induced between elements sharing only vertices. The maximum number of nonzero elements per row in the stiffness matrix is thus bounded. Furthermore, if all degrees of freedom belonging to an element are numbered consecutively, the stiffness matrix has a block structure, where the number of nonzero blocks in each row is known a priori (apart from boundary degrees of freedom). This predictable structure may be exploited to design efficient factorization schemes for direct solvers or preconditioners (see, e.g.,  [43]). Another advantage of this structure is that common element-level operations, such as interpolation of the kinematic fields and the nodal force assembly in (64) and (65), use values largely stored in contiguous blocks of memory.

                        . In order to reduce the matrix bandwidth and to promote usage of contiguous memory blocks, it is recommended that the displacement and director correction unknowns are numbered together element-wise, and that the spatial components of each unknown are indexed consecutively.

The integrals in (64) and (65) are computed approximately with a quadrature rule. For stiffness and residual calculations, the selection of the quadrature rule is made using the Reissner plate system as a guide. The highest degree term appearing in the Reissner virtual work is a polynomial of degree

In this section, a numerical implementation of the proposed method is subjected to a set of benchmarks and examples. In all problems, solution of the systems of equations is performed through the PETSc scientific computing library  [44] using the LU and Cholesky direct solver routines.

In this section, the accuracy of the proposed method with linearized kinematics is assessed with published linear benchmarks. Even in the restricted scope of linear problems, analyzing the accuracy of numerical methods for shells is surprisingly difficult. For the most part, exact solutions are not known, and thus measuring convergence rigorously in terms of norms is not possible. Most researchers and practicing engineers largely rely on heuristic benchmarks to assess shell methods. Unfortunately, the most commonly used benchmarks only test point-wise convergence of displacement or forces, and are not necessarily indicative of the relative performance of different methods. Furthermore, many of the benchmark problems lack sufficient regularity to be well-posed for shear-flexible shells: in particular, point loads are inadmissible in these theories. These shortcomings have been recognized over the last 20 years, and mathematical analysis has been done to shed light on the inherent difficulties; in particular, the work Pitkäranta and co-workers  [46,47] and Bathe and Chapelle  [48–50] deserve mention. Ref.  [46] notes that in the limit of vanishing thickness, well-posed shell problems range between two limiting regimes: (i) bending dominated problems and (ii) membrane dominated problems. This suggests that if a method is able to function accurately and efficiently (without locking) in both extremes, it is likely to be successful.

Membrane and bending patch tests were performed to verify that constant strain fields are exactly reproduced by the element. Both tests were conducted on a domain of the unit square in the 
                           x
                           y
                        -plane. The mesh used for these tests is shown in Fig. 6
                        
                        . The parameters of the problems are the plate edge length 
                           L
                        , the plate thickness 
                           t
                        , the Young’s modulus 
                           E
                        , and the Poisson’s ratio 
                           ν
                        .

In both problems, the implementation of the proposed method was verified to satisfy the constant strains solutions exactly at every nodal point (within machine precision) (see Fig. 7).

In this section, the convergence of the proposed method is evaluated numerically on the clamped plate problem of Chinosi and Lovadina  [51]. The convergence is measured over a range of plate thicknesses in order to check for locking in the thin plate limit. Ideally, the numerical solution should converge uniformly as a function of thickness.

The problem is defined on a plate occupying the unit square, which is clamped on all sides. The plate is subjected to the load

This is the expected behavior of a uniformly convergent method. These results attest to the robustness of the proposed DG method as a general plate analysis tool for both thick and thin plates.

                           =
                           2
                         DG shell element tested here. In terms of the relative error in the strain energy, the present method is seen to be similar in performance to the MITC6 element. The accuracy level remains comparable as the shell becomes thin. The proposed method shows no tendency to lock in this membrane-dominated test.

This problem, another benchmark suggested by Pitkäranta et al. [46], tests curved shell elements in a bending-dominated problem. The cylinder mesh is subject only to the symmetry constraints, and the end is left free. The geometry, and properties, and meshes are identical to those in the clamped cylinder benchmark. The loading is given by

The proposed method is again compared to the MITC elements in terms of relative error in strain energy. The results are shown in Fig. 11
                        . The proposed method again displays good convergence with mesh refinement. In the

                         case, the accuracy is nearly identical to the MITC6 element. In the 
                           t
                           /

                         case, the accuracy of the proposed method is poorer than the MITC elements for coarse meshes, but surpasses the MIT4 element by the third refinement level and reaches similar accuracy to the MITC6. An additional refinement level was performed with the present method to show that this level of accuracy is maintained. Again, the accuracy of the method remains acceptable in the thin limit. This benchmark and the previous one attest to the versatility of the method as a high performing tool in both asymptotic limits.

Note, however, that the proposed method uses a larger number of degrees of freedom when compared to the MITC elements. This is a common drawback of DG methods, where instead the benefit lies in the treatment of discontinuities such as fracture. In order to compare the efficiency of the proposed method versus the MITC elements in this metric, we replot the strain energy convergence data from the free cylinder benchmark as a function of total number of degrees of freedom in Fig. 12
                        . As expected, whereas the convergence rate of the proposed DG method is the same as that of the MITC6, the additional cost in terms of number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a given error grows as a constant factor.

The Scordelis–Lo roof problem is a classic shell benchmark. It has been shown to be a problem of “intermediate” character in the thin limit, having finite bending and membrane energies as 
                           t
                           →

                        . The gravity load is 90 lb/ft2 in the negative 
                           z
                        -direction. Scordelis and Lo computed the vertical displacement of the mid-span at the free edge as 0.3024 ft, which is used to normalize the numerical results in Fig. 13(b). The current method is compared with a series of other shell elements: the MITC4 element, the DG method of Güzey et al.  [27], the one-point quadrature degenerated solid shells of Liu et al.  [52], and the assumed strain element of Simo et al.  [53]. In this point-wise displacement metric, the present DG method converges rapidly and without overshoot.

In this section, benchmark problems with geometric and material nonlinearities are solved with the proposed method to assess its ability to function as a practical engineering tool.

The problem was solved in 12 equal load increments. Fig. 14
                         depicts the equilibrium position of the beam at several load increments, as well as the final deformed shape. The convergence condition was set to be when the

                         norm of the residual forces is reduced to 10−8 of the initial out-of-balance. At each load increment, 10 Newton iterations were required to reach equilibrium. The robustness of the proposed method can be appreciated by comparing these results with the performance of the “S4R” element of the commercial finite element code Abaqus. In fact, Sze et al.  [54] report a much larger number of load steps (125) and maximum permitted number of Newton iterations (714) convergence using the default convergence criteria and the default adaptive load incrementing scheme on the same problem.

A cantilevered bar of length 
                           L
                        , width 
                           w
                        , and thickness 
                           t
                         is twisted by application of a torque 
                           T
                         at the free end. This is another test of the shell method to efficiently find equilibrium positions under large deformations and rotations. The parameters of the problem are given in Table 5
                        . Note that in this case, the bar is rather thick, with 
                           t
                           /
                           w
                           =
                           0.2
                        . The in-plane dimensions of the bar are the same as the previous problem, and the same mesh is used. The material is taken to be elastic.

The load is applied in 25 equal increments. The convergence criterion is again taken to be a reduction in the

                                 2
                              
                           
                         norm of the residual to 10−8 of the value at the start of the load increment. The final state of the bar is shown in Fig. 15
                        . The deformation is clearly quite large, with the bar being subjected to approximately one and a half turns. The maximum number of Newton iterations needed in any increment is 8, and the median value is 5. In fact, the number of Newton iterations to reach equilibrium decreased as the total load increased. These features illustrate the robust convergence behavior obtained with the interpolations and exact update formulae. In the absence of an exact solution for comparison, this example was carried out for the sole purpose of showing the reliable performance of the quasi-static method in the presence of very large deformations.

The pinched open hemisphere problem is commonly used as a benchmark for both linear and nonlinear shells. In this problem, a hemispherical shell with an 18° hole in the top is loaded by two pairs of diametrically opposed forces on the equator, separated by 90°. The forces are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sense (see Fig. 16
                        (a)). The parameters of the problem are given in Table 6
                        .

Point loads are not admissible loads for shear-flexible shells. Hence, despite its popularity, the utility of this problem as a benchmark is limited. Yet, due to the fact that this example is so widely used, it is included here to show that the predictions of the proposed DG method are similar to other accepted shell methods. The results are presented in Fig. 16(c) as force vs. displacement plots of the inward and outward load points. The present method is compared with the shell element of Simo et al.  [55], which is based on the same shell theory as the proposed method, but uses an assumed strain approach to control locking. Additionally, results are included from the standard shell element (denoted “S4R”) of the widely used commercial solid mechanics software Abaqus  [56] (the Abaqus data come through the published work of Sze et al. [54]). The proposed method predicts very similar results to both of the other element formulations. The geometric nonlinearity in this problem is rather strong, as evidenced by the disparity in the magnitudes of the inward and outward displacements, which would of course be identical in the linearized problem.

The problem tests the ability of the proposed method to capture the nonlinear transition of a circular plate from bending to membrane behavior under large deflections. The problem setup is illustrated in 17
                        (a). A circular clamped plate is subjected to transverse distributed load and possible radial pre-tension. The clamped plate has radius

                         is taken as 0.1, so that the numerical results may be compared with calculations from thin plate theory. The response of the plate is measured in terms of

Quarter symmetry is exploited in the mesh, which is shown in Fig. 17(b). The predicted response of the plate is shown in Fig. 18
                         in terms of load intensity vs. transverse deflection of the plate center. The response of the plate is initially governed by bending and can be described well with Kirchhoff plate theory, which predicts that the deflection scales linearly with

                        . As the deflection of the plate grows to be comparable with the thickness, membrane effects become important, and the response becomes increasingly nonlinear. At large deflections, bending effects are small, and the plate response is dominated by in-plane membrane forces, and membrane theory predicts that the transverse displacement goes as

                         predictions of Sheplak and Dugundji using von Kármán nonlinear plate theory  [57]. The results are plotted on logarithmic scales so that the asymptotic behaviors can be clearly seen. The proposed method closely reproduces the published results. It is particularly noteworthy that the proposed method accurately captures the transition from bending to membrane stretching with a rather coarse mesh. (There is a boundary layer in the solution near the clamped boundary, targeted refinement in this area would improve the results further.) The bending to membrane transition is present in many technologically important fracture problems involving impact and penetration, such as the design of force protection and armor systems, and ship grounding analysis in naval architecture.

A discontinuous Galerkin method was proposed for the analysis of finitely deforming, shear-flexible shells. The key feature of this method is that the usual tools to prevent locking in shells, mixed formulations and reduced integration, are eschewed in favor of a selection of approximation spaces that are compatible with the thin shell limit. Numerical evidence was presented that suggests the method is accurate and locking-free. As in most discontinuous Galerkin methods, the number of unknowns generated for a given mesh is higher than competing conforming methods; on the other hand, the absence of mixed variables allows the proposed method to be cast variationally, in terms of an energy minimum principle. The energy principle approach could prove advantageous for solution methods and mesh adaptation.
