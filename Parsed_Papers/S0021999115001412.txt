                  We present a hybrid particle-mesh method for numerically solving the hydrodynamic equations of incompressible active polar viscous gels. These equations model the dynamics of polar active agents, embedded in a viscous medium, in which stresses are induced through constant consumption of energy. The numerical method is based on Lagrangian particles and staggered Cartesian finite-difference meshes. We show that the method is second-order and first-order accurate with respect to grid and time-step sizes, respectively. Using the present method, we simulate the hydrodynamics in rectangular geometries, of a passive liquid crystal, of an active polar film and of active gels with topological defects in polarization. We show the emergence of spontaneous flow due to Fréedericksz transition, and transformation in the nature of topological defects by tuning the activity of the system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dynamics of many processes is governed by the mechanics of active matter. Active matter is a system of interacting agents that exhibit coordinated motion mediated by active internal stresses induced by consumption of energy [41,58]. Consumption of energy occurs at the level of individual agents keeping these systems persistently out of equilibrium [41,58]. Processes such as the collective motion of robots [60] and the motion of colloidal particles propelled by catalytic activity [50,41] are well described as active matter [41]. More striking examples of active matter are living systems like collections of bacteria [21,41], groups of biological cells [34,41], meshworks of cytoskeletal filaments [37,33,32], and flocks of birds [70,71] that exhibit mechanical motion by dissipating chemical energy. Such active systems constitute a class of physical processes where flow is driven from within by consumption of chemical energy.

Inspired by energy-fueled phenomena such as cortical cytoskeleton flows [46,45,32] during biological morphogenesis, the theory of active polar viscous gels has been developed [37,33]. The theory models the continuum, macroscopic mechanics of a collection of uniaxial active agents, embedded in a viscous bulk medium, in which internal stresses are induced due to dissipation of energy [41,58]. The energy-consuming uniaxial polar agents constituting the gel are modeled as unit vectors. The average of unit vectors in a small local volume at each point defines the macroscopic directionality of the agents and is described by a polarization field. The polarization field is governed by an equation of motion accounting for energy consumption and for the strain rate in the fluid. The relationship between the strain rate and the stress in the fluid is provided by a constitutive equation that accounts for anisotropic, polar agents and consumption of energy. These equations, along with conservation of momentum, provide a continuum hydrodynamic description modeling active polar viscous gels as an energy consuming, anisotropic, non-Newtonian fluid [37,33,32,41]. The resulting partial differential equations governing the hydrodynamics of active polar viscous gels are, however, in general analytically intractable.

There have been attempts to numerically simulate the physics of active polar viscous gels at different length scales. At the microscopic scale, simulations have been carried out to understand in vitro organization of microtubule filaments in the presence of oligomeric motor proteins [49,47]. In addition, Brownian dynamics simulations have been used to model the collective dynamics of flexible cytoskeletal fibers [48]. However, such microscopic simulations do not allow large systems to be studied and are computationally demanding. At the mesoscopic scale, lattice Boltzmann simulations have been used to simulate the emergence of spontaneous flow in active liquid crystal films [42,43], spontaneous symmetry breaking in active liquid droplets [69] and pattern formation in active fluids [26]. While this increased the accessible length scales, it is challenging to impose constant polarity magnitude due to the limitation of the numerical method [7,42]. We are not aware of any numerical method to simulate at the macroscopic scale the hydrodynamic equations of active polar viscous gels proposed by Kruse et al. (2005) [37], Jülicher et al. (2007) [33] and, Joanny and Prost (2009) [32]. Lack of such a numerical method prohibited macroscopic simulations of complex active processes including coupled mechanochemical processes that have been postulated as the fundamental basis of biological morphogenesis [31,5,45,27,28].

In this paper, we present a hybrid particle-mesh method [29,30,40,9,63,10] to simulate the macroscopic hydrodynamics of incompressible active polar viscous gels on rectangular geometries with arbitrary boundary conditions. The method is based on Lagrangian particles and Cartesian meshes. In Lagrangian particle methods, field quantities are discretized onto a set of computational elements called particles [19,20,12,35,23,62,63]. Every particle occupies a position that evolves according to a local velocity field. The field quantities carried by particles evolve according to the material derivative in a Lagrangian frame of reference. Such a description forms the basis of numerical methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics [52,8] and vortex methods [22,35,12] that have been used for various flow simulations. In such methods, advection of a field is performed by moving particles according to the velocity field. This enhances numerical stability in flow-dominated simulations [19,20,12,35,23,62,63] since the method is not restricted by the Eulerian Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition [24]. Remeshing the field quantities from particles to meshes guarantees consistency in discretizing the advection operator [12,11] and allows using mesh-based methods for discretizing other differential operators. Mesh based methods, like finite differences and finite volumes, offer simple and accurate operator discretization schemes, especially in simple geometries. Hybrid particle-mesh methods therefore combine the advantages of Lagrangian particle methods and mesh based methods [29,30,62,63,3,10]. Using these advantages we develop a conservative numerical method where the novelty is the preservation of the constant magnitude of the polarization field. The numerical method uses an analytically derived Lagrange multiplier which is consistent with the physics of active polar viscous gels to conserve the magnitude of the polarization field. The Lagrange multiplier is a function of the velocity and polarization fields, and introduces additional coupling between the dynamics of the polarization and velocity fields. In addition, we perform moment conserving remeshing of the polarization field from particles to an underlying mesh that preserves the constant magnitude of the polarization field. We exactly impose the incompressibility constraint using staggered finite-difference meshes and direct linear solvers to obtain the exact solution of the resulting linear system of equations. Finally, we use particles to perform advection so that the discretization scheme is not necessarily restricted by the CFL condition for advection-dominated problems.

In Section 2, we present the governing equations of the continuum hydrodynamic description of incompressible active polar viscous gels in two-dimensional geometries. We present a hybrid particle-mesh method to numerically solve the governing equations in two-dimensional rectangular geometries in Section 3. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we present the accuracy and computational cost of the hybrid particle-mesh method. We validate our numerical method by demonstrating its consistency and convergence in Section 4. In Section 5, we use the hybrid particle-mesh method to simulate passive liquid crystal flows, spontaneous flows in active polar films, and hydrodynamics of active polar viscous gels with topological defects in the polarization field. We provide conclusions and discuss the limitations of the current method in Section 6.

The continuum hydrodynamic description of incompressible active polar viscous gels in two-dimensions [37,33,32] (see Appendix A for more details) is governed by five partial differential equations (PDEs): one for each velocity component, one for the incompressibility condition, and one for each component of the polarization field.

Assuming that the viscous forces in an active gel dominate the inertial forces, the two equations governing the velocity field in the low-Reynolds-number limit are obtained by imposing force balance in each of the two directions:

                      Eqs. (10) and (11) reduce to the polarization dynamics of an incompressible passive liquid crystal when 
                        Δ
                        μ
                        =
                        0
                     . They hence are a generalization accounting for consumption of energy in active polar gels [37,33,32].

To solve Eqs. (1), (2), (9), (10), and (11) for the velocity and the polarization fields, we require an initial condition and various boundary conditions. The initial condition is given by the polarization field at time 
                        t
                        =
                        0
                     . The active gel equations can have a variety of boundary conditions. The velocity at the boundary is prescribed by a Robin (mixed) condition or a stress-free condition. Robin boundary conditions for the magnitude v of tangential and normal velocity components, on the one hand, are defined as 
                        a

                        =
                        
                           constant
                        
                      where a, b are constants,

                      is a unit vector pointing outwards at the boundary and 
                        
                           ∇
                           ̲
                        
                      is the gradient differential operator. On the other hand, velocity at stress-free boundaries are such that the shear stress at the boundary vanishes (see Eqs. (A.5), (A.6), (A.7) and (A.3) for the expression of the deviatoric stress tensor). Additionally, the polarization field at the boundaries is determined according to a Dirichlet or a Neumann boundary condition. Therefore, every point on the boundary is governed by four boundary conditions to define the two velocity components and the two components of polarization.

In summary, Eqs. (1), (2), (9), (10), and (11), along with appropriate boundary conditions for velocity and polarization, govern the hydrodynamics of incompressible active polar viscous gels in two dimensions as a function of material constants, namely, η, ν, γ, ζ, λ,

                      is, in general, spatially and temporally variable across the two-dimensional domain.

We present a hybrid particle-mesh method to numerically solve the continuum hydrodynamic equations of incompressible active polar viscous gels (see Section 2) in two-dimensional rectangular geometries with arbitrary boundary conditions. The rectangular computational domain contains a set of points with coordinates 
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        )
                      such that

                        ≤
                        x

                      and 
                        0
                        ≤
                        y
                        ≤

                     , where

                              y
                           
                        
                      are the dimensions of the computational domain in x and y directions, respectively. All differential operators are discretized on staggered Cartesian finite-difference meshes, while the advection of the polarization field is represented on particles (for details on particle-function approximation see, for example, Hockney and Eastwood (1988) [30], and Cottet and Koumoutsakos (2000) [12]). We initialize particles carrying the local polarization field at mesh nodes at every time step. We integrate the material derivative and the local velocity field to compute the polarization field carried by the particles, and accordingly update the positions of the particles in the next time step. Subsequently, we interpolate the polarization field carried by the particles back to the mesh nodes. Using staggered finite differences, we then compute the velocity field at the next time step. This procedure combines the superior numerical stability of Lagrangian particle methods in performing advection of field quantities with the accuracy and simplicity of discretizing differential operators on Cartesian meshes to simulate the hydrodynamics of active gels.

Numerically simulating the hydrodynamic equations requires computing the velocity field

                        t
                        )
                      and the polarization field 
                        
                           p
                           ̲
                        
                        (
                        x
                        ,
                        y
                        ,
                        t
                        )
                      across the computational domain as a function of time t. To do so, we first compute the initial velocity field at time 
                        t
                        =
                        0
                      according to Eqs. (1), (2), and (9) from the initial condition for the polarization field. Subsequently, we integrate the equations of motion of the polarization field (Eqs. (10) and (11)) until time δt to compute the polarization field at 
                        t
                        =
                        δ
                        t
                     , where δt is the integration time step. We then use the polarization at time 
                        t
                        =
                        δ
                        t
                      to compute the velocity field at time 
                        t
                        =
                        δ
                        t
                      according to Eqs. (1), (2), and (9). We use this procedure repeatedly to compute the polarization and velocity fields for all time steps until a final time 
                        
                           
                              t

                              t
                           
                        
                        
                        δ
                        t
                     , 
                        
                           
                              N
                           
                           
                              t
                           
                        
                      being the total number of integration time steps.

The method, therefore, consists of two principal computational modules. One for integrating the polarization field from time

                      to t according to Eqs. (10) and (11) using point particles and a finite difference mesh. We then make use of the polarization field at time t in the second computational module. The second computational module uses staggered finite difference meshes to compute the velocity field at time t. We make use of these two computational modules in the hybrid particle-mesh method to compute the velocity field and the polarization fields across the computational domain at all times.

The computational module for numerically evaluating the polarization field is conceptually similar to solving for a concentration field governed by an advection-reaction-diffusion equation using particles and meshes. In the case of advection-reaction-diffusion, the diffusion and the reaction parts are evaluated on a mesh, and combined with the advection of particles [29,30,10,3].

                        . The polarization field, however, can be purely oscillatory and using the explicit Euler scheme to integrate Eq. (16) will result in an unstable numerical simulation. As an instance of an integration scheme that can be stable in purely oscillatory regimes, we use the fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme (RK4) [61,38] with the initial condition given by

                        . In order to remain consistent with the explicit Euler integration of Eq. (15), we let the velocity field, strain-rate tensor, and the vorticity tensor at the intermediate stages of RK4 be equal to that at time

                        . The polarization field, however, changes at the intermediate stages of RK4. This requires recomputation of the material derivative (right hand side of Eq. (16)) at intermediate integration stages. We perform this computation on the nodes of

                         by accounting for the boundary condition of the polarization field. This computation requires recomputing

                            kernel is two-sided (symmetric) and for nodes that are within two mesh nodes of the boundary, the kernel does not have the necessary support domain. This leads to incorrect interpolation at these nodes. In order to faithfully interpolate polarization from particles to mesh nodes near the boundary, we impose polarization boundary conditions on the mesh

                            (Eq. (8)). We numerically compute these derivatives with a second-order accurate spatial discretization. We compute the simple second derivatives according to the three-point central finite-difference stencil for all (interior) nodes that are not at the boundary. For boundary nodes, we use a second-order one-sided four-point finite-difference stencil to compute the simple second derivatives. We compute the mixed derivatives by applying the first-order partial derivative in one direction followed by the first-order partial derivative in the other direction. We compute first-order derivatives on the nodes using a two-point second-order central finite-difference stencil for all interior nodes. For the nodes at the boundary, we compute the first-order partial derivatives using a second-order three-point one-sided finite-difference stencil.

                         (Eqs. (1) and (2)). We discretize Eq. (1) on the internal nodes of

                         and evaluate all terms in the equation using a second-order central finite-difference for all differential operators. On the boundary nodes we evaluate a one-sided second-order finite-difference scheme to enforce Robin boundary condition for the velocity component normal to the boundary. We use the ghost nodes and central second-order finite differences to enforce the Robin boundary condition for the velocity component tangential to the boundary. We use the ghost nodes to enforce the stress-free boundary condition using central second-order finite differences. Similarly, we discretize Eq. (2) on the nodes of

The accuracy of the hybrid particle-mesh method is dictated by the numerical error of the time integration scheme used to compute the polarization field on particles, the numerical error in remeshing the polarization field from particles to mesh nodes, and the numerical error of discretizing differential operators on the meshes

The remeshing from particles to mesh nodes is second-order accurate. This is mediated by the accuracy of imposing polarization boundary conditions on the mesh using ghost particles. The numerical error of remeshing using the

We validate the hybrid particle-mesh method by studying its consistency and convergence on two test problems. On a test problem for which the analytical solutions of

A consistent numerical method, however, does not guarantee convergence of the numerical solution towards the correct solution of Eqs. (1), (2), (9), (10) and (11) upon increasing spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation. We demonstrate convergence of the numerical solution to the analytical solution at steady state on a second test problem where the steady-state analytical solutions of

In summary, the present hybrid particle-mesh method is consistent and converges to the analytical solution. Consequently, we conclude that the method is numerically stable. The error in the numerical solution decreases according to the theoretical error bounds (see Section 3.3).

                         is less than 1 [11,9]. The Lagrangian CFL condition ensures that pathlines of particles do not intersect and is potentially less restrictive on δt. Here, we demonstrate the numerical accuracy of our hybrid particle-mesh method for CFL numbers larger than 1.

                        . These time steps correspond to median CFL numbers of 0.32733 and 26.1866 respectively, where the median is computed across time steps. The corresponding median of the Lagrangian CFL numbers are 0.011354 and 0.90838, respectively. We observe that the steady-state polarization field at CFL number much larger than 1 agrees with the polarization field obtained using CFL number smaller than 1 (see Fig. 9). This shows that the hybrid particle-mesh method is accurate at CFL numbers larger than 1, thereby relaxing the constraint on δt. The CFL condition becomes more stringent with increasing number of mesh nodes

                         making the hybrid particle-mesh method more attractive for simulations with high spatial resolution.

In summary, the hybrid particle-mesh method potentially allows for time steps larger than those prescribed by the CFL condition. This potentially reduces the number of integration time steps and therefore the overall computational cost of simulating the dynamics of active polar viscous gels. When the CFL condition is fulfilled, or when the polarization dynamics is not advection dominated, the computational cost of our hybrid particle-mesh method becomes identical with that of a stable finite difference scheme.

We report results from computational experiments on incompressible active polar viscous gels in rectangular geometries using the present hybrid particle-mesh method. The method enables simulations of the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics of simple fluids, of passive liquid crystal flows [65,39,1,2,14], and finally, of active polar viscous gels. Here, we present numerical results of the time-evolution of the polarization and velocity fields in a passive liquid crystal [1,2], in an active polar film [33,32], and in active polar viscous gels with topological defects in the polarization field [33,36].

                        , Eqs. (1), (2), (9), (10), and (11) are independent of ζ and λ, as these coefficients couple the activity (or energy consumption) measured by Δμ to the dynamics of the velocity and polarization fields, respectively.

                        , the system is at steady state and the orientation of the polarization field is approximately 2.55 radians (or 146°). This direction of alignment is governed by the initial polarization field. Due to lack of gradients in the steady-state polarization field, we observe that the steady-state velocity field is zero (Fig. 10(f)).

We show numerical simulation results of an active polar viscous gel of certain thickness with periodic boundary conditions in the other dimension. Such an active polar film is a model for in vitro actomyosin films and in vivo cortical actomyosin meshworks in biological cells [33,32].

The polarization, however, is non-homogeneous along the y-direction and therefore the gradient of the polarization field is non-zero (see Figs. 11(a)–11(c)). The velocity field is also invariant along the x-direction, and the y-component of the velocity field is zero (see Figs. 11(d)–11(f)). Importantly, the velocity field at steady state is non-zero (see Fig. 11(f)). This non-zero steady-state flow is mediated by gradients in the steady-state polarization field, which in turn is imposed by the polarization boundary condition.

We next show a case of steady-state flow in active polar films due to gradients in the polarization field emerging spontaneously only when the ratio of activity Δμ to a critical activity

                         relaxes to approximately 0.983 radians (or 56.3°) at steady state (Figs. 13(a)–13(c)). The gradient in the polarization field is, therefore, non-zero in the y-direction (see Fig. 13(c)). Consequently, the velocity field at steady state is non-zero (see Fig. 13(f)). This shows activity Δμ larger than the critical value

                         induces gradients in the polarization field leading to non-zero flow velocities.

We present simulation results of the dynamics of Eqs. (1), (2), (9), (10), and (11) in the presence of topological defects in the polarization field. At the topological defects, the polarization field is not defined (
                           |

                        ) and the gradient of the polarization field diverges. Such a point defect could be the center of an aster, a spiral, or a vortex. In an aster, the polarization field at each point is oriented along the line connecting the point with the defect. In a vortex, the polarization field at each point is orthogonal to the line connecting the point with the defect. Defects with any other constant orientation between the polarization field at each point and the line connecting the defect with that point are referred to as a spiral defects [33,36].

In order to avoid a diverging gradient in the polarization field at the defect location, we smooth (regularize) the magnitude of the polarization field so that it increases smoothly to 1 over a distance of approximately 3 units from the defect. At the boundaries, we impose the velocities and the normal derivative of the polarization field to be zero. We set

                         and 0.5, respectively. For both values of Δμ, we observe a circular flow profile centered at the defect location (Figs. 14(d)–14(f) and Figs. 15(d)–15(f)) with the maximum kinetic energy density being approximately 50 times smaller at 
                           t

                         (Figs. 14(f) and 15(f)). The spiral character of the initial polarization field persists over time when 
                           Δ
                           μ
                           =
                           1.5
                         (see Figs. 14(a)–14(c)). For the smaller 
                           Δ
                           μ
                           =
                           0.5
                        , the same initial polarization field gets transformed to an aster over time (see Figs. 15(a)–15(c)). This shows that tuning the activity Δμ can change a spiral defect to an aster defect.

We now switch the initial polarization field to an aster (Fig. 16
                        (a)) and perform simulations retaining all other settings. Figs. 16 and 17
                         show the polarization and velocity fields at 
                           t

                           Δ

                           0.5
                         and 1.5, respectively. For 
                           Δ
                           μ
                           =
                           0.5
                        , we observe that the aster defect persists over time (see Figs. 16(a)–16(c)). The corresponding velocity field (see Figs. 16(d)–16(f)) shows a pattern consisting of 8 vortices. The centers of these vortices form a octahedron whose centroid coincides with the defect. In addition, the flow at neighboring vertices of the octahedron is in opposite directions. For the larger 
                           Δ
                           μ
                           =
                           1.5
                        , we observe that the aster defect is transformed into a spiral defect over time (see Figs. 17(a)–17(c)). The corresponding velocity field is also transformed from a pattern consisting of 8 local vortices organized along an octahedron to a single large vortex centered at the defect (see Figs. 17(d)–17(f)). This observation shows that Δμ can change an aster to a spiral defect. Such transformations of topological defects, for instance from a spiral to an aster or vice versa, have been predicted using linear perturbation analysis of the hydrodynamic equations [36]. Experimentally, such transformations have been observed in in vitro microtubule dynamics [49,66,67]. In these experiments, modulating Δμ by changing the concentration of motor proteins induced a change in the overall filament orientations from a spiral to an aster configuration and vice versa [49,66,67]. This is the first time such topological transitions are confirmed in a numerical simulations of the macroscopic governing equations of active polar viscous gels.

We have presented an algorithm to solve the macroscopic governing hydrodynamic equations of incompressible active polar viscous gels [37,33,32,41] in two-dimensional rectangular domains using a hybrid particle-mesh method. The method is a hybrid of Lagrangian particles and staggered finite-difference meshes. Combining the superior numerical stability of Lagrangian particle methods for flow-dominated problems with the simplicity of discretizing differential operators on staggered Cartesian meshes, we numerically solve the equations of active polar viscous gels. As the main novelty, the numerical method uses an analytically derived Lagrange multiplier to impose constant magnitude of the polarization field that is consistent with the physics of active polar viscous gels. We use particles to transport the polarization field so that the advection is not restricted by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. Staggered finite differences are used to exactly impose incompressibility, and a direct solver to obtain the exact solution of the resulting linear system of equations. Remeshing of the polarization field from particles to mesh nodes is performed using a moment-conserving interpolation kernel preserving the constant magnitude of the polarization field. Using these ingredients, we developed a novel conservative numerical method to accurately solve the hydrodynamic equations of incompressible active polar viscous gels.

We have validated the hybrid particle-mesh method on two test problems. On one test problem, where the analytical solution is not known, we showed that the numerical error of the method decreases with increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation. On another test problem, where the analytical solution can be computed, we showed that the numerical solution converges to the correct analytical solution with increasing spatial and temporal resolution of the simulation. Specifically, we showed that the numerical error decreases by a factor of four upon doubling the number of mesh nodes in each direction and decreases by a factor of two upon halving the time-step size. These observations demonstrate that the presented hybrid particle-mesh method is consistent and converges to the correct solution of the underlying governing equations. Further, we demonstrated that the presented hybrid particle-mesh method is stable and converges to the correct solution even for CFL numbers much larger than 1 making the method advantageous especially for advection dominated dynamics.

Using the present hybrid particle-mesh method, we have performed computational experiments on a few instances of active polar viscous gels. Setting the energy consumption or the activity of the gel to zero, we simulated the hydrodynamics of passive liquid crystals using the same method. Using active polar films, which are a model system for cortical actomyosin layers in biological cells [33,32,72], we demonstrated the Fréedericksz transition [33,72,42] when the activity is larger than a critical value. At supra-critical activities, we showed the emergence of non-zero gradients in the steady-state polarization field. As a result we observed a non-zero velocity field. In active polar viscous gels with defects in the polarization field, we showed the transition from a spiral to an aster defect, and vice versa, by tuning the activity of the gel as observed in in vitro experiments on microtubule dynamics [49,66,67].

The present hybrid particle-mesh method has several limitations. The method is limited to two-dimensional rectangular domains and has a computational cost proportional to the total number of mesh nodes to the power 
                        
                           3
                           2
                        
                     . Even though extending the method to three-dimensional geometries is straightforward, the scaling of the computational cost might prohibit efficient simulations in three dimensions. The computational cost of the method may, however, be reduced by using iterative linear solvers at the expense of numerical accuracy. For complex geometries, discretizing differential operators using simple finite difference schemes is problematic. This limitation can be addressed by using generalized finite-difference schemes, like discretization-corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE) operators [64,59]. In addition, the current time integration scheme is explicit and is therefore only conditionally stable. Using an implicit integration scheme can alleviate this limitation at the expense of larger computational cost. Future work will involve relaxing these limitations, leading to a robust hybrid particle-mesh method for simulating active polar viscous gels in complex three dimensional geometries. Additional future extension of the present method include coupling the local activity of active gels to concentration of chemicals that are advected by the flow velocity of the gel, diffuse, and undergo reactions that are deterministic or stochastic depending on the population of the chemicals [37,33,68,3,53,55–57,54].

The theory of active polar viscous gels offers a framework for simulating active matter like migrating cells and cytoskeletal meshworks. The theory, in general, provides a basis for modeling active mechanochemical processes that are crucial to biological morphogenesis [31,5,27]. We envision an important role for computer simulations of such active mechanochemical processes in understanding complex phenomena in developmental biology.

                      ensures that the amplitude of the polarization field does not fluctuate over time. In other words, if the initial polarization field at 
                        t
                        =
                        0
                      has a magnitude of 1 everywhere, the polarization field at all subsequent times will have a magnitude of 1.
