                  This paper investigates the effect of information updating on the members of a two-stage supply chain in the presence of spot market. The supplier decides the contract price. New information becomes available as time progresses. The manufacturer updates his belief on demand and/or spot price and subsequently decides the contract quantity. The demand and spot price are correlated. Thus, the new demand information also updates the belief on the spot price, and vice versa. We model the problem with an information updating Stackelberg game and derive unique equilibrium strategies. Previous studies have considered only the demand information and concluded that improved demand information always benefits the supplier. By contrast, we demonstrate that improved demand information benefits both the supplier and manufacturer if the correlation coefficient between the two uncertainties has a small positive value and benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier otherwise. Moreover, superior spot price information benefits only the manufacturer and always hurts the supplier. Surprisingly, superior information fails to improve the performance of the supply chain and only changes the allocation of the profits between the supplier and manufacturer. Our findings likewise provide insights into when the supplier intends to use the contract channel and which type of information updating facility or expertise to invest in if a choice must be made.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Information updating facilitates decision making. Accurate demand information can improve pricing strategy and inventory management. The popularity of spot markets has prompted firms to focus both on the end customer demand uncertainty and the spot price volatility of intermediate goods (e.g., raw material). Accurate information on the spot price is important for firms to manage their procurement costs. Firms collect data not only to forecast demand but also commodity price, and various methods have been explored (Anderson, Kellogg, Sallee, & Curtin, 2011; Chen, Rogoff, & Rossi, 2010). The accuracy of the information on the spot price and/or end customer demand also affects the strategies and profitability of the upstream supplier, as well as the entire supply chain.

We investigate an information updating Stackelberg game that involves both demand and spot price information. Specifically, we consider a supply chain that consists of a risk-neutral supplier and a risk-averse manufacturer, which is a simplified situation but reasonably approximates several commodity industries. For instance, the degree of market concentration in the Asian monoethylene glycol (MEG) industry is relatively high due to significant investment and strict environment requests. The suppliers, such as MEGlobal, SINOPEC, and Shell, are large companies that are often publicly listed and can smooth out their profit variabilities. These companies can be considered risk neutral in this supplier–manufacturer game. As raw material suppliers, the companies usually provide forward contracts for their products monthly or quarterly, and the single-price (wholesale) contract is popularly used. The downstream markets are less concentrative than upstream ones and have many medium-sized manufacturers who use MEG to produce different types of products such as polyester fibers, polyethylene terephthalate resins, antifreeze formulations and other fine chemical products. Compared with their suppliers, these manufacturers are private and have relatively weaker capability to deal with risk uncertainties, and are thus considered as risk averse (Chod & Lyandres, 2011). The supplier usually decides on her contract prices several weeks before the targeted sales season, and the downstream manufacturers are required to submit the order (contract) quantity before the targeted sales season. For instance, MEGlobal usually adjusts its Asian contract price (ACP) monthly, and announces the ACP for the targeted month two or three weeks earlier.

                        Detailed information can be found in www.315.com.cn and www.fibre2fashion.com/news/company-news/meglobal/.
                      To illustrate, Table 1
                     
                      provides the ACP of MEGlobal in 2013. As the Stackelberg follower, the manufacturer typically processes more updated information when making his decision than the supplier who determines the pricing strategy earlier than the manufacturer. Moreover, the downstream firm is risk averse and has an incentive to acquire both demand and price information to control risk exposure. We use “information updating” or “forecasting” in this paper to describe information acquisition. We note that new information can be obtained as time passes even without sophisticated forecasting systems.

In addition to contract transactions, the online spot market likewise plays an important role in the Asian MEG industry. The spot market has accounted for 30 percent of the total MEG transactions in Asia, and this proportion continues to increase as the popularity of online trading grows. For instance, BOCE (www.boce.cn) is a leading online spot market in China for trading MEG. As transactions are completed online, the overhead expenses are reduced dramatically, and BOCE has attracted more than 10,000 regular market participants by 2013. Fig. 1 plots the spot price of MEG in BOCE in 2013.

Based on the preceding observations, this paper aims to understand the following important questions: (1) How does the accuracy of the demand or spot price information of a manufacturer affect the channel choice between the forward contract and spot market; for instance, does more accurate information induce a tendency of forward contract or spot sale? (2) How does the information-updating accuracy of a manufacturer affect the performances of the supplier, manufacturer, and the entire supply chain? Is a better demand/spot price information always preferred? (3) Which type of information updating is preferred by the manufacturer and supplier, information on demand or spot price? Will an agreement be achieved between the manufacturer and the supplier?

We provide the analysis with a general model framework in which the manufacturer conducts both demand and price information updating (BF). To separate the effects of these two types of information updating, we consider two special cases, namely, demand information updating (DF) and spot price information updating (SF). In the case of DF, the manufacturer may have the capability for obtaining better and more precise demand information. This scenario may represent a setting in which the manufacturer pays more attention to the demand side and sales, and this manufacturer is of the revenue-care type. In the case of SF, the manufacturer pays more attention to material procurement cost and can obtain better and more precise spot price information. This scenario may represent the setting in which the manufacturer is more concerned about its supply and procurement costs than demand and sales, and this manufacturer is of the cost-care type.

We use the property of bivariate normal distribution to derive the information updating from two random variables and solve the unique equilibrium strategies for the Stackelberg game. We subsequently obtain the condition under which the supplier intends to sell via forward contract. The contract price charged by the supplier always decreases with the spot price information accuracy but may either increase or decrease with the demand information accuracy. We further demonstrate that superior demand information benefits both the supplier and manufacturer if the correlation coefficient between the demand and spot price is small but hurts the supplier otherwise. This finding implies an effect of information different from that of previous studies that only consider demand information updating. Information updating on the spot price always benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier. Surprisingly, neither accurate demand nor spot price information improves the overall performance of the entire supply chain. When a choice has to be made between the two types of information updating, we determine that a more risk-averse manufacturer will prefer to forecast the demand, which is preferred by the supplier, when the spot price volatility is relatively large and the demand volatility is not. However, a less risk-averse manufacturer prefers to acquire the spot price information, whereas the supplier selects the demand information. When the demand uncertainty dominates the spot price uncertainty, the manufacturer always prefers the demand forecast regardless of risk attitude. An agreement in information preference between the players is achieved only when the manufacturer is less risk averse.

Considerable research has examined the effect of demand information updating on supply chains. However, the effect of spot price information updating has been ignored by researchers, let alone its effect when the two sources of information interact, although firms acquire and use both types of information in practice. Considering the other side of the story allows us to completely understand the pros and cons of information updating for supply chains. For instance, when the two sources of uncertainty are positively correlated, improved demand information actually hurts the supplier, which diverges with the common belief that more accurate demand information of the manufacturer benefits the supplier. Our unique model formulation enables us to provide suggestions to managers on when to improve demand or spot price information updating accuracies. We can recommend a type of information updating facility in which they should invest if a choice must be made.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related literature. In Section 3, we present the model and describe the information updating process. In Section 4, we solve the equilibrium of the information updating Stackelberg game. In Section 5, we analyze and compare the effects of forecast accuracies on decisions and performances. Finally, we offer concluding remarks and opportunities for future research. We provide proofs and the extension of the model in Appendices A–C.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our paper relates to two streams of research, namely, (1) the use of updated information to improve supply chain decisions and (2) the effect of the spot market on supply chain management.

The first stream of research on supply chain management in which superior demand information is used to improve buying decisions is quite extensive. Iyer and Bergen (1997) study a two-stage supply chain in which the wholesale price is exogenous and the retailer can adjust orders based on better demand information. Lau and Lau (2001) and Lariviere and Porteus (2001) consider price-setting suppliers and demonstrate that better demand information benefits the supplier and the supply chain but not necessarily the retailer. Taylor and Xiao (2010) explore the optimal procurement contract and indicate that if the retailer is a good forecaster, the manufacturer can benefit from the improved demand forecast. In the model of Miyaoka and Hausman (2008), the price-setting supplier likewise builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved demand information. Their study indicates that when the demand information accuracy increases to a certain level, the expected profits of the supplier and supply chain are better than those with worthless information. Fu and Zhu (2010) investigate the amount of additional demand information the buyer should acquire by hiring experts prior to placing an order with the supplier. Özer, Uncu, and Wei (2007) consider a supply chain in which a manufacturer sells to a retailer with dual purchase opportunities and can optimally place its order after observing the forecast update. Ferguson (2003), Ferguson, DeCroix, and Zipkin (2005), and Taylor (2006) examine the issue of sale timing in a two-firm supply chain with asymmetric demand information. In contrast to our study, the previous ones disregard the effects of spot market, spot price uncertainty, and related factors on supply chains. We provide a detailed analysis on how considering spot price information asymmetry changes the dynamics as our model and results unfold.

The effects of the spot market on supply chain management have received considerable scholarly attention. Kleindorfer and Wu (2003) and Haksöz and Seshadri (2007) survey the early literature on supply contracting and spot market. Li and Kouvelis (1999) study the different contracts a buyer adopted when facing a volatile price but a deterministic demand. Seifert, Thonemann, and Hausman (2004), Martínez-de-Albéniz and Simchi-Levi (2005), and Xing, Wang, and Liu (2012) investigate how the presence of spot market affects the optimal procurement strategy of a risk-averse buyer. Dong and Liu (2007) analyze why the forward contract remains available in the presence of a spot market. In their model, the contract price and quantity are determined through Nash bargaining. Our paper falls in this stream of literature by considering the supply chain dynamics under both contract channel and spot market. However, we focus on how information updating affects the decisions and performances of the supplier and manufacturer.


                     Mendelson and Tunca (2007) focus on the effect of spot market on a supply chain in the presence of a closed spot market, where the number of players is limited and the spot price is endogenously determined. The supplier has private information on costs, and buyers can update their beliefs regarding consumer demand. Based on this asymmetric information, the players then trade on the closed spot market to adjust the quantities they had committed in the first period. This paper differs from our paper in two significant aspects. First, we consider an open spot market with an exogenous stochastic spot price, in which all traders are price takers. Second, we capture the correlation between two stochastic variables that commonly influence supply chain decisions and performances, namely, spot price and market demand. Gümüs, Ray, and Gurnani (2012) introduce a model of a supply chain that consists of one buyer, one reliable supplier, and one unreliable supplier. They examine the underlying motivation for the unreliable supplier to offer a price and quantity guarantee contract, as well as its effect on the supply chain performance. Zhang, Zhou, and Liu (2014) consider the information asymmetry of production efficiency and compare five types of contract commonly used by firms to procure raw materials with price volatility. They further consider the effect of information asymmetry of raw material price under a rational contract scenario, but they disregard the demand uncertainty. Secomandi and Kekre (2009) analyze the procurement decision over multiple periods for a buyer who can update demand and forward price information. By contrast, we investigate how the accuracies of demand and spot price information updating affect the strategies and performances of the supply chain members in a Stackelberg game setting. We also compare the impacts of the two types of information updating (demand and spot price) on the decisions and performances of the players.

Consider a decentralized supply chain that consists of a risk-neutral supplier (she) and a risk-averse manufacturer (he) with a fully liquid spot market. The supplier sells an intermediate good via forward contract to the manufacturer, who uses the good as a one-to-one input to produce a final product and sells it to end consumers. In addition to trading with forward contract, both the supplier and the manufacturer can also trade the intermediate good in the spot market as well. Fig. 2
                      illustrates our description on the sequence of events and decisions.

                     . We assume the variance values are relatively smaller than the deterministic values, rending the probabilities of negative demand and spot price negligible (Miyaoka & Hausman, 2008). Moreover, ε
                        d
                      and ε
                        s
                      are correlated with a nonnegative correlation coefficient ρ ∈ [0, 1). When the demand of a product or product category increases, the spot price of the corresponding raw materials typically increases. For instance, the price of MEG dashed down in the second half of 2008 due to the sluggish demand caused by the financial crisis in Asia. Thus, the demand and spot price variables are commonly assumed to be positively correlated (see Seifert et al., 2004 and the reference therein). For completeness, we will briefly describe the results when ρ < 0 in Appendix A, and all of our key results are robust. The normal distribution is commonly used in the literature that considers the demand uncertainty and/or spot price volatility (e.g., Boyabath, Kleindorfer, & Koontz, 2011; Seifert et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014). It is also widely adopted to describe the process of information updating (e.g., Fu & Zhu, 2010; Miyaoka & Hausman, 2008). The popularity of normal distribution in research and practice rests on the fact that it plays the role as approximate sampling distribution for many statistics and that it is mathematically tractable (Johnson & Wichern, 2007).

We assume the selling price of the final product, p, is exogenous. Usually, firms keep a relative stable selling price of their product to maintain customer goodwill and reduce menu cost. This assumption is also adopted by Seifert et al. (2004) and Kleindorfer (2009). The supplier decides the contract price w at time T
                     0. Moreover, both players know that the manufacturer will update his information at time T
                     1.

At time T
                     1, the manufacturer obtains new information about the unknown demand ε
                        d
                      and/or the unknown spot price ε
                        s
                     , updates his beliefs on the demand and/or the spot price, and submits order q to the supplier.

At time T
                     2, the random demand and spot price are realized, and spot trading begins. Both the supplier and the manufacturer can trade for the intermediate good in the spot market.

When the manufacturer updates information on both the demand (ε

                      and spot price ε
                        s
                      are fixed and that the levels of forecast noises ε1 and ε2 (as captured by σ
                     1 and σ
                     2) vary, which affects the forecast accuracies (Taylor & Xiao, 2010).

To simplify the following analysis, we define the demand-price conversion factor and price-demand conversion factor as β ≡ ρσs
                     /σd
                      and λ ≡ ρσd
                     /σs
                     , respectively. The larger the β, the larger correlation is and/or a more volatile the spot price becomes. The larger the λ, the larger the correlation is and/or a more volatile the demand becomes. We derive the posterior distributions in the following lemma with the properties of the multivariate normal distribution:

                           The posterior demand and spot price distributions under BF situation (given Fd and Fs
                           ) remain bivariate normally distributed.

                      and Fs

                      (Fs

                      the demand information updating fails to provide new information to update the belief on the spot price in the DF case. Similarly, new information on the spot price does not affect the belief on the final product demand in SF either.

                     A similar formula was used by Seifert et al. (2004) and Dong and Liu (2007). The manufacturer likewise needs to limit risk exposure while maximizing profit. We use the mean–variance method to measure risk aversion. This method is commonly used in the literature on operations management when considering the effect of spot market (e.g., Dong & Liu, 2007; Martínez-de-Albéniz & Simchi-Levi, 2005; Seifert et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014). Let k measure the risk attitude of the manufacturer and assume that k > 0. The manufacturing (processing) cost per unit for the final product is a constant. For simplicity, we assume that the cost per unit equals zero, and this assumption will not affect our analysis results. At time T

                     where Q is the capacity or production level of the supplier. We assume that the strategic decision variable for the supplier is contract price w, where capacity or production level Q is determined in advance. This assumption allows us to focus on the effect of information updating on the contract and procurement strategies of a supply chain. This consideration is appropriate when the capacity or production level of the supplier is a long-term decision and fixed for a certain period of time (Kleindorfer, 2009), which is consistent with our example. As previously discussed, the supplier is assumed to be risk-neutral and will set the contract price w at T
                     0 to maximize his expected profit, that is, max 
                        w
                     
                     E[πs
                     ]. Even if the supplier obtains improved information at time T
                     1 similar to the manufacturer, the new information will be futile for the pricing decision made at time T
                     0. The asymmetric market information between the supplier and the manufacturer exists because of the nature of the Stackelberg game, as articulated by the MEG example in Section 1.

The expected profit margin for the manufacturer is denoted as 
                        
                           γ
                           ≡
                           p
                           −
                           
                              μ
                              s
                           
                        
                      if he only procures from the spot market. Assume that γ > 0 as the price of the final product should be more than the expected spot price of the intermediate good. We likewise use CV
                        d
                      ≡ σd
                     /μd
                      and CV
                        s
                      ≡ σs
                     /γ to measure the demand uncertainty and the spot price volatility, respectively. The latter also represents the coefficient of variation for the profit margin uncertainty buying from the spot market.

As the Stackelberg leader selling the intermediate, the supplier is unable to buy the intermediate good via the forward contract from the manufacturer and later sells it in the spot market. Therefore, the order quantity should be no less than 0, that is, q
                     * ≥ 0. This assumption is relatively different from the Nash bargaining framework used by Dong and Liu (2007). When the manufacturer adopts the contract procurement, that is, q
                     * > 0, based on the expected customer demand μd
                     , he has to readjust his order quantity according to several considerations. The second term in (4), E[ɛ
                        d
                     |BF], is the adjusted quantity according to his new belief on the demand and spot price. From Lemma 1, we know that the manufacturer will intend to increase his order quantity if he believes that the customer demand and spot price will be high. On the one hand, the manufacturer needs an additional order quantity to meet the perceived higher demand. On the other hand, the forward procurement seems better for him because he believes that the spot price will be higher. The third term represents the strategic quantity, which reflects two different functions of the spot market. When the preserved spot price of the manufacturer is larger than the contract price, that is,

                      the manufacturer intentionally “under-orders” and prepares to obtain the shortfall from the spot market to satisfy the additional demand. In this case, the spot market serves as the secondary procurement source for the manufacturer. The final term is the hedging quantity that is used to protect the manufacturer from customer demand uncertainty. This term is negative when γ > E[ɛ
                        s
                     |BF] because ρ > 0, which implies that the manufacturer will take a short position (i.e., reduce his contract quantity) to hedge against his demand uncertainty. As expected, the correlation coefficient plays an important role in this term through λ. The stronger the correlation ρ, the larger hedging quantity the manufacturer trades. When 
                        
                           ρ

                      the hedging function of the spot market vanishes.

                      represents the strategic effect of the forward contract, whereas the third term Cov(s, qu
                     ) is the risk caused by the uncertainties of both the spot price and order quantity, which directly hurts the supplier. To set an appropriate contract price, the supplier should have several considerations. First, the supplier knows that the expected profit should be greater than μsQ. Otherwise, the supplier selects only the spot sale.

                        We assume that if the supplier achieves the same expected profit in the contract channel and in the spot market separately, she prefers the spot sale because the transaction cost in online spot markets is relatively low (Grey, Olavson, & Shi, 2005).
                      Second, the supplier should set the contract price higher than the expected spot price and utilize the risk aversion of the manufacturer to achieve a higher profit. Therefore, at time T

When the supplier knows that the manufacturer is less risk averse, the supplier intends to avoid using the contract sale because she knows that a less risk-averse manufacturer is more likely to procure from the spot market. Furthermore, if the spot price volatility is relatively large and/or the demand uncertainty is relatively low, the condition

                     . Fig. 3 shows that the demand accuracy has less effect on the threshold kC
                     , but kC
                      increases sharply in the spot price accuracy. The greater the accuracy of the spot price, the less possibility the supplier will intend to sell through contract. These findings help the supplier arrange her channel strategy in advance.


                     Eq. (5) shows that the supplier will use the expected spot price μs
                      as a starting point and consider the information updating capability of the manufacturer to set an appropriate contract price. Therefore, we refer to the second term of the right hand side in (5) as information-adjusted price. As a
                     2 increases, w
                     * decreases and approaches μs
                      when a
                     2 approaches 1 because the spot market becomes less risky for the manufacturer as a supply source when the spot price accuracy improves and the manufacturer can procure from the spot market with a fixed price μs
                     , which forces the supplier to charge the same price in the contract channel.

In the middle part of (6), the second term is the expected strategic quantity, and the third term is the expected hedging quantity.

Market information asymmetry plays an important role in the supplier–manufacturer game. In this context, the following questions should be asked: How do the information updating accuracies affect the decisions and performances of the supply chain members in the presence of a spot market? Which information updating is better for the supplier or the manufacturer: the demand information or the spot price information? Our analysis focuses on the case in which the supplier adopts the contract sale, that is, the conditions in Proposition 2 are satisfied.

Previous studies (e.g., Lariviere & Porteus, 2001; Lau & Lau, 2001) have confirmed the following intuition: In a traditional supplier–manufacturer supply chain without spot market, the order quantity of the manufacturer will be less sensitive to the wholesale (contract) price if he has superior information about demand. Thus, the supplier will set a higher wholesale price to reap the benefit of information updating. With some variations, a similar result is reported by Miyaoka and Hausman (2008) and Taylor and Xiao (2010). In our setting with a spot market, the demand information updating of the manufacturer helps him obtain more information on spot price. Consequently, the manufacturer may shift a part of his procurement from the contract procurement to the (better known) spot market. Therefore, both strategic quantity and hedging quantity in (4) will be affected by the demand information accuracy and the pricing decision of the supplier.

                         the demand information updating is incapable of helping the manufacturer obtain any information to update his belief on the spot price. Thus, the supplier knows that the superior demand information does not influence the expected strategic quantity, and the hedging quantity is zero when 
                           
                              ρ

                         that is, unaffected by the superior demand information either. Anticipating this effect, the supplier does not adjust the contract price with the improved demand information accuracy.

When ρ > 0, the effect of the demand forecast accuracy on the contract price depends on the correlation coefficient, uncertainty levels, and the spot price forecast accuracy. The superior demand information reduces the perceived risks caused by the demand and spot price. The supplier knows that reduced risks cause two opposite effects on the expected ordering quantity of the manufacturer, which is expressed in (6). First, the manufacturer will under-order the strategic quantity and thus procure more from the spot market due to the reduced spot price volatility, and reduce his contract quantity. Second, the manufacturer needs less hedging quantity to protect him against the demand uncertainty due to the reduced demand uncertainty and thus will increase his contract quantity. When the demand uncertainty is relatively large and the correlation is relatively small, that is,

                        Corollary 1 helps compare our results with those of previous studies disregard the effect of the spot market. This result contributes the literature by indicating that with correlated stochastic spot price and demand, superior demand information increases the contract price if the demand uncertainty is relatively high, the spot price volatility is relative low, and they are less correlated; however, a more accurate demand information updating reduces the contract price otherwise. In the later situation, improved demand information reveals several aspects about the spot price information to the manufacturer, who can use this information against the supplier in selecting between contract channel and spot market, which in turn forces the supplier to reduce her contract price.

With the increase of a
                        2, the spot price volatility becomes lower for the manufacturer, and the spot procurement becomes attractive for the manufacturer due to the reduced risk. Anticipating this effect, the supplier has to reduce her contract price to lure the manufacturer to order more.

                        /2 as a
                        1 approaches 1. However, the effect of spot price forecast accuracy on the expected order quantity is different. When a
                        2 increases, the manufacturer tends to reduce his procurement via contract because the spot procurement improves. Anticipating this effect, the supplier reduces her contract price (Proposition 4) to attract more contract sales. These two opposite effects seem to offset each other, and thus leave the expected order quantity unaffected by a
                        2.

We also investigate the effects of updating information of demand and spot price on the performances of the supply chain members at time T
                        0. We introduce the following notations: EM is the expected profit of the manufacturer at time T

We consider the effect of demand accuracy by focusing on the DF case (i.e.,

                        ). When 
                           
                              ρ

                        Propositions 3 and 5 demonstrate that the pricing strategy of the supplier and the expected order quantity of the manufacturer are not affected by the demand accuracy. Thus, the expected profit of the supplier at time T
                        0 is independent of a
                        1 as well.

What is the effect of the demand information accuracy on the performance of the supplier with a positive correlation coefficient? To answer this question, we perform numerical experiments and illustrate the results using the following parameters:

                         and

                              =

                        . These parameters can guarantee that the supplier intends to use the contract sale for the range of ρ (Proposition 2 and Fig. 3). The subsequent observations and findings are generally true after extensive numerical experiments. We investigate the effect of a
                        1 under different values of correlation coefficient because the correlation coefficient plays an important role in the information updating game.

Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the effect of a
                        1 on the expected profit of the supplier is different with a different value of the correlation coefficient. If ρ is relatively small (i.e., less than 0.7 in our example, as shown in Fig. 4
                        (a)), the supplier can benefit from the superior demand information of the manufacturer. However, with a relatively high value of ρ, the supplier is hurt by the improved demand information of the manufacturer. Previous studies (e.g., Miyaoka & Hausman, 2008; Taylor & Xiao, 2010) have indicated that the superior demand information of the manufacturer benefits the supplier. Our finding contributes to this stream of literature that has disregarded to the spot price information. With high correlation values, improved demand information likewise reveals more valuable information on the spot price, which helps the manufacturer allocate the orders between the forward channel and spot market, and in turn damages the profit of the supplier.


                        Fig. 4 (b) shows that the performance of the manufacturer (EU) increases in a
                        1 for all of the values of ρ. Direct and indirect factors affect the performance of the manufacturer as a
                        1 increases. The superior demand information can directly reduce the variance of the profit of the manufacturer. The revealed information on the spot price can serve as a strategic tool in the reaction to the supplier, who is forced to charge a lower contract price, and thus improves the performance of the manufacturer. These effects seem to dominate the fact that the improved information accuracy of the manufacturer results in a more stingy contract, which works against the manufacturer, as reported by Lau and Lau (2001), Lariviere and Porteus (2001), Miyaoka and Hausman (2008), and Taylor and Xiao (2010). Considering the two sources of correlated information that is closely related to supply chain operations, as well as the risk attitude of the manufacturer, allows us to provide a valuable addition to the literature in explaining the effect of demand information. In summary, when ρ is relatively small, updating information on the demand can make both the supplier and the manufacturer better off. If ρ is sufficiently high, the superior demand information can benefit the manufacturer but hurt the supplier.

We subsequently investigate the effect of the spot price information accuracy on the performances of the supply chain members by focusing on the SF case (

                              2
                              .
                           


                        Fig. 5
                         shows that with the increase of a
                        2, the expected profit of the supplier decreases, but the expected utility of the manufacturer increases for the entire range of ρ. The spot price information updating affects the performances in two aspects. First, the spot procurement becomes better for the manufacturer due to the reduced risk. The manufacturer reduces the contract quantity and increases spot procurement quantity. Thus, the supplier has to reduce her contract price to attract the contract order of the manufacturer. Second, the superior information on the spot price likewise reduces the variance of demand, which directly benefits the manufacturer. Therefore, the manufacturer benefits from the superior spot price information, but the supplier does not.

What is the overall effect of information updating on the performance of the supply chain? This question might interest policy makers who can help nurture information updating operation in firms. We assume that the policy makers are concerned about the total supply chain profit, as commonly observed in the literature. We define

                              is independent of a

To determine why the entire supply chain is unaffected by the information updating, we compare our results with Lau and Lau (2001) and Lariviere and Porteus (2001). They report that the expected profit of the entire supply chain increases in the demand information accuracy because the superior information helps meet the demand and reduce the surplus cost. Taylor and Xiao (2010) and Miyaoka and Hausman (2008) similarly obtain this result but with some variations based on different models setups. However, the spot market is overlooked in their models. With the existence of a spot market, this advantage of information updating for the entire supply chain disappears. For the manufacturer, the demand is always satisfied either from the forward contract or the spot market. For the supplier, the entire capacity is always sold out by selling through either channel. The superior information affects the contract price and order quantity, but it only serves as a strategic tool for the entire supply chain for relocating the profit between the supplier and the manufacturer and is incapable of enlarging the pie.

To determine which information updating is better for the manufacturer or the supplier, we compare the two types of information updating. To achieve a fair comparison, we assume that

                              The supplier will not set the contract price in DF less than that in SF, and the price difference △w increases in a and decreases in ρ.
                           

This proposition may be attributed to the fact that the spot price information updating always increases the market power of the manufacturer in the forward-contract game, whereas the demand information updating does not. If the correlation coefficient is relatively small, the advantage of the superior spot price information on △w is significant because the demand information is unable to better update the price information than the forecast on spot price itself. As expected, the price difference △w approaches 0 as ρ approaches 1.

We subsequently compare the effect of the demand and spot price information on the performance of the supplier. Let us denote

                        Proposition 9 reveals that when the spot price volatility is sufficiently high and the correlation coefficient is relatively low, the supplier always prefers a manufacturer engaging demand information updating. However, when the demand uncertainty is sufficiently large and the correlation coefficient is relatively high, the threshold kT
                         assigns the manufacturers into two groups. The supplier would encourage a less risk-averse manufacturer (max {0, kC
                        } < k < kT
                        ) to forecast the demand, and a more risk-averse manufacturer (k ≥ kT
                        ) to forecast the spot price. If

                         > ρ is satisfied as well. With the increase of information accuracy, the supplier will set a higher contract price in the DF case (Corollary 1) and a lower contract price in the SF case (Proposition 4). The lower contract price in the SF case stimulates more forward contract for a more risk-averse manufacturer, who wants to preserve supplies from the contract channel, than in the DF case. This effect is the reason that the supplier prefers a more risk-averse manufacturer to forecast the spot price.

                         is likewise relatively easier to be satisfied with the increase of a. The supplier can charge a higher wholesale price in the DF case as expressed in (8), and the manufacturer is more capable of in information acquisition. Thus, the supplier prefers the demand information updating.

The manufacturer that selects demand information updating would face a higher contract price in the contract market. The spot price forecast seems to benefit the manufacturer. On the one hand, the spot price information reduces the price volatility and the variance of the profit of the manufacturer. On the other hand, the supplier is forced to reduce the contract price to induce the manufacturer to procure more via contract. Can we conclude that spot price information updating rather than demand information updating, is always preferred by the manufacturer? To answer this question, we plot

                        Fig. 6(a) shows that a less risk-averse manufacturer should select the spot price forecast rather than the demand forecast because this type of manufacturer is more risky and prefers to procure from the spot market. However, a more risk-averse manufacturer likewise prefers the demand forecast than the spot price forecast because he relies more on forward contract procurement. Better demand information updating facilitates a more accurate order through forward contract and is preferred more by the manufacturer. When the demand uncertainty is sufficiently high and the correlation coefficient is relatively high, that is,

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Online spot market has increasingly become a convenient sourcing channel for manufacturers. The volatile nature of spot price, along with the highly uncertain demand, has become an increasingly important factor that affects the decisions and performance of the manufacturer. Modeling the stochastic nature of spot price and demand and the asymmetric market information on the two uncertainties processed by the supply chain members allows this paper to provide unique contributions to the literature and practitioners through the following conclusions:

                        
                           (1)
                           The contract channel is always used along with the spot market when the spot price volatility is relatively high as compared to the demand volatility, the correlation between the two random variables is low, and the manufacturer is more risk-averse (Proposition 2). Moreover, demand information updating induces the supplier to more likely use the contract sale. However, the superior spot price information causes the supplier to become reluctant to sell through contract. These findings are helpful for the supplier to arrange her channel strategy in advance.

The supplier charges a higher contract price as the increase of the demand information accuracy of the manufacturer when the demand volatility is relatively high as compared to the spot price volatility, the correlation is low, and the spot price accuracy is high. Otherwise, the supplier will charge a lower contract price when the manufacturer improves his demand information accuracy (Proposition 3). However, the contract price always decreases as the capability of the manufacturer in spot price forecasting improves (Propositions 4). The expected order quantity of the manufacturer increases with the accuracy of demand information updating, but it is unaffected by the spot price information accuracy (Proposition 5). This finding helps managers adjust their operational and contracting strategies in responding to their market information.

With only demand information updating available, the improved information benefits both the supplier and the manufacturer if the correlation between the demand and the spot price has a small positive value. In this case, the players can achieve a Pareto improvement by advancing forecasting capacity. However, if the correlation coefficient is relatively large, the improved demand forecast benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier (Fig. 4). With only spot price updating available, accurate information always benefits the manufacturer but hurts the supplier (Fig. 5 and Proposition 6). A surprising insight for policy makers is that improved information on either type has no effect on the total expected supply chain profit (Proposition 7).

Comparing the two types of information updating, we find that the manufacturer always prefers the demand forecast when the demand volatility is relatively high as compared to the spot price volatility, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and the forecast capacity of the manufacturer is low. In this case, the supplier hopes a more risk-averse manufacturer to forecast the spot price and a less risk-averse manufacturer to acquire the demand information. When the demand volatility is relatively low as compared to the spot price volatility, the correlation coefficient is relatively low, and the forecast capacity of the manufacturer is high, the more risk-averse manufacturer selects the demand forecast, whereas a less risk-averse manufacturer prefers to acquire the spot price information, although the supplier always wants the manufacturer to acquire the demand information (Fig. 6 and Proposition 9). This finding provides a unique contribution to supply chain information literature that has focused on demand information. Moreover, by considering the spot price information and correlations between the two random variables, we provide managers with guidance on which type of information is more valuable under a specific situation.

In summary, this paper explores the supply chain behavior under asymmetric market information on both demand and spot price. We model the problem with an information updating Stackelberg game in which the supplier decides the contract price; as time progresses and new information becomes available, the manufacturer updates his beliefs on the demand and/or the spot price, and then decides the order quantity. Finally, the supplier and the manufacturer can trade in the spot market to sell the extra supply or buy for the unsatisfied demand. The correlation between the demand and spot price likewise allows updating the demand information to reveal some information on the spot price, and vice versa. We initially derive the posterior distributions of stochastic demand and spot price and then proceed with the equilibrium, strategy, and performance analyses. Several other extensions and avenues are possible for future research. Considering information sharing instead of asymmetric information between a supplier and a manufacturer in the presence of a spot market may be a valuable research direction. Extensions that include a competitive setting of either manufacturers or suppliers might be interesting to pursue as well.

We have focused on a nonnegative correlation coefficient in the analysis. For completeness, we provide a brief summary of the case with a negative correlation between the spot price and customer demand.

                        
                           (1)
                           We know from Proposition 2 that the supplier always uses forward contract sale if ρ < 0 because when the demand is high, the forward contract is used as a main source. When the demand is low, the manufacturer protects himself by selling in the spot market with a possible high price.

The negative correlation coefficient does not change the sensitivity analysis of the contract price with respect to the information accuracies in Section 5. Thus, the equilibrium contract price increases in the demand accuracy and decreases in the spot price accuracy. However, E[q
                              *] decreases with a
                              1 with a negative correlation.

Using the numerical data in Section 5, we find that the expected profit of the supplier decreases in the demand forecast accuracy, consistent with the results of Section 5.2, where ρ > 0 and relatively large.

We demonstrate that Proposition 8 still holds with a negative correlation coefficient.

From the proof of Proposition 9, we verify that Proposition 9 holds for a negative correlation coefficient if the threshold
