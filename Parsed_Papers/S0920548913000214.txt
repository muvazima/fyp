                  We propose an ontology-based approach to automated trust negotiation (ATN) to establish a common vocabulary for ATN across heterogeneous domains and show how ontologies can be used to specify and implement ATN systems. The components of the ATN framework are expressed in terms of a shared ontology and ontology inference techniques are used to perform ATN policy compliance checking. On this basis, a semantically relevant negotiation strategy (SRNS) is proposed that ensures the success of a negotiation whenever it is semantically possible. We analyze the properties of SRNS and evaluate the performance of the ontology-based ATN.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Automated trust negotiation (ATN) [1] is a promising approach to establishing mutual trust between two strangers who wish to share resources or conduct business transactions in a distributed environment. In the ATN framework, each negotiator establishes access control (AC) policies to regulate the disclosure of sensitive information to negotiation opponents. Trust is established by iterative disclosure of AC policies and credentials between negotiators. Automated trust negotiation has been thoroughly studied from both theoretical and practical perspectives in the last decade [2–6]. Many ATN systems have been proposed, using various notation systems to represent credentials and access control policies, such as role-based trust-management language (RT) [7], attribute-based trust negotiation language (ATNL) [8], PeerTrust [9], 
                        X
                     -TNL [10], and Cassandra [11]. However, the variety of ATN notations with different vocabularies and semantics negatively affect interoperability. In open distributed systems, negotiators usually belong to different security domains, and each domain may use a different vocabulary to denote attributes, credentials, and AC policies. Suppose two subjects A and B from security domains DA
                      and DB
                     , respectively, endeavor to establish trust. If the trust requirements within the policies of B cannot be understood by A, then A will not know how to satisfy them. On the other hand, if the attributes disclosed by A cannot be evaluated by B in DB
                     , B cannot determine whether to grant A the desired service. In this case, establishing trust between them is impossible. Negotiation over heterogeneous domains relies on semantic interoperability. One of the goals of this paper is to establish a common vocabulary of ATN across domains.

Semantic Web technologies and ontologies in particular provide the means to address this problem. The attributes, credentials, and AC policies of ATN systems can be given meaning through the use of ontologies. An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization [12]. More specifically, an ontology provides unambiguous and flexible meaning agreement on the semantics of concepts and their inter-relationships in a specific domain. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach to automated trust negotiation. We present an ATN ontology and show how ontologies can be used to implement the ATN system. Our ontology-based ATN has the following advantages.
                        
                           1.
                           Given an ontology that modeling the key entities and their relationships typically found in ATN, our proposed model has a higher degree of semantic interoperability compared to other ATN systems. By aligning different terms that might be used in different domains, negotiators reach a mutual understanding of the exchanged information.

The ontology-based ATN promotes the completeness of negotiation. Completeness is an important property of ATN, meaning that negotiations should succeed whenever possible [1]. In ATN, access control is based on attributes of negotiators, that are proven through disclosure of digital credentials. Unfortunately, ATN has been limited to syntactically identical attributes and their values for access control. In our model, ontologies provide semantics for attributes to make negotiations succeed by addressing semantically equivalent attributes. Besides the semantics of attributes in domain-specific ontologies, the ATN ontology defines the relationships between attributes formed by delegations, which means that having one attribute may imply having another attribute.

Ontology inference techniques can be used to perform the tasks of ATN policy compliance checking, which determines which credentials satisfy a policy and whether particular sets of credentials satisfy the relevant policy [13].

Negotiation strategies in ATN govern the exchange of credentials between negotiators in terms of policies. More specifically, negotiation strategies determine which credentials to disclose, when to disclose, and whether the negotiation succeeds or fails. Most previous strategies [14–16] determine relevant credentials of the eventual negotiation goal by syntax; that is, a credential C is related to resource R iff C appears in R's policy or C appears in the policy of a credential C′ that is relevant to R 
                     [17]. These strategies are not semantically complete because the negotiation may fail in some cases where it would succeed if the semantics of attributes were exploited. To address this issue, we propose a complete ATN strategy that determines the relevant credentials by semantics.

In this paper, we propose an ATN ontology that is an explicit and declarative representation of ATN components. The ATN ontology helps to establish a common understanding of ATN components across domains and facilitates the semantic interoperability among negotiators. As another major contribution, we propose a semantically relevant negotiation strategy (SRNS) that discloses credentials and policies that are semantically relevant to the negotiation goal. SRNS can find a set of credentials of a negotiator to satisfy a given policy, which may not be requested by the policy but can semantically imply those requested. By taking advantage of the semantics of attributes defined in ontologies, SRNS makes a negotiation succeed whenever possible. Furthermore, SRNS enforces the attribute acknowledgment policies (ACK policies) to protect information about sensitive attributes.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We begin with a discussion of the related work in Section 2 and provide an overview of automated trust negotiation with ACK policies in Section 3. The ontology-based ATN and the semantically relevant negotiation strategy are proposed in Section 4. The implementation and evaluation of our ontology-based ATN are presented in Section 5, and the comparison with different negotiation strategies is summarized in Section 6. We conclude the paper in Section 7.

Many ontology-based methods have been proposed to support access control systems. Finin et al. studied the relationship between the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and role-based access control (RBAC) model [18], putting forward two different ways to support RBAC in OWL. Priebe et al. presented an approach to simplifying the specification and maintenance of attribute-based access control policies by extending the attribute management with an ontology-based inference facility [19]. Formalizing and reasoning access control polices by the Description Logic (DL) has also been proposed multiple times in the literature. The DL representation of RBAC by Zhao et al. [20] modeled not only the core and hierarchical RBAC but also RBAC constraints, including the separation of duty and role cardinality. Their logical framework makes it possible to reason about RBAC and check the consistency of RBAC with constraints via a DL reasoner. However, these ontology-based access control models address the general authorization problem, that is, who is authorized to access what. Although automated trust negotiation is a form of access control, it has some features specific to open distributed systems that have not been covered by these ontology-based works. For example, both parties in ATN have policies. Instead of a one-shot authorization, trust is established incrementally through a sequence of bilateral credential disclosures.

Leithead et al. explored the use of ontologies in automated trust negotiation for the first time [21]. Ontologies are used to simplify the specification and management of trust negotiation policies. Moreover, ontologies offer additional protection for sensitive information. Nevertheless, ontologies are used only for providing supplemental information to trust negotiation agents. Our approach, however, models the ATN system with ontologies to build a common understanding among heterogeneous domains. Squicciarini et al. defined the relationships between credentials and attributes by ontologies to protect the privacy of negotiators [22]. These ontologies are used as a reference for negotiation policy languages. Based on these ontologies, two techniques are proposed to substitute the privacy-sensitive credentials and attributes with alternative ones. In a recent study [23], trust negotiation with reference ontologies is integrated with the management of virtual organization. Ontologies are used to provide clear semantics of the credentials employed during negotiation.

Ontologies have also been used as a powerful tool to model negotiation mechanisms in electronic commerce. In [24], the negotiation protocol is expressed as a shared ontology rather than being hard-coded in agents. By acquiring the negotiation ontology, agents need very little prior knowledge of the protocol. Ragone used OWL-DL to model a multi-issue bilateral negotiation [25]. Issues are expressed via an OWL ontology. By exploiting the inference services of ontologies, agents negotiate and reach an agreement. These negotiation ontologies are different from our work in that they were designed from the perspective of behavior, whereas our work defines ontologies for the components of ATN. Negotiation protocols are generated automatically from the ontologies, stimulating negotiation behavior among agents. Trust negotiation is a special type of negotiation in the context of e-business, where the behavior of agents is explicit.

To sum up, although there has been a large body of literature discussing the applications of ontology to access control, especially to trust negotiation, no ontology model for ATN that describes the formal semantics of ATN components has yet been defined. Our main concern is how to use an ontology of concepts along with their attributes and relationships to represent ATN. Furthermore, the existing works on exploiting ontologies in ATN focus on policy specification and controlled release of information from the perspective of one negotiator during a single round of a negotiation. The techniques of ontology-based ATN have never been thoroughly explored, including how to integrate the semantics of remote policies and the semantics of local credentials to make a negotiation succeed as far as possible and how to address the delegation of authority and prevent information leakage from inference on delegation. We study the integration of ontologies with the negotiation process, which is controlled by the negotiation strategy, and develop a complete negotiation strategy by consulting the ATN ontology.

In this section, we briefly introduce the formal framework of ATN. Here, we follow the formal definition developed in [26]. An ATN system supporting delegations is a 6-tuple

                     :
                        
                           •
                           
                              
                                 K
                               is a countable set of principals. We use K, sometimes with subscripts, to denote principals.


                              
                                 R
                               is a countable set of attributes. Each attribute 
                                 
                                    r
                                    ∈
                                    R
                                 
                               is identified by a pair containing an attribute authority (which is a principal) and an attribute name (which is a string over some standard alphabet). An attribute defines a set of principals that have this attribute.


                              
                                 E
                               is a countable set of credentials. Each credential proves that its subject has a finite, nonempty set of attributes. We use e for a member of 
                                 E
                               and E for a finite subset of 
                                 E
                              .


                              
                                 L
                               is a countable set of delegation credentials. In general, a delegation credential 
                                 
                                    l
                                    ∈
                                    L
                                 
                               asserts that an attribute implies another attribute.


                              Resource is a countable set of resources. Resources refer to credentials or services.


                              Policy denotes the set of positive propositional logical formulae in which the propositions are attributes in 
                                 R
                              . We use ψ to denote a policy and say that ψ is satisfied by a principal if the attributes that the principal possesses make the formula true.

Here, we adopt the syntactic constructs of role-based trust-management language (RT) [7] to illustrate the components of ATN. An attribute takes the form of a principal followed by an attribute name, separated by a dot, e.g., K.r. A credential e is a digitally signed type-1 statement of RT, K.r
                     ←
                     K
                     0, where K is the issuer and K
                     0 is the subject. A delegation credential is a digitally signed type-2 statement of RT, K.r
                     ←
                     K
                     1.r
                     1. If K
                     1 indicates that an entity has the attribute r
                     1, then K indicates that it has the attribute r. An attribute name can take parameters as r(p
                     1,p
                     2,…,p
                     
                        n
                     ), in which pj
                      is a descriptive property characterized by a name and a domain. The name of a parameter uniquely identifies it, and the domain gives the set of permitted values of that parameter. Each pj
                      has the form name
                     =
                     c or name: S where name is the name of a parameter, c is a constant, and S is a static value set. An attribute name with parameters provides a template for specifying a credential type that has a similar structure and collects the same attributes. For example, diploma(degree,year) is a parameterized attribute name with two parameters: degree, of integer type, and year, of date type.

Attribute acknowledgment policies (ACK policies) were proposed by Winsborough and Li [4]. ACK policies resemble access control policies except that they can be associated with attributes that the negotiator does not have. Ref. [26] proved that ATN with the enforcement of ACK policy can protect information about sensitive attributes. A participant in the ATN system enforcing ACK policies is characterized by a finite configuration G

                              Policy is a partial function mapping a finite subset of resources to policies. The resources in the preimage of AC
                              
                                 G
                               are those the participant has. Each resource has exactly one access control policy.

We introduce a scenario taken from [26] that we use throughout the paper as a running example. As depicted in Fig. 1
                     , a fictitious web publishing service involves principals from different security domains. EPub, a web publisher, and its parent organization EOrg are in security domain A. StateU, a university, RegistrarB, the registrar of one of StateU's campuses, and Alice, a student of StateU, are in security domain B. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) is in security domain C. EPub offers a special discount to preferred customers of EOrg. EOrg considers students of the university StateU to be preferred customers. StateU delegates the authority of identifying students to RegistrarB. RegistrarB then issues a credential to Alice stating that Alice is a student. Alice is cautious about whom she tells that she is a university student. Her ACK policy for this attribute requires the recipient of this information to be a member of BBB.

The architecture of ontology-based automated trust negotiation is shown in Fig. 2
                     . The high-level ATN ontology is a formal abstraction of ATN components that is shared and reused by negotiators. This ontology can also be used as a common vocabulary for nonsensitive attributes and delegations. The local ATN ontology of a negotiator includes the conceptual instances provided by the negotiator and the definition of credentials and delegation credentials private to the negotiator. Each negotiator has his domain-specific ontology that captures the features of the application domain.

Our ontology-based ATN uses the strategy-independent and language-independent trust negotiation protocol designed by Yu et al. [17] for TrustBuilder [27]. The semantically relevant negotiation strategy can thus interoperate with the variety of negotiation strategies supported by the TrustBuilder protocol.

We adopt the Description Logic (DL) 
                           
                              SHOIN
                              
                                 D
                              
                           
                         to formalize the ATN ontology. The policy compliance checking of ATN can be performed by the state-of-the-art DL reasoners. They can be reduced to inference services offered by DL reasoners, such as axiom pinpointing and instance checking. Most previous ATN systems have First-Order Logic (FOL) as the semantic foundation of access control policies. Compared with FOL, DL reasoning is decidable and 
                           
                              SHOIN
                              
                                 D
                              
                           
                         achieves a better tradeoff between the computational complexity and expressiveness. Furthermore 
                           
                              SHOIN
                              
                                 D
                              
                           
                         is formally aligned with Web Ontology Language (OWL) DL, which is a W3C standard for representing information on the Web. Therefore, the ATN ontology can be easily integrated with the existing contexts described by OWL language.

In the Description Logic, the domain of interest is modeled by individuals, concepts, and roles, denoting objects of the domain, unary predicates, and binary predicates, respectively. We use the symbols C, D to denote concepts; R, S to denote roles; and a, b to denote individuals. A knowledge base (KB) of DL is a pair 
                           
                              K
                              =
                              <
                              T
                              ,
                              A
                              >
                           
                        , where 
                           T
                        , called TBox, is a finite set of concept (role) inclusion axioms of the form C⊑D (R⊑S) or concept (role) equality axioms of the form C
                        ≡
                        D (R
                        ≡
                        S), while 
                           A
                        , called ABox, is a finite set of concept and role assertions of the form C(a) and R(a, b).

The basic concepts and their relations in the ATN ontology are shown in Fig. 3
                        . The alphabet of the ATN ontology includes the following atomic concepts and roles:
                           
                              -
                              
                                 Object denotes the root concept of all ATN objects.


                                 Resource and Principal represent the resources and individuals, respectively.


                                 Attribute is the root concept for all attributes. For an attribute name r
                                 1, there is a corresponding atomic concept named R
                                 1 in the ATN ontology. For attributes A.r
                                 1 and B.r
                                 1, the atomic concepts A_R
                                 1 and B_R
                                 1 are defined, respectively.


                                 Policy is the root concept of all ATN policies. ACPolicy, ACKPolicy, DisPolicy, and CertPolicy represent the top concept of access control policies, attribute disclosure policies, resource disclosure policies, and certificate disclosure policies, respectively.

For each resource disclosure policy, certificate disclosure policy, and attribute disclosure policy ψ, there is an atomic concept DisPolicy
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 , CertPolicy
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 , and ACKPolicy
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 , respectively.

The atomic role authority relates the member of Attribute to the member of Principal.

For each parameter p
                                 
                                    j
                                 , 1≤
                                 j
                                 ≤
                                 n of a parameterized attribute name r(p
                                 1,p
                                 2,…,p
                                 
                                    n
                                 ), there is an atomic role p
                                 
                                    j
                                  of R (the atomic concept corresponding to r) and the role p
                                 
                                    j
                                  has the restrictions corresponding to the constraints of parameter p
                                 
                                    j
                                 .

The TBox of the ATN ontology includes three categories of axioms: attribute definition axioms, policy definition axioms, and delegation axioms.

Attribute definition axioms have the following forms:

Delegation axioms express delegation credentials in ATN. For example, with K.r
                        ←
                        K
                        1.r
                        1, the delegation axiom has the form K
                        1_R
                        1⊑K_R, where K
                        1_R
                        1 and K_R are atomic concepts corresponding to the attribute K
                        1.r
                        1 and K.r.

The ABox of ATN ontology includes the assertional axioms for credentials. A credential is a digitally signed statement showing that a principal has certain attributes. There are several ways of expressing credentials in the Description Logic. To facilitate policy compliance checking, we consider credentials as axioms of ABox showing that a principal is a member of the concept corresponding to the attribute contained in a credential. For example, with respect to credential K.r
                        ←
                        K
                        0, the assertional axiom has the form K_R(K
                        0).

Because DL reasoners can explore the semantics of attributes defined in the ATN ontology, a policy can be satisfied by a set of credentials corresponding to more specialized attributes than those requested in the policy. For example, with respect to DisPolicy

The ATN ontology does not contain any specific instance. In fact, it represents the commonness of all ATN systems. For the example of the web publishing service given in Section 3, Fig. 4
                         portrays the knowledge bases of the ATN ontology.

We first define the semantically relevant credentials of the negotiation target. Then, the algorithm for semantically relevant negotiation strategy (SRNS), which discloses the unlocked semantically relevant credentials, is introduced. In the following description, we assume that 
                           
                              O

                         is the local ATN ontology of a negotiator

                         is the abstract ATN ontology shared and reused by negotiators, and 
                           
                              O
                              M
                           
                         is the knowledge disclosed in a sequence of ATN messages

                        . We use 
                           
                              CN

                         to denote the set of concept names occurring in the ontology 
                           O
                        .

To define the semantically relevant credential, we first give the definitions for the minimal semantic explanation of a policy and minimal semantic solution of a policy.

Intuitively, in our ATN model, any policy defined by a concept Policyψ
                            has semantics, which is the minimal semantic explanation of Policyψ
                           . For a negotiator 
                              P
                            who defines Policyψ
                           , the other negotiator Q can satisfy Policyψ
                            or any of its semantic inclusion C (

                                 Polic

                           . This will allow a successful negotiation even though Q does not have the attributes defined by Policyψ
                           . For instance, suppose 
                              P
                            has the following policies presented in RT [7] syntax: R

Computing all minimal semantic solutions of a policy is an extension to ATN policy compliance checking that finds all minimal sets of credentials that can be used to satisfy a given policy. Current policy compliance checkers support only the semantics of logical AND and OR operators defined in policy languages; the semantics of attributes in AC policies and credentials are not considered. To ensure the completeness of ATN, compliance checking should consult the semantics of attributes defined by both negotiators. The negotiator disclosing a policy computes the minimal semantic explanation of the policy, and the other negotiator receiving a policy computes the set of minimal semantic solutions of the policy.

Winsborough et al. [1] proposed some desirable properties of negotiation strategies. We prove below that these properties are satisfied by SRNS.
                           Theorem 1
                           Completeness


                           
                              SRNS can always find a successful negotiation if a successful negotiation exists.
                           

Specifically, SRNS is complete semantically. Therefore, SRNS can find a successful negotiation even when negotiators possess only the attributes that can imply those attributes requested semantically rather than the attributes requested.

                               so that negotiation opponent can satisfy any of these semantic inclusions to make a negotiation succeed.

By taking advantage of the semantics of attributes, it is possible for SRNS to make a negotiation succeed that would otherwise fail if the policies were satisfied only syntactically.


                              SRNS will terminate with failure when success is impossible.
                           

SRNS will terminate a negotiation when no new resource or policy is sent. As a result, semStrategy will return the failure message Ø and then terminate the negotiation.


                              SRNS can avoid disclosing any irrelevant credential that is not necessary for the negotiation to end successfully.
                           

In SRNS, all credentials disclosed are necessary to satisfy the disclosed policies in any semantically possible way. These credentials either are requested directly by the policies or can imply those requested and the credentials to verify the implications.

SRNS ensures that no irrelevant credential for a successful negotiation is disclosed.


                              In the worse case, the communication complexity of SRNS is O(m), where m is the total number of semantically relevant credentials of the negotiation target.
                           

The communication complexity of a negotiation strategy includes the total number of messages and the total size of messages. A message in SRNS includes requests of concepts for attributes or policies, and disclosures of axioms corresponding to semantically relevant credentials of the negotiation target. Because in the ATN ontology a concept for a policy must have a definition in terms of attributes, if each concept is requested only once then the number of requests is no more than the total number of attributes.

The number of requests of attributes is less than m because for each requested attribute at least one credential asserting this attribute should be disclosed. Suppose the size of concepts and axioms is bounded by a constant, then the worst case communication cost of SRNS is O(m).

To evaluate our proposal, we implemented a prototype. The architecture of our prototype implementation is depicted in Fig. 7
                     . Our implementation was developed using the Java programming language with JDK version 1.6 and runs within the TrustBuilder2 framework. TrustBuilder2 is an extensible trust negotiation framework, which allows developers to add new plug-ins to it without modifying the underlying code base. The semantically relevant negotiation strategy module is a plug-in of strategy modules of TrustBuilder2, and the DL reasoner is a plug-in of the policy compliance checkers of TrustBuilder2.

We used Pellet (version 2.3.0), a complete OWL-DL reasoner, as policy compliance checker. Actually, other DL reasoners can be plugged in and used as well. Our implementation leverages the inference services of Pellet, including the non-standard inferences, to efficiently conduct policy compliance checking. For example, axiom pinpointing is a service of Pellet providing justifications for any entailment derived from an OWL-DL KB. This service facilitates the computation of the minimal semantic solutions of policies. The experimental results in [27] show that the majority of the negotiation time is spent on the task of using the compliance checker (≈49%). Thus, our implementation of ATN inherits the computational complexity of DL reasoning. Automated reasonings in expressive Description Logic, such as 
                        
                           SHOIN
                           
                              D
                           
                        
                     , are known to have very high worst-case complexity, exponential with the size of the ontology. However, Pellet implements a suite of optimization techniques. These optimizations lead to a significant improvement in the performance of Pellet and have proved to be effective in a wide variety of realistic applications [28].

We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of our implementation and compare it to the original implementation of TrustBuilder2. The experiments were conducted on a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor PC with 2GB of memory running Microsoft Windows 7. The performance was measured in terms of CPU time (in seconds). All the timings presented are computed as the average of 10 independent runs. Table 1
                      reports the experimental results for the time of a successful negotiation with ATN ontologies of varying complexity and expressivity. The first line, named WebPub, is the ATN with only the knowledge of the web publishing service given in Section 3. The following lines are the ATNs with the ontology of the web publishing service in addition to some well-known OWL ontologies. Links to these ontologies can be found at the web page http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/performance. The results show that our implementation has a reasonable performance considering the knowledge size.

To compare the performance of our implementation with the original TrustBuilder2 framework, we used both to carry out the trust negotiation scenario described in [27]. This scenario has neither ACK policies nor attribute delegations. The original TrustBuilder2 framework uses the Jess rule engine as the underlying theorem prover for policy compliance checking [13] and TrustBuilder1-Relevant strategy [17] as the default negotiation strategy. The average time to conduct the trust negotiation session is 0.781s using the original TrustBuilder2 and 1.098s using our implementation. The higher time overhead of our implementation was due to the following two reasons. 1) In our implementation, the minimal semantic explanation of a policy released together with the policy must be computed. However, in the original TrustBuilder2, policies are released immediately to the negotiation opponent. 2) Our implementation relies on DL reasoning for policy compliance checking, whereas the original TrustBuilder2 uses rule-based reasoning. Specifically, a non-standard inference service of Pellet called axiom pinpointing is used to find all satisfying sets of a given policy in our implementation. The same work is performed in the original TrustBuilder2 by an efficient pattern-matching algorithm called Rete implemented by Jess [13]. Further examination of these two bases of compliance checking in terms of assessing their benefits and limitations is our future work.

We compare the properties of several negotiation strategies in Table 2
                     . All these negotiation strategies are complete and ensure that no irrelevant credentials are disclosed during the trust negotiation. Prudent negotiation strategy (PRUNES) [14] is a refined backtracking strategy that prunes certain areas of the negotiation search tree. Deterministic finite automaton negotiation strategy (DFANS) [16] models a credential policy as an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD). The strategy based on negotiation Petri Net (SNPN) [29] models the policies as Petri Net and then combines the characteristics of Petri Net with the behaviors of ATN. PRUNES considers only purely propositional policies. DFANS and SNPN use the same form of polices as PRUNES.

The most distinguishing features of SRNS are the following. 1) Unlike other strategies, credentials and policies in SRNS are defined by Description Logic. SRNS takes into account the semantic aspects of those definitions. 2) SRNS supports the delegation of authority, which is essential in a decentralized environment. The policies used by the other three strategies do not support delegations. 3) SRNS addresses the issue of information leakage of sensitive attributes by enforcing the ACK policies of sensitive attributes.

In the worst case, the communication complexity of PRUNES is O(n
                     2), where n is the total number of credentials requested during the negotiation. DFANS and SNPN are more efficient due to the O(n) communication complexity in the worst case. However, it is not practical for SNPN to model the policies of both negotiators as a Petri Net because no entity knows both parties' credential policies to construct the Negotiation Petri Net. Each party is only aware of its local disclosure policies. The communication complexity of SRNS is O(m), where m is the total number of semantically relevant credentials of the negotiation target and m
                     ≥
                     n. When no semantic relations are defined among attributes, m equals n. Otherwise, m is greater than n.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this paper, we showed how available Semantic Web technologies, namely ontology and Description Logic, can be used to build the automated trust negotiation system. To this end, we developed an ATN ontology and proposed a semantically relevant negotiation strategy (SRNS). The ATN ontology defines a vocabulary for ATN components to enhance semantic interoperability between negotiators. We formalized the ATN ontology with the Description Logic (DL) 
                        
                           SHOIN
                           
                              D
                           
                        
                     . Based on this logical formalization, it is feasible to conduct ATN policy compliance checking automatically via the state-of-the-art DL reasoners. The semantically relevant negotiation strategy exploits the semantics of attributes, credentials, and access control policies defined in the ATN ontology to make a negotiation succeed whenever possible. SRNS supports delegation of authority by modeling delegations as the semantic relationships between attributes. We verified the desirable properties of SRNS and evaluated the performance of our implementation of the ontology-based ATN.

Future work would involve the following aspects.
                        
                           •
                           Based on the DL formalization of ATN policies presented in this paper, we will attempt to conduct automatic policy analysis (conflict detection, redundancy checking, policy comparison, etc.) by leveraging DL reasoners. The tasks of policy analysis can be mapped to DL reasoning services (e.g., conflict detection can be reduced to concept satisfiability, policy comparison can be reduced to concept subsumption). Because ATN policies are of vital importance in the protection of resources from unauthorized access, a detailed policy analysis before the negotiation process begins is non-trivial.

We will further compare the performance of our implementation with the original TrustBuilder2 implementation, especially for policy compliance checking. The benefits of DL reasoning about policies and the limitations on the growth of time overhead will be further investigated.

Further improving the performance of SRNS implementation is still an important area of future work. Our experiment results have shown that ontology-based ATN becomes costly as the size of the ATN ontology grows. Thus, reducing the size of the ontology is highly desirable. We plan to use the module extraction technique of ontology as a way to reduce the size of knowledge bases related to negotiation. Module extraction computes a subset of an ontology with respect to a supplied signature that is ensured to be small and adequately capture the meaning of symbols in that signature. A signature is set of interested symbols referring to individuals, concept names, and role names. To identify only those concepts and axioms relevant to negotiation will promote efficient reasoning and thereby reduce the time overhead of SRNS.
