                  This paper undertakes the full decomposition of dynamic cost inefficiency into technical, scale and allocative inefficiency based on the dynamic directional distance function. The empirical application estimates dynamic inefficiency in the Spanish construction industry before and during the current financial crisis over the period 2001–2009. Static inefficiency measures are biased in a context of a significant economic crisis with large investments and disinvestments as they do not account for costs in the adjustment of quasi-fixed factors. Allocative inefficiency is smaller, while technical inefficiency is larger when using the dynamic compared to the static framework. Results further indicate that overall dynamic cost inefficiency is very high with technical inefficiency being the largest component, followed by allocative and scale inefficiency. Moreover, overall dynamic cost inefficiency is significantly larger before the beginning of the financial crisis than during the financial crisis. Larger firms are less technically and scale inefficient than smaller firms on average, but have more problems in choosing the mix of inputs that minimizes their long-term costs. Firms that went bankrupt, on average, have a higher overall dynamic cost inefficiency and scale inefficiency than continuing firms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A competitive sector often depends on its firms meeting their production potential and minimizing waste. Focusing on the growth in returns to factors employed, more competitive firms are able to attract resources away from less competitive firms. Sustaining competitiveness over the long run involves attention to growth prospects associated with the innovations needed to keep pushing the competitive envelope, and the efficiency gains needed to ensure that implemented technologies can succeed. The construction sector in both emerging and mature economies is a classic case in point. In most cases, the expansion in a nation’s economic fortunes are fueled by the construction sector. The sector draws on a significant capital base as well as is an economy’s significant employer and an important contributor to the nation’s GDP. The construction sector is also known for its cyclicality movement. The downturn of the Spanish construction sector after the beginning of the current financial crisis provides a case in point. Given this sector’s central role in promoting Spain’s competitiveness and economic growth, this study focuses on characterizing the Spanish construction sector’s economic performance over the recent past.

The literature on inefficiency measurement in the construction sector presents a diverse picture. Country studies report a wide range of inefficiency levels employing production- and financial-based frameworks. These range from a high of 68% of inefficiency for Spanish firms (Kapelko & Oude Lansink, 2014), around 50% for Canadian firms (Pilateris & McCabe, 2003), approximately 40% for Portuguese firms (Horta, Camanho, & Da Costa, 2012), to lower estimates of 7% for Greek firms (Tsolas, 2011) and 2% for Chinese firms (Xue, Shen, Wang, & Lu, 2008). El-Mashaleh (2010) assessed safety efficiency of construction contractors in Jordan and found an average inefficiency score of 0.68. Odeck (2001) analyzed the inefficiency of the road construction sector in Norway and found the sector’s potential for efficiency improvement in the range of 19–59%. The case of Korea in the late 1990s presents an interesting case in contrast to the Spanish case. The Korean construction sector was impacted by an economic crisis starting in November 1997. Using a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach for the period 1996–2000, You and Zi (2007) focus on leverage ratio, export weight, institutional ownership, asset size and receivables overdue turnover and find these factors impact all efficiency measures. However, declining allocative efficiency is the major component leading to lower efficiency over the crisis, which together with the strong relationship between institutional investors and efficiency suggests the agency problem between managers and owners is at fault.

The literature on assessing inefficiency in the construction sector has so far only focused on static measures of inefficiency. Unlike dynamic measures, static measures ignore the presence of adjustment costs associated with investments in quasi-fixed factors of production like capital. The adjustment costs can be viewed as transaction or reorganization costs and may be either internally driven (for example learning costs) or externally driven (for example expansion planning fees) (Brechling, 1975; Nickel, 1978). Adjustment costs are not observed, but are implicit in higher costs of inputs and lower revenues of output. In the presence of adjustment costs in quasi-fixed factors of production, static measures do not correctly reflect inefficiency. Only recently we observe a number of important contributions to dynamic inefficiency modeling in the adjustment-cost technology framework. Using stochastic frontier analysis, Rungsuriyawiboon and Stefanou (2007) propose a shadow cost approach to estimate allocative and technical inefficiency measures in the framework of the dynamic duality model and apply it to the US energy sector, and Serra, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2011) parametrically estimate the structural dynamic inefficiency measures in the Dutch agricultural sector. In the nonparametric setting, Silva and Stefanou (2007) develop measures of dynamic inefficiency using hyperbolic measures based on their earlier work of nonparametric dynamic dual cost approach to production analysis (Silva & Stefanou, 2003), and apply them to data from Pennsylvanian dairy farms. Silva and Oude Lansink (2013) extend the adjustment cost framework to the directional distance function and its dual cost function. Several others take on a network approach to account for dynamic effects of a production process into inefficiency measurement. Färe and Grosskopf (1996) account for storable inputs that can be used over multiple time periods and intermediate outputs. Chen (2009) proposes a network model where dynamic effects refer to the situation when intermediate outputs consumed may affect future output level, while Chen and Van Dalen (2010) develop a dynamic DEA model allowing for the presence of lagged production effects in efficiency evaluation. Skevas, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2012) apply a network DEA approach to account for intermediate outputs in the current period impacting the output in the future period. Kao (2013) proposes a dynamic DEA model to simultaneously assess the system and period efficiencies for multi-period systems. The other dynamic DEA modeling studies consider quasi-fixed inputs as outputs in the current period, while being treated as inputs in the next period (Nemoto & Goto, 2003; Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2005).

This paper builds on the earlier literature on dynamic inefficiency analysis in the adjustment-cost technology framework (Silva & Stefanou, 2003; Silva & Stefanou, 2007; Silva & Oude Lansink, 2013). However, previous works did not make a full decomposition of dynamic cost inefficiency into technical, scale and allocative inefficiency in the directional distance function context. Against this background, the objective of this paper is to estimate dynamic cost inefficiency and its decomposition into technical, allocative and scale inefficiencies in the Spanish construction industry before and after the beginning of the current crisis. The results are compared with cost inefficiency and its decomposition based on static models. Furthermore, the dynamic inefficiency results are compared for different size classes as well as firms that are active and that disband in the time-period considered. The paper employs a non-parametric DEA approach to measuring dynamic inefficiency. Although both parametric and non-parametric approaches have evolved in the literature, non-parametric approaches are more flexible as they do not impose a functional specification on the production frontier and ensure that regularity conditions are satisfied.

This paper builds also on the existing literature by undertaking the first empirical application of the dynamic inefficiency framework to the construction sector. A dynamic approach is particularly relevant in sectors undergoing rapid changes in the capital stock. The Spanish construction sector was facing periods of large investments and disinvestments, and a rapid change in economic conditions in the past decade. With the construction sector being heavily embodied in capital, the adjustment of these stocks is sluggish and cannot be expected to change instantaneously to revised long-run equilibrium levels that come about from the changing macroeconomic environment. Hence, a dynamic rather than a static inefficiency analysis is an appropriate method for analyzing the evolution of inefficiency.

The paper proceeds with the next section presenting background information on the crisis in the Spanish construction sector. This is followed by the elaboration of the conceptual model based on the intertemporal cost minimization and the presentation of the dynamic cost inefficiency measures. The subsequent sections describe the data of Spanish construction firms and the empirical results. The final section offers concluding comments and some potential policy implications.

Spain has the largest construction sector among the European Union (EU) countries (Eurostat, 2012). Until recently, the Spanish construction sector enjoyed a period of constant growth, reaching a 10% share of national GDP in 2006, which is twice the comparable EU-wide share, and employing 13% of the labor force. During the last decade, the expansion of this industry was a driving force behind the Spanish economic growth. Until 2007, Spain was recording higher annual new home construction completions than France, Germany and Italy combined. In the face of rising interest rates, oversupply, oversize, stricter lending conditions, and the emerging global financial crisis, Spain’s construction industry collapsed in 2007 with many firms exiting the sector (Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport, 2012; Bielsa & Duarte, 2010). The construction downturn negatively impacted output and employment with both contracting by about one third through the end of 2009 (Eurostat, 2012).

                      presents the pattern of construction permits granted and construction completion in Spain between 2001 and 2010. The emerging crisis is clearly foretold during 2006 by the building permits granted which is a leading economic indicator of macroeconomic performance. Conversely, the pattern of construction completion presents a lagging indicator of economic performance. The declining value of buildings to be built and buildings finished reflects the onset of financial stress when construction firms’ ability to acquire credit was diminished and costs for firms of acquiring and repaying the loans dramatically increased. The difficulty of loans repayment was associated also with decreasing demand of finished space (both residential and nonresidential), resulting in huge stocks of unsold buildings (Vergés, 2011). Several economic policy levers are available to stimulate this sector’s economic activity. Examples include monetary policy impacting interest rates changes, banking policies that can impact mortgage activity, zoning regulation, investment in amenities complementing building activities (such as green space and entertainment opportunities).

                      measures the distance of x and I to the frontier in the direction defined by the directional vectors gx
                      and gI
                     , respectively. Silva and Stefanou (2003) develop the characterization of the dynamic production technology under adjustment costs in the case of the input requirement set. Silva and Stefanou (2007) build on the Silva and Stefanou (2003) framework to develop characterization and measurement of dynamic inefficiency. For the dynamic directional input distance function, Silva and Oude Lansink (2013) develop the full characterization of the duality between the directional technology and the optimal value function of intertemporal cost minimization.

                     This measure is the normalized deviation between the shadow cost of the actual choices and the minimum shadow cost (rW(y, K, w, c)). The normalization is the shadow value of the directional vector, making the dynamic cost inefficiency a unit-free measure. The overall dynamic cost inefficiency relates to the firm’s ability to minimize production costs in order to produce a given level of outputs. For example, a dynamic cost inefficiency of 0.1 suggests that the same quantity of output can be produced at reduced long-run costs in the order of 10% of the value of the directional vector (w’gx

Hence, unlike other dynamic DEA approaches (e.g. Färe & Grosskopf, 1996), there is no need to have data over long time period, nor there is a need to use balanced panel data for computing dynamic inefficiency.

                      is a measure of dynamic scale inefficiency (SE) which indicates how much the producers would save in terms of long-run costs if they produce according to constant returns to scale. For example, a dynamic scale inefficiency of 0.1 implies a 10% reduction of the difference of long-run CRS costs and VRS costs expressed in terms of the value of the directional vector due to a reduction of variable inputs and expansion of investments.

Finally, dynamic overall cost inefficiency is decomposed into the contributions of technical inefficiency under variable returns to scale, scale inefficiency (SE) and a residual term defined as allocative inefficiency (AE)

Dynamic allocative inefficiency refers to the firm’s ability to choose the optimal mix of variable and dynamic factors, given their respective prices, i.e. the mix which minimizes long-run costs. For example, a dynamic allocative inefficiency of 0.1 suggests that a firm can reduce costs by 10% of the value of the directional vector through a better mix of variable and dynamic factors in the light of prevailing prices.

Some explanation is required regarding the comparison between the approach developed in the paper and network DEA approach taken in Färe and Grosskopf (1996), Nemoto and Goto (2003) and Chen and van Dalen (2010). The approach taken in the paper employs the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation approach in contrast to the network DEA approach. Network DEA is a computational decision process framework that is well suited to multistage production systems when an output in one stage feeds into the next stage as an input. A balanced panel is suitable for the network approach. In our approach, we have time-specific input decisions and the production of time-specific (intermediate) outputs. The constraints from one stage (or decision period) to the next can be input constrained just as capital-like factors can be in the dynamic problems addressed in this paper. This is a mathematical programming problem where the optimization takes place over all stages (periods) to generate the optimal trajectories for the control variables. There are two clear points of difference between the network DEA and the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation framework. The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman approach solves for the current period choice variables while looking to the impact of the flow of profits or costs into the future and is more akin to decision making process where firms make decisions in the short-run as they look to the future. Since both approaches are consistent with dynamic optimization theory, they yield the same answers. As the network DEA framework solves for the current period forward, a trajectory is generated for the future periods; thus, clearly, linking current decisions to the future flow of profits or costs.

The SABI database, managed by Bureau van Dijk, is the source for the data used in this study. This dataset contains the financial accounts of Spanish companies. The study sample includes the firms belonging to the category of firms in construction of residential and non-residential buildings (NACE Rev. 2 code 4120). This study focuses on the medium-sized firms which are among the most adversely impacted by the crisis as reflected by the significant reduction in the number of firms (Laborda, 2012). Also, focusing on medium-sized firms results in a data set with firms that are more comparable in size. Yet, there are still substantial differences between firms, since the medium-sized firms are those employing between 50 and 249 employees with an annual turnover between 10 and 50million euros, following the EU definition.

After filtering out companies with missing information and after removing the outliers,
                        2
                        Outliers were removed because solutions could not be obtained for dynamic cost inefficiency. Following Geylani and Stefanou (2013), outliers were determined using ratios of output to input. An observation was defined as an outlier if the ratio of output over any of the three inputs was outside the interval of the median plus and minus two standard deviations. After cleaning procedures there were 2690 observations left, out of which 230 (8.6% of the sample) were identified as outliers.
                     
                     
                        2
                      the final data set consists of 775 medium-sized firms that operated in Spain in at least one year during the period from 2001 to 2009. Choosing this time span we are able to analyze the years before and after the start of the financial crisis in Spain. The panel is unbalanced and sums to 2460 observations.

One output and three inputs (material costs, labor costs and fixed assets) are distinguished, following You and Zi’s (2007) and Kapelko and Oude Lansink (2014) studies of the construction sector, and efficiency studies of different industries (Kapelko & Oude Lansink, 2013; Soboh, Oude Lansink, & Van Dijk, 2012). Output was defined as total sales plus the change in the value of the stock and was deflated using the price index of residential buildings (2000=100%). Material costs and labor costs were directly taken from the SABI database and were deflated using the price indexes of materials of residential buildings and labor costs in construction, respectively. Fixed assets are measured as the beginning value of fixed assets from the balance sheet (i.e., the end value of the previous year) and are deflated using the industrial price index for capital goods. All prices used to deflate output and inputs are obtained from the Spanish Statistical Office (various years). Gross investments in fixed assets in year t are computed as the deflated beginning value of fixed assets in year t
                     +1 minus the deflated beginning value of fixed assets in year t plus the deflated beginning value of depreciation in year t
                     +1. Table 1
                      provides the descriptive statistics of the data used in this study, for the whole period 2001–2009 and for the periods before and after the start of the financial crisis (from 2001 to 2006, and from 2007 to 2009).


                     Table 1 indicates that the values of output and material costs have been shrinking by almost 10% in the period after the start of the financial crisis compared to the period before the financial crisis. The cost of employees remains largely unchanged. Furthermore, Table 1 indicates that the size of fixed assets is larger in the post- financial crisis period, which may reflect the change in the composition of the group of medium-sized firms. Operations categorized as large firms before the crisis have scaled down and enter the medium-sized firm category after the crisis. However, the financial crisis is reflected in the ratio of investment over fixed assets. This ratio decreased from 29%, on average, before the crisis to 17% after the crisis. Also, the volatility, as measured by standard deviation of investments normalized by the mean, is much larger after the crisis than before the crisis, reflecting that firms reacted very differently to the crisis.

@&#RESULTS@&#

This section presents the decomposition of overall dynamic inefficiency in the Spanish construction industry for the period pre- and post-financial crisis. The value of directional vector applied in this paper is (gx
                     ,
                     gI
                     )=(x,
                     δK),i.e. gx
                      is the actual quantity of variable inputs and gI
                      is the depreciated quantity of capital (20% of capital stock). We contrast these results with inefficiency measures based on the static directional distance function (Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1996). Furthermore, the paper investigates the dynamic inefficiency indicators for firms of different size classes and status (active versus those that went bankrupt in the time-period analyzed). In the absence of a unifying theory relating dynamic inefficiency to economic and financial forces, the value of this effort is to find evidence of dynamic inefficiency’s presence. In all cases, the frontiers are estimated for each year in the 2001–2009 time period, separately. Differences in overall, technical, scale and allocative inefficiencies between groups of construction firms are tested using the test proposed by Simar and Zelenyuk (2006) denoted as the S–Z test. Their test adapts the nonparametric test of the equality of two densities developed by Li (1996). Simar and Zelenyuk (2006) propose its adaptation to account for the case of DEA efficiency scores by creating a bounded support of the distribution and allowing for the fact that estimated rather than ‘true’ efficiencies are used. In particular, they propose two algorithms and among them they found the algorithm 2 to be more robust. In essence, the algorithm is based on computation and bootstrapping the Li statistic using DEA estimates, where values equal to unity (truncation of efficiency scores) are smoothed by adding a small noise. In this test, the bootstrap procedure only applies to test scores, so one does not need to compute bias-corrected efficiency scores. It should be noted that Simar and Zelenyuk (2006) develop their algorithm for the case of radial distance functions. Although the dynamic inefficiency is based on the directional distance function, their test can be applied for our purposes because of two reasons. First of all, we use actual quantities of inputs and capital as directional distance vectors and as Färe and Grosskopf (2005) show for the input distance function, the radial distance function is inferred from the directional distance function and vice versa. Second, we adapt algorithm 2 by adding a small noise to values of directional distance functions equal to 0. The same procedure applies for the static directional distance function. The implementation of this algorithm is done in R, using 1000 bootstrap replications.

                         of overall dynamic and static cost inefficiencies for the time-period before and after the beginning of the financial crisis (from 2001 to 2006, and from 2007 to 2009).

At a first glance, one should note the similarity between the values of dynamic and static overall inefficiencies. The graphs in Fig. 2 suggest also a higher dynamic and static overall cost inefficiencies of Spanish construction firms in the period before the financial crisis rather than during the financial crisis: the distributions of the period before financial crisis are located to the right of the distributions for the period after the beginning of the financial crisis. The decompositions of overall dynamic and static cost inefficiencies in Table 2
                         provide additional insight into the causes of this difference.

Using Table 2, one can note that the decrease in dynamic and static overall cost inefficiencies of Spanish construction firms in the post financial crisis period is due to a decrease in all its components. Moreover, the inefficiency distributions show significant differences between both periods as indicated by the S–Z test results: the estimated p-values are equal to 0, so the null hypotheses of equality of dynamic and static inefficiency distributions between two time periods are rejected. Four possible interpretations can be derived from this result: (1) some inefficient firms might have been forced to disappear from the market and hence from the sample due to, for example, the decrease in demand caused by the crisis; (2) the crisis has worked as a disciplining factor and firms became sharper in allocating resources; (3) as large firms contract to become medium-sized firms, they bring an additional dimension of experience in construction management to the group of firms in this category; and (4) the decreasing demand for construction permits has driven firms to try to increase their technical performance to attract the decreasing number of customers. All explanations imply the decrease of firms’ inefficiencies in the period of financial crisis.
                           4
                           Although we find that inefficiency decreases in the crisis period as compared to pre-crisis period, the reader should keep in mind that because we use an unbalanced panel, the observed differences in inefficiency may be due to attrition, i.e. highly inefficient firms included in the sample in the pre-crisis period are no longer in the sample in the post-crisis period.
                        
                        
                           4
                         Interestingly, further investigation suggests that the dynamic and static allocative inefficiencies decreased dramatically during the years of financial crisis as compared to pre-crisis period. This suggests that Spanish construction firms improved their resource allocation to minimize long-run costs during the financial crisis. Finally, exploring the sources of CRS dynamic and static technical inefficiencies decrease in post-crisis period, one can conclude that it occurred mainly due to a decrease in scale inefficiency rather than a decrease in VRS technical inefficiency. Therefore, the main reason behind the improvement in CRS dynamic and static technical inefficiencies is the fact that the firms’ combination of inputs and outputs became less scale inefficient.

Comparing overall mean dynamic and static inefficiencies over the 2001–2009 time-period suggests that dynamic allocative inefficiency is lower, and technical inefficiency is higher, than static allocative and technical inefficiency. These differences are statistically significant as shown by the S–Z test results. Higher levels of static allocative inefficiency can be explained by the quasi-fixed nature of capital which is not taken into account in static measures: firms cannot adjust the quantity of capital instantaneously and hence the allocative inefficiency may be persistent. Lower levels of static technical inefficiency in CRS are caused by the lower inefficiency in VRS as scale inefficiency is very similar between static and dynamic cases. Therefore, firms are closer to the VRS frontier in the static case than in the dynamic case. This suggests that firms are particularly inefficient in terms of the use of investments, i.e. some firms succeed in keeping output high and the use of other inputs low when investing a particular amount of money, whereas others are not as good in the process of investing. One explanation for this finding is the infrequency with which investments take place, so firms generally have little experience. Another interpretation derives from the fact that investments differ in nature, i.e. replacement investments are more accomplished with a lower inefficiency than expansionary investments and investments in new technology.

Overall for the 2001–2009 period, the findings suggest that substantial cost savings could be realized in the Spanish construction industry; i.e., the combined effect of dynamic technical and allocative factors shows that the average overall dynamic cost inefficiency for construction firms is 0.506. Such a high level of inefficiency, on the one hand, is due to the factors under managers’ control. On the other hand, it is possible that uncertainty in construction delivery which is out of the control of the firm (for example, weather conditions, obstacles in natural conditions of the ground) is being disguised partly as inefficiency. This relatively high level of overall dynamic cost inefficiency is mainly due to dynamic technical inefficiency under CRS (0.391) rather than dynamic allocative inefficiency (0.115). Average dynamic technical inefficiency allows for an improvement of 39.1% in reducing the inputs and increasing investments at a given level of outputs. The average dynamic allocative inefficiency of 0.115 suggests that construction firms can reduce costs by 11.5% through a better mix of variable and dynamic factors of production at given prices.

The comparison of the dynamic inefficiencies of Spanish construction firms differing in size uses two size population classes among medium-sized firms according to the annual sales turnover. The group of small medium-sized firms is defined as firms with a turnover between 10 and 30million euros (size class 1), whereas large medium-sized firms are defined as firms with a turnover between 30 and 50 million euros (size class 2).

                         presents the kernel density estimates of overall dynamic inefficiency for these two categories of firms’ size for the period from 2001 to 2009.

It is clear from the graphs in Fig. 3 that the distributions of overall dynamic inefficiency for small and big medium-sized construction firms are similar suggesting that overall inefficiency may not be associated with firms’ size. Table 3
                         further elaborates this finding by providing the decomposition of overall dynamic inefficiency as well as the results of S–Z test of significance of differences in inefficiency between the two size classes.

The results in Table 3 clearly provide a support that overall dynamic inefficiency of Spanish construction firms is not associated with firm size for both the pre- and post-financial crisis period. The estimated p-values of the S–Z test range from 0.312 to 0.635, indicating that the null hypothesis of equality of distributions cannot be rejected. Dynamic technical and scale inefficiencies decrease with size. Mean inefficiency is lower for larger than for smaller construction firms; however, the difference in magnitude is not large. This result holds in the pre-crisis period and during the financial crisis (from 2007 to 2009 with exception for scale inefficiency). Therefore, the results confirm that smaller construction firms are farther away from efficient frontier and are less scale efficient than larger companies. However, the results for dynamic allocative inefficiency in Table 3 suggest that larger construction firms have more problems with choosing the mix of inputs and output that minimizes long-run cost than smaller construction firms.

Further insights can be achieved by splitting the sample of dynamic inefficiency estimates into construction firms that are active versus those that exit the sector due to bankruptcy.
                           6
                           We create a subsample of firms that went bankrupt in the sample period and compare the inefficiency of this group of firms (measured in the years prior to going bankrupt) with inefficiency of the group of continuing firms. It should also be noted that financially distressed firm may have been acquired by other firms. However, we do not observe the reason for acquisition by other firms. Therefore, the firms in our sample of bankrupt firms are only the ones with bankruptcy status.

                         visualizes the distributions of overall dynamic inefficiency of these two groups of firms during the analyzed period.


                        Fig. 4 suggests that overall dynamic inefficiency is slightly higher for construction firms that went bankrupt than for active firms. The distribution of overall inefficiency of bankrupt companies is located to the right of the distribution of active companies. However, the differences in distributions of overall dynamic inefficiency observed on the graph are not very substantial. Table 4
                         presents the results of the S–Z test for differences in overall dynamic inefficiency and its components for active companies and companies that went bankrupt.


                        Table 4 shows that overall dynamic inefficiency during the 2001–2009 time-period is lower for active construction firms rather than for firms that went bankrupt. In this period, although all inefficiency components are lower for active firms rather than for firms that went bankrupt, only for CRS dynamic technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency these differences are statistically significant. Comparing the periods of pre- and post-financial crisis, again in general the lower inefficiencies are observed for active firms, although many differences are not statistically significant. After the beginning of the financial crisis, the differences in overall dynamic inefficiency and CRS dynamic technical inefficiency between active and bankrupt firms are significantly different, but all other components are not. In the period before the beginning of the financial crisis, the difference in overall dynamic inefficiency is not statistically significant, but one of its components, the difference in CRS dynamic technical inefficiency is significant. Hence, the results indicate that after the financial crisis, firms that went bankrupt are, on average more technically inefficient than firms that remained active.

This is the first study assessing dynamic inefficiency of a sample of construction firms. Hence, our results cannot be directly compared with earlier studies as they used static approaches. Nevertheless, a comparison with Horta et al. (2012) and Pilateris and McCabe (2003) present similar levels of technical inefficiency. Higher values of technical inefficiency were found by Kapelko and Oude Lansink (2014), El-Mashaleh (2010) and Odeck (2001), while much lower levels were found in Tsolas (2011) and Xue et al. (2008). Unlike You and Zi (2007) who found the allocative inefficiency to be the major contributor to overall inefficiency, our study finds that technical inefficiency is the largest component. Apart from differences in economic and regulatory conditions in the countries studied in the literature, this disparity of findings may be the result of our study using a dynamic rather than static approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper contributes to the literature by undertaking a full empirical decomposition of overall dynamic cost inefficiency into technical, scale and allocative inefficiency based on the dynamic directional distance function and comparing these measures to their static counterparts. The dynamic approach, unlike the static approach, accounts for the presence of adjustment costs of investments and provides a better assessment of inefficiency, particularly for firms undertaking large investments and disinvestments. The empirical application nonparametrically estimates dynamic and static cost inefficiency of Spanish construction firms before and after the beginning of the financial crisis. The performance is compared for firms of different sizes and for firms that went bankrupt versus those that continued operation. The results show that incorporating dynamic factors into inefficiency measurement modifies the analysis of inefficiency. We find that dynamic allocative inefficiency is lower and technical inefficiency is higher than static allocative and technical inefficiency, respectively.

Overall dynamic cost inefficiency is almost 50% in the period under investigation with technical inefficiency being the largest component, followed by allocative and scale inefficiency. Overall dynamic inefficiency is significantly larger before the beginning of the financial crisis than during the financial crisis; the improvement is mainly due to lower allocative inefficiency. Large medium-sized firms are, on average less technically and scale inefficient than small medium-sized firms, but have more problems in choosing the mix of inputs that minimizes their long-term costs. In the period after the beginning of the financial crisis, large medium-sized firms have a lower technical and allocative inefficiency, whereas small medium-sized firms have a lower technical and scale inefficiency. Firms that went bankrupt in the period 2001–2009, on average, have a higher overall dynamic cost inefficiency and scale inefficiency than continuing firms.

The implications of our results for the construction firms are that these firms have a substantial scope for improving their technical performance with the current technology. Better management of their resources can contribute to a reduction of technical inefficiency. Further research is needed though to investigate the factors that are underlying poor technical performance. Also, our results imply that particularly larger firms suffer financial losses due to a poor allocation of resources at given input prices. Big firms and firms pursuing a growth strategy need to pay more attention to this source of inefficiency, e.g. by choosing less costly combinations of inputs.

Our results on scale inefficiency imply that firms need more flexibility in adjusting the size of their operation. The lack of flexibility in adjusting the firm size due to legal and regulatory constraints contributes to the persistence of scale inefficiency. For instance, policy makers can increase the flexibility of firms to adjust the size of the labor force by introducing labor market reforms that enable firms to more easily lay off people or reduce salaries in times of financial distress such as the reforms that have been implemented recently in Spain (Noblet & Regojo, 2012).

Our study has some limitations. Although we are confident that our results reflect the main trends in the industry severely impacted by the crisis, other forces may have contributed to our findings. For example, uncertainty in construction delivery could explain the high level of inefficiency found in this study. Future research could address production uncertainty along the proposals of Skevas et al. (2012), Chambers, Hailu, and Quiggin (2011) or O’Donnell et al. (2010) and distinguish between inefficiency due to factors under managers’ control and this related to the factors out of control of the firm. However, we are not able to account for production uncertainty due to the lack of appropriate data on e.g. the number of days of construction delays or the number of frost-free days experienced by individual firms. Also other sources of dynamic inefficiency of Spanish construction firms could be considered such as the ownership structure, the age of the firm or the intensity of competition. For the sample at hand this requires the collection of additional data. We leave the exploration of these topics for future research.
