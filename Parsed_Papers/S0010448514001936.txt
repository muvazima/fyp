                  Congenital Hand Deformities (CHD) usually occurred between the fourth and the eighth week after the embryo is formed. Failure of the transformation from arm bud cells to upper limb can lead to an abnormal appearing/functioning upper extremity which is presented at birth. Some causes are linked to genetics while others are affected by the environment, and the rest have remained unknown. CHD patients develop prehension through the use of their hands, which affects the brain as time passes. In recent years, CHD have gained increasing attention and researches have been conducted on CHD, both surgically and psychologically. However, the impacts of CHD on the brain structure are not well-understood so far. Here, we propose a novel approach to apply Teichmüller space theory and conformal welding method to study brain morphometry in CHD patients. Conformal welding signature reflects the geometric relations among different functional areas on the cortex surface, which is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, invariant under conformal deformation, and encodes complete information of the functional area boundaries. The computational algorithm is based on discrete surface Ricci flow, which has theoretic guarantees for the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. In practice, discrete Ricci flow is equivalent to a convex optimization problem, therefore has high numerically stability. In this paper, we compute the signatures of contours on general 3D surfaces with the surface Ricci flow method, which encodes both global and local surface contour information. Then we evaluated the signatures of pre-central and post-central gyrus on healthy control and CHD subjects for analyzing brain cortical morphometry. Preliminary experimental results from 3D MRI data of CHD/control data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The statistical comparison between left and right brain gives us a better understanding on brain morphometry of subjects with Congenital Hand Deformities, in particular, missing the distal part of the upper limb.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Congenital anomalies affect 1%–2% of newborns, and approximately 10% of those children have hand abnormalities  [1,2]. Congenital hand deformities (CHD) usually occurred between the fourth and the eighth week after the embryo is formed  [3]. Failure of the transformation from arm bud cells to upper limb can result in an abnormal appearing/functioning upper extremity which is presented at birth. Some causes are linked to genetics while others are affected by the environment—either outside or inside the uterus, and the rest has remained unknown.

CHD are present at birth and may become a challenge for children as they continue to grow and learn to interact with their environment through the use of their hands. The degree of deformity can vary from something minor, such as a digital disproportion, to a more severe deformity, such as total absence of a bone or part of the hand. Children develop prehension with hands as they are, and they usually start being self-conscious of the difference when they socialize in school, as a result, they may intend not to show or use it. The less the affected arm and hand are used, the less functional they will be, and the more likely it will affect functionalities of brain. In recent years, a number of researches have been conducted on mechanism, behaviors and psychology for CHD  [4–7]. However, the impacts of CHD on brain structure are not well-understood so far.

Most brain MRI scanning protocols acquire volumetric data about the anatomy of the subject. Early researches  [8,9] have demonstrated that surface-based brain mapping may offer advantages over volume-based brain mapping work  [10] to study structural features of the brain, such as cortical gray matter thickness, complexity, and patterns of brain change over time due to disease or developmental processes. In research studies that analyze brain morphology, many surface-based shape analysis methods have been proposed, such as spherical harmonic analysis (SPHARM) [11,12], minimum description length approaches  [13], medial representations (M-reps)  [14], cortical gyrification index  [15], shape space  [16], metamorphosis  [17], momentum maps  [18] and conformal invariants  [19]; these methods may be applied to analyze shape changes or abnormalities in cortical and subcortical brain structures. Even so, a stable method to compute a global intrinsic transformation-invariant shape descriptors would be highly advantageous in this research field.

Here, we propose a novel and intrinsic method to compute the global correlations between various surface region contours in Teichmüller space and apply it to study brain morphology on CHD. The proposed shape signature demonstrates the global geometric features encoded in the interested regions, as a biomarker for measurements of CHD progression and pathology. It is based on the brain surface conformal structure  [20–23] and can be accurately computed using the surface Ricci flow method  [24,25].

For a 3D surface, all the contours represent the ‘shape’ of the surface. Inspired by the research work of Sharon and Mumford  [26] on 2D shape analysis (recently it has been generalized to model multiple 2D contours  [27]), we build a Teichmüller space for 3D shapes by using conformal mappings. In this Teichmüller space, every 3D contour (a simple closed curve) is represented by a point in the space; each point denotes a unique equivalence class of diffeomorphisms up to a Möbius transformation. For a 3D surface, the diffeomorphisms of all the contours form a global shape representation of the surface. By using this signature, the similarities of 3D shapes can be quantitatively analyzed, therefore, the classification and recognition of 3D objects can be performed from their observed contours.

We tested our algorithm in segmented regions on a set of brain left cortical surfaces extracted from 3D anatomical brain MRI scans. The proposed method can reliably compute signatures on two cortical functional areas  [28] by computing the diffeomorphisms of each observed contour. Using the signature as the statistics, our method achieves about 91% accuracy rate to discriminate a set of CHD subjects from healthy control subjects.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to apply contour diffeomorphism to brain morphometry research. Our experimental results demonstrated that this novel and simple method may be useful to analyze certain functional areas, and it may shed some light on understanding and detecting abnormality regions in brain surface morphometry. Our major contributions in this work include:
                           
                              (i)
                              A new method to compute Teichmüller shape descriptor, in a way that generalized a prior 2D domain conformal mapping work  [26].

The method is theoretically rigorous and general. It presents a stable way to calculate the diffeomorphisms of contours in general 3D surfaces based on Ricci flow.

It involves solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), so it is numerically efficient and computationally stable.

The shape descriptors are global and invariant to rigid motion and conformal deformations.

                         shows the pipeline for computing the diffeomorphism signature for a surface with 4 closed contours. Here, we use a human brain hemisphere surface whose functional areas are divided and labeled in different colors. The contours (simple closed curves) of functional areas can be used to slice the surface open to connected patches.

The diffeomorphisms induced by the conformal maps of each curve form a diffeomorphism signature, which is the Teichmüller coordinates in Teichmüller space. As shown in (f, h), the curves demonstrate the diffeomorphisms for two contours; the

                         By stereo-graphic projection, the unit sphere can be conformally mapped to the extended complex plane. Therefore, the Möbius transformation group is also the conformal automorphism group of the unit sphere. Suppose

                         is a genus zero closed Riemannian surface, then there exists a conformal mapping

All Riemannian surfaces can be classified by the conformal equivalence relation. Each conformal equivalence class shares the same conformal invariants, the so-called conformal module. The conformal module is one of the key components for us to define the unique shape signature.

                           Fixing the topology of the surfaces, all the conformal equivalence classes form a manifold, which is called the Teichmüller space.

Surface Ricci flow is a powerful tool to compute uniformization. Ricci flow refers to the process of deforming Riemannian metric 
                           
                              g
                           
                         proportional to the curvature, such that the curvature 
                           K
                         evolves according to a heat diffusion process, eventually the curvature becomes constant everywhere. Suppose in the local coordinate, the metric can be written as 
                           
                              g

                         Surface Ricci flow conformally deforms the Riemannian metric, and converges to constant curvature metric  [32]. Furthermore, Ricci flow can be used to compute the unique conformal Riemannian metric with the prescribed curvature.

                            is a topological disk, then by puncturing a small hole in the center, we convert it to a topological annulus. After mapping the topological annulus to the canonical annulus, we can fill the center hole. This gives the Riemann mapping from the original topological disk to the unit disk.

                           ’s become rounder and rounder, and the mesh is mapped to a circle domain.

After the computation of the conformal mapping, each connected component is mapped to a circle domain. We define an order for all the loops on the surface, this induces an order for all the boundary components on each segment. Then by the definition for the conformal module of a circle domain, we normalize each circle domain using a Möbius transformation, then compute the conformal modules directly. For those segments, which are simply connected and mapped to the unit disk, we compute its mass center, and use a Möbius transformation to map the center to the origin.

Each loop on the surface becomes the boundary components on two segments, both boundary components are mapped to a circle under the uniformization mapping. Then we compute the signature directly. Suppose

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our method by analyzing the human brain cortexes of CHD subjects and healthy controls. The brain surfaces are represented as triangular meshes; a brain surface with 300 K triangles. We implement the algorithm using generic C++ on windows 7 platform, with Intel Core i7-2630QM CPU 2.00 GHz, 6.00 GB RAM. The numerical systems are solved using C++ libraries, graphs are plotted with C++ and Matlab libraries. In general, the signature calculation on each half brain surface with 2 contours on each half takes less than 20 min to compute, even on complicated domains.

We applied our method on both pre-central gyrus and post-central gyrus, which are known to be the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch/planing and executing movements.

The experimental data include patients missing the distal part of the upper limb, and matched healthy controls. The segmentation algorithm  [33,34] is implemented in C++ and the user interface is developed using FLTK (http://www.fltk.org/). The data set consists of brain MRI scans of patients and matched controls obtained using 3-T Siemens Trio Scanner with a standard 8-channel head coil in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri (TR = 1920 ms, TE = 3.75 ms, flip angle = 8, in-plane resolution = 1 × 1 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, number of images = 160, matrix = 256 × 256).


                        Fig. 2
                         shows an example of diffeomorphism signatures for a brain cortical surface. We selected two contours: pre-central and post-central gyrus marked by experts on the left and the right half brain cortical surfaces, which correspond to the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch/planing and executing movements. More results are demonstrated in Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                        . Early researches  [35,36] have indicated that these two areas may have significant atrophy in congenital anomalies.

The diffeomorphism signature for each contour is plotted as a monotonic curve

From the statistics, we may give the conjecture that (a) compared with patients with CHD, healthy controls yield relatively stable contours for both pre-central and post-central gyrus of the brain. (b) CHD may provide a greater impact on post-central gyrus than pre-central gyrus for patients brains, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that both CHD and variations of post-central gyrus development result from genetic causes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we propose a novel method that computes the global shape signatures on specified functional areas on brain cortical surfaces based on Teichmüller space theory. Conformal welding signature reflects the geometric relations among different functional areas on the cortex surface, which is intrinsic to the Riemannian metric, invariant under conformal deformation, and encodes complete information of the functional area boundaries. The computational algorithm is based on discrete surface Ricci flow, which has theoretic guarantees for the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. Discrete Ricci flow is equivalent to a convex optimization problem, therefore has high numerically stability. We applied the method to study the shape difference of cortical surfaces between Congenital Hand Deformities (CHD) and healthy control groups. The method is lossless, robust, and effective; it also has great potential to be employed to general brain morphometry study. Currently, the method is implemented to limited sets of data from recruited patients and healthy controls but it has the potential to extend to a greater number of subjects. The statistical comparison from the preliminary result indicates the impacts of CHD on brain structure. In the future, we will further explore and validate numerous applications of this global correlation shape signature in neuroimaging and shape analysis research.
