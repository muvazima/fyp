                  Background
                  Renal arteriovenous malformation (RAVM) represents abnormal communication between the intrarenal arterial and venous system. The purpose of this study was to investigate hemodynamics and biomechanics quantities which may influence the instability of RAVM and imply clinical complications.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A detailed 3D reconstruction of RAVM was obtained from the patient CT scans, aortic inlet flow was measured by color-flow Doppler ultrasound, while material characteristics were adopted from the literature. A numerical finite element analysis (FEA) of the blood flow was performed by solving the governing equations for the viscous incompressible flow. The physical quantities calculated at the systolic and diastolic peak moment were velocity, pressure, shear stress and drag forces.
               
               
                  Results
                  We reported a case of a 50-year-old patient with a large RAVM and adjacent renal cyst, who unsuccessfully underwent two attempts of embolization that resulted in the consequent nephrectomy. FEA showed that the cyst had a very low pressure intensity and velocity field (with unstable flow in diastolic peak). For both systolic and diastolic moments, increased values of wall shear stress were found on the places with intensive wall calcification. Unusually high values of drag force which would likely explain the presence of pressure in the cystic formation were found on the infero-medial side where the cyst wall was the thinnest and where the flow streamlines converged.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  FEA showed that the hemodynamics of the cyst-RAVM complex was unstable making it prone to rupture. Clinically established diagnosis of imminent rupture together with unfavorable hemodynamics of the lesion consequently made additional attempts of embolization risky and unsuccessful leading to total nephrectomy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Renal arteriovenous malformation (RAVM) represents an abnormal communication between the intrarenal arterial and venous system [1]. This communication is established through a network of abnormal vessels (often referred to as “nidus”). RAVM may either be congenital, idiopathic, or acquired, with latter being the most common (70% to 80%) usually resulting from trauma, malignancy, inflammation, or percutaneous procedures [2]. In cases of sustained RAVM, there is nearly always a single, markedly dilated intrarenal arterial branch supplying the malformation and communicating with the vein. Congenital lesions account for 14% to 27% of cases and are composed of multiple, tortuous arterial and venous structures [3]. Idiopathic forms are type of acquired RAVM with no apparent cause. To the best of our knowledge, only few case reports describing a concomitant presence of large RAVM and adjacent renal cyst could be found in the literature [4–6].

Surgical excision is recommended for: malformations >2cm in diameter, in women of child-bearing age, with an expanding size on serial angiograms, with an incomplete ring-like calcification on radiography, in the presence of uncontrollable hypertension, or in the presence of high output heart failure [7]. Recent studies have suggested that transarterial embolization may be regarded as the first-line treatment of RAVM in order to avoid nephrectomy, reduce pre-operative risk and shorten hospital stay [8,9]. Embolic materials used for embolization include gelatin sponge, metallic coil, absolute ethanol, plastic polymers, lipiodol, and n-butyl 2-cyano crylate [10]. Another study reported that high-flow RAVMs can be technically difficult to manage by embolization because the torrential flow through these lesions increases the risk of loss of the embolic device into the pulmonary circulation [11]. Due to these complications, high-flow RAVMs are usually treated by surgery. Endovascular techniques have also been used recently to treat giant aneurysms with arteriovenous fistulas [12]. Surgical treatments such as partial nephrectomy, total nephrectomy, renal auto-transplantation, vessel ligation are also potentially viable options.

However, none of these studies focused on the investigation of biomechanical conditions which precede malformation complications. In the recent literature, mechanical response and interaction of medical devices, human tissues and blood flow are commonly studied by using finite element method (FEM) or finite element analysis (FEA) [13–16]. FEA represents a cost-effective tool in situations where precise analysis and evaluation of physical quantities (such as stress, strain, displacements, velocity, temperature, etc.) requires expensive equipment which usually may not provide results for a complete structure. Regarding the modeling of arteriovenous malformation, FEA has been used and validated for studying arteriovenous fistula (AVF) flow in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in whom AVF was created for hemodialysis access [17,18]. An in-vitro study that investigated local hemodynamics in a model of AVF with a 30 degree anastomotic angle and vein-to-artery diameter ratio of 1.6 showed that the flow properties during pulsatile flow were similar to those seen in steady flow with no significant qualitative changes over the cardiac cycle [19]. The study that focused on the investigation of correlation between calcification occurrence and shear stress reported that there were no associations between calcification occurrence and areas of oscillating shear stress, whereas potential associations between calcification and high temporal wall shear stress gradients was observed [20]. Another study that included six ESRD patients undergoing primary AVF formation studied the contribution of hemodynamic parameters to the remodeling of the venous limbs of the AVF [21]. The conclusion was that the venous limb of the AVF is subjected to a high blood-flow and a low blood-pressure environment and that the venous wall undergoes eccentric hypertrophy as a result of increased circumferential stress due to higher shear forces.

The aim of this study was to perform extensive analysis of biomechanics properties and their correlation with the stability of RAVM by using FEA. Particularly, considering the patient-specific model and conditions, we aimed to investigate the influence of hemodynamics parameters (blood-flow velocity, pressure, shear stress and drag forces) on the RAVM stability and corresponding clinical implications.

A 50-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our hospital with complaints of minor right flank pain and gross hematuria with signs of hemodynamic compromise (blood pressure 90/50mmHg and heart rate 100beat/min). A history of significant renal trauma or prior surgery was excluded. The patient confirmed that no medical intervention involving a percutaneous procedure had been carried out. The presence of cystic lesion on the right kidney was established during the previous ultrasound studies that had shown no evidence of renal nor bladder stones. Laboratory values were unremarkable except for haemoglobin (71g/L). The patient was initially treated with indwelling catheter and a blood transfusion. Ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 10×8cm with signs of hemorrhage in the cyst and renal collecting system (
                     Fig. 1). Contrast CT examination revealed arteriovenous malformation originating from the renal artery.

A decision to embolize the RAVM was made. Angiography was performed using a right transfemoral approach. The angiogram showed that the right kidney was vascularized by a single right renal artery (
                     Fig. 2). The main trunk of the renal artery was normal while the ventral branch appeared ecstatic and tortuous with direct communication with the cystic lesion. The anterior branch was selectively cannulated. Embolization was performed using Trisacryl microspheres (Embosphere; Biosphere Medical, Rockland, MA) (700μm). The control angiogram showed that the ventral branch was only partially occluded due to its dilatation (5mm). Beginning at the origin of the RAVM from its feeding vessel, a 10×15 Nester coil was then deployed. Multiple 3×5 Nester and 10×5 Tornado (Cook Inc. Bloomington, IN) coils were then placed along the length of the branch, up to the main renal artery. The larger coil was placed first as it was thought to be less likely to embolize into the malformation and could provide a scaffold into which the smaller coils could be more safely deployed later on.

Five days later, the ventral branch was additionally embolized through the right transfemoral approach. The RAVM remained partially occluded. During the course of recovery, the patient maintained good urine output without hematuria. A follow-up CT showed no flow through the malformation and a sustained flow through the right main renal and accessory arteries. There was no loss of parenchymal perfusion.

Control color-flow Doppler ultrasonography showed the presence of flow in the malformation. Surgical treatment (nephrectomy) was consequently carried out, with the aim to obviate the risk of rupture, prolonged treatment and uncertainty, and discomfort in the right lumbar area. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day. Six months after the surgery the patient is feeling well with a sustained renal function.

Pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of aneurysmatic extension of terminal part of the renal artery, with atherosclerotic changes in intima, calcium deposits in its wall, thrombotic material inside its cavity as well as thinned fibrotic media and adventitia.

@&#METHODS@&#

After obtaining the hospital ethical committee agreement to use the available patient’s CT scans (Siemens Somatom Sensation 16, Munich, Germany), a detailed 3D reconstruction of considered RAVM was performed within a few steps (note that MRI/MRA would also be appropriate modality for a 3D reconstruction). After the acquisition, Mimics 10.01 software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) was used for image segmentation and reconstruction of 3D surface meshes. The triangulated surface mesh was refined and exported in the stereolithography (STL) data format (
                     Fig. 3a). For the developed model which included the right renal artery, ventral and anterior branch, 3D volume discretization of the surface mesh was carried out using the TetGen (Hang Si, WIAS, Berlin, Germany) meshing software. By using custom functions written in Matlab R2010a (MathWorks, Natick, MA), the obtained four-nodal tetrahedral elements were then split following the pattern given in Fig. 3b into the four eight-node hexahedral (brick) elements. Thetetrahedral mesh density was increased iteratively until the changes of FEA results between two mesh refinements were less than 5%, ending with approximately 400,000 brick elements.

To investigate the hemodynamics of the described RAVM, a numerical finite element simulation of blood flow was performed using PAK Software for static and dynamics finite element analysis (University of Kragujevac) [22]. The assumption was made about the cystic wall to be a linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous. The blood was assumed to be incompressible, with a Newtonian behavior having density

                      are forcing vectors. The mean shear stress was calculated following the literature [24]. For the inlet flow measured by ultrasound color-flow Doppler (Fig. 3c), a parallelized solver with 400 time steps per cycle took 6h on the cluster configuration consisting of 256 processors and 40GB of RAM.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The physical quantities calculated at the diastolic peak moment (DPM) and systolic peak moment (SPM) are shown in 
                     Figs. 4 and 
                     5, respectively. It could be seen that the cyst had a very low vector field (velocity), with pressure intensity at the wall remaining small, both for SPM and DPM. Together, they generated low wall shear stresses (WSS). Moreover, FEA indicates unusually high drag forces (Figs. 3d and 5d) which would likely explain the presence of pressure in the cystic formation. Dimensions of the cyst in the directions marked in Fig. 3a were 12×8cm, which categorize it as uncommonly large. The length of arteriovenous fistula was 14cm with diameter varying between 4.5 and 12mm (Fig. 3a) with complex multiple direction changes influencing the blood flow. Increased values of the cyst wall shear stresses were found on the places with calcification in the cyst wall (Fig. 3a, yellow color represents voxels of calcifications extracted from the CT scans). Such correlation is in accordance with the previously published experimental study focusing on the investigation of hemodynamics relationship with smaller tubular vascular alterations [18]. In the present study dealing with the large RAVM, turbulent microcirculations around the calcified region could be detected in the DPM as shown in Fig. 4a. Moreover, it may be found that directions of turbulent streamlines coincide with the places with increased wall shear stress given in Fig. 4c. Maximum values of drag forces were found on the infero-medial side where the flow streamlines from Fig. 5 a converged. It is interesting to note that the places of high values of drag forces occurrence coincide with the places where the cyst wall was the thinnest, which probably additionally contributed to the instability of the presented RAVM.

Although the risk of RAVM rupture is generally reported to be small, the reasons for RAVM instability and the consequent rupture remain unclear so far. In the case reported in this study, we performed a selective percutaneous embolization of the RAVM with the aim to promptly control the bleeding, preserve the renal parenchyma, and avoid a major surgery. Unfortunately, after having attempted it twice, we were unable to fully occlude the flow through the RAVM. Beside the fact that we started the embolization with embospheres, as they were the only embolization material available at the time (short and direct AV shunting with coils could be used as well), we believe that the failure was more the result of a high flow communication found between the structures rather than the type of chosen embolization material. FEA clearly identified the flow patterns of the RAVM connection, and was able to pinpoint the areas of increased hemodynamics instability. The previous study focusing on the predicting of aneurysm rupture reported that wall stress calculated using FEA could be used to predict a rupture risk of aortic aneurysms [25]. In the considered RAVM, maximal diameter of feeding artery was found proximally to the site of its rupture. Consequently, we concluded that the rupture occurred in the segment where increased flow and shear stress had been developed in the initial fistula. However, the ongoing bleeding into the collecting system and the need for a continued transfusion necessitated surgery with a total nephrectomy. Regarding the prediction of rupture and following complications, it is well established that hemodynamic parameters directly affect AVF maturation and performance. RAVM instability which obstructed the embolization attempts may be explained with increased drag forces (which influenced the increasing of wall stress) in the region of decreased wall thickness and turbulence near the cyst wall (especially on the places where high wall shear stress was developed).

Apart from the presented computer aided approach for analysis of the RAVM, multiple imaging modalities are available and widely used in everyday clinical practice. Although renal arteriography is still regarded as the gold standard, ultrasonography with color Doppler assessment may also be useful in establishing the diagnosis of RAVM especially in high flow RAVMs [26]. However, ultrasound color Doppler cannot reveal other quantities presented in this study, such as shear stress or drag forces. Three-dimensional visualization of vascular malformations, its relation to the renal parenchyma, and evaluation of the inflow and outflow vessels along with the architecture of the malformation itself have been dramatically improved with the introduction of a multi-detector row CT and magnetic resonance angiography without the contrast medium. However, establishing an indication for interventional or surgical RAVM treatment based solely on imaging modality without a hemodynamic examination may prove to be inadequate, as it was shown in this study. A great improvement would be achieved by fusing advantages of various imaging modalities, image analysis and numerical procedures [27–30]. Computer methods presented in this study aim to give much more insight into the surgical outcome and probably predict situations with increased risk for the patient. As it may be seen, therapeutic effects on hemodynamic interactions with the RAVM can only be predicted prior to surgery by using numerical simulations. Consequently, as a disadvantage of this study we report the impossibility to perform in-vivo validation of the obtained results in the case of RAVM. However, since software tools used in this study have been previously validated and established as reliable in numerous examples [13–16,22,23], we assumed that calculated physical quantities were acceptable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar study in the literature that analyzed RAVM from the point of biomechanics. In this study, we presented the patient-specific modeling procedures which could be used as a support for performing clinical treatment analysis and decision-making.

As limitations of this study, we remind that anisotropy and nonlinearity of the cyst wall was neglected. This was performed because of our inability to precisely reconstruct the wall of the cyst and renal artery. More importantly, it was not possible to experimentally estimate its material characteristics. Knowing these parameters could provide more insight into the RAVM rupture by performing Fluid Solid Interaction simulations [31]. Thus, the focus of this study was restricted to the hemodynamics quantities which preceded the RAVM complications.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Rupture of RAVM is an uncommon and potentially life-threating condition that has to be promptly recognized and adequately treated. Several therapeutic approaches are available, with percutaneous embolization considered as a first-line option, while nephrectomy is a reasonable option when dealing with unstable patients or those with unsuitablerenal vascular anatomy. This study presented the use of computational fluid dynamics simulation for the analysis of the RAVM, with emphasis on the investigating velocity and pressure distribution, wall shear stress, drag force and flow streamlines. Previously unpublished specific case of large RAVM was reported and discussed in this study. The analysis of the data obtained by FEA revealed that the cyst had unstable hemodynamics nature making RAVM prone to rupture. Estimation of RAVM instability is difficult or impossible to be detected by the conventional diagnostic procedures. Therefore, therapeutic effects on hemodynamic interactions with the RAVM can only be predicted prior to surgery/intervention by using numerical simulations. It may be concluded that computer methods presented in this study intended to provide support to surgeons to overcome clinical diagnostic limits and help them during the process of medical decision making.
