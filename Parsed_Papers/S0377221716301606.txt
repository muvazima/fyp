                  The sampling information for the cost-effectiveness analysis typically comes from different health care centers, and, as far as we know, it is taken for granted that the distribution of the cost and the effectiveness does not vary across centers. We argue that this assumption is unrealistic, and prove that to not consider the sample heterogeneity will typically give misleading results. Consequently, a cost-effectiveness procedure for heterogeneous samples is here proposed.
                  The proposed cost-effectiveness procedure consists of a Bayesian clustering to measure the sample heterogeneity, and a meta-analysis to account for the specific clustering structure of the data.
                  Examples with real data illustrate this methodology for normal and lognormal models, and the results are compared with those we would obtain if homogeneity of the samples is assumed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cost-effectiveness analysis of medical treatments is a well-known statistical decision procedure for choosing between alternative medical treatments. It is based on the realistic assumption that the health care system financial resources are scarce, and, consequently, the health provider compares competitor treatments based not only on their effectiveness but also on their cost. In this setting, statistical inference is applied for estimating the unknown parameters of the cost and effectiveness distribution of the treatments involved, or testing the equality of them. The samples of the treatments on which the inference is based typically come from k ≥ 2 health care centers. As far as we know, in the cost-effectiveness analysis literature it is taken for granted that samples from different health care centers have the same distribution. However, we argue that this unrealistic assumption can give misleading results, and, consequently, we formulate the cost-effectiveness Bayesian procedure for heterogeneous samples. The formulation of the cost-effectiveness for the case where homogeneity of the samples can be accepted is obtained as a particular case of our more general formulation.

For clarity, in the presentation we give a brief background of the cost-effectiveness problem, and the difficulties that are found when heterogeneity of the samples is present.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

A scheme of the cost-effectiveness analysis of medical treatments is as follows. A distribution f(ct, et
                        ) is assumed for the random vector (ct, et
                        ) that represents the cost and effectiveness of treatment t for 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1

                        . The net benefit zt
                         of treatment t is defined as the random variable

                                          t
                                       
                                       −

                        where R is the amount of money the health provider is willing to pay by the unit of effectiveness. It is assumed that (c
                        1, e
                        1) and (c
                        2, e
                        2) are independent, and hence the joint distribution of the net benefit (z

Then, the cost-effectiveness analysis consists of the decision problem of choosing between treatment 1 and 2 based on their net benefit distribution f(z
                        1, z
                        2|R). We note that the decision space of this problem is the set

                         is the state of nature space. Then, decision theory requires defining a non-negative utility function U(dt, z
                        1, z
                        2) on the product space 
                           
                              D
                              ×

                        1, z
                        2). Decision theory proves that the optimal decision is the one maximizing the expected utility, conditional on R, where the expected utility of decision dt
                         is given by

                        This utility function justifies the well-known incremental net benefit approach. Indeed, it is immediate to show that when using this utility function the optimal decision, conditional on R, turns out to be the decision that maximizes the expected net benefit, that is

                        The main difference between U
                        1 and U
                        2 is that when using U
                        1 transference of net benefit between patients is allowed, while when using U
                        2 it is not. Note that under U
                        2 the utility of each decision is a constant, regardless the amount of the net benefit increment between treatments.

Typically, we are not able to fully specify the distribution of the cost and the effectiveness of the treatment f(ct, et
                        ), and this model depends on unknown parameters θt
                         ∈ Θ, possibly multidimensional, so that f(ct, et
                        ) becomes f(ct, et
                        |θt
                        ) for 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1

                              2
                           
                        . Consequently, the net benefit distribution will also depend on θt
                        , and this introduces the need for statistical inference on θt
                         based on a sample of the cost and the effectiveness

                         are coming from different healthcare centers, a point that we discuss in the next section.

In practice, the data on the cost and effectiveness 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 c
                                 ˜
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 e
                                 ˜
                              
                              )
                           
                         of a given treatment are typically an aggregate of data coming from k different health care centers or clinical trials. It is arguable that a certain heterogeneity degree between centers is always present, even when the same treatment protocol be applied to all health care centers (Bhaumik et al., 2012; Canner, 1987; DuMouchel and Waternaux, 1992; Nixon and Thompson, 2005; Sutton and Higgins, 2008, among others).

This is an important issue because the presence of heterogeneity in the data implies that the likelihood (1) is no longer true, and the underlying model might be substantially different. As a result, the cost-effectiveness analysis for heterogenous samples might give a different optimal treatment than that we would obtained if homogeneity is imposed.

Therefore, the data 
                           
                              (

                         represents samples of size nj
                         from the distribution f(cj, ej
                        |θj
                        ) in center j. We certainly do not exclude the possibility that different health care centers could have the same distribution, so reducing the dimensionality of the underlying model and, consequently, sampling uncertainty.

Thus, our proposal is to first investigate which is the underlying model for the available data before the cost-effectiveness analysis is carried out. That is, we first group those samples having the same distribution, and then construct the likelihood accordingly. Unfortunately, this block clustering is carried out with uncertainty, and this model uncertainty should be incorporated into the cost-effectiveness analysis. This is a first difficulty to be considered.

On the other hand, for a specific clustering of the samples we certainly could carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis for each of the clusters, but in order to give a cost-effectiveness analysis unconditional to a specific clustering the resulting analyses from the clusters have to be pooled. This is a second difficulty.

To solve the first difficulty of grouping the samples drawn from the same distribution and measuring the uncertainty of this clustering, we will use a Bayesian model based clustering procedure. This Bayesian procedure also provides a measure of the uncertainty on the cluster structure of the observed data.

To solve the second difficulty of accounting for the variability across clusters, a Bayesian meta-analysis has to be applied. As we will show, this methodology is able to provide a unconditional cost-effectiveness analysis by pooling the conditional analyses on each cluster.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 a summary of the Bayesian product partition models (Barry & Hartigan, 1992; Casella, Moreno, & Girón, 2014) for analyzing the cluster structure of multicenter data is given. In Section 3 the cost-effectiveness analysis is reformulated from the meta-analysis viewpoint. The important case where the cost and the effectiveness are independent is also considered. In Section 4 the univariate normal case is developed. In Section 5 examples with real data to illustrate the cost-effectiveness methodology for heterogenous samples are given, and compared with previous analysis where heterogeneity is not considered. Section 6 contains concluding remarks.

Let f(cj, ej

                      is an unknown parameter in the space Θ. It is assumed that for i ≠ j, (ci, ei
                     ) and (cj, ej

We note that (2) and (3) represent two extreme situations of clustering and that intermediate situations, where the number of clusters in the samples is in between 1 and k, are certainly possible. Therefore, the problem is to know the cluster structure of the observed data 
                        
                           (

                     . This is a model selection problem in which the class of models is defined by the class of possible cluster models of the data. This model selection problem is focused here from the Bayesian viewpoint. We will use the product partition models approach introduced by Barry and Hartigan (1992) and further studied in Casella et al. (2014). To facilitate the reading of the paper we present here a short summary of the Bayesian cluster procedure.

                      defines the sampling model, so that partition and model are equivalent words in this context.

The partition

This prior used to be a useful prior distribution for model selection. Further, it is widely applied to different contexts, including cost-effectiveness analysis, change point problems, variable selection in regression, etc. (Berger, Bayarri, and Pericchi, 2013; Berger and Pericchi, 1996; 2001; Casella and Moreno, 2006; 2009; Girón, Moreno, and Casella, 2007; Girón, Moreno, Casella, and Martí nez, 2010; Moreno, Girón, and Casella, 2015; Moreno, Girón, and García Ferrer, 2013a; Moreno, Girón, Martínez, Vázquez-Polo, and Negrín, 2013b; among others).

                                  contain models of the same complexity, it seems reasonable to assign to these classes a uniform prior. Therefore, to define this uniform prior we only need to count the number of configuration classes in

                                 . We note that this number is also the number of ways the integer k can be partitioned into p integer parts, which we denote by b(k, p). This number does not seem to have a closed form expression as a function of p and k. However, it can be shown that b(k, p) satisfies the recursive equation

                        gives us a measure of the uncertainty we have on these models.

We recall that the predictive net benefit distribution is the central quantity of interest in the cost-effectiveness analysis of a medical treatment. For finding this distribution in the presence of heterogeneity, we provide formulae for computing the predictive distribution of the cost and the effectiveness, conditional on a generic cluster model, and the unconditional predictive distribution is computed as a mixture of these conditional predictive distributions with the posterior probabilities of the cluster models as the mixing distribution. Then, a simple change of variables in the unconditional predictive distribution provides the unconditional net benefit distribution we are looking for.

                      conditional on a partition, is obtained with the help of the Bayesian meta-analysis methodology, a point that we make precise in the next section.

The linking distribution is a distribution for the experimental parameter θj
                        , conditional on the meta-parameter θ. This conditional distribution π(θj
                        |θ) is of the utmost importance in meta-analysis. The linking distribution π(θj
                        |θ) cannot be arbitrarily chosen since the marginal π(θj
                        ) and π(θ) are given, so that we must ensure that the joint distribution

                        ) and π(θ). This is equivalently to impose that π(θj, θ) belongs to the Frèchet class. This way the experimental model Mj
                         and the meta-model M are coherent. This implies that the integral equations

                        |θ) it seems reasonable to assume that

In many real applications, cost and effectiveness variables present a behavior near to be considered statistically independent and therefore the assumption of independence between c and e is not a too restrictive assumption for practical purposes (Brailsford and Harper 2008; Vázquez-Polo, Negrín, Badía, and Roset 2005; among many others). In the presence of heterogeneity in the samples the predictive net benefit distribution cannot be derived from that given in (13) for the case where c and e are not independent. The reason will be apparent in this section.

When c and e are independent, the Bayesian clustering procedure should be applied to the cost samples

We start mentioning that for normal random variables

                     where θj
                      , σj
                      are the experimental mean and variance parameters, θ is the meta-parameter, and α, β, γ, α
                     1 and β
                     1 are hyperparameters. The parameter of interest is typically the meta-mean θ, and sometimes the so-called heterogeneity between center parameter τ
                     2 (Stojanovski & Mengersen, 2006). We complete the Bayesian modeling by introducing the meta-variable x which has now the normal distribution N(x|θ , σ
                     2), and keep in mind that our the quantity of interest is the predictive distribution of x.

A drawback of the above random effects normal model is that the experimental variance parameter 
                        
                           σ
                           
                              j
                           
                           2
                        
                      is not linking to the meta-parameters. As a consequence, the predictive distribution of the meta-variable x cannot be fully updated. A second difficulty is the elicitation of the hyperparameters α, β, γ, α
                     1 and β
                     1.

To avoid these drawbacks, we change this traditional Bayesian model for meta-analysis by assuming an objective prior for the experimental parameters θj
                      , σj
                     , and a linking distribution π(θj
                      , σj
                     |θ, σ) for both the mean and the variance parameters.

In what follows the objective Bayesian models for the observational experiments are

                        which is a proper distribution. We certainly can use this prior as a linking distribution. If fact, it can be easily proved that this linking distribution satisfies the basic requirement of having marginals πN
                        (θj, σj
                        ) and πN
                        (θ, σ). Unfortunately, the computation of the predictive distribution of the meta-variable x becomes rather involved. This computational problem can be alleviated by assuming homocedasticity. While this can be a reasonable restriction in linear models, it is less acceptable in the normal model with no covariate. For these reasons we will not use the conditional intrinsic prior as the linking distribution for normal models.

An alternative choice is a normal inverse-gamma distribution which has interesting properties. This distribution belongs to the Frèchet class, so that the experimental Bayesian models (17) and the meta-model (18) are coherent. Moreover, it has a good performance for clustering the k samples, and further provides a computable predictive distribution for the meta-variable x.

The next lemma proves that the linking distribution π(θj, σj
                        |θ, σ) in (19), and the marginals πN
                        (θj, σj
                        ) and πN
                        (θ, σ) are compatible.

In this section we give two applications of heterogenous cost-effectiveness analysis to real data sets. In the first application, the cost and the effectiveness data for two different treatments were collected in four centers. The unit of cost was the euro and the unit of effectiveness was related to the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) which is a measure of quality of life. It is assumed that the distribution of the cost and the effectiveness in each center is normal, and that they are independent random variables. The data are available as Supplementary material of the paper.

                        Example 1
                        The data were obtained from a study to compare three-methadone maintenance programs: high, medium and low intensity, for opioid-addicted patients (Puigdollers, Cots, Brugal, Torralba, & Domingo-Salvany, 2003). A 12-month follow-up study of 586 patients beginning methadone treatment at five Drug Care Centers in Barcelona was performed. At the time of the original study, year 1996, the data contain the 85% of the patient under these treatments in Barcelona. The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used to measure quality of life. The NHP is a generic and standardized measure of perceived health problems which can be used to evaluate disease and disability. It measures health-related quality of life in terms of the subjective emotional, functional and social impact of disease. Scores range from 0 (normal health) to 100 (very poor health). If NHP1 represents the value of NHP at the end of one month of treatment period and NHP0 the same valued at the beginning of treatment period, the effectiveness measure is then given by the difference NHP0-NHP1.

Although three methadone maintenance programs were compared in the original study, for simplicity of this illustration we only compare the medium-intensity program, to be denoted in the sequel as treatment T
                           1, and the high-intensity program, to be denoted as treatment T
                           2. To treatment T
                           1 were randomly assigned 126 patients, and 133 to treatment T
                           2. Both treatments were applied in four drug care centers, labelled as center 1 to 4. Table 1
                            shows the mean and standard deviation of the effectiveness and cost of our data set.

To these data sets we applied a cluster analysis and Table 2
                            displays the top cluster models for the original data from the four hospitals. This analysis shows that the effectiveness and cost data present a strong heterogeneous behavior for both treatments. The probability of the one cluster model {1, 2, 3, 4} is zero for any of the four data set.

The cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment T
                           1 and T
                           2 for the utility function U
                           1 for the heterogenous data is summarized by the continuous straight line in Fig. 1
                           . This line displays the expectation 
                              
                                 E
                                 (

                                    z
                                    2
                                 
                                 |
                                 R
                                 )
                              
                            as a function of R for R ∈ (0, 1000) euros, and the conclusion is that treatment T
                           1 is the optimal treatment for 0 < R < 122.7 euros, and T
                           2 is the optimal one for 122.7 < R < 1000.

If the heterogeneity of the data is not considered and if we assume instead that the data are homogeneous, the cost-effectiveness analysis is that given by the dashed straight line in Fig. 1. We note that in this latter case T
                           1 is an optimal treatment only for the range 0 < R < 36.8. Therefore, for R ∈ (36.8, 122.7) the homogeneous cost-effectiveness analysis chooses treatment T
                           2 while the heterogenous cost-effectiveness analysis chooses treatment T
                           1. The strength of the expected net-benefit considerably differs between the homogenous and heterogenous analysis.

                           2 is summarized by the continuous line in Fig. 2

                            as a function of R ∈ (0, 1000) euros. We recall that treatment T
                           1 is now preferred to T
                           2 if

                                 )

                                 0.5
                              
                           . The conclusion is that treatment T
                           1 is the optimal treatment for 0 < R < 122.7 euros, while treatment T
                           2 is optimal for 122.7 < R < 1000.

This conclusion does not coincide with the one we would obtain if homogeneity of the data from the four hospital were assumed. In this latter case the dashed line in Fig. 2 shows that treatment T
                           1 is preferred to T
                           2 only for 0 < R < 36.8.

                            which is a consequence of the underlying normal-normal model for the cost and the effectiveness (Moreno et al., 2010). However, the meaning and strength of the optimal treatment under U
                           1 and U
                           2 differ.

In the next Example 2 we consider the clinical trials conducted by Burns et al. (1999) in four health care centers for comparing intensive intervention and standard intervention for psychotic patients. The principal effectiveness outcome was the time in hospital for psychiatric problems over 24 months. As part of the baseline data, information was collected on the number of days each patient spent in hospital. The societal cost for each individual over 24 months was estimated by Nixon and Thompson (2005) who evaluated the cost of the treatments according to recorded resource use (including social, hospital and community components).

The effectiveness and cost of each treatment are assumed to be independent. The distribution for the effectiveness in each center is assumed to be normal, and that of the cost lognormal. This latter assumption implies that the expected net benefit does not exist (Moreno et al., 2010), and hence we use the criteria of choosing treatment T
                     1 if and only if

                        Example 2
                        Based on Burns et al. (1999),Nixon and Thompson (2005) consider data on costs and effectiveness for 667 randomized psychotic patients (332 patients under treatment T
                           1, and 335 patients under treatment T
                           2). The trials compared intensive intervention (treatment T
                           2, in which managers had a case load of 10–15 patients) with the standard intervention (treatment T
                           1, case loads of 30–35 patients).


                           Table 3
                            shows the mean and standard deviation of the observed cost and effectiveness in Example 2.

The rationale for the trial was that, by providing more intensive support, the patients’ use of health and other services might be reduced, and clinical outcomes might be improved. The effectiveness analysis by Burns et al. (1999) yields the authors to the conclusion that “There was no significant decline in overall hospital use among intensive-case-management patients”.

A clustering analysis of the data reveals the cluster structures we display in Table 4
                           , which clearly shows that the data are heterogenous.

                           2 is summarized in Fig. 3
                           , where the solid line displays the probability

                            as a function of R ∈ (0, 5000).

This solid line shows that for R ≤ 889 euros treatment T
                           1 is the optimal one, while for R ≥ 889 the optimal treatment is T
                           2. We note that the strength of this latter conclusion is not large for 889 ≤ R ≤ 3000, and becomes stronger as R increases.

Assuming that the data are homogeneous, the probability

                            as a function of R is given by the dashed line in Fig. 3. The cost-effectiveness conclusion would then be that treatment T
                           1 is the optimal one for any R.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the cost-effectiveness analysis of medical treatments, the cost and effectiveness data are collected in different centers, and the analysis is usually carried out for the aggregate data as if the distribution of the cost and the effectiveness does not vary across centers. However, even when the medical treatment protocols are the same, a certain heterogeneity degree between treatment effectiveness across centers is always present, and something similar can be said about the cost. DuMouchel and Waternaux (1992) assert that even when the study protocols are similar (dosage, length of treatment, control treatment) there is often considerable variation between studies.

To account for this variation, the standard cost-effectiveness methodology for homogeneous data has to be substantially modified to what we could call heterogenous cost-effectiveness analysis. The heterogenous cost-effectiveness analysis methodology presented in this paper involves a novel methodology with two different parts. A first part in which a Bayesian clustering procedure for detecting the heterogeneity is applied to the data, and a second part of Bayesian meta-analysis for taking into account the detected heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness analysis.

The examples we presented show that the optimal treatment under the homogeneity modeling does not necessarily coincide with that under the heterogeneity, so that to ignore the existing heterogeneity of the data yields suboptimal cost-effective treatments. Therefore, to apply the heterogenous cots-effectiveness analysis developed here is strongly recommended. We note that the heterogeneous cost-effectiveness analysis reproduces the cost-effectiveness analysis for homogenous data.

The heterogeneous cost-effectiveness analysis presents difficulties related to the computation of the clusters when the number of hospitals is moderately large, a point that deserves research. On the other hand, covariates have already been incorporated in the cost-effectiveness analysis literature providing the interesting subgroup analysis (Moreno et al., 2013a; Moreno, Girón, Vázquez-Polo, and Negrín, 2012 and references therein). It is of interest to see how the heterogeneous cost-effectiveness analysis reacts with the incorporation of such a covariates.
