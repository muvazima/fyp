                  Innovative approaches to the assessment and management of medical technologies use a combination of health technology assessment (HTA) and operations research methods, specifically multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The purpose of this article is to develop methodological support and provide a theoretical justification for decision support in the selection of medical devices under conditions of uncertainty, using MRI systems as an example. The goal of the method application has been formulated as follows: determine a ranked list of MRI systems for contributory health organisations administered by regional authorities (regional hospitals) in the Czech Republic. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Delphi method were used to identify experts’ preferences and for consensus building. The expert group was selected based on eight complex-valued criteria, and each expert was given a weighting factor. A set of 13 MRI systems and the 14 key default specifications that play the most important roles when hospitals select MRIs for purchase were defined. Strong conformity (W ≥ 0.6, p < 0.05) within the experts' judgments was revealed. A prediction regarding alternatives, weights and changes in priority vectors over the following 8 years has been provided. The developed approach is useful in decision support when selecting medical devices under conditions of uncertainty by hospitals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Medical technologies (MTs) play one of the largest roles in growth of health expenditures (Ivlev, Kneppo, & Bartak, 2014) and, more than many other factors, influence processes in the healthcare system (Willemé & Dumont, 2014). MTs are the main element causing increases in financial expenses in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (World Health Organization, 2010). The global market for medical device (MD) technologies reached US $411.8 billion in 2013 and is expected to climb to $538.7 billion by 2018 (BCC Research LLC, 2014) as a result of many factors (Sastri, 2014).

To provide access to new or expensive technologies under resource-limited conditions, health technology assessment (HTA) methods are most commonly utilised (Barron, Klinger, Shah, & Wright, 2015; Goeree & Diaby, 2013). Innovative approaches for the assessment and management of MTs use a combination of HTA and operations research methods, specifically multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) (Diaby, Campbell, & Goeree, 2013; Endrei, Molics, & Agoston, 2014; Padilla-Garrido, Aguado-Correa, Cortijo-Gallego, & López-Camacho, 2014; Reddy, Kelly, Thokala, Walters, & Duenas, 2014).

Complexity in healthcare decision-making is associated with a high degree of responsibility on the part of decision-makers (DMs) in regard to outcomes, which may affect the quality of life of the individual patients and/or the community as a whole (Diaby et al., 2013). Decision-making processes related to the management and assessment of MDs are fraught with uncertainty (Barberá-Tomás & Consoli, 2012; Retèl, Grutters, van Harten, & Joore, 2013) due to the presence of (1) various stakeholders aims (Marsh, Lanitis, Neasham, Orfanos, & Caro, 2014; Schuwirth, Reichert, & Lienert, 2012) and the aims of other participants, such as governments, hospitals (Sorenson & Kanavos, 2011), insurance companies, physicians (Ulucanlar, Faulkner, Peirce, & Elwyn, 2013), patients, etc. (Scholten, Schuwirth, Reichert, & Lienert, 2015); (2) various supplier policies (Sorenson & Kanavos, 2011) (differences in purchase prices or the heterogeneous presentation of information about the units); (3) requirements of the DMs to understand the economic environment, the technical and organisational requirements and the social consequences of the decisions made (Goetghebeur et al., 2012), and (4) the various objectives of the clinical application. Uncertainty in this work is understood as explained in the paper (Scholten et al., 2015). The points described above, along with other ‘internal’ and ‘external’ uncertainties (Durbach & Stewart, 2012), cause difficulty in decision-making during the selection of MDs and often make it impossible to predict the future effect of any given decision. Thus, the process of selection and the events that follow purchasing take place in a multidimensional space in which most criteria are parameters of a function of time.

The selection process is an important part of a complex purchasing process. The issue of MDs purchasing is very important and calls for much attention (World Health Organization, 2010). Work to formalise the process of controlling MDs is underway (Cruz, Haugan, & Rincon, 2014; Grennan, 2014; Pecchia et al., 2013). MDs’ methods of purchase stand out significantly in the set of controlling tasks (Brown, Smale, & Wong, 2006). Methodological recommendations (Angelo, 2009) describe a range of organisational and technical questions that must be answered by DMs at the equipment-selection stage. Usually, materials describing decision-making do not go beyond defining the need for the new equipment, the need to replacement of the old equipment, and the abilities of the medical institution, in addition to revealing the most critical technical parameters (Lerski, Nicholas, Macfarlane, Waugh, & McComb, 2010) that are sufficient for the equipment to fulfil its clinical tasks.

Finding the vector of priorities for a small number of alternatives and criteria is often easy (Brunelli & Fedrizzi, 2015). Because MDs have so many demands and specifications, it is difficult to understand and acquire the relevant knowledge because of its heterogeneous nature. Clearly, MDs selection processes operate within a wide range of categories, which result in the need to take into account safety, scientific and technological progress and changing requirements for economic and social efficiency. An inefficient and irrational choice on the part of MDs may cause the ineffective operation of devices, additional financial losses and unsatisfactory medical service and healthcare quality.

Because of the aforementioned and with the aim of reducing financial costs in the global system of public health, mistakes in the control system and the misuse of funds, there is a need to create a system for the selection of MDs (Ivlev et al., 2014). The purpose of this article is to provide methodological support and a theoretical justification for that support for selecting MDs in uncertain conditions, using the selection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems for contributory health organisations administered by regional authorities (hereinafter referred to as “regional hospitals”) in the Czech Republic as an example. The regional hospitals in the Czech Republic are owned by the regional government, and this group of hospitals is the largest provider of country's inpatient acute care (Roubal & Sidlo, 2014).

The goal of the developed approach application has been formulated as follows: determine a ranked list of MRI systems for regional hospitals in the Czech Republic. The list of alternatives and the most important specifications should be defined. An expert panel should be used to evaluate the criteria and alternatives. The competence of the experts should be identified and reflected in each expert's weighting coefficients. An informed decision based on expertise should be obtained.

The analysis (Ivlev et al., 2014) of MCDA methods applications demonstrated that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method corresponds to major defined criteria for the selection of large medical equipment because of axiom of homogeneity and the hierarchical decomposition principle.

For the purpose of determining the alternatives, MRI systems from nine manufacturers of MDs (Aurora Imaging Technology Inc.; Esaote SpA; GE Healthcare; Hitachi Medical Corp.; InnerVision MRI Ltd.; Neusoft Corp.; Philips Healthcare; Siemens Healthcare; Toshiba Medical Systems Corp.) available in the European market (ECRI Institute, 2013) were studied. All 44 alternatives, along with their default specifications, were analysed in terms of their inclusion in the study group. All manufacturers were contacted with the aim of identifying additional alternatives available on the Czech market or alternatives that will be offered on or removed from the Czech market. Based on the task, the following requirements were applied to all alternatives: (1) a device must be available on the market in the Czech Republic at the beginning of the study, (2) a device should be available for purchase, (3) a device should not be taken out of production over the four years after the beginning of the study, (4) the device should offer a clinical application for the whole body without any dedicated scanners and (5) the magnetic field strength should be 1.5 T. After all limitations were imposed, the 13 MRI systems (Appendix D and Suppl. 1) were selected for future assessment.

The list of key specifications that play the most important roles when selecting MRI systems for purchase by hospitals were defined based on the literature review (ECRI Institute, 2013; Price, Delakis, Renaud, & Dickinson, 2008). Specific values for the default specifications were obtained from a report published by the ECRI Institute (2013) and information provided by the manufacturers and official suppliers of MRI systems in the Czech Republic.

Within the framework of this research, we proposed to use a web-oriented means of polling using a Delphi multi-round polling procedure, with the aim of achieving consensus (Theißen & Spinler, 2014). The hybrid hierarchical decision model is used in this study (Appendix A). First, the objective or the overall goal of the decision is presented at the top level of the hierarchy “select new MRI system for regional hospitals in the Czech Republic”. In the first round, the experts compared the selection criteria and then compared the MRI systems relative to each criterion. The titles of the MRIs’ systems were hidden from the experts. The data received from the experts was processed to determine the mean and extreme values of the evaluations. The results of the each round were reported to the experts. If an expert's evaluation deviated significantly from the weighted mean value, the expert was asked to provide reasons for the opinion or to correct it. The experts' responses remained anonymous, which allowed us to avoid the influence of any authority.

An expert panel was constructed based on the following method (Ivlev, Kneppo, & Bartak, 2015). This approach was devoted to bringing together subjective and objective experts’ characteristics, with the aim of determining each expert's total weighting factor (We
                        ), which reflects the overall competence of that expert in terms of solving problem. The weighting factor is based on the expert's overall work experience, experience in solving tasks, level of education, scientific record, interest in solving this particular problem, current position and awareness of how to solve the problem. This study also considered the relevance of the experts’ knowledge and their overall self-evaluation regarding their total competence in solving the task. Experts were interviewed through a web-based questionnaire.

A comparison of the criteria used by the expert panel was conducted. The question for the experts was formulated as follows: “Which of the specifications is most important in the selection of a new MRI system for regional hospitals in the Czech Republic?” Each expert rated the specifications independently from other experts through a Web-based application (Section 3.3). The matrices for the pairwise comparisons of the criteria and alternatives were obtained from each expert.

An assessment of the consistency ratio (CR) and consistency index (CI) were defined, as was recommended (Dahal, Al-Arfaj, & Paudyal, 2015; Saaty, 1980). The random consistency index (RI) was selected based on the data (Forman, 1990). The results of the paired comparisons were deemed inconsistent when CR > 0.1 and were returned to an expert for corrections, which must be guaranteed (Anojkumar, Ilangkumaran, & Sasirekha, 2014).

To establish a measure of the consistency of the experts' opinions, we propose using Kendall's dispersive coefficient of concordance (correlation coefficient) (Gibbons, 1993). A matrix of the ranking results for n objects by m experts

If related ranks are present in the rankings (Pavlov & Sokolov, 2005), then the maximum value of dispersions in the previous formula becomes smaller than in the absence of related rankings.

The verification of the significance W is performed according to the procedure for the verification of the statistical hypotheses. When the critical value n ≤ 7, the use of an F-distribution is recommended (Siegel & Castellan, 1988). When there is a relatively large number of assessed objects (n > 7), then the verification of significance W is performed using the significance of Pearson's chi-square test (Kapetanopoulou & Tagaras, 2011; Legendre, 2005). In accordance with the level of significance α and the number of degrees of freedom

                           , then at the level of significance α, we have reason to reject the hypotheses that have been put forward. The significance of the concordance coefficient is difficult to assess with small numbers of objects n. This allows us to test W for statistical significance. If the hypothesis of the homogeneity of the group evaluations is proven wrong, the possible actions are as follows: (1) to return the results of the assessment to the experts for the correction of their judgments according to the judgment of the majority, (2) to exclude from further analysis the alternatives or characteristics with the largest scattering of evaluations and (3) to exclude the experts whose opinion differed the most from the opinion of the group. After the corrections and other actions described above, it becomes necessary to determine the object to be excluded by comparing the mean-square deviations of the ranks for each of the objects.

After each expert was assigned his/her weighting factor (Appendix C), using the developed software (Section 3.3), we conducted a comparison of alternatives and criteria, and n matrices of pairwise comparisons of alternatives were obtained from m experts, where n is the number of selection criteria. A matrix of pairwise comparisons of the specifications with respect to the aim of the selection was obtained from each expert. The objective was to obtain a weighted matrix of the combined experts' judgments. The matrix should (1) reflect the opinions of the experts and (2) take into account the competence of each expert regarding the importance of MRI specifications and alternatives. The use of a weight function in solving this task is proposed. The resulting set of matrices is named the ‘super expert matrix’ or ‘super expert’ judgment:

                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     

The following designations were introduced: k is the number of the analysed alternatives, n is the number of analysed criteria, m is the number of experts involved in the selection and Ne
                         is the serial number of an expert. Calculations must be produced to obtain a super expert matrix (see the scheme in Fig. 1

The judgments of many experts were combined. The experts' weights were considered to be the weight or probability of their making the right decision. The ‘super expert’ matrix judgments were obtained after combining all judgments from all experts.

When implementing the method of selecting MRI systems, the price of the products, an important characteristic, was not taken into account. Price was not considered due to the lack of reliable information on the real market prices in the Czech Republic. Prices for MRI systems in the U.S. market are used to demonstrate how to take prices into account. All alternatives (Table 6) have been considered separately from their cluster. After assessing the importance of all criteria (except price) and after assessing all alternatives with respect to each criterion, a priority vector for alternatives was obtained (A), and each price corresponds to an alternative (B).

In general, the task of considering the price when determining a ranked list of alternatives is as follows. Prices should be normalised. The overall vector of priorities is the quotient of a priority vector bn
                         and a corresponding value pn
                        . Thus, there arises the task of dividing the elements of the vector with length n by a number:

Priority vector W is a vector of priorities with the prices of products.

According to various sources, the lifespan for MRI systems as high-tech medical diagnostic equipment ranges from 5 (Nevada Department of Taxation, 2010; Temple-Bird, Kawohl, Lenel, & Kaur, 2005) to 6 (Arizona Department of Revenue, 2012) years, or the lifecycle may be considered equal to 10 years (Chakravarty & Naware, 2008). One report claimed (Keller, 2005) that at least 60 percent of MRIs should be less than 5 years old and that no more than 30 percent of the devices should be 6 to 10 years old. Thus, as a border for the prediction period, 4 years, approximately half the lifespan of an MRI system, was chosen. To identify changes in priorities over a period of 4 years, the same expert group was interviewed again. The design for obtaining expert judgments corresponds to the method described above. The experts were tasked with assessing the importance of specifications when selecting MRI systems 4 years later. Weights (Suppl. 4, Table S.4.1) and ranked lists of alternatives and criteria were obtained. Special aspects of the experts' forecasting affect the reliability of the predictions. In this paper, the reliability of the forecast was provided by (1) the qualitative and quantitative composition of the expert group and (2) the justification and adequacy of the expert information retrieval technologies. The consistency of the experts’ views, as an integral estimate of the a priori reliability of the expert forecast, was evaluated.

To implement long-term reprioritisation prediction, the weights of the specifications 4 years later were defined (Suppl. 4, Table S.4.1.) by the experts. The task of assessing the importance of the specifications 4 years ago was also given to the experts. The experts’ judgments regarding design and processing were similar, as in Section 2.7.1. Changing the weights of the specifications has been considered a stochastic (random) process. The weights of specifications at a point in time 4 years ago, at the current point in time, and at a point in time 4 years from now were used for a prediction. The fundamental concept of the method is based on the assumption that the law of variation of a variable, which has been identified in the past, can be predicted at a certain time interval in the future. To predict changes in the weights of criteria at the fourth and fifth levels of the hierarchical model, 8 years from now, Brown's method linear exponential smoothing, which provides good reliability and has often been successfully applied before (Costantino, Di Gravio, Shaban, & Tronci, 2015), was used.

The list of 14 key specifications that play the most important roles when selecting MRI systems for purchase by hospitals has been defined (Appendix D). Based on the formulated criteria, a set of 13 alternatives has been selected (Appendix D). All alternatives were located on the sixth level of the hybrid hierarchical model for the selection of MRI systems for regional hospitals in the Czech Republic.

The developed method (Section 2.2) was used to determine the qualitative composition of an expert panel and the weighting factor regarding the importance of experts’ judgments for the purpose of participating in decision-making. For the purpose of developing the expert group, 60 web-based questionnaires were sent to potential experts (physicians, biomedical engineers, radiological assistants, medical physicists, etc.) at 34 health facilities at all levels of organisations in the Czech Republic where MRI systems are based. Nineteen (31.7%) potential experts responded to the questionnaire. The qualitative composition in terms of the jobs and positions of the potential experts who responded corresponds to the composition of the potential experts to whom the questionnaire was sent. After the evaluation, each of the potential experts was given his or her own weighting factor (Table 1
                        ) regarding the importance of their judgments.

The equity structure (Appendix B) of the total weight of the potential experts was defined. Thereby, we obtain a representative expert panel that has sufficient experience and knows the required specifications from the point of view of MRI selection and application.

To ensure the success of the process of collecting experts’ evaluations, a Web-based application has been developed. In the structure (Fig. 2
                        ) of the application, three levels can be distinguished: the presentation level, the business level and the data layer. The application was written in the PHP programming language. The CakePHP engine was used, and an Apache Web server managed the application.

A pairwise graphical comparison scale has been used, with the aim of avoiding the disadvantages (Ivlev et al., 2014) of the AHP scale. A data pre-processing algorithm (Fig. 2) has been implemented. The algorithm has been created with the following aims: (1) to increase consistency, (2) to reduce the number of pairs of comparisons and (3) to increase the speed of examination. All alternatives that have the same specification values (within one specification) have been given the same weight. Identical pairs of paired comparisons were identified. Afterwards, the experts evaluated only one of the identical pairs, and scores were assigned to all such pair comparisons.

For the purpose of conformity assessment, the method described above was used. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used for assessing the agreement among raters.

The calculations for one criterion (z-axis standard strength, [millitesla/metre]) are shown to clarify the computation process. A matrix (Table 2
                           ) of the normalised experts' judgments regarding the specification according to each alternative was built. In the next step, ranks were assigned to each judgment. In the presented example, the seven experts made judgments regarding the z-axis standard strength (m = 7) and evaluated 13 MRI systems (n = 13).

In addition, the quantity of the groups of ties in the set of ranks

Consistency and other characteristics of the alternatives were calculated in the same manner. The conformity of the experts’ judgments about the characteristics and alternatives was calculated in the same manner.

The number of objects (sites) are used as the rows of the data table n = 13, as described above. The verification the null hypothesis was performed using Pearson's chi-square test. The empirical value for the z-axis standard strength specification was calculated as

                           , and at the significance level α = 0.999, there is reason to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that Kendall's coefficient of concordance is significantly different from zero. Strong conformity among the experts' judgments has been revealed.

The following results (Appendix A) were obtained by applying the calculation model described above. Ranked lists of criteria (Table 5) and sub-criteria were determined. The weight subsystems and specifications of MRI systems (Table 4
                        ) were determined as the sum of the respective nodes (Appendix A).

This modification is in contrast to the classical pathway for determining the weights of sub-criteria in AHP. As seen from Table 5
                        , the weights of the specifications vary in the range of 0.025–0.110. The distance between adjacent specifications is often small, despite the fact that the distance between the extreme values, is significant.

It was determined that currently, the most important elements are the main magnet system, at 61.7 percent, and the gradient system, at 19.7 percent. Less important are RF transmission and receipt, at 10.1 percent; the patient table, at 5.8 percent, and patient comfort, at 2.7 percent. When considering the weight of the upper layer, it has been determined that the technical features are decisive (72.5 percent). Less important are ease of use (21.0 percent) and safety (6.5 percent). As a result of processing the information provided by the expert panel the weights and priorities of the alternatives were identified (Table 6
                        ). The total vector is obtained by multiplying the priority of each criterion times the priority of each alternative with respect to it and summing. The overall priority vector is presented by normalised vector that was calculated by dividing each element in the totals vector by the sum of its elements.

A ranked list of alternatives from most to least suitable with regard to the stated goal was created. The weight range of the alternatives [0.058; 0.101] is less stretched and the distance between the extremes is smaller than those of the weights of the criteria. The distances between adjacent values are often very small or non-existent. In both cases (alternatives and specifications), it is notable that the weights between adjacent groups vary discontinuously. This fact provided grounds to assume the presence of homogeneous groups (clusters) that have equal importance in a group. Priorities, inconsistencies and the weights of alternatives with respect to criteria may be found in Suppl. 2.

For the purpose of identifying homogeneous groups of specifications and alternatives, hierarchical cluster analysis was applied. As a result, all the specifications have been divided into four clusters (Table 5), and all alternatives were divided into three clusters (Table 6). Analyses were run using SPSS software.

It was determined that when selecting an MRI system, the largest weights are given to the following specifications (Table 5), which are related to the first cluster: shimming, gradient standard strength, guaranteed homogeneity, frequency drift and standard number of channels. The specifications of the second cluster are the configuration, the standard slew rate, and the dimensions of the maximum useful FOV. The bore diameter at the isocenter is the only specification of the third cluster, which was formed at the fifth stage of the cluster analysis. The smallest weights were assigned to the following specifications: shielding, the table load limit, the table dimensions, the maximum sound pressure level at the peak gradient amplitude and the cryogen refill frequency. Based on the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis, all the alternatives could be divided into three clusters. The importance of alternatives within clusters can be considered homogeneous.

Given the formulated goal, the MRI systems from the first cluster can be regarded as the most suitable. The MRIs from the second cluster can be considered as alternatives in the second selection queue. The MRIs from the third cluster are alternatives in the last selection queue.

Border areas of insensitivity for each specification are given (see Table 7
                        ).

The minimum and maximum values of the weights correspond to the extreme values of the weights of the specifications when at least one alternative moves from one cluster to another. The insensitive zone was determined using the ExpertChoice 11.5 (Expert Choice, 2013) software. This approach to the analysis of the sensitivity of the decision is proven (Ishizaka & Labib, 2009) and has been used successfully in recent studies (Barker & Zabinsky, 2011; Cho & Lee, 2013; Frikha & Moalla, 2014).

Thus, for the insensitive zone of the decision, we provide the range of the weights of the characteristics, within which the structure of (1) all the clusters remain unchanged (all the alternatives remain in their clusters) (Fig. 3
                        A); (2) the first cluster remains in place; i.e., both alternatives remain the best choice from among the first cluster (Fig. 3B) and (3) the first alternative retains its leading position (Fig. 3C). A detailed dynamic analysis of the sensitivity of the decision with regard to the best alternative is demonstrated in Suppl. 3. In the first stage, the resistance of all clusters of alternatives to any change in the balance of specification weights was investigated. The deadband borders (Fig. 3A) indicate the boundary values of the weights of specifications in which the structure of the clusters (Table 6) does not change.

The boundaries inside all clusters remain unchanged. Through the use of hierarchical cluster analysis, it has been found that, in this case, the specifications can be divided into three clusters based on their resistance: (1) the least sensitive specifications (frequency drift and shielding), (2) specifications with average sensitivity (configuration and table load limit) and (3) the most sensitive specifications (standard slew rate, gradient standard strength, table dimensions, shimming, dimensions of maximum useful FOV, standard number of channels, guaranteed homogeneity, bore diameter at the isocenter, maximum sound pressure level at peak gradient amplitude, and cryogen refill frequency).

In the next stage, the resistance of the first clusters of alternatives to change in the balance of the specification weights was investigated. The deadband borders (Fig. 3B) indicate the boundary values of the specification weights within which the structure of the first cluster (Table 6) remained the leading one. The boundaries within which the composition of the first cluster remained unchanged have been found. It has been found that in this case, all the specifications can be divided into three clusters based on their resistance: (1) the least sensitive specifications (frequency drift, dimensions of maximum useful FOV, shielding and shimming); (2) specifications with average sensitivity (configuration, gradient standard strength and table load limit) and (3) the most sensitive specifications (maximum sound pressure level at peak gradient amplitude, table dimensions, guaranteed homogeneity, standard slew rate, standard number of channels, bore diameter at the isocenter and cryogen refill frequency).

The resistance of the best alternatives to a change in the balance of the weights of the specifications has been investigated (Table 6). The deadband borders (Fig. 3C) indicate the boundary values of the specification weights in which the structure of the best alternative (Table 6) remained the leading one. Through the use of hierarchical cluster analysis, it has been found that in this case, all the specifications can be divided into three clusters based on their resistance: (1) the least sensitive specifications (shimming, standard slew rate, gradient standard strength, shielding and frequency drift); (2) the specifications with average sensitivity (guaranteed homogeneity, configuration and maximum sound pressure level at peak gradient amplitude) and (3) the most sensitive specifications (dimensions of maximum useful FOV, table load limit, standard number of channels, bore diameter at isocenter, table dimensions and cryogen refill frequency).

During the analysis, it was identified (Table 8
                        ) that within the ranked list of alternatives (Table 6), the GE Healthcare Discovery MR450 alternative was the most suitable choice.

The weight of all the specifications that are not sensitive or have an average sensitivity is 67.1 percent. The remaining, more sensitive specifications comprised only 32.9 percent of the total weight. When analysing the first cluster of alternatives (Table 6), it was determined that the first two clusters of specifications (Table 8) contribute 56.1 percent of the total weight. The sensitive specifications contribute 43.9 percent of the weight.

Naturally, when trying to preserve the structure of all the clusters of alternatives (Table 6), the insensitive zone (Fig. 3A) is smaller than in the other (Fig. 3B and C) cases. The insensitive zone of the decision (Fig. 3B) contains a larger quantity of more severe specifications than in Fig. 3C. Thus, it was shown that the GE Healthcare Discovery MR450 and Seimens Magnetom Aera 1.5 T were the best choices within the task of MRI system selection for regional hospitals in the Czech Republic.

As a result of the study, (1) the priority vector for MRIs and (2) the normalised prices of the devices were obtained (Table 9
                        ).

With the demonstrated method, it is possible to calibrate the priorities given a known price. It should be noted that the price is thus endowed with a very high weight, which is not always justified in healthcare.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

The analysis (Ivlev et al., 2014) showed that explored MCDA methods have a significant drawback: the methods do not take into account the competence of the experts in the task of the selection of MDs. Our research was devoted to overcoming the described weakness. As a consequence of the application of the aforementioned methods and approaches, a ranked list of specifications and alternatives has been obtained. In contrast to the approach described by Saaty (1980), in our method, the weights of the upper layer of criteria have been calculated as the sum of the elements’ lower levels. The reason approach was used is based on the fact that MRI is a sophisticated piece of equipment and consists of multiple integrated subsystems. The way of presenting helps stakeholders (DMs, biomedical and clinical engineers, manufactures, etc.) to understand the structure of local weights (current and predicted) of MRI technical subsystems.

When analysing the importance weights of the criteria and alternatives, it was determined that the weights sometimes differed by hundredths or thousandths, so distances between adjacent values are often very close. Despite the slight differences in the weights, these differences determine the sequence of the alternatives on the ranked list. Obviously, when assessing sophisticated systems such as MRIs, a small difference in the weights of the elements may be a consequence of random errors or other factors. Alternatively, small differences could be explained by a lack of clarity in the measurement scale and the complexity of verbalising expert knowledge. To minimise the impact of all unaccounted factors and other uncertainties, we proposed a solution: devices that were in the same cluster were considered equivalent for the purpose of selection. This fact provided grounds to assume the presence of homogeneous clusters whose members have equal importance in a group. This idea is rare in MCDA methods application, but it corresponds to recent studies (Li & Chou, 2014).

In the research, price was endowed with a very high weight, which is not always justified in healthcare. It is possible to use a certain price when selecting alternatives by applying cluster analysis. A ranked list of alternatives in the first cluster may be considered a new ranking list adjusted for price. Price should be the subject of detailed consideration in each decision. The importance of price must be addressed via a particular decision-making process to account for other factors affecting the choice of MDs.

In the current paper, BOCR (benefits, opportunities, costs and risks) analysis was used in combination with pairwise comparisons (Bouzarour-Amokrane, Tchangani, & Peres, 2015; Wijnmalen, 2007). The difference from the typical use of these analyses is that the model was reduced. This reduction is the removal of benefits from the model. An important condition for the creation and application of diagnostic tests or methods is to maximise their sensitivity and specificity. Thus, the benefits of the application of diagnostic tests or devices may be assessed in terms of the probability of a correct diagnosis. The result of the use of MRIs is a series of pictures that will be used by a physician to describe morphological changes in tissues and then make a diagnosis. For this reason, the task of assessing the benefits of diagnostic procedures is reduced to an estimation of the likelihood of errors of the first and second kind by physicians (although errors of the first kind are not always critical in the diagnostic process). Hence, a direct assessment of the benefits of diagnostic procedure/devices is impossible when the medical findings of the application of a technology depend on the physician. The consideration of the likelihood of errors by a physician as an indicator of the effectiveness of an application of procedures or devices is also inappropriate.

According to long-term forecasting, the priorities of MRI subsystems will change in the future. We associate a slight decrease in the importance of the main magnet subsystem for MRI selection with its current high development. Some specifications have achieved near maximum or sufficient indicators, and their improvement will not significantly affect the diagnostic value of MRI applications. Conversely, an increased technical value for the gradient standard strength and a decreased technical value for the standard slew rate are desirable. Though the confidence interval for predicted values currently overlaps the weights, it may be assumed that increasing certain other specifications will not have a positive or negative effect in the future.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper has presented methodological support and a theoretical justification for decision support for selecting MDs under conditions of uncertainty. The developed algorithm (Appendix C) has been tested for the task of MRI system selection on the part of regional hospitals in the Czech Republic.

Depending on the goals of the expert evaluation, the following main tasks are required to process the survey results. It was suggested that during the first step in the selection of requirements, alternatives and criteria should be provided. Second, it is important to determine the experts' competences and build an expert group. Each expert should receive his or her own weighting factor regarding the importance of that expert's judgments. Third, it is important to determine the generalised evaluations and ranks of the objects by expert group.

The MCDA approach presented in the paper was based on the AHP technique. The Delphi method is recommended for consensus-building, i.e., using a series of the Web-based questionnaires delivered in multiple iterations to collect experts’ opinions. Various strategies for achieving the best conformity and consistency may be used. The method of merging experts’ judgments has been created and justified. The method is intended to bring together the opinions of many experts in accordance with their competencies. As a result of the application of the method, it is possible to obtain the unified opinion of a ‘super expert’, which is weighted according to all experts. After a unified decision is obtained, a sensitivity analysis should be provided. This paper suggests the use of cluster analysis to find groups of alternatives and criteria having homogeneous importance. Thus, a group of the best alternatives will be presented to a DM. Another important task is to make the results of an assessment more flexible when as times change and thus provide sensitivity to a change in the ranked list over time. It was suggested that Brown's method of linear exponential smoothing may be used for long-term forecasting.

Future work will be devoted to creating a decision support system for the selection of MDs. The system should take into account a wider range of selection criteria, such as the clinical effectiveness, patients’ preferences, medical purpose of an application, easy of use, reliability characteristics and safety, maintenance requirements, total cost of ownership, and sales contract terms and conditions. Our feature work will also focus on comparative modelling of a range of MCDA methods' results for the selection of medical equipment.
