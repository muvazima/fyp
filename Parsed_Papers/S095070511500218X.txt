                  We mainly study the low-rank image recovery problem by proposing a bilinear low-rank coding framework called Tensor Low-Rank Representation. For enhanced low-rank recovery and error correction, our method constructs a low-rank tensor subspace to reconstruct given images along row and column directions simultaneously by computing two low-rank matrices alternately from a nuclear norm minimization problem, so both column and row information of data can be effectively preserved. Our bilinear approach seamlessly integrates the low-rank coding and dictionary learning into a unified framework. Thus, our formulation can be treated as enhanced Inductive Robust Principal Component Analysis with noise removed by low-rank representation, and can also be considered as the enhanced low-rank representation with a clean informative dictionary via low-rank embedding. To enable our method to include outside images, the out-of-sample extension is also presented by regularizing the model to correlate image features with the low-rank recovery of the images. Comparison with other criteria shows that our model exhibits stronger robustness and enhanced performance. We also use the outputted bilinear low-rank codes for feature learning. Two unsupervised local and global low-rank subspace learning methods are proposed for extracting image features for classification. Simulations verified the validity of our techniques for image recovery, representation and classification.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vision data (e.g., images) and non-vision data in the real-world emerging applications, such as face recognition [13,21,27,39], robust alignment of images [26], and document retrieval, can usually be characterized by using high-dimensional attributes or features. Also, plenty of real-world multimedia data, including images, videos and documents, can also be characterized by low-rank subspaces, so recent decade has witnessed lots of efforts and increasing attention on the research of recovering low-dimensional or low-rank structures from high-dimensional data with important information in data preserved by feature learning or low-rank coding. Representative works dedicated to these topics include [1–11,15,26,33–38,41–46,50,56]. In this paper, we mainly focus on the study on the bilinear low-rank coding for image recovery, error correction and image representation.

One most representative low-rank recovery criterion is named Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) [3,8,9,16]. For a given observed data matrix

                     . Note that RPCA can well address gross corruptions with large magnitude if only a fraction of entries are corrupted [3,6]. But RPCA is a transductive model, so it cannot handle new data [6]. Besides, RPCA implicitly assumes that the underlying data structures lie in or lie near a single low-rank subspace, but most real data are described by using a union of multiple subspaces [1,2], so the recovery of RPCA may be inaccurate in reality. To enable RPCA for including outside data, Inductive Robust Principal Component Analysis (IRPCA) [6] was recently proposed by seeking a low-rank projection

                      by IRPCA. Based on the learnt U, given data can be mapped onto the underlying subspaces and the possible corruptions can be efficiently removed [6]. Note that IRPCA performs recovery along column direction of X, so row information of data is lost by IRPCA.

To well address mixed data with (grossly) corrupted observations, another low-rank criterion called Low-Rank Representation (LRR) [1,2] was also recently proposed for subspace recovery, clustering and segmentation. For subspace segmentation, LRR aims at computing a low-rank representation

                     . Different from IRPCA, LRR recovers or segments given data along row direction, but column information of given matrix is similarly lost by LRR. Note that LRR is also a transductive criterion as RPCA, so it cannot handle new points efficiently. As a result, both LRR and RPCA are inappropriate for the practical applications requiring fast online computation [6]. For image recovery and subspace segmentation, LRR applies the matrix X itself as dictionary, so it requires that sufficient noiseless data is available in dictionary (i.e., only a part of D is corrupted). But most real data are contaminated by various errors, e.g., corruptions and noise, so directly setting X itself as dictionary may be invalid and may depress the robustness performance for subspace recovery and segmentation [11,23].

To overcome the shortcomings of LRR and IRPCA for image recovery, we incorporate the concept of tensor representation [12,28,30] into the low-rank recovery and present a bilinear coding criterion, Tensor Low-Rank Representation (TLRR), for enhancing the robustness of image recovery to noise, corruptions or missing values in data. Compared with the existing studies, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, to enhance the robustness to noise and corruptions, and to well handle data with missing values, our TLRR aims to reconstruct given images along row and column directions at the same time by embedding data onto a low-rank tensor subspace spanned by seeking a pair of low-rank matrices alternately from a nuclear norm minimization problem. Besides, TLRR exhibits a strong generalization power. The modeling of TLRR seamlessly integrates the low-rank representation and dictionary learning into a unified framework, that is, it can perform simultaneous subspace recovery, error correction and dictionary learning. As a result, when learning a low-rank projection to construct a clean informative dictionary, TLRR is considered as an “enhanced” version of IRPCA based on the noise and corruptions removed data. Similarly, when learning the low-rank representation for image recovery, TLRR is regarded as enhanced LRR learning with trained low-rank informative dictionary. As a consequence, the image recovery performance and the robustness against noise, corruptions and missing values can be greatly improved by our proposed bilinear TLRR model theoretically. Second, we present an out-of-sample extension of TLRR for deal with the outside images, since TLRR is essentially a transductive criterion as LRR and RPCA. To enable such capability, we add a Least Square (LS)-style [49] regularization term into the objective function of TLRR to compute a projection for correlating features with the low-rank recovery of images so that the bilinear low-rank recovery of new test images can be directly obtained by embedding them onto the projection. Third, we propose two similarity preserving and global structure preserving low-rank subspace learning methods by using the outputted bilinear low-rank codes of TLRR as inputs for image feature extraction and classification.

The paper is summarized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related work. Section 3 proposes the TLRR algorithm mathematically. Subsequently, in Section 4 we present the out-of-sample extension of bilinear TLRR for including outside images. We in Section 5 discuss bilinear low-rank coding for subspace learning. Section 6 shows the settings and evaluates our methods. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7. For easy to follow the work, we first present the important notations and abbreviations of algorithms in Table 1

Most real-world data includes noise or corruptions, so recent years have witnessed lots of efforts and increasing interests on low-rank data representation and subspace recovery in the literature. In general, existing works can be roughly divided into two categories. The first category mainly focuses on seeking the low-rank representation for subspace segmentation, recovery and clustering, for instance [1–3,6,7,11,19,36–38,42–44,50]. The other category is mainly for low-rank representation by designing overcomplete dictionaries, such as [23,45].

In the first category, the representative criteria are RPCA [4], IRPCA [6], LRR [1,2], Latent LRR (LatLRR) [11], and Fixed LRR (FLRR) [43], etc. In addition, several researchers have suggested effective extensions and enhanced modifications to the original formulations. For example, P. Favaro et al. [45] proposed to enforce the symmetric positive semidefinite constraint explicitly during the process of low-rank coding and presented a new criterion, LRR with Positive Semi-Definite constraint (LRR-PSD). The problem of LRR-PSD is defined as

The authors of [36–38] have also suggested matrix bi-factorization and tri-factorization methods for low-rank image recovery. But it is worth noting that virtually all criteria in this category use matrix X itself as a dictionary to learn the low-rank representation for subspace recovery and segmentation. But if given dataset is corrupted by dense noise, setting X itself as the dictionary may not be a good choice, since the included noise or corruptions in most real data may directly degrade the subspace recovery or segmentation performance.

To enhance the recovery and error correction performance, typical methods, such as [23,45] belonging to the second category, were recently proposed. The objective is to decompose given data matrix X as the sum of a clean self-expressive low-rank dictionary plus an error matrix. The non-convex problem that involves three main variables (i.e., dictionary D, low-rank representation V and sparse errors

Note that the above problem is similar to the non-convex formulations of [31,48] which involve three similar variables, namely dictionary, sparse representation [13,30,47] and sparse errors, to estimate from a non-convex problem. According to the Theorem 3.1 of [23], it is easy to check that the above criterion can be equivalent to

                      is a shape interaction matrix [23,40]. It is worth noting that the above low-rank coding formulation can also do simultaneous dictionary learning and low-rank representation, but our approach is different from theirs. The model in Eq. (6) is directly built on LRR by involving the dictionary and low-rank representation to estimate for subspace recovery, while our bilinear low-rank coding model aims at recovering given data from two directions (i.e. row and column) by calculating a pair of low-rank matrix factors to well handle cases corrupted by noise and corruptions in addition to recovering low-rank subspaces. Besides, t the dictionary in Eq. (6) is updated directly at each iteration, but our model seeks a low-rank projection U to update the dictionary instead by projecting given data into their underlying subspaces.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework that can seamlessly integrate the low-rank representation and dictionary learning. The objective is to recover or reconstruct given data along both row and column directions for well handling the observations that may be corrupted by noise and missing values. No extra constraint is included during the low-rank coding process. So, the most related low-rank recovery criteria to ours are IRPCA, LRR and LatLRR. The principles of IRPCA and LRR are illustrated in the top left and top right of Fig. 1
                     , respectively. Obviously, IRPCA and LRR perform image recovery and error correction along either column or row direction of given data respectively, so row or column information of images is lost by them. To well handle the issue of insufficient sampling suffered in LRR and improve the robustness to noise, LatLRR constructs the dictionary by using both observed and unobserved hidden data and solves the following problem:

                     when corrupted data is included. Clearly, LatLRR reconstructs given data matrix X using both row and column information to some extent. Previous studies showed that LatLRR could solve the issue of insufficient sampling to some extent and was proved to be more robust than LRR [11] for recovering low-rank matrices and correcting errors. But it is worth noting that both observed and hidden data in the formulation of LatLRR are sampled from the same collection of low-rank subspaces [11]. Thus, LatLRR may suffer from the same issue as LRR, as one still cannot ensure there are sufficient noiseless data available in dictionary

From Fig. 1, one can intuitively find that LatLRR is a combination of LRR and IRPCA. More specifically, although column and row information of given data matrix X are reflected in the final reconstructive procedure of LatLRR, i.e.,

                      still remain unclear. To boost the robustness to noise and well handle data with missing values, we present a new image recovery mechanism from two directions at the same time, as shown in the top of Fig. 1, from which we can see clearly that our approach is different from LatLRR, although row and column information of given data are all considered by them. Based on such strategy, our presented TLRR exhibits certain properties over existing criteria, such as the enhancement of robustness against noise and corruptions, which will be evaluated by simulations.

We present the bilinear low-rank coding framework named Tensor Low-Rank Representation (TLRR). TLRR for image recovery is driven by learning two low-rank matrix factors U and V at the same time to recover given matrix X from row and column directions in the form of tensor representation [12,28,30]. In tensor scenarios, the matrix X can be regarded as the second-order tensor in the tensor space

In this work, we solve U and V alternately, i.e., other variables are fixed when optimizing U or V at each iteration. Specifically, we can compute U and V alternately from the following two equivalent convex surrogates to Eq. (12) during the iterative optimization:

                         is a clean informative dictionary obtained by projecting given data onto the underlying subspaces by using the low-rank projection U as IRPCA. That is, the proposed bilinear low-rank coding framework can perform simultaneous subspace recovery, error correction and dictionary learning.

Note that the above two convex problems in Eq. (13) can be solved by using various methods, e.g., Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) [8,9]. When seeking the low-rank factor U to column-reconstruct

                        , we firstly set U to be an identity matrix, namely the dictionary is initialized with the given matrix X. After obtaining V from Eq. (13b), we can update the low-rank projection U from Eq. (13a) to column-reconstruct

                        . With both U and V obtained alternately, the sparse errors E can be computed from Eq. (12). Note that, in the alternating optimizations, the convex problem in Eq. (13a) can be considered as enhanced IRPCA using errors corrected and noise removed matrix

                         by V. Recall that IRPCA also computes a low-rank projection to remove the possible corruptions in given data by projecting the data onto the underlying subspaces [6], but it is worth noting that the data structures represented by

                         will be easier to be projected onto the underlying subspaces than X, since the process of encoding XV has already corrected the possible errors in data to some extent and segmented points into their respective subspaces by low-rank representation. Similarly, the problem in Eq. (13b) can be treated as enhanced LRR with a clean informative dictionary

                         learnt from Eq. (13a). Thus, TLRR has the potential to improve the robustness to noise and missing values, compared with LRR and IRPCA. Based on the relationships of LRR, IRPCA and LatLRR shown in Section 2, TLRR can also be considered as enhanced LatLRR. An early version of this paper was presented in [32]. This version also discusses the out-of-sample extension of TLRR for including the outside images, provides the discussion of bilinear low-rank coding for subspace learning, and conducts a thorough simulation evaluation on image representation and classification.

We employ the inexact Argument Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method [9] to solve our bilinear low-rank coding problem in Eq. (12) for efficiency. We first convert the problem to the following equivalent one:

                         and V are defined as identity matrices. Note that the convergence property of inexact ALM were well studied when the number of blocks is at most two and it could generally perform well in practice [1,24]. But since there are more than two blocks in our TLRR, which is similar to IRPCA, LRR and LatLRR, and the objective function of Eq. (14) is non-convex, it would be hard to prove that the solution of our TLRR converges to the global optimum theoretically, which is a common situation when handling non-convex problems [19,23,45]. In Algorithm 1, we approach TLRR by alternately solving the five blocks, which are easily solvable at each iteration. This paper finds that

                         is a good choice for TLRR. Under this setting, we experimentally observe that TLRR often converges with the iteration number k within the range of 30∼250.

Resembling RPCA [3] and LRR [1], our proposed bilinear low-rank coding algorithm (TLRR) is also essentially a transductive method, namely it is unable to represent unseen data vectors and requires recalculating all points when a new sample vector is inputted, which is computationally expensive and makes the approaches of the kind inappropriate for the real-world applications needing fast online computation. To address this issue, we propose an inductive extension of our bilinear low-rank coding, termed Inductive TLRR (iTLRR), by incorporating a least square (LS)-style [49] regularization term to bridge features of images by a projection

In this section, we discuss the proposed bilinear low-rank coding framework for unsupervised subspace learning and feature extraction. Two methods, i.e. similarity preserving and global structure preserving, are presented.

We first aim at proposing a similarity preserving Local Low-Rank Subspace Learning (L-LRSL) approach for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. L-LRSL seeks an orthogonal projection matrix

In this section, we evaluate the validity of the proposed bilinear low-rank coding criteria (TLRR and iTLRR) and low-rank subspace learning algorithms (G-LRSL and L-LRSL) for image recovery against different corruptions, and image feature extraction in classification respectively.

For image recovery and error correction, the performance of our TLRR is mainly compared with the most related criteria, i.e., LRR,

                         IRPCA, and Sparse Representation (SR) [13]. For unsupervised subspace learning, we compare the proposed G-LRSL and L-LRSL with five most popular unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods, i.e., Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [22], Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) [27], Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) [20], Sparsity Preserving Projections (SPP) [21], and the Sparse Locality Preserving Projections (SLPP). For feature extraction by projection (without dimensionality reduction), the performance of our iTLRR is mainly compared with IRPCA and LatLRR that can also output a projection to extract features from images by embedding images onto the projections [6,11].

                                  is the recovered result over different percentages of pixel corruptions. For feature extraction and image recognition, the one-nearest-neighbor (1NN) classifier with Euclidian distance is used due to its simplicity. In the simulations, each dataset is randomly split into training and test sets. Prior to feature extraction, PCA is used to eliminate the null space of the training set for efficiency. After seeking the projections from the training set, test data are projected onto the projective subspace for evaluating the accuracies. We perform all simulations on a PC with Intel (R) Core (TM) i5 CPU 650 @ 3.20GHz 3.19GHz 4G.

Seven real image datasets and one synthetic dataset are involved in this study. The image datasets include Yale face database [14], ORL face database [17], Georgia Tech face database [54], MIT-CBCL face database [29], 3D Object database [52], Phos object database [53], and the CASIA-HWDB1.1 handwriting image database [55]. The synthetic set is a spiral dataset that follows a nonlinear spiral distribution. Following the common practice, all the images of YALE, ORL, Georgia Tech, 3D Object, Phos and MIT-CBCL databases are downsampled to 32
                           
                              ×
                           
                        32 pixels due to the consideration of computational efficiency. Hence if each pixel of images is considered an input variable, each real image will correspond to a data point in a 1024-dimensional space.

We mainly investigate the low-rank recovery and error correction results via visual observation. We evaluate our TLRR and existing algorithms for reconstructing various errors corrupted real object images, real handwriting images, real face images and correcting errors in synthetic data, respectively.

We first examine the performance of our TLRR for object image recovery. The 3D Object [52] and Phos [53] object databases are employed for simulations. The 3D Object database features modeling shots of 8 objects and 51 cluttered test shots containing multiple objects [52]. The Phos database is a color image database of 15 scenes captured under different illumination conditions. Every scene contains 15 different images that contain objects of different shapes, colors and textures. Typical object images of 3D Object and PHOS are respectively shown in the column (a) of each row Fig. 2
                           . For each database, we choose 8 object images from 8 classes to form a matrix X of size 256
                              
                                 ×
                              
                           256 for the study. Note that we add different noise to the two databases for observing the results. For 3D Object, we add Gaussian white noise of zero mean and variance 0.05 to the images, and add ”salt and pepper” noise to the images with the noise density equaling to 0.05 for Phos in the simulations.

For each data matrix X, our TLRR decomposes it to a low-rank part

In this study, we evaluate the proposed TLRR method for reconstructing the handwriting images based on the popular CASIA-HWDB1.1 database [55]. This database has 3755 Chinese characters and 171 alphanumeric and symbols, which are collected from 300 writers. We choose the handwriting digit and handwriting letter images for this simulation. But the original sizes of the handwritings in CASIA-HWDB1.1 are inconsistent, so we resize the handwriting digit and letter images to 14
                              
                                 ×
                              
                           14 pixels and 16
                              
                                 ×
                              
                           16 pixels respectively. We randomly select 10 handwriting digits from ‘0’–‘9’ to form a matrix X of size 140
                              
                                 ×
                              
                           140, and choose 100 letter ‘A’ from the database for experiments. For handwriting recovery, we corrupt a percentage of randomly selected pixels in handwriting digits or letters by replacing the gray values with inverted values, that is, each gray value g of corrupted pixel is replaced by using 255-g, similarly as [51]. The original, corrupted, recovered and error handwritings are shown in Fig. 3
                           . We can see that our TLRR delivers promising results for detecting and recovering errors in images.

In this simulation, we discuss the face image recovery against corruptions by low-rank coding. The MIT-CBCL face database [29] that consists of face images of 10 persons is involved in this study. The dataset provides two training sets: (1) High resolution pictures, including frontal, half-profile and profile view, (2) Synthetic images (324 images per person, that is, 3240 face images totally) rendered from 3D head models. The second face image set is used. Note that we have elaborated in Section 3.1 that both IRPCA and LRR are treated as special cases of our bilinear low-rank coding framework (TLRR), and they respectively lose row or column information of the images during the process of recovery. Thus in this study we compare the bilinear face recovery result of our TLRR with those of IRPCA and LRR in Fig. 4
                           . For face image recovery, we corrupt a percentage of randomly selected pixels in face images by similarly replacing the gray values with inverted values. In Fig. 4, we show the original face images (first columns), corrupted face images, recovered face images and errors, respectively. The three rows respectively illustrate the results of IRPCA, LRR and our presented TLRR. From the results, we find our TLRR outperform both IRPCA and LRR for recovering the corruptions in images by considering both row and column information of the face images at the same time during bilinear low-rank coding.

In addition to evaluating the low-rank coding methods on real-world databases, we also prepare an experiment for handling the random corruptions by using a synthetic spiral dataset X in noisy case. The sampled set has 2000 vectors (i.e., samples) totally and each sample corresponds to a data point in a three-dimensional (3D) space. The recovery result of our TLRR is mainly compared with those of IRPCA, LRR, SR and LatLRR. We illustrate the correction result of each model in Fig. 5
                           , where Gaussian white noise is randomly add to the x-coordinates of 10 percent of data vectors (denoted by square symbol) and Gaussian noise of the same density is also added to the y-coordinates of another 10 percent of data vectors (denoted by circle symbol). The noised spiral dataset is given in Fig. 5(a). We mainly evaluate the error correction performance of each model by visually perceiving the number of far away points that are included in the reconstructed spiral manifold or distribution.

From the results, we see clearly that our presented TLRR outperforms other criteria for error correction, since less number of far away points are included in the recovered toy data, which is due to its capability of embedding given data into a low-rank tensor subspace onto which the corruptions can be automatically and effectively recovered from both row and column directions simultaneously. Note that LatLRR also works well on this toy by delivering the highly competitive results to our TLRR, but the performance difference between them is not very clear. Thus, in addition to visually evaluating the performance of LatLRR and our TLRR for correcting random errors, we also provide some numerical results for quantitative comparison between them. The numerical result is obtained by computing the standard deviation of the corresponding reconstructed spiral data by LatLRR and our TLRR. Note that a smaller standard deviation can indicate the distribution of the reconstructed toy data is more close to the main spiral manifold to some extent, i.e., less far away data points from the spiral distribution are included. The computed standard deviations for LatLRR and our TLRR are 3.25 and 3.16 respectively, that is, the recovered result by our proposed TLRR is also better than that of LatLRR on this toy set.

In this subsection, we mainly present the quantitative evaluation for the low-rank image de-noising capability by recovery of each method. The quantitative evaluation results are computed from handling the real face images under different levels of pixel corruptions. The quantitative evaluation result of our TLRR is mainly compared with those of RPCA, IRPCA, LRR and LatLRR. In this study, the face images are selected from the real-world ORL database that includes variation in facial expression (smiling/non smiling), facial details (glasses/no glasses) and poses. In total, the database has 40 persons and consists of 10 images per person. Three faces are selected for the experiments and a data matrix of size 32
                           
                              ×
                           
                        96 is created. The gray values of the face images are normalized to [0, 1] for this study. To investigate the robustness of various low-rank coding methods, two configurations (that is, faces are corrupted by random corruptions and sample-specific corruptions) are tested respectively.

We first test the case that face images are corrupted by random pixel corruptions. In this simulation, we corrupt a percentage of randomly selected pixels from the face images by replacing the gray values with inverted values, i.e., each gray value g is similarly replaced by 1-g. The corrupted pixels are randomly selected from the faces and the locations are unknown to each method. In this study, we vary the percentage of corrupted pixels from 0 percent to 90 percent, and accordingly increase the values of

We then corrupt a percentage of randomly chosen sample-specific corruptions, i.e., columns of the data matrix. In this study, we add Gaussian noise with zero mean and 0.02 variance to the columns. The corrupted columns are randomly chosen and the locations are also unknown to users. We similarly vary the percentage of corrupted columns from 0 percent to 90 percent for each algorithm. Fig. 7
                            illustrates the result of each technique as a function of the level of column corruptions. Fig. 7(b)–(e) examine our TLRR for recovering the face images with 20 (or 50) percentage of column corruptions. Illustrations show our TLRR is able to effectively detect the corruptions and correct them then.

In this simulation, we mainly evaluate the proposed unsupervised subspace learning methods (i.e., G-LRSL and L-LRSL) for handwriting recognition based on the popular CASIA-HWDB1.1 database. This database consists of 3755 Chinese characters and 171 alphanumeric and symbols, which are collected from 300 writers. Because the original sizes of the handwriting images in the original CASIA-HWDB1.1 database are inconsistent, we resize all handwriting images to 14

                        14 pixels and then normalize the gray values of the pixels to [0, 1] for the simulations. In this study, a subset called HWDB1.1-D [10], including 2381 handwritten digits (‘0’–‘9’), from CASIA-HWDB1.1 is used for simulations, and some handwriting sample images of digit ‘0’ to ‘9’ are illustrated in Fig. 8

                         of training images from each handwriting digit of the sampled set are evaluated. More specifically, T
                        =15, 25, and 35 handwriting images per digit are selected for training the projection matrix respectively, and the rest is applied as the test set.

The neighborhood size is set to seven for LPP and NPE if without extra remarks. We illustrate the averaged result of each method over 10 random splits of training/testing images.

First, we see clearly that the recognition performance can be greatly boosted by the increasing number of training data. Second, for handwriting digit recognition by dimensionality reduction (i.e., comparing our G-LRSL and L-LRSL with PCA, LPP, NPE, SPP and SLPP), we can find that our G-LRSL and L-LRSL that are comparable outperform other existing methods by about 4–5% improvement in accuracy in most cases. In addition, the proposed G-LRSL and L-LRSL achieve the highest accuracy than other criteria by applying small number of reduced dimensions (
                           
                              d

                        , which is desired for image feature extraction in classification. It is also noted that SPP and SLPP deliver better results than LPP and NPE in most cases. PCA also works well on this dataset. For handwriting digital image feature extraction by projection without dimension reduction (i.e., comparing our iTLRR with 1NN, IRPCA and LatLRR), we find our iTLRR gains comparable and even better results than1NN, IRPCA and LatLRR in most cases. Note that LatLRR delivers the higher records than 1NN, IRPCA and our iTLRR for the case of T(=25, 35) and

In this study, we address a face recognition task to examine the face representation power of our unsupervised G-LRSL and L-LRSL by subspace learning and face image feature extraction. For this study, we prepare a new face set called Georgia-Yale face database by merging the face images of Georgia Tech face database [54] and Yale face database [14] into a single set. The Georgia Tech face database [54] contains face images of 50 people with 15 images taken at the Center for Signal and Image Processing at Georgia Institute of Technology. The average size of face images is 150
                           
                              ×
                           
                        150 pixels. The pictures show frontal and/or tilted faces with different facial expressions, lighting conditions and scale. The Yale face database [14] contains 11 face images of each of 15 persons and the face images demonstrate variations in lighting conditions, facial expressions and with/without glasses. For face recognition on Georgia-Yale, we normalize the gray values in each row of the training set into [0, 1], fix the numbers of training face images from each person (i.e., T
                        =6, 8, and 10) and vary the number (
                           
                              d
                              )
                           
                         of reduced dimensions from 5 to 90 with interval 5. Note that we show some face images of 15 individuals in the Georgia Tech and Yale face databases are shown in Fig. 9
                         for visual observation.

We illustrate the averaged recognition result of each method over 10 random splits of training and test images in Table 3
                        , where we highlight the best records in each group (i.e.,

                        -norm regularization on SPP, SLPP, IRPCA, LatLRR, iTLRR, G-LRSL and L-LRSL) similarly for comparison. We find from the results that: (1) The increasing number of training images can significantly enhance the face recognition performance; (2) For dimension reduction for face recognition (i.e., comparing our G-LRSL and L-LRSL with PCA, LPP, NPE, SPP and SLPP), we can observe that the presented G-LRSL and L-LRSL can deliver 2–3% improvement over other unsupervised feature learning criteria. More importantly, our formulations deliver the promising results by using small number of d, compared with the other approaches. For face feature extraction by projection without dimensionality reduction (i.e., comparing our iTLRR with 1NN, IRPCA and LatLRR), we can find that IRPCA LatLRR, and our iTLRR outperforms 1NN by delivering higher accuracies in the cases of T(=25, 35). We also notice that our iTLRR is able to deliver the better results than INN, IRPCA and LatLRR in most cases, and the exception is that IRPCA outperforms LatLRR and our iTLRR for recognition in the case of T

                        -norm regularization. SLPP obtains slight higher accuracy than SPP in most cases, and both are superior to the baseline method, PCA and NPE. Note that the best records of LPP are very close to our algorithms, but the gained mean results by LPP are relatively worse, which may be caused by the unusual trend in performance.

We proposed a bilinear low-rank coding framework named Tensor Low-Rank Representation for image recovery and data representation. Our methodology seamlessly integrates low-rank coding and dictionary learning into a unified framework, providing a new mechanism for recovering low-rank images and learning a clean informative low-rank dictionary from a nuclear norm minimization problem simultaneously. Our model proceeds low-rank image recovery and representation by enhancing the robustness to noise and missing values by considering both column and row information of given data at the same time. We mathematically elaborate that our formulation can be regarded as the enhanced versions of existing criteria. The out-of-sample extension of our bilinear model is also presented to deal with the outside image vectors. Besides, we also employ the low-rank coding outputs for unsupervised global and local subspace learning for image classification.

Visual and quantitative evaluations of image recovery and error correction verified the effectiveness of our approach for boosting the robustness against corruptions. Classification on real handwriting and face databases demonstrated the superior performance of our methods for representing and recognizing images. But there are certain future directions to explore. First, to date it is still challenging to strictly prove the convergence of inexact ALM based recovery methods that include more than two blocks [1], including other existing criteria and our method. Second, extending the proposed bilinear low-rank coding model for handing images using matrix form directly, which is very efficient due to the small size, is also an important future work.
