                  A series of Bi3+ and Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors were synthesized with solid state reaction technique.

The optimal doping concentration of Bi3+ is experimentally ascertained to be 0.5mol%. The decay time of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.88 to 1.69ms. Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 can be excited with 254nm ultraviolet light and yield intense 312nm emission. The optimal doping concentration of Gd3+ is experimentally ascertained to be 5mol%. The decay time of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.42 to 1.36ms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Zinc borates are a group of eco-friendly, halogen-free fire retardant materials with different ratio of ZnO, B2O3, and H2O. They are extensively used in plastic, rubber or coating industry for their advantages, such as innocuity, low water solubility, high thermal stability, small granularity and density and good dispersibility [1–5]. In recent years, ZnB2O4 has started to attract attention because it can be used as a host in phosphor luminescence applications [6–9]. Li et al. synthesized Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors and investigated their photoluminescence (PL), three dimensional thermoluminescence (TL) and dosimetry characteristics following 60Co gamma-ray irradiation. They concluded that Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped ZnB2O4 had potential use as the materials in gamma-ray TL dosimeter for clinical dosimetry [6,7]. Zheng et al. prepared Eu3+ doped ZnB2O4 with co-precipitation method and studied the luminescence properties of Eu3+ in it [8]. Liu et al. prepared Eu3+ and Bi3+ co-activated ZnB2O4 with solid state reactions and found Eu3+ in ZnB2O4 exhibits a dominant emission peak at 610nm under the excitation at 393nm. By co-doping Bi3+ in ZnB2O4:Eu3+, the emission intensity and quantum efficiency can be efficiently enhanced by an increment of 14% and 6%, respectively [9].

However, literature [9] did not refer to the luminescence properties of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4. Thus the sensitization mechanism of Bi3+ on Eu3+ in ZnB2O4 is still unclear. The investigation about the luminescence properties of Bi3+ in a host is very significant because Bi3+ can be used as not only an activator but also a sensitizer in many hosts [10–14]. Furthermore, Gd3+ is also a sensitizer for some rare earth (RE) ions such as Eu3+, Tb3+ and Pr3+ 
                     [15–17]. With the sensitization of Gd3+, these RE ions can effectively emit visible light under 254nm irradiation from low pressure mercury vapor lamps, indicating that these phosphors can be useful for display applications. To the best of our knowledge, no literature reported the luminescence properties of Bi3+ and Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 up to now. Therefore, we will report this in the present paper. The effect of doping concentrations of luminescent center ions on the luminescence is discussed. The motivation of this work is to provide a clear comprehension on the luminescence properties of Bi3+ and Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 and evaluate their potential as luminescent materials for display applications.

All the investigated phosphors were synthesized with traditional solid state reactions. Firstly, raw materials ZnO (A.R.), H3BO3 (A.R.), Bi2O3 (A.R.) and Gd2O3 (4N) were accurately weighed according to the composition of Zn1
                     −
                     
                        x
                     B2O4:Bi3+
                     
                        x
                      (x
                     =0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03), Zn1
                     −
                     
                        y
                     B2O4:Gd3+
                     
                        y
                      (y
                     =0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07). The weighed materials were put into an agate mortar and ground with an agate mill in order to mix them thoroughly. Then they were heated up to 850°C in a muffle furnace. The samples were kept at 850°C in air for 10h, and subsequently allowed to cool down in the furnace. The cooled samples were ground again before they were measured and analyzed.

The phase identification of prepared phosphors was carried out by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD). The excitation, emission and decay curves of the phosphors were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer. As for the details of these instruments, the reader is referred to our previous literatures [18–20]. The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Shimadzu 2450 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

All the prepared phosphors were measured and analyzed by XRD method. Fig. 1
                         shows the XRD patterns of Zn1
                        −
                        
                           x
                        B2O4:Bi3+
                        
                           x
                         (x
                        =0, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.03). To be clear, the XRD patterns for x
                        =0.0025, 0.02 were omitted. JCPDS card No. 39-1126 was also listed for comparison purpose. From Fig. 1, it is obvious that the XRD patterns of all the samples are consistent with JCPDS card No. 39-1126. Thus all the prepared phosphors can be indexed to ZnB2O4. This indicates that the doping of Bi3+ with small amounts (no more than 3mol%) does not change the phase structure of ZnB2O4 significantly.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the XRD patterns of Zn1−
                        
                           y
                        B2O4:Gd3+
                        
                           y
                         (y
                        =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07) and JCPDS card No. 39-1126. From Fig. 2, it is observed that the XRD patterns of samples for y
                        =0.01, 0.03 are consistent with JCPDS card No. 39-1126. However when y increases to 0.05, little impurity phases, such as H3BO3 and B2O3 
                        [20] were observed at 2θ
                        =27.08, 30.72, 31.46, 32.98, and 37.06°. These impurity peaks get enhanced when y
                        =0.07. The intensity of impurity phases are so small that the effect on the luminescence of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 could be neglected.

From Figs. 1 and 2, we can also see that the intensity of the main diffraction peaks is different. This indicates that samples with different doping concentrations have different crystallinity. The strongest diffraction peak at 29.24° can be the best reference for evaluating the variation of crystallinity. Pure ZnB2O4 presents the strongest diffraction intensity for its best crystallinity. With the increment of doping concentrations of Bi3+ or Gd3+, the diffraction intensity decreases monotonically. This indicates the deterioration of the crystallinity of samples. If we put all the XRD patterns at the same baseline and magnify them locally, it can be seen that the main diffraction peaks move to lower angles slightly.

The difference of crystallinity, the appearance of impurity phases and the shift of main diffraction peaks are all related to the radii of involved ions. As reported in the JCPDS card No. 39-1126, ZnB2O4 crystallizes in a cubic structure (space group: Im-3m (229)) structure with lattice constants: a
                        =7.473Å and Z
                        =6. The effective radii of ions were reported as follows: R(Zn2+)=60pm, R(B3+)=21pm, R(Bi3+)=103pm, and R(Gd3+)=93.8pm [21]. According to the difference of radii among these ions, it is difficult for doping ions to replace B3+ in ZnB2O4 because B3+ is too small in comparison with Zn2+. Thus, in this work, it is believed that all the doping ions replace Zn2+ in the lattice. The substitution of Bi3+ and Gd3+ for Zn2+ induces not only charge unbalance but also volume unbalance. This results in the deterioration of the crystallinity of samples. This also restricts the accommodation of Bi3+ and Gd3+ in ZnB2O4. Thus, when the doping concentration increases, the appearance of impurity phases is inevitable. According to Bragg’s equation 2dsin
                        θ
                        =
                        λ (here λ is the wavelength of employed X-ray, λ
                        =0.15406nm, θ and d is diffraction angle and interplanar distance of corresponding diffraction peak, respectively), the moving to lower angles of 2θ indicates that the interplanar distance of samples is increasing gradually. According to the interplanar distance equation of cubic system d
                        2
                        =
                        a
                        2/(h
                        2
                        +
                        k
                        2
                        +
                        l
                        2) (here h, k, l are crystal indices of relevant crystal planes. a is the cell parameter of cubic system), cell parameter increases with the decrement of interplanar distance. Thus the crystal lattice expands. The reason for the expansion of crystal lattice is that the radii of both Bi3+ and Gd3+ are bigger than replaced Zn2+.

The main graph of Fig. 3
                         shows the excitation and emission spectra of phosphor Zn0.995B2O4:Bi3+
                        0.005. From Fig. 3, it is seen that the phosphor emits broad-band purplish blue light peaking at 428nm under 329nm excitation. The full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the emission broad-band is 52nm. The excitation spectrum inducing the emission at 428nm presents an obvious broad-band peaking at 329nm. The FWHM of this excitation broad-band is 40nm. The Stokes shift from emission peak to excitation one is 7031cm−1.

Bi3+ has the 6s2 electronic configuration. The ground state of the free ion is 1S0, whereas the 6s6p excited states give rise to the triplet states [3P0, 3P1, and 3P2] and 1P1 singlet state [10]. The energy level of the four excited states is increasing in the sequence of 3P0, 3P1, 3P2, and 1P1. The first transition, i.e. the one from 1S0 to 3P0 is strongly forbidden. The second (1S0–3P1) becomes allowed as a result of spin–orbit coupling. The third (1S0–3P2) is also forbidden but it can be induced by coupling with unsymmetrical lattice vibration modes. The last one (1S0–1P1) is allowed. Therefore, needed lowest energy from ground state to excited states is the difference between 1S0 and 3P1. From the excitation spectrum shown in Fig. 3, there is no other excitation peak or band between the excitation broad-band peaking at 329nm and emission one at 428nm. Thus the broad-band peaking at 329nm can be attributed to the transition from 1S0 to 3P1 of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4.

The electrons in the excited state 3P1 can return to ground state 1S0 through two approaches. One is to directly return to ground state. The other is to relax to lower excited state 3P0 firstly, and then return to ground state. Thus the emission broad-band peaking at 428nm can be attributed to the transition from 3P0,1 to 1S0.

We also studied the concentration quenching effect of Bi3+ luminescence in ZnB2O4. The subgraph of Fig. 3 shows the change of integrated mission intensity of Bi3+ doped ZnB2O4 and Bi3+ doping concentrations. The optimal doping concentration of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 for luminescence applications is 0.5mol%. Room-temperature emission decay curves at 428nm upon 329nm excitation were measured and exhibited in Fig. 4
                        . All decay curves can be well fitted with the following single-exponential decay Eq. (1):
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 I
                                 (
                                 t
                                 )
                                 =
                                 A
                                 exp
                                 (
                                 -
                                 t
                                 /
                                 τ
                                 )
                              
                           
                        where A is a constant, τ is the decay time of excited state of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 under 329nm excitation. The decay time of Bi3+ emission has the same changing trend with integrated emission intensity. It increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases. The changing region is from 0.88 to 1.69ms. The longest decay time is 1.69ms.

The left part of Fig. 5
                         shows the excitation spectra of samples Zn1−
                        
                           y
                        B2O4:Gd3+
                        
                           y
                         (y
                        =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07) for inducing the emission at 312nm, which can be attributed to the transition from 6P7/2 to 8S7/2 of Gd3+ 
                        [22–24] . From the profiles of excitation spectra we can suppose that all the excitation spectra are composed of one narrow band peaking at 274nm and two overlapped broad-bands from 200 to 270nm. All the emission spectra can be fitted very well with three Gaussian peaks via ORIGIN software from OriginLab company. The fitting data are listed in Table 1
                        . From Table 1, the peak wavelengths of two broad-bands are about 210 and 235nm with slight variation. The narrow band possesses a stable peak wavelength at 274nm. Obviously, the narrow band peaking at 274nm can be attributed to the intrinsic excitation of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4, i.e. the transition from ground state 8S7/2 to excited state 6I7/2 
                        [22–24].

In order to ascertain the attribution of the two broad-bands peaking at 210 and 235nm, we measured the fluorescent and absorption spectra of pure ZnB2O4. The fluorescent spectra show that pure ZnB2O4 does not emit any light in near ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral region. The absorption spectrum of ZnB2O4 is shown in Fig. 6
                        . It is observed that absorbance of the sample increases remarkably in the spectral range below 210nm. Thus the former broad-band in the excitation spectra of Gd3+ doped samples can be ascribed to host absorption (Fig. 6). There is no steep increment corresponding to a significant absorption band from 220 to 260nm in the absorption spectrum. Thus the latter broad-band peaking around 235nm is irrelative to the host. In this case, the broad-band must be related to Gd3+ doping. A reasonable attribution for this broad-band peaking at 235nm is the CT transition of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4.

From Table 1, it can be concluded that the intensity of all three excitation bands increases with the increment of doping concentrations of Gd3+ to reach maximum when y
                        =0.05. Then it decreases with the further increment of doping concentrations. Room-temperature emission decay curves at 312nm upon 274nm excitation of all Gd3+ doped samples were measured (Fig. 1S). All decay curves show nearly single-exponential decay. The Gd3+ decay times of four samples are 0.42, 0.68, 1.36, and 1.16ms, respectively. The optimal doping concentration for this application is ascertained to be 5mol%, though a little impurity appears in samples.

As mentioned before, Bi3+ doped ZnB2O4 can emit broad-band purplish blue light peaking at 428nm under 329nm excitation. This emission can be used for display applications directly. Also, it can be utilized to sensitize RE3+ ions and make them emit visible light with a lower energy. Currently, cold cathode fluorescence lamp is the main backlight source for liquid crystal displays. The main emission line of mercury vapor locates at 254nm, which can excite phosphors to emit visible light for use in display applications. Gd3+ can emit UV light at 312nm under 254nm excitation. Though this emission is not readily for practical use in display applications, it is feasible to exploit the mechanism of energy transfer from Gd3+ to RE3+ ions to make RE3+ ions emit visible light. Thus, ZnB2O4 codoped with Gd3+ and RE3+ can be potential luminescent materials for display applications.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Bi3+ or Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 phosphors were synthesized with high temperature solid state reactions. The XRD analysis shows that a small amount (no more than 3mol%) of Bi3+ or Gd3+ can be well incorporated into ZnB2O4. Under 329nm excitation, Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 can emit broad-band purplish blue light peaking at 428nm, which can be used in white light-emitting diodes or as a sensitizer for other luminescent center ions. In this work, the optimal doping concentration of Bi3+ is 0.5mol%. The decay time of Bi3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.88 to 1.69ms. Under 254nm irradiation, Gd3+ doped ZnB2O4 can effectively emit 312nm UV light, which can be exploited to induce energy transfer from Gd3+ to RE3+. The synthesis of ZnB2O4 codoped with Gd3+ and RE3+ and investigation of their luminescence properties are under our consideration. These phosphors codoped with Gd3+ and RE3+ can be prospective materials for display applications. The optimal doping concentration of Gd3+ is 5mol%. The decay time of Gd3+ in ZnB2O4 changes from 0.42 to 1.36ms.
