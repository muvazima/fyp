                  Systems of systems are collections of independent systems which interact and share information to provide services. To communicate, systems can opportunistically make use of contacts that occur when two entities are close enough to each other. In this paper, it is assumed that reliable predictions can be made about the sequence of such contacts for each system. An information item (a datum) is split into several datum units which are to be delivered to recipient systems. During a contact between two systems, a sending system can transfer one stored datum unit to a receiving system. Source systems initially store some of the datum units. The data transfer problem consists in searching for a valid transfer plan, i.e. a transfer plan allowing the datum units to be transmitted from their source systems to the recipient systems. The dissemination problem consists in searching a valid transfer plan which minimizes the dissemination length, i.e. the number of contacts which are necessary to deliver all the datum units to the recipient nodes. To our knowledge, there is no previous work attempting to determine the theoretical complexity of these problems. The aim of this paper is to determine the frontier between easy and hard problems. We show that the problems are strongly 
                        NP
                     -Hard when the number of recipients is equal to 2 or more (while the number of datum units is unbounded) or the number of datum units is equal to 2 or more (while the number of recipients is unbounded). We also show that these problems are polynomially solvable when the number of datum units or the number of recipient nodes is equal to 1, or when these parameters are all upper bounded by given positive numbers. The complexity of two related problems is also studied. It is shown that knowing whether there exist k mutually arc-disjoint branchings in an evolving graph and k arc-disjoint Steiner trees in a directed graph without circuit are strongly 
                        NP
                     -Complete.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Systems of systems (SoSs) are integrated systems that are heterogeneous and independently operable on their own, but are networked together for a common goal (Jamshidi, 2008). Most of the functions carried out by SoSs require the transfer of information through the whole SoS. A SoS is generally composed of mobile interacting systems, e.g. satellites, drones, sensors, etc.

From a data transportation point of view, a SoS can be considered as an intermittently connected network of several systems. These systems can make opportunistic use of the possibilities for communication that arise when two entities are close enough to share data. A system is equipped with one or more transmitters, referred to below as nodes. Using heterogeneous technologies, e.g. Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11, nodes are communication devices which allow the systems to interact in order to cooperate and efficiently transmit data from one subset of systems to another.

Any opportunity to communicate between several compatible nodes is called a contact. Contacts allow the elements of the SoS to collaborate and to route information from a subset of source systems to a subset of recipient systems. This collaboration becomes necessary, for example, when contact durations are relatively short with respect to the quantity of information to be disseminated, and where consequently the complete data cannot be transferred in a single contact. To tackle this problem, modern protocols subdivide data into several datum units which are sent in any order to recipient systems. A datum unit represents an identified, indivisible and unitary datum fragment (measured in bytes). A datum unit could, for example, be one of a set of identified fixed-sized blocks constituting high-resolution satellite images (the data). It is assumed that these recipient systems are able to rebuild the data from the corresponding datum units. The datum units may be transferred to non-recipient messenger systems whose role is to store and pass on the datum units.

A source system is characterized by a set of datum units it initially stores, and a recipient system is characterized by a set of datum units that it wishes to store before a given deadline in order to rebuild some data. The problem we address here is how to use knowledge about possibilities for collaboration when routing information from sources to destinations within a given time horizon. The general question to be answered is this: which datum units should be transferred from which nodes to which other nodes, and when (i.e. during which contacts)?

Apart from some works where datum units are not identified (Bhadra and Ferreira, 2002; Bui-Xuan, Ferreira, and Jarry, 2003; Ferreira, 2002), all previous works have, to our knowledge, studied a specific problem without attempting to determine the theoretical complexity of the case in hand. Thereby, we have chosen to study a simple case which allows us to determine the frontier between easy and hard problems.

In the context of real applications, a contact could have been characterized by its time interval (during which the transmission of data between these nodes is possible), its transmission delay (i.e. the length of time required by the sending node to process all the bytes that are sent according to the data-rate of the link), and its propagation delay (i.e. the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver over the medium concerned). Moreover, systems are often heterogeneous and each system could have been characterized by its buffer capacity (which quantifies the amount of bytes the system is able to store in its non-volatile memory) and the life expectancy of its battery (which limits the activity of the whole system for a given period). However, several simplifying assumptions have been proposed in the literature to study these kinds of problems from a theoretical point of view. For instance, Handorean, Gill, and Roman (2004) defined atomic contacts. This assumption means that contact durations are ignored, given that inter-contact times are much more significant; both propagation and transmission delays are then disregarded. Thus, in the present paper, we have also chosen to consider contacts as being atomic and without interference, i.e. a node is in contact with only one other node at any given time. Knowing the dates of each contact for each node, the collaboration possibilities can be defined as a sequence representing the successive contacts which will occur between nodes. More particularly, we define a contacts sequence of ordered pairs of nodes. Note that if two contacts occur at the same time, they can be sequenced in any order since they concern different nodes. During a contact, a receiver node can receive from a sender node at most one datum unit that is already present in the sender’s buffer (either from the outset or as a result of previous contacts). Following the contact the datum unit is assumed to be stored in the receiver’s internal memory. Buffers are assumed to have an infinite capacity and network failures are disregarded. We also focus on the problem in which datum units are part of the same piece of information. Indeed it does not change the computational complexity of the problem, while the description of the problem is simpler.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally describes the studied problem. Section 3 investigates the computational complexity of the general problem. In Section 4 we show that particular cases of the problem are polynomially solvable. Finally, in Section 5 we also prove the complexity of two related problems which are studied in the same context of opportunistic networks.

We consider a set V = {1, …, n} of n nodes (representing the transmitters in the systems). Set D = {1, …, p} represents the p units of a datum (numbered from 1 to p). Each of these units represents an identified, indivisible, unitary datum fragment. Each node i ∈ V has a corresponding subset oi
                     ⊆D indicating which datum units in D are initially stored by node i.

Collaboration possibilities are defined as a sequence σ = (σ
                     1, …, σm
                     ) representing the successive contacts which will occur between nodes. The contacts are assumed to occur at different times and in the order of the sequence. Each contact σc
                      is an ordered pair (i, j) ∈ V × V with i ≠ j. During a contact (i, j) ∈ σ, node j can receive from node i a datum unit k ∈ D that i already has stored in its buffer (initially or after some previous contacts). From this point onwards datum unit k is assumed to be stored in node j’s internal memory. Below, sc
                      and rc
                      refer respectively to the sender and the receiver of contact σc
                      ∈ σ, i.e. σc
                      = (sc, rc
                     ). Note that if we are interested in a non-directed version of the problem (in which either node of the contact can send a datum unit to the other), it is sufficient to add a contact (j, i) after each contact (i, j). The subset R⊆V defines the recipient nodes which have to retrieve datum D before the end of σ. We denote the number of recipients as r = |R|.

A transfer plan describes which datum units are transferred during the contacts comprising the sequence, and can be defined by a function ϕ: {1, …, m} → {∅, {1}, {2}, …, {p}} where ϕ(c) is a singleton containing the datum unit transferred from sc
                      to rc
                      during σc
                     . If no unit is transmitted during contact σc
                      (for example, because rc
                      already possesses all the datum units that sc
                      possesses), then ϕ(c) = ∅. Considering a transfer plan ϕ, we associate with each node i ∈ V the set 
                        
                           o

                           c
                        
                      of datum units which are stored by i after the first c contacts (σ
                     1, …, σc
                     ) of σ. Therefore,

In the following “the data transfer problem” designates the problem of finding a valid transfer plan ϕ such that ∀i ∈ R,

                     i.e. all recipient nodes possess every datum unit making up D after the sequence of contacts. This problem is summarized in the following integer linear programming formulation (see for example Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1998, pp. 3–14, for a comprehensive introduction on the modeling of combinatorial problems using binary variables). Binary variable xkc
                     , with k ∈ D and c ∈ {1, …, m}, is equal to 1 if datum unit k is transferred during contact σc
                      (i.e. if ϕ(c) = {k}), and to 0 else. Binary variable

“The dissemination problem” is one of the possible optimization version of the data transfer problem which consists in finding a valid transfer plan ϕ that minimizes λ(ϕ). This problem can be seen as the offline version of the problem considered by Belblidia, de Amorim, Costa, and Conan (2011) where the contacts between nodes are not known into advance (that is why the problem is online). To manage this online context, they propose a popularity-based strategy which relies on node-local information. Indeed, nodes keep track of the dissemination level of the datum units throughout the network in order to privilege the least prevalent datum unit. This simple strategy has shown to significantly increase the system performances.

The special case where R is reduced to a singleton {ω} is called “the delivery problem” and consists in finding a valid transfer plan ϕ minimizing λω
                     (ϕ). To our knowledge, these problems have never been considered in the literature. The previous integer linear programming formulation can be completed in order to introduce this minimization criterion: we introduce a binary variable gc
                      for each c ∈ {1, …, m} which is equal to 0 if all recipient nodes store all datum units at the end of contact σc
                     , or to 1 otherwise (if there exists a node i which has still to retrieve at least one datum unit). We have then:

Any instance of the problem can be easily described with an evolving graph, which is a time-dependent graph model proposed by Ferreira (2004). An evolving graph is “an indexed sequence of subgraphs of a given graph where the subgraph at a given index point corresponds to the network connectivity at the time interval indicated by the index number” 
                     (Ferreira, 2004). An evolving graph takes concretely the shape of a directed multigraph where the vertices represent the nodes of the network and the arcs represent the network links. Arcs are besides labeled with the time index at which the corresponding links are efficiently active. Thus, it can be seen as a directed multigraph G(V, A, τ) where τ: A → I and I is the set of intervals which can be built over a given time horizon. Thus, for an arc (i, j) ∈ A, τ((i, j)) represents the interval on which (i, j) can be used. For the problem in hand, the considered evolving graph is simpler since each interval can be reduced to an instant time. It can then be seen as a directed multigraph G(V, A, τ) where τ: A → {1, …, m}. With each contact σc
                      = (i, j) ∈ σ is associated an arc (i, j) ∈ A with τ((i, j)) = c (see Fig. 1
                      for an instance). In such a graph, a path [u
                     0, u
                     1, u
                     2, …, uz
                     ] with each uj
                      ∈ A is such that ∀j ∈ {0, …, z − 1}, we have τ(uj
                     ) ≤ τ(u
                     
                        j + 1). Such a path is then called a journey in Ferreira (2004). A branching B rooted at t in an evolving graph G is a subgraph of G such that for every vertex v ∈ V, there is exactly one journey in B from t to v. A solution of the data transfer problem can be described as a set of arc-disjoint branchings in subgraphs of the evolving graph, each branching being rooted in a node initially storing the datum unit which is transferred across the branching.

In Fig. 1, we provide an example of an instance with its set of nodes V, its set of datum units D and its sequence of contacts σ. All nodes are recipient nodes, i.e. V = R and all nodes have to retrieve all datum units before the end of the sequence σ. Initially, node 1 stores datum units 1 and 2 (i.e. o
                     1 = {1, 2}) and node 2 stores datum unit 2 (i.e. o
                     2 = {2}) while the other nodes store no datum unit. The evolving graph associated with this instance is provided. Each arc is labeled with the index of the contact corresponding to this arc. For example, arc (1, 2) is labeled with 8, because σ
                     8 = (1, 2). A solution is also provided for this instance. As it can be seen, with the dissemination of each datum unit from a source node to a recipient node is associated a journey. For example, the dissemination of datum unit 1 from node 1 to node 4 is associated with the journey [(1, 6); (6, 5), (5, 4)] which corresponds to ϕ(1) = ϕ(3) = ϕ(6) = {1}. Finally three arc-disjoint branchings are associated with the dissemination of the datum units: two branchings respectively rooted in nodes 1 and 2 (highlighted with bold arcs on the figure) for datum unit 1, and one branching rooted in node 1 (highlighted with doubled arcs on the figure) for datum unit 2. Note that five arcs do not belong to one of the branchings since they are associated with a contact during which no datum unit is transmitted (ϕ(2) = ϕ(9) = ϕ(12) = ϕ(13) = ϕ(14) = ∅). After the application of the provided transfer plan, the final state of the nodes is such that 
                        
                           ∀
                           i
                           ∈
                           R
                           ,
                           
                              o
                              i

                     i.e. all nodes store all datum units.

In this section we show that the data transfer problem is 
                        NP
                     -Hard, leading also to the 
                        NP
                     -Hardness of the dissemination problem.

Let us consider the decision version of the data transfer problem, denoted henceforward as Dt :


                     INSTANCE:
A set V = {1, …, n} of n nodes. A subset R⊆V of recipient nodes. A sequence σ = (σ
                     1, …, σm
                     ) of m ordered pairs (i, j) ∈ V × V with i ≠ j. A set D = {1, …, p} of p datum units. For each node i ∈ V, a subset oi
                     ⊆D of units initially stored by i.


                     QUESTION:
Is there a valid transfer plan ϕ: {1, …, m} → {∅, {1}, …, {p}} such that ∀i ∈ R, 
                        
                           
                              o
                              i
                              m
                           
                           =
                           D
                        
                      ?

The data transfer problem (Dt) is obviously in 
                        
                           NP
                           ,
                        
                      since it can be decided in polynomial time whether a given transfer plan ϕ is valid and such that ∀i ∈ V,

                        NP
                     -Complete in the strong sense when p = 2 and r is not upper bounded, or when r = 2 and p is not upper bounded.

To prove these results, we need to reduce a problem known as being strongly 
                        NP
                     -Complete to the studied cases. Garey and Johnson (1979) give a comprehensive guide to the theory of 
                        NP
                     -Completeness and provide an extensive list of 
                        NP
                     -Complete and 
                        NP
                     -Hard problems. In this paper, we will consider the 3-SATISFIABILITY problem described on p. 259 in Garey and Johnson (1979) (referred to below as 3Sat). The 3Sat problem is strongly 
                        NP
                     -Complete and is stated as follows:


                     INSTANCE:
A set X = {x
                     1, …, xq
                     } of q variables. A set C = {c
                     1, …, cs
                     } of s clauses over X such that for each c ∈ C, |c| = 3.


                     QUESTION:
Is there a truth assignment that satisfies C ?


                        
                           Theorem 3.1
                           The data transfer problem is strongly 
                                 NP
                              -Hard for p ≥ 2.

We now show that 3Sat is reducible in polynomial time to the special case of Dt for which p = 2 (U2Dt). Consider an instance of 3Sat. From this instance, we build an instance of U2Dt as follows:

We have p = 2 and then D = {1, 2}.

                                       . The datum units possessed by these nodes will correspond to the logical value of the clause in such a way that the clause will be considered to be true if the associated node possesses datum unit 1 and to be false otherwise. Thus, initially all clauses are false (the associated nodes possess only unit 2).

                                        which will store datum unit 1 will be considered to be true, while the other one which will store datum unit 2 will be considered to be false. Initially all literals are considered to be undetermined (the associated nodes possess no datum units).

In U2Dt is also created the node α ∈ V with oα
                                        = {1, 2}. This node is the only one which initially possesses the two datum units. It will allow the logical value of each literal to be given by providing unit 1 only to the nodes associated with literals which have to be true, and unit 2 to the nodes associated with literals which have to be false.

We set R = {ωj
                                       |j ∈ {1, …, s}}∪{li
                                       |i ∈ {1, …, q}}.

Thus, from the instance of 3Sat, exactly n = s + 2q + 1 nodes have been created.

                            shows a valid transfer plan solution for the previous example, giving rise to a truth assignment of the clauses of C. Each part of the table represents the transfer plan associated with contacts in the subsequence σk, k ∈ {1, 2, 3}. For each contact

                           . In the first part of the table, the logical values of literals associated with nodes are also listed (“literal”). In the second part of the table, the logical value of each clause cj
                            with j ∈ {1, 2}, which is true only if it obtains datum unit 1, is also reported (“clause”).

Suppose that there exists a satisfying truth assignment for C. We can build a corresponding valid transfer plan as follows:

For each i ∈ {1, …, q}, if xi

                               is false) then we set ϕ(i) = {1} and ϕ(i + q) = {2}, else (xi
                               is false and 
                                 
                                    
                                       x

                               is true) we set ϕ(i) = {2} and ϕ(i + q) = {1}. Note that the datum unit stored by each node l (representing a literal) is given by set 
                                 
                                    o
                                    l

                              1).

For each i ∈ {1, …, s}, considering that {l

                                 i3} are the 3 nodes associated with the literals of ci
                              , for k ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we set ϕ(|σ
                              1| + 3(i − 1) + k) = {1} if datum unit 1 is stored by lik
                               else ϕ(|σ
                              1| + 3(i − 1) + k) = ∅ (node i already stores datum unit 2). Note that if clause ci
                               is satisfied, there exists at least one node lik
                               which can transmit unit 1 to node i. Thus, after the contacts of σ
                              2 each node ωi, i ∈ {1, …, s}, possesses all the units comprising the datum.

Given that all nodes i ∈ R of the instance of U2Dt possess all the datum units, the resulting transfer plan is such that ∀i ∈ R,

                           Theorem 3.2
                           The data transfer problem is strongly 
                                 NP
                              -Hard for r ≥ 2.

We now show that 3Sat is reducible in polynomial time to the special case of Dt for which r = 2 (R2Dt). For this purpose we adapt the proof of Even, Itai, and Shamir (1975) showing that the two-commodity integral flow problem is 
                           NP
                        -Complete. The significant difference is that instead of dealing with units of flow, we are now dealing with datum units which can be duplicated (which is not the case for a unit of flow). Consider an instance of 3Sat. Using this instance we build an instance of R2Dt as follows:

We recall that s is the number of clauses and that q is the number of variables of the 3Sat instance. We set p = s + 1 and D = {0, 1, …, s} (exceptionally, for the sake of simplicity, datum units are numbered starting with 0).

Thus, from the instance of 3Sat, a sequence of exactly m = 13s + 3q + 1 contacts has been created.

For example, consider the instance described in Section 3.1. Then, the associated instance for R2Dt (see Fig. 5

Suppose that there is a valid transfer plan ϕ such that ∀i ∈ R,

During the contacts of σ, node ω
                           1 needs to obtain datum unit 0, since initially it possessed only datum units {1, …, s}. This can only occur where datum unit 0 has been transmitted from α
                           1 to β
                           1 during contact (α
                           1, β
                           1) and has been transmitted from β
                           1 to ω

                           2. Therefore, for i ∈ {1, …q}, datum unit 0 is transmitted using either subsequence

                           . This means that at least one of these two subsequences is devoted exclusively to transmitting datum unit 0 (and no other datum unit can transit through these nodes). Datum unit 0 next uses contact (ε
                              i
                           , β

                           1) if i = q.

During the contacts of σ, node ω
                           2 needs to obtain the subset {1, …, s} of datum units, since initially it possessed only datum unit 0. Each datum unit must therefore have been obtained from a different node Cj
                           , since there are exactly s contacts from nodes of {C
                           1, …, Cs
                           } to ω
                           2. The datum unit k which is transmitted during contact (Cj, ω
                           2) comes initially from node α
                           2. It has transited either through some nodes from

                           ) with 1 ≤ z < i. Indeed, as mentioned before, datum unit 0 is transmitted during contact (ε
                              i − 1, βi
                           ).

Actually, the path of contacts used to transmit datum unit k to node Cj
                            makes it possible to identify the literal that makes clause cj
                            true. If k has been transmitted through nodes from

                            to 
                              
                                 l
                                 i

                            (x, y ∈ {1, …, pi
                           }, y > x), then variable xi
                            is set to false (
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 i
                              
                            is true).

We should remember that datum unit 0 has transited using some of the contacts in σ
                           2i
                           , and that xi
                            obviously cannot be true and false at the same time. It should also be noted that the same literal can cause several clauses to be true : in this case, several datum units (one per true clause) transit through nodes of Li
                            using one disjoint path of contacts per datum unit. Finally, in certain cases none of the datum units in {1, …, s} transits through nodes of Li
                           : in this case, the associated variable xi
                            can be arbitrarily set to true or false, meaning that it is not needed to make C true.

Given that for each clause cj
                            we have found exactly one literal that makes cj
                            true, we can therefore conclude that there is a truth assignment for C
                        

For the previous example (see Fig. 5), datum unit 1 can be transmitted through the contacts

Let us assume that there exists a truth assignment that satisfies C. We can build a corresponding valid transfer plan as follows. First, datum unit 0 is transferred during contact (α

                           1), during all contacts (ε

                           . In both cases, these contacts cannot have been used to transmit datum unit 0 since the contrary would mean that both literals xi
                            and

                            are true.

All other contacts can be set to ∅. Moreover, since each datum unit j ∈ D has been transmitted from α
                           2 to ω
                           2 during contacts associated with clause cj, ω
                           2 also possesses all datum units at the end of sequence σ.

Given that every node i ∈ R of the instance of R2Dt has all the units of the datum, the transfer plan obtained is such that ∀i ∈ R,

                           .

In this problem, D = {1}. If there is at least one transfer plan leading to the dissemination of the whole datum, there is at least one optimal transfer plan where, for each contact σc
                         ∈ σ, we have ϕ(c) = {1} if

                                 {
                                 1
                                 }
                              
                           
                        . Indeed, there is no advantage to be gained in delaying the transfer of the only datum unit for node rc
                        , if such a transfer is possible. It is therefore sufficient to go through the sequence of contacts in such a way that each recipient node rc
                         of a current contact σc
                         obtains the datum unit if it can, and stops as soon as all recipient nodes have the datum.

This process is summarized in Algorithm 1
                        . In this algorithm, o[i] represents the current state of a node i: it is equal to ∅ if it does not possess the datum, and {1} if it does possess it. In the first loop, each element o[i] is set to oi
                         and nbdelivered is set to the number of recipient nodes which initially have the datum. In the second loop, each contact σc
                         is considered in the order of sequence σ. For a contact σc
                         = (sc, rc
                        ), node rc
                         gets the datum if needed and if possible, i.e. if o[rc
                        ] = ∅ and o[sc
                        ] = {1}. The transfer plan is then built and nbdelivered is updated if ϕ(c) = {1} and rc
                         ∈ R. The loop terminates once all recipient nodes possess the data (if nbdelivered = r), or if the end of sequence σ has been reached. The third loop sets all the remaining contacts to ∅. Each iteration of the loops being in O(1) time, Algorithm 1 runs in O(max (m, n)) time. This leads to the following theorem.

                           Theorem 4.1
                           The dissemination problem can be solved in O(max (m, n)) time if p = 1.

Recall that this problem is similar to the dissemination problem, except that only one specified node ω needs to obtain all the datum units.

Obviously, if p = 1 then the delivery problem can be solved in O(max (m, n)) time with Algorithm 1. We will now show that the general case is also polynomial, by reducing the problem to the resolution of a max (p, m) separate maximum flow problems. Let μi
                         = |{σc
                         ∈ σ|rc
                         = i}| be the number of contacts whose node i ∈ V is the receiver.

A transportation network G = (U, A, c) can be made to correspond to any given instance of the decision version of the delivery problem. This network is composed of the following elements:

                           
                              •
                              a source vertex S ∈ U;

with each datum unit z ∈ D = {1, …, p}, we associate a vertex dz
                                  ∈ U;

with each node i ∈ V, we associate the set of vertices

For example, the transportation network corresponding to the following instance of the decision version of the delivery problem is depicted in Fig. 6
                        :

                           
                              •
                              
                                 n = 4, p = 2, V = {1, 2, 3, 4} and D = {1, 2}, o
                                 1 = {1}, o
                                 3 = {1, 2}, o
                                 2 = o
                                 4 = ∅, ω = 4 (i.e. R = {4}),


                                 m = 7, σ = ((1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 2)).

Note that the maximum flow on arc 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 ω
                                 
                                    μ
                                    ω
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              S
                              )
                           
                         cannot exceed its capacity p. Note also that the resulting transportation network contains |U| = 1 + p + n + m vertices and |A| = p + ∑
                           i ∈ V
                        |oi
                        | + 2m + 1 ≤ (n + 1)p + 2m + 1 arcs.

We now show that solving the decision version of the delivery problem is equivalent to searching for a flow of magnitude p in the associated transportation network.

                           Proposition 4.1
                           For any instance of the delivery problem, there exists a transfer plan ϕ such that node ω obtains the whole datum if and only if, in the associated transportation network, the maximum amount of flow through vertex S is equal to p.

To prove this proposition, we consider a flow f: A → D in the associated transportation network satisfying the capacity constraints and the conservation of flow such that the flow entering S is equal to p. A valid transfer plan ϕ can then be built as follows.

First, we consider the amount of flow from each vertex dz
                         (z ∈ {1, …, p}) to each vertex i
                        0 (i ∈ V). If f(dz, i
                        0) = 1 then i
                        0 is the node that is considered to be the owner of datum unit z. Note that each datum unit is considered to be owned by at most one vertex, since the flow entering vertex dz
                         cannot exceed 1. From now on, each unit of flow from one vertex to another in the transportation network has to be considered as a change of owner for a datum unit.

Next, we consider each contact in the order of the sequence. For a contact σc
                         = (i, j), let is
                         and jt
                         be the nodes in U such that i has already been the receiver of s contacts before contact σc
                         and such that σc
                         is the tth contact in which j is the receiver. Note that we have t > 0. In the associated transportation network, if f(j
                        
                           t − 1, jt
                        ) = q, then jt
                         becomes the owner of q datum units that j
                        
                           t − 1 previously owned. Note that since there is conservation of the flow at each vertex of the transportation network, j
                        
                           t − 1 was the owner of at least q datum units. If j
                        
                           t − 1 was the owner of more than q datum units, the q datum units whose owner is changing can be chosen indifferently (for example the q datum units with the smallest indices). Now, if f(is, jt
                        ) = 1, then jt
                         becomes the owner of one datum unit z that was previously owned by is
                        , and we set Φ(c) = {z}. If f(is, jt
                        ) = 0 then we set Φ(c) = ∅. At the end of this step, note that each datum unit is still considered to be owned by only one vertex. The same process is iteratively applied to each contact in the sequence σ.

Having considered each contact of the sequence, we look at the amount of flow from 
                           
                              ω
                              
                                 μ
                                 ω
                              
                           
                         to S. If 
                           
                              f
                              (
                              
                                 ω
                                 
                                    μ
                                    ω
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              S
                              )
                              =
                              p
                           
                         we can conclude that vertex 
                           
                              ω
                              
                                 μ
                                 ω
                              
                           
                         is the owner of all units of the datum and that transfer plan that has been constructed is such that node ω has obtained the whole datum at the end of the sequence of contacts.

Conversely, consider a valid transfer plan ϕ such that node ω gets the whole datum at the end of the sequence of contacts. From the sequence of contacts and from this transfer plan we can construct the states 
                           
                              o
                              i
                              c
                           
                         of each node i after the different contacts σc
                         ∈ σ. We can then build the flow function f as follows. First we initialize the flow function such that ∀(i, j) ∈ A, f(i, j) = 0. We consider vertex 
                           
                              ω
                              
                                 μ
                                 ω
                              
                           
                         in the transportation network. Initially we consider that this vertex is the owner of every datum unit. The procedure consists of finding iteratively the different owners of each datum unit z until a vertex i
                        0 (i ∈ V) has become its owner.

For this purpose we consider a datum unit z initially owned by vertex 
                           
                              
                                 i
                                 s
                              
                              =
                              
                                 ω
                                 
                                    μ
                                    ω
                                 
                              
                           
                        . We will assume that s > 0 (if this were not the case, then the process would terminate immediately, because node ω would never be the receiver in a contact and must therefore own the whole datum at the start). Let σx
                         be the sth contact whose i is the receiver and thus let 
                           
                              o
                              i
                              x
                           
                         be the set of datum units stored by node i after contact σx
                        . If 
                           
                              z

                           s − 1 is considered to be the new owner of datum unit z and f(i

                         then node i has received datum unit z during the sth contact in which i is the receiver. Then, let σc
                         = (j, i) be the sth contact of i in which i is the receiver, and let t be the number of contacts in which j was the receiver before contact σc
                         (0 ∈ {1, …, μj
                        }). Vertex jt
                         consequently becomes the new owner of datum unit z and we set f(jt, is
                        ) = 1. Note that the flow magnitudes obtained respect the capacity constraints of the transportation network. By resetting is
                         = i

                         = j
                        
                           t − 1 according to the case, the process is repeated until that datum unit z is owned by a vertex i
                        0.

Note that at the end of each iteration there is only one owner of datum unit z and that the change of owner results in an increase in the flow on the arc linking the new owner to the previous owner. This ensures the conservation of the flow. This operation is repeated for all of the datum units. At the end of the process we therefore know which vertex i
                        0 is the owner of each datum unit z. For each vertex i
                        0 and for each datum unit z, if i
                        0 is the owner of datum unit z then we set f(dz, i
                        0) = 1. Finally for each dz
                         (z ∈ {1, …, p}), we set f(S, dz
                        ) = 1. QED
                     

In practice the transportation network can be simplified by iteratively removing the vertices that have no successor or no predecessor and through which the flow can only be null. Moreover, the vertices representing the different states of node ω can be merged into a single node (the resulting vertex is the destination of all in-arcs to a vertex ωx
                        , and all the out-arcs are removed, apart from the one to S). The simplified transportation network from the previous example is shown in Fig. 7
                        .

Node ω needs at least p − |oω
                        | contacts to obtain all the data. One way of finding a transfer plan ϕ that minimizes λω
                        (ϕ) is to build the transportation network associated with the shortest subsequence of σ involving p − |oω
                        | contacts with node ω. If

                         then the transfer plan ϕ associated with f is optimal. Otherwise, we complete the current subsequence of σ in such a way that it involves

                         more contacts with node ω. A new maximum flow can be computed. Note that in practice the previously computed flow can be easily transformed to obtain a new starting flow. The procedure is repeated until 
                           
                              f

                              =
                              p
                           
                         or until the current sequence equals σ. Note that if the procedure stops while 
                           
                              f
                              (
                              
                                 ω

                              ,
                              S
                              )
                              <
                              p
                           
                         then we know that the instance is not feasible, i.e. there is no valid transfer plan that could ensure the delivery of the whole datum to node ω. By using the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (Ford and Fulkerson, 1956) or the Edmonds and Karp algorithm (Edmonds and Karp, 1972) to compute the maximum flow of the transportation networks that are constructed, the procedure can run in O((np + m)max (p, m)) time, given that the search for an augmenting path is in O(|A|) time and that we need to obtain at most max (p, m) augmenting paths.

Finally, note that if several pieces of information (each one composed of different datum units) have to be considered, the method is still valid since it is sufficient to merge these pieces of information to obtain a single set D of datum units.

In this section we look at an instance of the problem in which both p and r are assumed to be upper bounded by given positive constant numbers K
                        1 and K
                        2, with K
                        1 ≥ p ≥ 2 and K
                        2 ≥ r ≥ 2. We might be tempted to use the same kind of technique as in the previous section, but since r ≥ 2 this is no longer possible. In the case where r = 1 it was possible, because exactly p units of flow were sent through the transportation network, and a unit of flow was interpreted as the ownership of one datum unit which did not need to be identified. Now, however, the ownership of a datum unit might need to be duplicated (in order to be transmitted to several nodes), and conservation constraints prohibit the duplication of units of flow. Moreover, taking one unit of flow per datum unit per recipient is not possible, because the units of flow are not identified: this can lead to a solution in which a recipient get the same datum unit twice.

However, taking one unit of flow per datum unit per recipient, we can build Algorithm 2
                         using the notion of temporary ownership of a datum unit.

In this algorithm, a set of states States is managed. Since there are r recipients of the datum, it is considered that there are exactly r copies of each datum unit. Each state S ∈ States is defined by a bidimensional array S.o, where S.o[z][k] designates the node owning the kth copy of datum unit z, and S.ϕ is the transfer plan from which this state has arisen.

Initially, the algorithm is started with only one state S in which the imaginary node 0 is the owner of all copies of each datum unit and where S.ϕ(c) = ∅, ∀c ∈ {1, …, m}. The ownership of each copy of each datum unit z is then distributed among nodes i with z ∈ oi
                        . At the end of this phase of the algorithm, a node i can own several copies of the same datum unit (if it needs to transfer datum unit z to several other nodes).

Next, the ownership of datum unit copies is transferred through contacts. At the end of each iteration c, States contains one state for each possible situation which can arise from contacts (σ
                        1, …, σc
                        ). For this purpose a new set of states States′ is computed from the set States obtained at the end of the previous iteration. Given a state S ∈ States, for each copy k of each datum unit z, if S.o[z][k] = sc
                        , then a new state S′ is created by copying S (with instruction copy(S) which copies both the dimensional array and the transfer plan of S) and by transferring the ownership of datum unit z to rc
                         (instruction S′.o[z][k] ← rc
                        ). Since this corresponds to the transfer of unit z during contact σc
                        , we set S′.ϕ(c) to {z}. Instruction add(States′, S′) is used to add the new state S′ to set States′. We assume that S′ is not added if there exists another state in States′ that has exactly the same ownership matrix (although not necessarily the same associated transfer plan, since several transfer plans can give rise to the same ownership matrix). The instruction isCompleted(S′) checks whether all recipient nodes have obtained all the datum units (this can be done in polynomial time). If this is the case the algorithm stops and returns the computed transfer plan. Finally, at the end of iteration c, States′ is added to States with add(States, States′) (also in such a way that each ownership matrix is unique within the obtained set State).

Since the ownership of the kth copy (k ∈ {1, …, p}) of datum unit z (z ∈ {1, …, p}) can take n + 1 values, there are at most (n + 1)
                           rp
                         possible states and at each iteration of the algorithm r ≤ (n + 1)
                           rp
                        . The overall algorithm is consequently in O(mnrp
                        ) time. Since r and p are upper bounded by given positive constant numbers K
                        1 and K
                        2, the algorithm is polynomial in m and n.

Note that two states S
                        1 and S
                        2 are equivalent if ∀z ∈ {1, …, p}, S
                        2.o[z] is a permutation of S
                        1.o[z]. Indeed, the |R| copies of a datum unit z are equivalent. To avoid having several equivalent states, we can slightly improve the process by incorporating a sorting procedure to obtain sequences S.o[z] where S.o[z][1] ≤ S.o[z][2] ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ S[z][r].

Note this algorithm can be practically used only for small values of r and p. However, from a theoretical point of view, we have shown that the problem can be polynomially solved as soon as r and p are upper bounded. Finally, note that if several pieces of information (each one composed of different datum units) have to be considered, the method is easily adaptable. The instruction is 
                        Completed(S′) has to check whether all recipient nodes have respectively obtained all the datum units of the pieces of information they wished to retrieve.

Let G = (V, A) be a directed multigraph. For a vertex t ∈ V, a branching B rooted at t is a subgraph of G such that for every vertex v ∈ V, there is exactly one path in B from t to v 
                        (Edmonds, 1972). For any X⊂V, let δG
                        (X) denote the set of arcs (i, j) ∈ A such that i ∈ X and j ∈ V/X. Edmonds (1972) established that there exist k mutually arc-disjoint branchings rooted in t if and only if for every X⊂V with X ≠ ∅, we have |δG
                        (X)| ≥ k.

Let cG
                        (t) = min {X|t ∈ X, X⊂V, X ≠ ∅}
                        δG
                        (X) be the maximum number of arc-disjoint branchings at t in G. Therefore, cG
                        (Xt) can be seen as the outward connectivity of t, i.e. the minimum number of edges that would need to be removed to make at least one vertex unreachable from t 
                        (Shiloach, 1979). cG
                        (S) can also be seen as the minimum number of arc-disjoint paths from t to any other vertex in V. This well-known property is used by a number of polynomial algorithms that have been developed for finding a given number of arc-disjoint branchings in a multigraph, such as Shiloach’s (1979) in O(k
                        2
                        n(m + n)).

An evolving graph is a time-dependent graph model, first introduced by Ferreira (2002), which can be used to deal with intermittently connected communication networks (see for example delay tolerant networks (Fall, 2003)). It can be seen as a directed multigraph G(V, A, τ) where τ: A → I and I is the set of intervals which can be built over a given time horizon. Thus, for an arc (i, j) ∈ A, τ((i, j)) represents the interval on which (i, j) can be used. In its simplest version τ is such that 
                           
                              τ
                              :
                              A
                              →
                              N
                           
                         (i.e. the interval of time on which (i, j) can be used) is reduced to a singleton. In this case, a path [u
                        0, u
                        1, u
                        2, …, uz
                        ] in an evolving graph with each uj
                         ∈ A is such that ∀j ∈ {0, …, z − 1} we have τ(uj
                        ) ≤ τ(u
                        
                           j + 1). Such a path is then called a journey.

Surprisingly, unlike usual graphs, knowing if there exists a strong connected component of a given size in evolving graphs (i.e. considering journeys instead of usual paths) is 
                           NP
                        -Complete (Bhadra and Ferreira, 2002). However, the directed minimum spanning trees for each vertex in a strongly connected evolving graph can be polynomially computed. Some other algorithms in the literature can be polynomially generalized in evolving graphs. These include the search for foremost journeys (the journeys with the smallest dates), shortest journeys (the journeys which minimize the number of arcs) and fastest journeys (the journeys with the smallest difference between departure and arrival times) from a source vertex to all other vertices (Bui-Xuan et al., 2003).

We now turn to the problem of knowing whether there exist k mutually arc-disjoint branchings in an evolving graph. It should be remarked that Edmonds’s property no longer holds for evolving graphs. This can be proved with the following counter-example. Let G = (V, A, τ) with V = {t, a, b, c, d, e, f}, A = {a
                        1, …, a
                        12} with a

                        3  =  (c, d), a
                        4  =  (t, a), a
                        5  =  (t, b), a
                        6 = (a, c), a
                        7 = (b, c), a

                        9 = (a, e), a
                        10 = (b, f), a
                        11 = (d, e), a
                        12 = (d, f) and 
                           
                              τ
                              :

We can see that for each vertex v ∈ V with v ≠ t, there are at least two journeys from t to v. However, there cannot exist two mutually arc-disjoint branchings rooted at t. Let us suppose that there exist two mutually arc-disjoint branchings B
                        1 and B
                        2 rooted at t. Note that each branching has exactly 6 arcs. Thus, {B
                        1, B
                        2} has to be a partition of A. Arcs a
                        1 and a
                        2 cannot be used in the same branching, otherwise the other vertices could not be reached because of the value of τ(a
                        1) and τ(a
                        2). Suppose that a
                        1 ∈ B
                        1 and a
                        2 ∈ B
                        2. This means that a
                        5 has to be in B
                        1 while a
                        4 has to be in B
                        2. The only possible course of action is to add a
                        7 to B
                        1 and to add a
                        6 to B
                        2. Then we have to put a
                        3 in one branching and a
                        8 in the other one. If a
                        3 ∈ B
                        1 and a
                        8 ∈ B
                        2, then a
                        11 has to be in B
                        1 since vertex e cannot be reached from A. However a
                        11 cannot be used after a
                        3. Now if a
                        3 ∈ B
                        2 and a
                        8 ∈ B
                        1, then a
                        12 has to be in B
                        1 since vertex f cannot be reached from A. However a
                        12 cannot be used after a
                        3.

Consider the decision version of the search for arc-disjoint branchings in an evolving graph, referred to below as Adbeg.


                        INSTANCE:
An evolving graph G = (V, A, τ), a vertex t ∈ V, an integer k (k ≤ |A|/(|V| − 1)).


                        QUESTION:
Are there k mutually arc-disjoint branchings rooted at t (considering journeys) in G ?

                           Theorem 5.1
                           The Adbeg problem is 
                                 NP
                              -Complete.

We will now show that Dt  is reducible to Adbeg in polynomial time. Consider an instance of Dt. From this instance, we build an instance of Adbeg as follows:

With each node i ∈ {1, …, n} in Dt, we associate a vertex i ∈ V in Adbeg. With each datum unit k ∈ D in Dt, we also associate a vertex dk
                               ∈ V in Adbeg. Finally, we add a vertex t ∈ V.

For each datum unit k ∈ D of Dt, we add an arc (t, dk
                              ) ∈ A with τ((t, dk
                              )) = 0 in Adbeg. For each node i ∈ {1, …, n} and each datum unit k ∈ D in Dt, if 
                                 
                                    k
                                    ∈
                                    
                                       o
                                       i
                                       0
                                    
                                    ,
                                 
                               we add an arc (dk, i) ∈ A with τ((dk, i)) = 0 in Adbeg. Now, with each contact σc
                               ∈ σ in Dt, we associate an arc (sc, rc
                              ) ∈ A with τ((sc, rc
                              )) = c in Adbeg. Let

                               with 1 ≤ τ(aj
                              ) ≤ m. These arcs can only be reached by first using an arc (t, dk
                              ) with τ((t, dk
                              )) = 0. Each branching is then associated with exactly one arc (t, dk
                              ). Let Bk
                               be the branching associated with the arc (t, dk
                              ) such that τ((t, dk
                              )) = 0. We can build a transfer plan ϕ for Dt in the following way. We initially set Φ(c) = ∅ for c ∈ {1, …m}. Next, for each branching Bk, k ∈ {1, …, p}, and for each arc a ∈ Bk
                               with 1 ≤ τ(a) ≤ m, we set ϕ(τ(a)) = k. Note that since the different branchings are mutually arc-disjoint, and since there is exactly one arc a ∈ A associated with a contact in σ, we do not try to set several values to the same Φ(c). For each i ∈ R there is a journey [u
                              0, …, ux
                              ] in each branching Bk
                               such that u
                              0 = (t, dk
                              ), u
                              1 = (dk, z) with 
                                 
                                    k
                                    ∈
                                    
                                       o
                                       z
                                       0
                                    
                                    ,
                                 
                               and such that ∀j ∈ {1, …, x}, 1 ≤ τ(uj
                              ) ≤ m and τ(u
                              
                                 j − 1) < τ(uj
                              ). Therefore there is a corresponding list of contacts which allows datum unit k to be transmitted from such a node z to node i. Thus, at the end of σ, all i ∈ R are such that 
                                 
                                    
                                       o
                                       i
                                       m

                              .

Now, suppose there is a valid transfer plan Φ. For each k ∈ {1, …, p} = D, we first set

                              . Next, for each node i ∈ V such that

                               we add arc (dk, i) in 
                                 
                                    A
                                    
                                       B
                                       k
                                    
                                 
                              . Then, for each c ∈ {x|Φ(x) = k}, we add arc (rc, sc
                              ) in 
                                 
                                    A

                              . Note that for each i ∈ V∖{t, d
                              1, …, dp
                              } for which there is a path from t to i, there is a corresponding list of contacts which means that datum unit k can be transmitted from a node z with 
                                 
                                    k
                                    ∈
                                    
                                       o
                                       z
                                       0
                                    
                                 
                               to i. This is particularly true for any node i ∈ R. Moreover, each i ∈ V∖R for which there is no path from t to i is such that it is not connected to another node in Bk
                              . For such node i, we add an arc (t, i) in 
                                 
                                    A
                                    
                                       B
                                       k
                                    
                                 
                               with τ((t, i)) = m + 1. This is always possible, given that there exist p arcs of this kind. The subgraph Bk
                               obtained is consequently a branching. Therefore, there must exist p mutually arc-disjoint branchings in G.

The problem of packing arc capacitated directed Steiner trees is a well known problem (Cheriyan and Salavatipour, 2006). Consider a directed graph G = (V, A) with a positive capacity ca
                         for each arc a ∈ A, a set T⊆V of terminals and a specified root vertex t, t ∈ T. A directed Steiner tree rooted at t is a subgraph of G that contains a path from t to each terminal v ∈ T. The problem of packing arc capacitated directed Steiner Trees is to find the maximum number of directed Steiner trees rooted at t such that for every arc a ∈ A the total number of Steiner trees containing a is at most ca
                        .


                        Cheriyan and Salavatipour (2006) used the following reduction of the problem: given two pairs of vertices (x
                        1, y
                        1) and (x
                        2, y
                        2), are there two arc-disjoint paths, one from x
                        1 to y
                        1 and the other from x
                        2 to y
                        2? This reduction enabled them to show that the problem of knowing whether there are two arc-disjoint Steiner trees in a graph with unit capacities and only three terminals is 
                           NP
                        -Complete.

In fact, it can be shown that this problem is 
                           NP
                        -Complete even if there are three terminals and the graph is without circuit. As we saw in Section 3.1, knowing if there exists a valid transfer plan in a graph (i.e. 
                        U2Dt) is 
                           NP
                        -Complete even if r = 2. Moreover, with an instance of U2Dt, we can associate a graph G = (U, A, c) similar to the one built for the delivery problem in Section 4.2 and which is composed of the following elements:

                           
                              •
                              a source vertex S ∈ U;

with each datum unit z ∈ D = {1, …, p}, we associate vertex dz
                                  ∈ U;

with each node i ∈ V, we associate the set of vertices

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have investigated the data transfer problem which consists in searching for a transfer plan allowing some datum units to be transmitted from their sources to the recipient systems, and the dissemination problem in which we search for a valid transfer plan which minimizes the dissemination length. These problems have been shown to be polynomially solvable when there is only one datum unit to be transferred or when there is only one recipient. A polynomial algorithm has also been provided for the case where the number of datum units and the number of recipients are both upper bounded by some given constant numbers. The general problems are shown to be 
                        NP
                     -Hard when the number of recipients and the number of datum units are greater than or equal to 2. The 
                        NP
                     -Hardness of two related problems has also been proved thanks to the 
                        NP
                     -Hardness of the data transfer problem. As future research, we plan to investigate some methods for efficiently solving the dissemination problem, both in a deterministic context and in a context where only uncertain knowledge about contacts is known.

Note that the data transfer problem and the dissemination problem are close to the maximal integer multiflow problem which consists in maximizing the sum of the integral flows of some commodities between some given pairs of terminal nodes subject to capacity and flow conservation requirements (see Costa, Létocart, and Roupin, 2005 for a survey on the maximal integer multiflow problem). The integer flow between a pair of terminal nodes could be assimilated to the transferring of a datum unit. The difference is that before a datum unit is transferred, it is duplicated, so the conservation of flow is not satisfied in our case. The data transfer problem and the dissemination problem are also close to the vehicle routing problem which consists in finding a set of routes for identical vehicles based at a vertex called the depot, such that each of the vertices is visited exactly once, while minimizing an overall routing cost (see Pillac, Gendreau, Guéret, and Medaglia, 2013 for a survey on the vehicle routing problem). Once again, the found routes could be assimilated to the dissemination paths of the datum units. The difference is that in our case, when a datum unit is delivered, it remains available because it has been duplicated. Therefore, although the data transfer problem and the dissemination problem are close to well known problems in the operational research community, they are different and open a new class of problems.
