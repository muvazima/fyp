                  This paper presents a generalized weighted vertex p-center (WVPC) model that represents uncertain nodal weights and edge lengths using prescribed intervals or ranges. The objective of the robust WVPC (RWVPC) model is to locate p facilities on a given set of candidate sites so as to minimize worst-case deviation in maximum weighted distance from the optimal solution. The RWVPC model is well-suited for locating urgent relief distribution centers (URDCs) in an emergency logistics system responding to quick-onset natural disasters in which precise estimates of relief demands from affected areas and travel times between URDCs and affected areas are not available. To reduce the computational complexity of solving the model, this work proposes a theorem that facilitates identification of the worst-case scenario for a given set of facility locations. Since the problem is NP-hard, a heuristic framework is developed to efficiently obtain robust solutions. Then, a specific implementation of the framework, based on simulated annealing, is developed to conduct numerical experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic is effective and efficient in obtaining robust solutions. We also examine the impact of the degree of data uncertainty on the selected performance measures and the tradeoff between solution quality and robustness. Additionally, this work applies the proposed RWVPC model to a real-world instance based on a massive earthquake that hit central Taiwan on September 21, 1999.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The p-center model, which aims to locate p facilities to minimize maximum distance (or travel time) between demand nodes and their closest facilities (e.g., Kariv and Hakimi, 1979; Albareda-Sambola et al., 2010), has been considered particularly suitable for emergency applications (e.g., Jia et al., 2007a,b; Huang et al., 2010), among various facility location models that have been presented in the literature (e.g., Mirchandani and Francis, 1990; Daskin, 1995; Altiparmak et al., 2006). This work adapts the p-center model to locate urgent relief distribution centers (URDCs) in an emergency logistics network that aims to promptly deliver relief supplies from URDCs to all relief or medical service stations in affected areas in the aftermath of quick-onset disasters (e.g., Altay and Green, 2006; Yi and Ozdamar, 2007; Campbell and Jones, 2011).

URDCs play an important role in an emergency logistics network, because they serve as hubs that seamlessly integrate and coordinate inbound and outbound emergence logistics responding to relief demands from affected areas. These hubs also have an inventory management function (i.e., risk pooling)—aggregating relief demands or their forecasts across several affected areas to reduce the adverse impact of relief demand variability and uncertainty on the system. In emergency response to quick-onset disasters, government rescue agencies typically designate existing public buildings (e.g., schools and stadiums) with little or no damage that can be promptly converted to shelters for survivors and/or warehouses for relief supplies as candidate sites of URDCs, instead of establishing new emergency facilities from scratch. Thus, the problem of locating URDCs can be considered as the vertex p-center problem which restricts the set of candidate sites to locations of existing public buildings (i.e., facility nodes). Furthermore, when relief demands faced by relief or medical stations are taken into account, the problem becomes a weighted vertex p-center (WVPC) problem (e.g., Current et al., 2002) with nodal weights reflecting relief demands from relief stations (i.e., demand nodes) in affected areas and the objective being to minimize maximum demand-weighted travel time between relief stations and their closest URDCs.

The proposed WVPC model for locating URDCs explicitly accounts for uncertain relief demands from relief stations and travel (or delivery) times between URDCs and relief stations, mainly due to poor measurements based on limited information available during a disaster’s aftermath or approximations in the modeling process using aggregated demands and choosing a distance norm. Two major categories of approaches have been adopted in the literature to deal with uncertain coefficients in facility location models (Snyder, 2006), namely, stochastic programming (SP) and robust optimization (RO). The former has been used typically to deal with decision-making for facility locations in risk situations, in which the values of uncertain coefficients are governed by discrete or continuous probability distributions that are known to a decision-maker. The SP approach has been widely applied to emergency logistics for short-notice disasters (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, and wild fires) by assuming that possible impacts of these disasters can be estimated based on historical and meteorological data. The common goal of these stochastic location models is to optimize the expected value of a given objective function. A classical example of applying SP to disaster relief is the scenario-based, two-stage stochastic model proposed by Mete and Zabinsky (2010), for medical supply pre-positioning and distribution in emergency management. Other examples can be found in, for instance, Chang et al. (2007) and Balcik and Beamon (2008).

On the other hand, the RO approach attempts to optimize the worst-case system performance in uncertain situations that lack any information about the probability distributions of uncertain coefficients (e.g., Kouvelis and Yu, 1997); hence, the RO approach generally describes uncertain data using pre-specified intervals or ranges. Typical robustness measures include mini-max objective value and mini-max regret in an objective value. The RO approach may be more appropriate than the SP approach in emergency response to quick-onset or no-notice disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides). For quick-onset disasters, because of the difficulty in predicting disaster occurrence and impacts as well as a lack of historical data, probability distributions and scenario data are generally unavailable. For example, an extremely large earthquake, 9.1 on the Richter scale, which hit the northeastern coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, was never considered in the nation’s preparedness planning for earthquakes, even though Japan is widely regarded as one of the most advanced countries in earthquake preparedness. Thus, in responding to such a disaster, decision-makers may prefer an alternative method for describing uncertain data (i.e., using intervals to represent uncertain data).

In the proposed RWVPC model, uncertain relief demands at relief stations in affected areas and travel times between URDCs and relief stations are represented using prescribed intervals (or ranges), rather than probability distributions. The objective of locating p URDCs is to minimize worst-case deviation in maximum demand-weighted travel time between URDCs and relief stations from the optimal solution. This work proposes a theorem that facilitates identification of the worst-case scenario for a given set of URDC locations, thereby reducing complexity of solving the problem. Since the problem is NP-hard (Averbakh, 2003), a local search-based algorithmic framework incorporating the theorem for identifying the worst-case scenarios is developed to find robust solutions within a reasonable amount of computational resources. Then, a specific framework implementation based on simulated annealing (SA) is developed to conduct numerical experiments, including a case study based on the Jiji Earthquake, which hit central Taiwan on September 21, 1999.

The p-center problems with interval-represented uncertain data tend to be very difficult because of the mini-max structure. Therefore, analytical results and exact algorithms for the p-center problems with interval data have only been attained in special cases, such as locating a single facility on general networks or multiple facilities on tree networks (e.g., Averbakh and Berman, 2000; Burkard and Dollani, 2002). To the best of our knowledge, only Averbakh and Berman (1997) reported analytical results for an absolute weighted p-center problem with interval-represented nodal weights. No study has addressed absolute or vertex multi-center problems with both interval-represented edge lengths and nodal weights.

This study contributes significantly to the literature by (i) modeling the URDC location problem as the WVPC problem with interval-represented edge lengths and nodal weights on general networks; (ii) providing an effective and efficient algorithmic framework for solving the problem; and (iii) shedding light on the applicability and potential benefits of the proposed model to real-world instances.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the RWVPC problem, the representation of data uncertainty, and the property of worst-case scenarios. Section 3 presents the generic heuristic framework and a specific implementation using SA. This is followed by the numerical experiments in Section 4. Section 5 provides a case study demonstrating the applicability of the proposed model to real-world instances. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Consider a connected, undirected network G
                        =(N, A), where N is the vertex set and A the arc (or edge) set. Let U be the set of candidate sites (i.e., facility nodes) for URDC locations and V be the set of relief stations (i.e., demand nodes) in affected areas; U
                        ∪
                        V
                        =
                        N, and U
                        ≠
                        V. Each possible pair of relief station i
                        ∈
                        V and URDC j
                        ∈
                        U is connected by an arc (i, j)∈
                        A that is associated with a positive (real or integer) number, t
                        
                           ij
                        , representing travel (or delivery) time between relief station i and URDC j. Although t
                        
                           ij
                         denotes the travel time, it can also be used for other measures of utility/disutility, such as distance or travel cost. Each relief station i
                        ∈
                        V faces relief demand ξ
                        
                           i
                         and is serviced by a single URDC. For a given set of predetermined candidate sites, U, the WVPC problem is to locate p (p
                        <∣U∣) URDCs and assign relief stations to these centers, thereby minimizing maximum demand-weighted travel time between relief stations and URDCs. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the problem is as follows (e.g., Current et al., 2002).

Constraint (2) defines the lower bound of maximum demand-weighted travel time, which is being minimized. Constraint (3) requires that each relief station be assigned to exactly one URDC. Constraint (4) restricts relief station assignments only to selected URDCs. Constraint (5) stipulates that p URDCs are to be located. Constraints (6) and (7) indicate that location and allocation decision variables are binary. The WVPC problem is also known as the minimum k-supplier problem (Ausiello et al., 1999).

                        This is equivalent to finding

                        RC(
                           τ
                        ); that is, the RWVPC problem is to find a robust solution 
                           τ
                        
                        
                           robust
                         that minimizes the largest (worst-case) deviation of maximum demand-weighted travel time from the optimal solution.

Because the (continuous) interval representation of uncertain demands and travel times may lead to an infinite number of possible scenarios, evaluation of robustness cost RC(
                           τ
                        ), which involves identifying the worst-case scenario of plan 
                           τ
                        , is a major challenge of solving the RWVPC problem. To efficiently evaluate RC(
                           τ
                        ), this work reformulates the sub-problem of RC(
                           τ
                        ), defined in Eq. (12), according to Theorem 1 below, indicating that although uncertain relief demands and travel times are described using continuous intervals, the solution to the sub-problem, RC(
                           τ
                        ), can be found in a finite subset of scenarios, each of which corresponds to an extreme case. This reformulation increases the tractability of the problem from a combinatorial perspective.

In Step 2, replacing ξ
                                       
                                          i

                                       ≠
                                       k, j

                                       j
                                       ∗ does not change the values of Z(ϖ, 
                                          τ
                                       ) and Z(ϖ, 
                                          τ
                                       
                                       ∗(ϖ)). Therefore, the modification in Step 2 also does not change the optimality of (ϖ, 
                                          τ

                                       ). Thus, the main claim is proven, as is Lemma 1.□

The theorem follows in a straightforward manner from the proof of Lemma 1.□

Since the RWVPC problem is NP-hard, to obtain robust solutions with a reasonable amount of computational resources for problem instances with practical sizes, heuristics or meta-heuristics are typically adopted. Based on Theorem 1, the following local search-based algorithmic framework is proposed.
                           
                              
                                 Step 1:
                              Initialization
                                    
                                       1.1.
                                       Generate randomly an initial solution 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          0; let 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          =
                                          
                                             τ
                                          
                                          0.

Evaluate the robustness cost of 
                                             τ
                                          , RCost(
                                             τ
                                          ), based on Theorem 1.

Local search

Generate a new solution, 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          
                                             new
                                          , from the neighborhood of 
                                             τ
                                          .

Evaluate the robustness cost of 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          
                                             new
                                          , RCost(
                                             τ
                                          
                                          
                                             new
                                          ), based on Theorem 1.

Solution acceptance or rejection

If the rules (or aspiration rules) of solution acceptance are adopted, then let 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          =
                                          
                                             τ
                                          
                                          
                                             new
                                          .

Otherwise, decline the new solution, 
                                             τ
                                          
                                          
                                             new
                                          .

Convergence check

If convergence criteria are satisfied, stop.

Otherwise, go to Step 2.

In this framework, each candidate solution has more than one neighbor solution, and the choice of which neighbor solution to move is determined using only the information about the neighborhood of the current solution (i.e., local search). When no improvement mechanisms are designed for the neighborhood search, a local search may be stuck at local optima. This issue can be resolved by applying, for instance, restarts with different initial solutions or relatively more sophisticated schemes based on iterations (e.g., iterated greedy) or memory-less stochastic modifications (e.g., SA) in Step 3 of the proposed framework.

This subsection presents a specific implementation of the proposed framework based on SA, which can escape from being trapped into a local optimum by accepting, with a small probability, worse solutions during iterations. Suman and Kumar (2006) comprehensively reviewed SA-based optimization algorithms. Let T
                        0 be the initial temperature, T
                        
                           F
                         the final temperature, Ite
                        
                           max
                         the maximum number of iterations between two different temperatures, Num
                        
                           max
                         the maximum number of temperature reductions, and β the temperature reduction ratio (0<
                        β
                        <1). The SA-based heuristic is presented as follows.

Note that the SA-based heuristic is provided only as a specific implementation for the framework, presented in Section 3.1. Any other local search-based heuristic can be adopted in the proposed framework, such as iterated greedy. Moreover, while SA is not a new approach, this work demonstrates a successful application of SA (or meta-heuristics) to solve robust combinatorial optimization problems, which is rarely seen in existing literature.

In Step 2 of the SA-based heuristic, a new solution 
                           τ
                        
                        new is generated in each iteration from the neighborhood of the current solution 
                           τ
                        . This work defines two neighborhood types. The first is called the allocation neighborhood, and involves only changes in allocation decision variables (i.e., y
                        
                           ij
                        , i
                        ∈
                        V, j
                        ∈
                        U). Both location and allocation decision variables (i.e., x
                        
                           j
                        , j
                        ∈
                        U, and y
                        
                           ij
                        , i
                        ∈
                        V, j
                        ∈
                        U) change in the second type, called the location–allocation neighborhood. Specifically, the allocation neighborhood consists of feasible solutions obtained by randomly selecting two relief stations serviced by different URDCs in the current solution, and swapping their associated URDCs (Fig. 1
                        a). The new solutions in the location–allocation neighborhood are generated by randomly choosing two URDCs and swapping their associated groups of relief stations. In this neighborhood type, at least one chosen URDC must be an open facility. Moreover, if only one chosen URDC is open, this swap is equivalent to moving a group of relief stations from an open facility to another facility that was closed but is now open after the swap (Fig. 1b).

In each iteration of the SA-based heuristic, a new solution 
                           τ
                        
                        new is generated from either the allocation (with probability p
                        1) or location–allocation (with probability p
                        2) neighborhood of current solution 
                           τ
                        . Selection between the two types of neighborhood is based on probabilities p
                        1 and p
                        2, and p
                        1
                        +
                        p
                        2
                        =1.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

A set of numerical experiments was conducted on a set of test instances, to examine the algorithmic performance of the SA-based heuristic, the tradeoff between robustness and optimality, and the impact of data uncertainty on the solutions. The algorithm was coded using C++ computer language and tested on a personal computer with a Pentium Core 2 Duo 2.4gigahertz CPU and 2gigabytes RAM.

To examine the performance of the SA-based heuristic, this work also implemented an enumeration approach and compared the effectiveness (solution quality) and efficiency (computational time) of the SA-based heuristic with those of the enumeration approach. This approach enumerates all possible plans and identifies the plan with minimal objective value. In spite of its computational inefficiency, this enumeration approach guarantees to find exact solutions that serve as the benchmark for evaluating the solution quality of the heuristic.

The test instances have different sizes, represented by the triplet (∣V∣, ∣U∣, p), where ∣V∣, ∣U∣, and p denote the numbers of relief stations, candidate URDC sites, and open URDC sites, respectively. Fifteen different sizes of instances were considered. For each problem size, 30 instances were generated, so there were 450 problem instances. For each instance, the two-dimensional coordinates of relief stations and candidate URDC sites were generated from the intervals (0,100) and (40,60), respectively.

The computational results of solving the RWVPC problem instances with the number of relief stations ∣V∣=10 and 15 are displayed in Tables 1 and 2
                           
                           , respectively. In the tables, Ave. RC(
                              τ
                           
                           robust) denotes the average robustness cost, over 30 instances, for each problem size and uncertainty level. For each problem size and each uncertainty level, the number of instances (out of 30 instances) where the SA-based heuristic fails to obtain optimal solution is reported inside the parenthesis in the third column of the tables. As shown in the third and fifth columns of the tables, for most problem sizes and uncertainty levels, the Ave. RC(
                              τ
                           
                           robust) obtained using the SA-based heuristic is close to that obtained using the enumeration approach. The difference in Ave. RC(
                              τ
                           
                           robust), between the SA-based heuristic and the enumeration approach is less than 10% in all instances, implying that the SA-based heuristic is able to find close-to-optimal solutions. Note that, since the estimated computational time for the enumeration approach to optimally solve one instance of problem size equal to (15,4,3) or (15,5,3) is more than 1week, a maximum computational time (5days) was set and the incumbent solution obtained within the maximal computational time was reported. As shown in Table 2, for the tests on these larger instances, the solution obtained using the SA-based heuristic is significantly better than that obtained using the enumeration approach.

Regarding the computational efficiency of the proposed heuristic, as shown in the fourth and sixth columns of these tables, the SA-based heuristic requires much less computational time than the enumeration approach in all the conducted tests. In particular, although the computational time of the enumeration approach increases dramatically as the problem size gets larger, the increase in computational time of the SA-based heuristic is not significant. For instance, for the tests with the same numbers of ∣V∣=10 and ∣U∣=5, when p increases from 2 to 3, the computational time of the enumeration approach increases by more than 60 times, but the SA-based heuristic requires an average of 2.6 more seconds. In summary, the SA-based heuristic obtains optimal or near-optimal solutions using much less computational time than the enumeration approach.

The tests conducted on the problem instances of larger size, i.e., (30,5,3), (40,8,4), and (50,10,5), aim to examine the impact of data uncertainty on the performance measures of interest. The test results in Table 3
                            show that both robustness cost and hedge value increase as the uncertainty level becomes higher. Because of the larger relief demand and travel time intervals (i.e., larger α
                           1 and α
                           2), the worst-case scenario deviates further from the nominal scenario, resulting in larger robust deviations and the increase in hedge value, which highlights the advantage of implementing robust solutions in the presence of data uncertainty. The robustness price is less than 15% of the optimal nominal objective value (i.e., Z(w
                           nominal, 
                              τ
                           
                           nominal) reported in the sixth column of Table 3), implying that the robust plans determined by the proposed method do not tradeoff much optimality for robustness.

This numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed RWVPC model to locate URDCs in a relief supply distribution network responding to the massive earthquake which hit central Taiwan on September 21, 1999—the 921 Jiji Earthquake. This earthquake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale, mostly affected Taichung and Nantou counties, causing more than 2500 deaths and 8000 injuries and destroying (completely or partially) 39,000 buildings. A three-tier relief supply distribution network was established in Nantou County immediately after this earthquake. Specifically, relief supplies were collected from six unaffected counties (Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Changhua, Tainan, and Kaohsiung), transported to two URDCs at Nantou Stadium and Jiji Town Hall, and then delivered to the 51 relief stations in the 11 townships in Nantou County. In this numerical example, in addition to Nantou Stadium and Jiji Town Hall, five other candidate sites for URDCs were selected based on an earthquake preparedness report prepared by Taiwan’s Ministry of the Interior (Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan, 2000). The triplet (∣V∣, ∣U∣, p)=(51,7,2) denotes the problem size of this numerical example, where ∣V∣, ∣U∣, and p denote the numbers of relief stations, candidate URDC sites, and selected URDC sites, respectively.

                      lists the travel times between the seven candidate sites and 51 relief stations. For instance, the travel time between Nantou Stadium and relief station NT-A in Nantou township was 4minutes. These travel time data were collected by Sheu (2007, 2010) to evaluate an emergency logistics distribution approach. In addition, because it is very difficult to precisely estimate relief demand faced by each relief station, this work divided number of survivals (provided in the leftmost column of Table 4), equal to population minus number of deaths, by number of relief stations of each township, to obtain an approximate estimate of relief demand faced by each relief station in that township. For example, the number of survivals in Nantou was 104,000 and there were four relief stations in this township, so each relief station faced a relief demand 26,000.

In the earthquake’s aftermath, the maximum demand-weighted travel time between the two URDCs (i.e., Nantou Stadium and Jiji Town Hall) and the 51 relief stations was 783,000 persons-minutes (from either one of the two URDCs to relief station JS-B with relief demand equal to 29,000 persons and travel time equal to 27min). Without considering relief demand and travel time uncertainties, this work solved a deterministic WVPC problem based on the data in Table 4. In the solution, Caotun Middle School and Jhushan Elementary School are selected as the URDCs, with a maximum demand-weighted travel time equal to 619,500 persons-minutes (from Caotun Middle School to relief station PL-E with relief demand equal to 10,500 persons and travel time equal to 59minutes). Setting up the URDCs at this two sites significantly reduces the maximum demand-weighted travel time (783,000−619,500=163,500 persons- minutes), which indicates a potential improvement in relief distribution efficiency by locating URDCs at the sites suggested by the deterministic WVPC model.

                      presents the computational results of solving the nine RWVPC problem instances. As expected, the robustness cost increases as the uncertainty level, (α
                     1, α
                     2), increases. The URDCs selected in the RWVPC model differ significantly from those in the deterministic WVPC model. Particularly, while an URDC is located at Caotun Middle School in the WVPC model, this site is not included in the RWVPC model for different levels of data uncertainty. Moreover, Puli High School is selected in the RWVPC model for different levels of data uncertainty, but not in the WVPC model. The difference in selected URDCs highlights the importance of considering data uncertainty in choosing URDC sites. The results also suggest that Puli High School is an appropriate site for locating an URDC while considering uncertain relief demands and travel times.

With particular emphasis on supporting the decision of locating URDCs in an emergency logistics network responding to quick-onset natural disasters, this work developed the RWVPC model and its solution algorithm. The model aims to minimize the worst-case deviation in maximum demand-weighted travel time between URDCs and relief stations from the optimal solution. Rather than using probability distributions to describe data uncertainty, the model represents uncertain relief demands and travel times using prescribed fixed intervals. A reformulation was proposed in Theorem 1 to facilitate identifying the worst-case scenario among an infinite number of possible scenarios, and evaluating robustness costs. The generic algorithmic framework, which incorporates the reformulation in Theorem 1, was developed to obtain robust solutions in a reasonable amount of computational time.

A large number of problem instances, with various problem sizes and different degrees of data uncertainty, were generated and solved using the SA-based heuristic. The numerical results show that the proposed heuristic is able to efficiently obtain optimal, or near-optimal, solutions. It was also found that the robust solutions determined by the proposed method do not trade off much quality (or optimality) for robustness. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed RWVPC model to real-world instances, a case study based on Jiji Earthquake, which hit central Taiwan on September 21, 1999, was conducted. In this case study, the URDCs selected in the RWVPC model differ from those in the deterministic WVPC problem, highlighting the importance of considering data uncertainty when choosing URDC sites.

This work contributes significantly to the growing body of literature developing robust optimization approaches to emergency logistics. A number of interesting studies can be conducted based on the developed robust emergency facility location model and algorithm. First, one can compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SA-based heuristic with those of other meta-heuristics (e.g., Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search). Second, some practical constraints (e.g., capacity and budget constraints on facilities) can be considered when determining emergency facility locations. Moreover, a convex combination of pessimistic and optimistic decision making can provide a sensitivity analysis on different degrees of utility or satisfaction for the WVPC problem with interval weights on transportation networks under general conditions (e.g., Majumdar and Bhunia, 2011).
