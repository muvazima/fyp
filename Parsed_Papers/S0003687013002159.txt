                  The maximum coefficient of friction that can be supported at the shoe and floor interface without a slip is usually called the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) for human locomotion. The probability of a slip could be estimated using a statistical model by comparing the ACOF with the required coefficient of friction (RCOF), assuming that both coefficients have stochastic distributions. An investigation of the stochastic distributions of the ACOF of five different floor surfaces under dry, water and glycerol conditions is presented in this paper. One hundred friction measurements were performed on each floor surface under each surface condition. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test was used to determine if the distribution of the ACOF was a good fit with the normal, log-normal and Weibull distributions. The results indicated that the ACOF distributions had a slightly better match with the normal and log-normal distributions than with the Weibull in only three out of 15 cases with a statistical significance. The results are far more complex than what had heretofore been published and different scenarios could emerge. Since the ACOF is compared with the RCOF for the estimate of slip probability, the distribution of the ACOF in seven cases could be considered a constant for this purpose when the ACOF is much lower or higher than the RCOF. A few cases could be represented by a normal distribution for practical reasons based on their skewness and kurtosis values without a statistical significance. No representation could be found in three cases out of 15.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The data from the Liberty Mutual Safety Index (Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety, 2012) showed that costs for disabling workplace injuries in 2010 due to falls on the same level in the US were estimated to be approximately 8.61 billion US dollars or 16.9% of the total cost burden. The same data also showed that while the overall costs of disabling workplace injuries decreased 4.7% between 1998 and 2010, after adjusting for inflation, the cost of falls on the same level increased by 42.3% over the same period. Therefore, falls on the same level are a serious problem in occupational injuries.

As summarized by Chang et al. (2001b), friction plays an important role in injuries triggered by underfoot slips that could result in falls. The maximum coefficient of friction (COF) that can be supported at the shoe and floor interface without a slip is usually called the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) for human locomotion (Chang, 2004). The minimum COF needed at the shoe and floor interface to support human locomotion is called the required coefficient of friction (RCOF). A slip may occur when the RCOF for an activity exceeds the ACOF at the shoe and floor interface (Redfern et al., 2001). Hanson et al. (1999) developed a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of a fall in which actual fall incidents in a laboratory environment were related to the differences between the means of the RCOF and ACOF. Burnfield and Powers (2006) adopted a similar approach to investigate the probability of falls using a different slipmeter from the one used by Hanson et al. to measure the ACOF. In these two studies, the probability of slip incidents was predicted based on the differences between the means of the RCOF and ACOF without considering the contributions from their variations and potential dependency on the materials and conditions used.

A statistical model was developed to compare the ACOF and RCOF in estimating the probability of a slip or fall incident (Chang, 2004). A stochastic distribution was assumed in this model for both the ACOF (p
                     
                        a
                     ) and RCOF (p

                     ) as shown in Fig. 1
                     . According to Chang (2004), the cumulative probability for the RCOF (μ
                     
                        r
                     ) to exceed the ACOF (μ

                      are the probability density functions for the RCOF and ACOF, respectively. In addition to differences in the mean values for the estimate of slip probability as used by Hanson et al. (1999) and Burnfield and Powers (2006), this statistical model demonstrated, as illustrated by Chang (2004), that the variations in the RCOF and ACOF could also contribute to the probability of a slip. Therefore, the estimate of the probability of a slip or fall incident may be improved by using stochastic distributions for the RCOF and ACOF with consideration of the difference between their means as well as their variations. A better understanding of the stochastic distribution of the RCOF and ACOF will help improve the inputs to the statistical model that could better predict slip probability. Chang et al. (2008, 2012b) recently reported an investigation on the stochastic distribution of the RCOF. Their results showed that the RCOF distribution for each individual under each walking condition had a slightly larger number of cases that had a good match with the normal distribution (85.5%) than the log-normal (84.5%) and Weibull (81.5%) distributions. Therefore, among three distributions evaluated, the normal distribution was a preferred representation for the RCOF with additional benefits of its simplicity, practicality and familiarity. However, in few cases (7.75%), none of the three distributions was a good match for the RCOF.

Mechanical devices, also called slipmeters, are usually used to measure the ACOF which always has random variations even when identical samples are used (Chang and Matz, 2001). In addition, variations in friction can result from measurements with different samples of identical floor and shoe materials, as shown by Chang and Matz (2001). Therefore, the ACOF is not a constant for a particular shoe and floor interface, but has a stochastic distribution. Barnett (2002) and Marpet (2002) discussed the concept of a stochastic distribution of the ACOF. Barnett (2002) reported that the distribution of the ACOF was near a Weibull distribution from 400 measurements of the ACOF over 100 new asphalt tiles under dry conditions with the Horizontal Pull Slipmeter (HPS).

Despite these preliminary examinations of the stochastic distributions of the ACOF, the published results are very limited in floor types and surface conditions evaluated. Most slip incidents occur on surfaces with contamination where the ACOF could be low and the probability of a slip incident could be higher than under dry conditions. The stochastic distribution of the ACOF could depend on the floor surfaces and surface conditions. Chang et al. (2012a) reported a preliminary study on the ACOF of quarry tiles under three surface conditions of dry, water and glycerol. They reported that the ACOF under the glycerol condition had a good match with all three continuous distributions, the normal, lognormal and Weibull, while the ACOF under wet condition had a good match with the normal and lognormal distributions. They further reported that the ACOF under the dry condition did not have a good match with any of the three distributions. The goal of the current study was to expand the investigation of the stochastic distributions of the ACOF by adding four more different floor surfaces under the dry, water and glycerol contaminated conditions as an input to the statistical model. These five different floor materials were selected out of 37 commonly used floor materials in a previous study due to their distinctive features that represented different combinations of friction levels and cognitive elements (Lesch et al., 2008). Since most slip incidents occur on contaminated surfaces, investigating the ACOF distributions on surfaces covered with water and glycerol is critical.

@&#METHOD@&#

As a part of a larger study, five walkways of approximately 6.1 m long and 81.3 cm wide were constructed. Each walkway was covered with a specific floor tile. The five floor types used in the experiment, referred to as floor types A to E, were: (A) standard flat quarry tile, (B) a standard quarry tile with raised-profiled tread lines perpendicular to the walking direction, (C) vinyl composition sheet, (D) marble tile and (E) glazed porcelain tile. Detailed information about these floor types is listed in Table 1
                     . These five floor types with three different surface conditions (15 cases) provided a wide range of ACOF values.

In contrast to friction measurements on uninstalled floor tiles, measurements on installed tiles on walkways offered more realistic conditions that could potentially affect the ACOF values. Fifty tiles or locations along the walking path on each walkway were selected for friction measurements. Under each surface condition, two friction measurements were performed on each selected tile or location, one in each walking direction, for a total of 100 measurements. The portable inclinable articulated strut slip tester (PIAST), also known as the Brungraber Mark II, was used in this experiment. A standard test method for this slipmeter is published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (ASTM F-1677-05, 2005).

The ACOF was measured under three different surface conditions: dry, water and 45% glycerol concentration. Clean paper towels were used to apply a solution of diluted 50% ethanol mixed with de-ionized water for cleaning the floor surfaces before performing friction measurements. For the water condition, in order to help form a uniform water film over the surface, a wetting agent (Kodak Professional Photo-Flo 200 solution; Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA) was added to the water with a 1 to 200 ratio by volume as suggested by its manufacturer. A garden sprayer was used to apply a fine water mist. As soon as a uniform layer of water was generated on the surface, judged by visual inspection, the process was terminated. For the glycerol condition, a paint roller was used to apply the contaminant of the mixture of 45% glycerol with water by weight. Liquid contaminant, such as water or glycerol, was replenished throughout repeated impacts on the floor surface during a friction measurement on a contaminated surface.

The ACOF was measured in this experiment with smooth Neolite test liners, a commonly used footwear material for slipmeter friction measurements in the US. The material was cut into approximately 7.6 by 7.6 cm squares to be attached to the test foot holder of the slipmeter as a footwear test pad. Before the first measurement at each tile or location under each floor surface condition, the surface of the Neolite pad was sanded using hand pressure with 400 grit silicon carbide abrasive paper. The sanding protocol described by Chang et al. (2012a) was used in this experiment. A brush was used to remove excess particles on the Neolite surface due to sanding. The sanding procedure was repeated until any visible scratches or dirt were removed from the Neolite surface.

The PIAST is an inclined-strut slipmeter. During a measurement with this slipmeter, the operator systematically impacts the floor with multiple strikes at different angles to determine the angle at which a non-slip becomes a slip. Only a fast movement was considered as a slip as described in Chang (2002). Instead of the scale of the slipmeter showing the angle, however, it shows only the COF reading, which represents the tangent of the acute angle between the normal to the floor surface and the direction of impact. The procedure for operating this slipmeter becomes systematically impacting the floor with this slipmeter at different COF readings, as shown on the scale that represents the impact angle, and looking for the COF reading at which a non-slip becomes a slip. The friction measurement should start at a low COF reading and increase by 0.05 as long as a non-slip persists, according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Once a slip occurs, COF reading is reduced by 0.01 as long as the slip persists. The measurement is stopped at the next occurrence of a non-slip. The COF reading of the last slip is recorded as the result of the measurement. All the friction measurements in this experiment were performed by one operator.

For each surface condition and floor surface, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test was used to determine whether the distribution of the ACOF had a good match with a commonly-used continuous distribution (normal, log-normal or Weibull). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing a sample with a reference probability distribution. It is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the two distributions and also works for non-normally distributed data as well.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the measured COF for each surface condition and floor surface are shown in Table 2
                     .

The p values for the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test for each surface condition and floor surface are shown in Table 3
                     . There is a statistically significant difference or lack of fit between the distribution of the data with a given distribution when the p value of the goodness-of-fit test is less than 0.05. When the p value is greater than 0.05, there is no evidence of lack of fit, i.e., a good match. The results of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test indicated that the ACOF distribution appears to fit the normal and log-normal distributions under the water condition for the quarry tile, and all three distributions under dry condition for the porcelain tile as well as under the glycerol condition for the quarry tile. However, no match with a statistical significance was found between the distribution of ACOF and any of the three continuous distributions evaluated for the rest of the 12 out of 15 cases.

The distributions of the data for each floor type and surface condition that had a good match with any of the three continuous distributions with a statistical significance are shown with the three continuous distributions in Figs. 2–4
                     
                     
                      for water and 45% glycerol conditions with the smooth quarry tile and dry conditions with the porcelain tile, respectively. In contrast, an ACOF distribution that did not have a match with any of three distributions is shown in Fig. 5
                     .

The results reported by Chang et al. (2012b) showed that the distribution of the RCOF had a good match with the commonly used continuous distributions in a majority of cases. In particular, the RCOF distribution for each individual under each walking condition had a slightly larger number of cases that had a good match with the normal distribution (85.5%) than the log-normal (84.5%) and Weibull distributions (81.5%). Almost the opposite results were found for the ACOF. The results show that both the normal and log-normal distributions had a good match with the ACOF in only three out of 15 different cases evaluated, and the Weibull distribution had a good match with the ACOF in two cases. Similar to the RCOF distributions, the normal distribution could be used to represent the ACOF distribution in these cases due to its simplicity, practicality and familiarity compared with the log-normal and Weibull distributions.

The RCOF is measured with a force plate under dry conditions and the value of the RCOF is usually non-zero and exists continuously over the range within the data pool, so the stochastic distributions could be used to represent the RCOF in most of the cases as shown by Chang et al. (2012b). With the protocol for the PIAST used in this experiment, the ACOF could only be measured in increments of 0.01; therefore, the slipmeter output could not resolve any differences in the ACOF less than 0.01. The ACOF range was obtained by subtracting the minimum ACOF value from the maximum ACOF under the identical floor type and surface condition within the data pool summarized in Table 2. Some cases in this study had a very small range in the ACOF such as the smooth quarry tile and marble under dry conditions, and the porcelain tile under wet and glycerol conditions. With a resolution of 0.01 in ACOF measurements, there was not enough variation in the data when the ACOF had a small range such as the example shown in Fig. 5, so the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test was unable to carry out a proper comparison with this limitation. So, it appears that small values in skewness and kurtosis and a larger range seem to be the criteria for a good match with the normal distribution with a statistical significance. By judging the results presented in Tables 2 and 3, most of the cases that did not have a good match with the normal distribution had a range of less than 0.15 and skewness and kurtosis more than 1.0. Therefore, the cases with skewness and kurtosis values less than 1.0 and a range more than 0.16 could have a good match with the normal distribution. However, there was an exception. The case of the ridged quarry tile under the glycerol condition, which had a range of ACOF 0.31, skewness −0.3 and kurtosis 0.4, did not have a good match with the normal distribution according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, although the p value for this was 0.024, so it could be considered marginal for a match.

The ACOF could be very close to zero with the presence of contaminants. Because the ACOF is not less than zero in practice, there could be a large number of the ACOF values around zero such as the marble wet and glycerol conditions. For those cases, none of the stochastic distributions could fit well.

For the purpose of estimating slip probability, the stochastic distribution of the ACOF is compared with that of the RCOF. Chang et al. (2012b) collected a total of 30,968 successful strikes from 50 participants under four different walking conditions with standard quarry tiles (Floor type A) and footwear with Neolite as the heel material under dry conditions and reported the RCOF ranged from 0.112 to 0.413. Although the RCOF values are highly dependent on activities, the ACOF obtained in the current study could be compared with the RCOF obtained by Chang et al. (2012b) as an example. For practical purposes, one could assume that the ACOF is a constant represented by the mean value without significantly affecting the estimate of slip probability when the ACOF is much lower or higher than the RCOF. Seven cases could be included in this category such as smooth quarry dry (0.84), quarry ridged dry (0.82), marble wet (0.002) and glycerol (0.001), vinyl dry (0.91), and porcelain wet (0.03) and glycerol (0.01).

Besides the three cases that had a match of the commonly used distributions with a statistical significance, the remainder of five cases could be judged by their skewness and kurtosis values. The values of skewness and kurtosis could be used to determine if the ACOF distribution has a chance for a good match with the normal distribution. The kurtosis value has been reduced by three, so the normal distribution has a value of zero. A perfect normal distribution with zero skewness and kurtosis rarely occurs in real life. For the practical purpose of identifying a distribution close to a normal distribution, the standard error of skewness (SES) and the standard error of kurtosis (SEK) can be used where SES = √(6/N) and SEK = √(24/N), with N the sample size (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996). If the skewness or kurtosis of the ACOF values is more than two times SES or SEK, respectively, they are probably skewed to a significant degree. The sample size for each case was 100 in the current study, so SES = 0.245 and SEK = 0.490. Although they did not have a match with a normal distribution with a statistical significance, quarry ridged wet and glycerol conditions could be considered as relatively close to a normal distribution for practical purposes since their skewness and kurtosis values do not exceed two times SES and SEK values, respectively. No representation was found in three cases out of 15, marble dry condition and vinyl wet and glycerol conditions.

In the first study on the stochastic distribution of the ACOF, Barnett (2002) reported that the distribution of the ACOF was near a Weibull distribution from 400 measurements of the ACOF over 100 new asphalt tiles under dry conditions with the Horizontal Pull Slipmeter (HPS). In our preliminary study with one floor material (Chang et al., 2012a), we found that two cases (wet and glycerol) could be represented by the normal, log-normal and Weibull distributions, but could not find a match for the dry condition. Without any further study, one might conclude that a good match with normal, log-normal or Weibull distribution exists in most of the cases. As we expanded the study from one floor material to five with continuation on dry, wet and glycerol conditions like that in Chang et al. (2012a) and 1500 measurements, we found that the distributions of most of the conditions actually could not have a match with these commonly used distributions with a statistical significance. The results reported in the current manuscript certainly open up other possibilities that are far more complex than what had heretofore been reported.

Under identical material combinations and test conditions, different slipmeters could produce very different ACOF values and different operators could produce different ACOF values with identical slipmeters (Chang et al., 2001a). The stochastic distributions of the ACOF were evaluated under three surface conditions using five different floor materials in this experiment. More evaluations should be done regarding the stochastic distributions of the ACOF considering factors such as different slipmeters, operators, material combinations and surface conditions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the data evaluated in the current study, both the normal and log-normal distributions had a good match with the ACOF in three out of 15 different cases evaluated and the Weibull distribution had a good match with the ACOF in two cases. The normal distribution could be used to represent the ACOF distribution in these cases due to its simplicity, practicality and familiarity compared with the log-normal and Weibull distributions. Under the surface conditions that could result in a very low ACOF, there could be a large number of measurements with the ACOF values near zero. Likewise, there could be a large number of measurements with a high ACOF under dry conditions. In the estimate of slip probability, when the ACOF is compared with the RCOF, one could assume, for practical purposes, that the ACOF is a constant under certain circumstances without significantly affecting the estimate of slip probability. Seven more cases could be represented as constants when compared with RCOF. Two cases could be represented for practical purposes by a normal distribution by their skewness and kurtosis values. No representation could be found in three cases out of 15. More measurements are needed to explore the ACOF distributions of other surfaces and conditions.
