                  Gamma-carboxylation, one type of post-translational modifications, is involved in many human disease. However, very few computational methods for gamma-carboxylation site prediction are available. In this paper, we develop a novel method CarboxySVM which is based on support vector machine with radial basis function kernel to identify the gamma-carboxylation sites. In this method, we combine position specific scoring matrices (PSSM)-based evolutionary conservation scores and other sequences-derived descriptors. As a result, an accuracy of 91.2% is achieved on training dataset with fivefold cross validation, and 91.8% on the independent test dataset. It is demonstrated by empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets that our method outperforms several other modern predictors. Our model reveals that evolutionary conservation is higher in carboxylation sites, compared to non-carboxylation sites. The composition of arginine in carboxylation sites is higher than that of non-carboxylation sites.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Gamma-carboxylation means that glutamic acid (Glu) transforms into gamma-glutamate (Gla). It is catalyzed by a vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamate carboxylase in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (Bristol et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1991). In this modification, carbon dioxide (CO2) is added at gamma-carbon of glutamic acid residue. Gamma-carboxylation plays important role in vascular calcification (Schurgers, 2013), bone fracture (Fusaro et al., 2011), and warfarin embryopathies (Neacsu et al., 2011).

In lab, researchers used mass spectrometry to determine gamma-carboxylation acid residues (Morris et al., 1995; Niiranen et al., 2002). Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and expensive to identify gamma-carboxylation sites. It is necessary to develop a computational method to predict the gamma-carboxylation. Lee et al. (2011) built a support vector machine model based on composition of amino acids, predicted solvent accessible surface area (ASA), predicted secondary structure and positional weighted matrix. Zhang et al. (2012) built a random forest model which fused compositions of amino acids, sequence conservations, disorder regions, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, and physicochemical/biochemical properties to predict the gamma-carboxylation sites.

Although these methods performed accurately and robustly, some factors, for example evolutionary conservation, structural affinities of carboxylation sites, should be considered (Lee et al., 2011). Zhang et al. (2012) utilized one row of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), which is a 20-dimensional vector, as conservation scores of a residue. Secondary structure was denoted by 3-bit binary string. However, these features are too simple. One motivation of this paper is to examine whether the improvement can be made by combining more evolutionary conservation. To this end, we investigated more evolutionary conservation of carboxylation sites and secondary structure affinities of carboxylation sites. We carefully designed two new features on PSSM profiles and some other sequence-derived descriptors to improve the performance for identifying gamma-carboxylation sites. Our method outperforms other modern predictors by empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets.

We retrieved 287 protein sequences, which contain 448 gamma carboxylated glutamate (Glu, E) from UniProt (version 2012_03) (The UniProt Consortium, 2012). All annotated carboxylated Glu residues are regarded as positive samples, while non-annotated carboxylated Glu sites are regarded as negative samples. There are totally 825 non-carboxylated Glu sites which were regarded as negative.

We extracted one 21-residue peptide fragment for each annotated/non-annotated gamma-carboxylated Glu site. The gamma-carboxylation site is at the center, plus 10 residues upstream and 10 residues downstream of the modification site. The peptides with length less than 21 residues were complemented by “X”. We removed the 21mer segments, which have the identity of more than 25% using BLASTCLUST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). The non-redundant dataset contains 1252 sites, where there are 816 negative sites and 436 positive sites. We randomly selected 70% of the non-redundant data set as the training dataset (Train70), 30% as test dataset (Test30) (Table 1
                        ).

In this paper, Train70 is used to build the model, and Test30 is used to validate the model. Two datasets Zh
                        
                           train
                         and Zh
                        
                           test
                        , which were first introduced by Zhang et al. (2012), are also used to compare our model with existing methods. In Zh
                        
                           train
                         dataset, there are 40 proteins, where there are 115 positive sites and 251 negative sites. In Zh
                        
                           test
                         dataset, there are 7 proteins, where there are 34 positive sites and 84 negative sites.

We designed features based on followings groups: amino acid composition (AA), predicted disorder (DS), predicted relative solvent accessibility (RSA), predicted secondary structure (SS), properties of amino acids (PA), and PSSM-based evolutionary conservation (PEC). We designed following features to encode each 21-mer peptide, which were described as following.

Amino acid composition is the number of residues divided by the sequence length. The properties of amino acid residues are also considered as the new features to improve the prediction performance.

AA_i composition of the 20 amino acid (AA) types, i.e., the count divided by the sequence length, where AA_i stands for the ith amino acid, i
                           =1,…,20 (20 features).

Disorder regions were predicted by DISOPRED (standalone Version 2.4) (Ward et al., 2004).
                              
                                 (1)
                                 Num_DIS, total number of predicted disorder and non-disorder segments (1 feature).

Percent_min/max_Dis/NonDis, predicted minimum/maximum of disorder/non-disorder segments divided by sequence length (2×2=4 features).

Percent_Dis/NonDis, composition of predicted disorder/non-disorder segment (2 features).

Solvent accessible surface area was predicted from the sequence using the Real-Spine (Faraggi et al., 2009). Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) is defined as the ratio of solvent accessible surface area of a residue observed in its three dimensional structure to that observed in an extended (Gly-X-Gly or Ala-X-Ala) tripeptide conformation. The residue is considered to be buried if its predicted RSA is less than 25%; otherwise, it is assumed to be exposed. We computed the RSA normalized using Ala-X-Ala tripeptide as suggested by Ahmad and colleagues (Ahmad et al., 2003, 2004).
                              
                                 (1)
                                 Num_RSA, total number of buried/exposed residue fragment (1 feature).

Num_Bd/Ed, number of predicted buried, exposed segments, where Bd stands for buried residues, Ed stands for exposed residues (2 features).

Percent_min/max_Bd/Ed, composition of predicted minimum/maximum of buried/exposed segments (2×2=4 features).

                                    =1, 2,…,21 (21 features).

In order to explore the character of the secondary structure and disorder region surrounding carboxylation sites, secondary structures were predicted by PSIPRED(3.3) (McGuffin et al., 2000).
                              
                                 (1)
                                 Num_SS, total number of secondary structure (SS) fragment (1 feature).

Num_C/H/E, number of predicted secondary structure segments, where C stands for coil, H stands for helix and E stands for strands (3 features).

Percent_min/max_C/H/E, predicted minimum/maximum of coil/helix/strand segments divided by the sequence length (2×3=6 features).

Percent_C/H/E, composition of predicted coil/helix/strand. That is the number of coil/helix/strand divided by the sequence length (3 features).

We used 49 selected physical chemical, energetic and conformational properties of the amino acids in this work. These properties have been used in pre-work (Gromiha and Selvaraj, 1999; Gromiha, 2005; Gromiha et al., 2006). More detailed descriptions can be found at http://www.cbrc.jp/∼gromiha/fold_rate/property.html. We computed the average and standard variance of the 49 properties for each sequence.

AAproperty_i_mu/sd, the average and standard variance of the ith amino acids property over the whole sequence, where i
                           =1,…,49 (49×2=98 features).

PSSM profiles have been widely used in bioinformatics problems with significant improvement (Gao et al., 2012; Jones, 1999; Xie et al., 2005). The program “blastpgp” (PSI-BLAST) was used to calculate the PSSM profiles with three iterations (−j 3) and no redundant (nr) protein database. We designed three types of evolutionary conservation scores based on the PSSM profile: (a) for each residue in 21mer segment, one row (20-dimensional vector) of PSSM matrix is used as the features of the residue. This is motived by Zhang et al. (2012); (b) for each residue, we computed expected self-information by using the corresponding row of PSSM matrix; and (c) we computed the PSSM scores based on the PSSM profiles by summing up the same amino acid rows in PSSM profiles. This generated a 400-dimensional vector. Then each element of 400-dimensional inputs was divided by the length of the sequence and then scaled by 1/(1+exp(−x)). This PSSM score was also used in Ou et al. (2005).

                                    =1,…,21, which is defined by

We computed the F-scores for each feature, and sorted the features according to the F-score. Firstly, we added the feature with the highest F-score in the selected feature set. Next, we added next feature, of which Pearson correlation coefficient with each feature in the selected feature group was less than 0.9 and its F-score was above 0.05. After the feature selection, the number of remaining features is 88 (Table 2). Then we optimized the parameters for support vector machine (SVM). For radial basis function kernel (RBF), C was searched from 2−5, 2−4,…,215, gamma from 2−15, 2−14,…,23. For linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and sigmoid kernel, we searched C from 2−5, 2−4,…,215, with five-fold cross validation. Finally, the optimal parameters C
                        =2.0 for linear kernel, C
                        =1024 for polynomial kernel, C
                        =128 for sigmoid kernel and C
                        =8, gamma=0.125 for RBF kernel, were obtained, respectively. The SVM algorithm was implemented by libsvm 2.17 software (Chang and Lin, 2011).

We compared several models of support vector machines with linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function kernel and sigmoid kernel on the training dataset. First we selected the models based on five-fold cross validation. In five-fold cross validation test, the training dataset was split into five equal sized subgroups, where four subgroups were used for training and the remaining one was used for test. This process was repeated five times.

We compute accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to evaluate the binary prediction.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

To analyze the composition of amino acid in the carboxylation sites, we used the WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) to plot the frequencies of the amino acids from −10 to +10 flanking non-homologous carboxylation sites. From Fig. 1
                        (A), it can be seen that Glu (E) is highly conserved, which is consistent with the conclusion that gamma-carboxylation recognition sites was closed to the glutamate-rich region (Furie et al., 1997).

We also used the TwoSampleLogo (Vacic et al., 2006) to analyze compositions of amino acids in both positive and negative datasets. Fig. 1(B) shows the position-specific differences in amino acid compositions between carboxylation sites and non-carboxylation sites. Glu (E) is rich in sites −10, −9, −7, −6, −4, −3, −1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10. It could also be found that the Arg(R) is rich in the −10, −7, −5, −4, −1, 3, 8, 9. This phenomenon is consistent with the results in Lee et al. (2011).

After the feature filter, we got 88 selected features (Table 2). The highest F-score is achieved by composition of amino acid Glu (AA_E). The second higher F-score is achieved by PSSM_E_C, which suggests that the evolutionary conservation of Glu and Cys play important roles in the discrimination of modification sites. The following are AAproperty_16_mu, and Percent_H, which mean that the 16th amino acid properties (Beta-helical tendency) and secondary structure helix. Fig. 2
                        (A) shows that the top two features achieve the highest F-scores. In Fig. 2(A), it can be seen that the feature of AA_E of gamma-carboxylation site (positive samples) is higher than that of non-gamma carboxylation site (negative samples). The feature of PSSM_E_C of gamma carboxylation site is higher than those of non-gamma carboxylation site. It implies in this chart that the designed features show significant difference in gamma carboxylation sites and non-gamma carboxylation sites.

We also plotted the heat map of the PSSM_AA_AA feature, which we firstly introduced in this study. The value of heat map is the F-scores, which indicates the power of discrimination of the carboxylation sites and non-carboxylation sites. In Fig. 2(B), we could find that the PSSM_E_C, PSSM_E_A, and PSSM_E_L are very hot. It implies that the evolutionary conservation based on Glu can help to identify the gamma-carboxylation sites.

Our model is based on support vector machine (SVM). We investigated several kernels including linear kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel and sigmoid kernel on Train70. The results (Table 3
                        ) show that the SVM with RBF kernel and polynomial kernel achieves the highest accuracy 91.2%. For both RBF and polynomial kernels, the MCC is 0.805. However, SVM model with RBF kernel achieves higher sensitivity than SVM model with polynomial kernel. It indicated that SVM model with RBF kernel performed better in the identification of gamma-carboxylation sites. In this study, we used the SVM with RBF kernel to build the model (named CarboxySVM).

We also test our model on the test dataset Test30. In the independent test dataset, our model achieved 91.8% accuracy, 0.818 MCC and 0.881 F-measure value for the test dataset. The sensitivity and specificity is 89.1%, 93.1% on the test dataset, respectively.

To evaluate our model, we compared CarboxySVM with Lee's method (Lee et al., 2011) and Zhang's method (Zhang et al., 2012) (Table 4
                        ). Since the Lee's method and Zhang's method does not provide the stand-alone software or web-server for their methods, we cannot directly compare our method with Lee's and Zhang's method. There are the results of Lee's and Zhang's methods on the Zh
                        
                           test
                         using the training set Zh
                        
                           train
                         in reference (Zhang et al., 2012). As an alternative, we build the model on the training dataset Zh
                        
                           train
                         using the same features as our proposed model, CarboxySVM and predict on the Zh
                        
                           test
                        . Then we can compare our method with Lee's and Zhang's method. On the Zh
                        
                           test
                         dataset, our method achieves the highest accuracy 91.5%. The MCC of our method is 0.798, which is higher than other two methods. It indicated that our novel designed features performs better than the existing methods on the Zh
                        
                           test
                        .

In order to evaluate the performance of each feature group, we predicted the gamma-carboxylation site based on each group feature. Results were shown in Fig. 3
                        . We built the model based on following selected feature groups, i.e., AA, PA, PSSM, RSA, and SS. All models achieved AUC above 0.5. It indicates that all these models are better than random modeling. The use of all selected features results in higher AUC compared to the best performing individual feature group. It is shown that the SVM model with properties of amino acid-based features (PA), which contain hydrophobicity, flexibility and polarity, achieves the highest AUC 0.955 among the individual feature groups, while the model with secondary structure based features achieves AUC 0.795. We also noted that the highest accuracy is achieved by the model that combines all different features.

We investigated the two types of conservation score, one is from Zhang et al. (2012) (denoted by PSSM_slide_i_j, PSSM scores), the other is the PSSM_AA_AA (cumulative PSSM scores). We compared the results of our SVM model with 88 selected features, and the conservation scores introduced in Zhang and the other conservation scores PSSM_AA_AA that we firstly introduced in this work. To do this, we built two SVM-based predictors that used PSSM_slide_i_j (denoted by Model_Slide), and PSSM_AA_AA (denoted by Model_Pair) in the optimal features, respectively. Both models were parameterized on the training dataset in the same way as the SVM models proposed in this work. The results are shown in Fig. 4
                        . The AUC of the Model_Slide and Model_Paire is 0.905 and 0.944 respectively, compared to 0.958 achieved by our model with 88 selected features. We attribute this improvement to the use of novel features and the combination of the new and existing features that are utilized in our approach.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this paper, we designed a novel method CarboxySVM to identify the gamma-carboxylation site. The method is based on support vector machine with radial basis function kernel. Composition of amino acid, predicted relative solvent accessibility, and conservation scores are designed as the input of model. With fivefold cross validation, our method achieves the 91.2% accuracy. On the independent test, our model achieves 91.8% accuracy. Compared with other method, our method achieves 91.8% accuracy and 0.817 MCC. It is worth pointing out that our method is based on fewer features and achieves better results than pre-work.

Our model reveals that evolutionary conservations, reflected by features of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), are favorable by carboxylation sites, compared to non-carboxylation sites. And the composition of glutamate and arginine of carboxylation site is higher than that of non-carboxylation site. These findings may help understanding the mechanisms of gamma-carboxylation.
