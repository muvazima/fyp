                  In this paper we consider nonlinear integer optimization problems. Nonlinear integer programming has mainly been studied for special classes, such as convex and concave objective functions and polyhedral constraints. In this paper we follow an other approach which is not based on convexity or concavity. Studying geometric properties of the level sets and the feasible region, we identify cases in which an integer minimizer of a nonlinear program can be found by rounding (up or down) the coordinates of a solution to its continuous relaxation. We call this property rounding property. If it is satisfied, it enables us (for fixed dimension) to solve an integer programming problem in the same time complexity as its continuous relaxation. We also investigate the strong rounding property which allows rounding a solution to the continuous relaxation to the next integer solution and in turn yields that the integer version can be solved in the same time complexity as its continuous relaxation for arbitrary dimensions.
               
            

It is well known that adding integrality constraints to continuous optimization problems increases their complexity in the majority of cases. A prominent example is linear programming, which can be solved in polynomial time by interior point methods, but becomes NP hard if integrality constraints are added. Integer linear programming has been widely studied and developed into a mature discipline. The theory developed in integer nonlinear programming is much less mature. According to Hemmecke, Köppe, Lee, and Weismantel (2010, chap. 15) who provide a recent overview, “integer nonlinear programming is still a very young field”.

Integer nonlinear programming has been tackled by different communities. In the context of global optimization the main focus is to develop numerical procedures for solving nonlinear integer problems. Also techniques from integer linear programming are transferred to nonlinear integer programs. Results exist for integer concave minimization (equivalently integer convex maximization) which are based on the observation that a (quasi-)concave function attains its minimum (if it exists) at an extreme point of the feasible set. Hence an enumeration of all vertices of the convex hull of the integer points would solve the problem. More efficient structures based on total unimodularity for linear constraints allow polynomial procedures. Results for integer concave minimization can be found for example in De Loera, Hemmecke, Onn, and Weismantel (2008). The methods used for convex integer minimization are different; early approaches include the extension of branch and bound methods for linear integer programming (Gupta & Ravindran, 1985) which has been extended for example to convex quadratic integer programming (Buchheim, Caprara, & Lodi, 2012), or an extension of the cutting plane technique of Kelley (1960). More recently, outer approximation procedures have been suggested (Bonami et al., 2008). Research has also been done for special cases such as integer minimization of polynomial functions over polyhedral sets where an FPTAS is possible (De Loera, Hemmecke, Köppe, & Weismantel, 2006), of separable convex functions over polyhedral sets where proximity results are provided in Hochbaum and Shanthikumar (1990) or of strongly convex functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients over polytopes (Baes, Del Pia, Nesterov, Onn, & Weismantel, 2012). The idea of test sets for linear integer optimization problems (Graver, 1975) was transferred to some special cases of nonlinear integer optimization in Lee, Onn, and Weismantel (2008). Boolean nonlinear optimization has been considered for special types of problems, many of them motivated by discrete or network optimization as for example the quadratic assignment problem. An example for a recent approach can be found in Buchheim and Rinaldi (2007).

The approach we suggest in this paper is based on the level sets of the objective function: given a function 
                        
                           f
                           :

                      can be reformulated as

                     . This approach provides structural insight into the properties of an optimal solution. In particular we investigate the rounding property, i.e., in which cases one can solve the integer version of a nonlinear optimization problem by rounding (up or down) the coordinates of a solution to its continuous relaxation. If the rounding property holds for a problem, a finite dominating set is given by the set of all integer points adjacent to an optimal solution of its continuous relaxation. Therefore our results can be seen as proximity results (similar to Hochbaum & Shanthikumar (1990)) as we identify cases where

                     . It is known that convexity does not imply such a rounding property. However, we identify two different problem classes that satisfy the rounding property. These problems need not be convex and their objective functions not even continuous. Our analysis is done by investigating the geometric structure of the level sets.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we introduce the rounding property. In Sections 3 and 4 we present two different geometric criteria which ensure the rounding property. Both lead to classes of nonlinear integer optimization problems which can be solved efficiently. The paper is ended by some conclusions and further research questions.

The strong rounding property guarantees that if

                           CP

                      is polynomially solvable then

                      is also solvable in polynomial time not only for fixed dimension.

Note that a function may have the (strong) rounding property without being continuous. However, continuity might be helpful in order to solve

                     Fig. 1
                      shows some examples for cross-shaped sets. Note that cross-shaped sets need not be convex (see Fig. 1-left) and convex sets need not be cross-shaped (see Fig. 1-right). On the other hand cross-shaped sets are always star-shaped but star-shaped sets need not be cross-shaped (see Fig. 1-middle and right).

There are some basic set operations that preserve cross-shapedness of sets: a set M that is cross-shaped w.r.t.

An easy consequence of this lemma is that axisparallel ellipsoid are cross-shaped with respect to its center. This means that if

                        Remark 3.1
                        Note that separable convex functions have cross-shaped level sets but the class of functions whose level sets are cross-shaped is much larger – just note that a monotonic norm need not be separable convex to give just one example.

                           (
                           BP
                           )
                        
                      and is also not efficient if n is too large. Unfortunately, cross-shapedness of the intersection of the level sets with the feasible set does usually not lead to the strong rounding property.

Hence, we are interested in identifying cross-shaped sets that also guarantee the strong rounding property.

                            is cross-shaped and coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. b. Therefore also the intersection with F is coordinate axially symmetric and cross-shaped and thus the problem has the strong rounding property and an optimal solution is given by 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          b
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , see the example in Fig. 2
                           .

If F is cross-shaped but not coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. b we get that the problem has the rounding property and that an optimal solution to (IP) is in 
                              
                                 Round
                                 (
                                 b
                                 )
                              
                           .

It is important to remark that cross-shapedness is sufficient for the rounding property but not at all necessary. An example for a completely different geometric shape which also guarantees the rounding property is provided in the next section.

The proof of Theorem 4.1 works because we have chosen

                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                      the way it “fits”. However without knowing the value of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 α

                      it is not helpful. To use the theorem in practice it is therefore very important to determine

                     . We start by analyzing the expression in (2) for a fixed point y and then compute

Another interesting question is to ask in which cases the strong rounding property holds. Do functions with quasiround level sets have the strong rounding property? The answer is no, as the example in Fig. 5
                      shows. Note that these level sets are also axially symmetric w.r.t. 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      but nevertheless the function does not have the strong rounding property.

In this paper we used geometric considerations in order to identify functions that have the rounding property, i.e., functions that guarantee that we can find an optimal solution for the integer problem by solving the continuous problem and then comparing only the integer points adjacent to the continuous minimizer. This has the advantage that the complexity of the integer problem is (more or less) given by the complexity of the continuous relaxation. One goal is to increase the class of functions having the rounding property. To this end, we investigate how 
                        
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                      in the definition of quasi-roundness depends on F and to use these properties to come up with a larger value for 
                        
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                        
                     .

Other functions with known level sets are also under investigation. Among others we analyze convex quadratic integer programming problems in Buchheim et al. (2013) and use our approach to improve the bounds given in Buchheim et al. (2012).

The definition of the (strong) rounding property might sometimes be too restrictive because it has to hold for all optimal solutions. We might instead say that a function 
                        
                           f
                           :

                           R
                        
                      has the (strong) specific rounding property if there exists an optimal solution

The advantage of this definition is that it is less restrictive then Definition 2.1 and so it is satisfied by a larger class of functions. If a function f has the rounding property then it certainly also has the specific rounding property. Moreover, both definitions are equivalent if 
                        
                           (
                           CP
                           )
                        
                      has only one optimal solution. The disadvantage is that it is no longer sufficient to find an arbitrary continuous minimizer but we have to find the specific one that gives the function f the required property. This is ongoing research.

Another interesting question is how to apply our results to mixed integer problems. This means we consider problems of the following type:

                      by rounding the solution for the continuous counterpart but with the difference that we round only the coordinates that are required to be integer.
