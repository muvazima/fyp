                  Background and objectives
                  Computer aided analysis of mammograms has been employed by radiologists as a vital tool to increase the precision in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The efficiency of such an analysis is dependent on the employed mammogram enhancement approach; as its major role is to yield a visually improved image for radiologists.
               
               
                  Methods
                  Non-linear Polynomial Filtering (NPF) framework has been explored previously as a robust approach for contrast improvement of mammographic images. This paper presents the extension of NPF framework for sharpening and edge enhancement of mammogram lesions. Proposed NPF serves to provide enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region (region-of-interest) in mammograms, in a manner to minimize the dependencies on pre-selected thresholds. In the present work, Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) model has been employed for the purpose of improvement in visualization of mammograms based on Human Visual System (HVS) characteristics.
               
               
                  Results
                  The proposed NPF filtering framework yields mammograms with significant improvement in contrast, edges as well as sharpness of the lesion region. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated using state-of-art objective evaluation measures (of mammogram enhancement) like Contrast Improvement Index (CII), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ASNR) and Combined Enhancement Measure (CEM); as well as subjective evaluation by radiologists’ opinions.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The proposed NPF provides a robust solution to perform noise controlled contrast as well as edge enhancement using a single filtering model. This leads to a better visualization of the fine lesion details predictive of their severity. The applicability of single filtering methodology for carrying out denoising, contrast and edge enhancement improves the worth of the overall framework.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, as lesions exist in a range of sizes rather than a single threshold value. Literature in the past has demonstrated that identification of lesion region during the first diagnosis bears a vital significance during the prognosis of breast cancer. Screening modalities would be successful if detection occurs prior to the development of micro-metastases [1,2]. Mammography has been the gold standard for breast cancer screening whereas ultrasound, MRI and nuclear medicines are being used as supplementary modalities. Although, mammography is the population screening modality, analysis of mammographic images is costly, time consuming as well as a challenging affair [3–5]. Magnification of the Region-of-Interest (ROI) at times not only blurs the lesion margins but leads to relative enhancement of the background tissues, which makes the overall analysis more complicated. Computer algorithms for pre-processing mammograms are therefore widely employed to enhance contrast and suppress noise in the background in order to improve the lesion region in mammographic images [6,7]. The accuracy in decisions related to the stages of malignancy can be critically evaluated only with the proper visualization of lesion margins. Hence, edge enhancement of the ROI during Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) of mammograms could serve as a vital alternative to accurately locate the features associated with morphology. CAD schemes aid the radiologists in detecting mammographic anomalies which are of subtle nature with greater degree of precisions; posing reduction in numerous unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions [8].

Bilinear realizations of Volterra series expansions are found suitable for filtering systems with Poisson noise inputs [9,10]. Quadratic filters are sub-class of bilinear Volterra filters whose output is linearly dependent upon filter coefficients. Zhou et al. [11] used Alpha-Weighted Quadratic Filter (AWQF) for enhancement of mammograms. AWQF has been extended for edge detection by inclusion of negative powers in the quadratic filter model. This has been done to suppress the homogeneous (uniform) regions of the image while yielding an enhancement of the edge portions [12]. Wavelet based Multiresolution approaches [3] decomposes the mammographic images into sub-bands; these approaches are performance limited owing to their dependency on pre-selected thresholds [13–15]. Another category of non-linear approaches for edge enhancement of mammograms are General Adaptive Neighbourhood Image Processing (GANIP) [16], morphological filtering [17–20] and Unsharp Masking (UM) [21,22]. Different variants of UM were proposed by employing non-linear operators providing satisfactory enhancement results. But, it added to the complexity of the overall enhancement approach along with presence of some overshoots [23–25]. Recently, there are many techniques which employed hybrid combinations of the above discussed enhancement approaches (for mammograms) as in work of Anand et al. [26], Rezaee and Haddadnia [27], Lu et al. [28], Septiana et al. [29], Srivastava et al. [30] and Xinfeng and Shumin [31]. Owing to hybridization, the techniques pose severe computational loads without any note-worthy improvement in terms of edge enhancement. The performance of these techniques is severely degraded for mammograms with dense tissues.

The aim of the present work is to extend the applicability of NPF for enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region (ROI) in mammograms in a manner to minimize the dependencies on pre-selected thresholds. Further, the usability of single filtering methodology for carrying out denoising, contrast and edge enhancement improves the versatility of the overall approach. It has been demonstrated during simulations that the outcomes of the objective evaluation of mammograms (enhanced using the proposed NPF) are in due coherence with that of analysis by radiologists.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The proposed NPF and AWQF [11,12] are deduced from its parent version second order Volterra filters. This very fact lays tremendous fundamental closeness in the above two non-linear filtering algorithms. However, the content in the succeeding paragraphs briefly outlines the difference between the two approaches. Firstly, AWQF as the name suggests is the Quadratic Filter consisting of only the second-order component of the Volterra filter; whereas polynomial filter deployed in this work is a combination of linear and quadratic components of Volterra filter. Secondly, the AWQF implementation using mask sizes higher than 3×3 takes significant assumptions by selecting only the corner pixel values for processing. This assumption may speed up the processing but may lead to loss of significant diagnostic details. The implementation of NPF has been carried out with only 3×3 filtering mask as higher mask sizes not just poses complexities in determination of coefficients but also lead to blurring of lesion edges. Thirdly, the results obtained with AWQF [11] only depict contrast enhancement of mammograms. There are also present regions of over enhancement in the nodal region. The backgrounds and foregrounds are enhanced almost to the marginally same intensity. On the other hand, the results of NPF depict both contrast and edge enhancement of mammograms. Fourthly, the filter structure of Type-0 and I deployed in AWQF [12] contains a more complex mode of assignment of power indices. The process requires a separate threshold selection parameter using the concept of hysteresis threshold. The segmented outcomes show a heavy thresholding leading to a strong suppression of details which may not be beneficial for mammograms. The images obtained using AWQF are finally processed with an HVS masking algorithm using directional kernels. The same NPF framework has been applied for edge enhancement just with the modification of LIP operators without any fundamental changes in tuning parameters or power indices. Lastly, the linear component of NPF provides noise smoothing effect during the edge enhancement process. Unlike, AWQF, there is residual noise in the final edge enhanced output.

The polynomial filtering model comprises of Volterra filters generated by second order truncation on the upper limit of Volterra series [9,32–35]. One of the significant aspects of Volterra filters is that its response is linear with respect to the elements of the kernels and it can be easily determined without any knowledge of higher order statistics of the inputs and output, respectively. The generalized framework of the polynomial filter can be modelled as in Eq. (1).

                        N kernel representing the quadratic filter coefficients. γ denotes the weight index for the linear term in Eq. (2). In this case, the input pixels of the linear filter are raised to the power of 2γ. Similarly, each of the collected and grouped input pixels for the quadratic filter in Eq. (2) is raised to the power of λ. These power indices are appropriately tuned to customize the performance of this filter for mammograms with different categories of background tissues. The above NPF framework yielded significant improvement in performances upon application to digital mammograms for contrast enhancement. This is so, because this filter behaves as a combo of high-pass and low-pass filters, respectively. The quadratic component acts as a high-pass filter which serves to provide contrast improvement and detail preservation, whereas linear component operates as a low-pass filter to provide noise smoothening effect. Based on the distance between the two pixels located within a 3×3 kernel, the NPF can be classified into Type-0, Type-I and Type-II.

Non-linear operators use certain mathematical operators which process the image according to the human perceptions and vision. Theoretically, the transmission and absorption of light follows a logarithmic relationship with human eye. That is why linear operators are not able to provide the results which are able to correlate with human eye. The Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) model of Jourlin and Pinoli [37] has been proved to be physically justified by important laws and characteristics of human brightness perception. This is designed to both maintain the pixels values inside the range as well as for more accurate processing of images from a HVS point of view. The LIP operations are defined using gray tone functions expressed as k(i, j) in Eq. (3).

The proposed NPF framework explores the combination of Type-0 and Type-I polynomial filter as a versatile platform to perform enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region in mammograms. The worthiness of proposed NPF lies in the fact that it avoids the necessity of an additional thresholding mechanism in the entire process to carry out segmentation at subsequent stages. The degree of enhancement can be controlled in an automated manner by minimal tuning of NPF parameters without any variations with the type of abnormality, nature of lesion or the background breast tissues.

Type-0 polynomial filter reduces the blurring of lesion edges and also suppresses the ill-effects of the background noise. This filtering module operates with a low-pass linear component capable of noise suppression and a quadratic component for improving lesion contrast. The mathematical expression of Type-0 polynomial filter consists of the coefficients in which the difference between the two pixels is zero. In addition, the quadratic component also compensates for the blurring induced by the linear filter on the mammogram details. After collecting and grouping all isotropic and symmetric terms in Eq. (2) the linear and quadratic components are expressed as in Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively. Both the components (in Eqs. (5) and (6)) are combined in Eq. (7) to yield Type-0 NPF.

The improvement in contrast and denoising is performed majorly by this component of the proposed NPF. On the other hand, sharpening of features can be performed via the Type-I component (well suited for detection of correlated content). Type-I polynomial filter therefore provides further edge enhancement of mammogram lesions segmenting the lesion margins with respect to its background tissues. The mathematical expression of quadratic component of Type-I polynomial filter in Eq. (8) consists of the coefficients in which the difference between the two input pixels is one. This quadratic component is combined with linear component of Eq. (5) to yield Type-I NPF in Eq. (9).

The same NPF framework can be extended for edge enhancement by incorporating the operators of LIP model. This can be explored by replacing the arithmetic addition of Type-0 and Type-I filter responses in Eq. (10) by logarithmic addition operator.

The proposed NPF framework (for edge enhancement) serves to enhance the sharpness of the lesion region performing significant segmentation of the ROI with respect to the surrounding tissues. The incorporation of LIP model based processing has posed significant improvements in visualizations as LIP arithmetic operator's yields more robust functioning well within the acceptable range of image [38,39].

The mammograms used in the present work for simulations are obtained from DDSM database [40]. This database consists of nearly 2620 breast cases, where each case includes two mammograms (MLO and CC views of the breast), along with radiologists’ markings of containing suspicious regions. On the basis of their assessment/subtlety, these mammograms are rated on a scale of one to five (1 – completely normal, 5 – highly suspicious for cancer) using the BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, according to the American College of Roentgenology) classification [41,42]. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out on numerous cases from this database. In this paper, the results are presented and discussed using three cases from DDSM database; yielding 7 test mammograms (denoted here as: Mam#1 to Mam#7). All the test mammograms used, contains a mass of rating 5 indicating cancerous characteristics with strong suspect of malignancy. The details of lesion characteristics of the test mammograms are mentioned in Table 1
                     . The versatility of the proposed NPF is based on the concept of utilizing the similar framework for improving contrast as well as sharpness of the lesion region (i.e. obtaining contrast and edge enhancement). In addition, both the NPF frameworks are based on similar filter coefficients (linear as well as quadratic filter) and operate with minimal tuning of parameters (power indices: a, b and c which jointly controlled via single parameter-μ).

For performance assessment of the proposed NPF along with its comparison with other state of art approaches, it is necessary to perform objective evaluation of obtained mammograms with suitable quality metrics (for quantification of improvements in contrast and sharpness). Firstly, the evaluation of contrast enhancement algorithm is carried out using Contrast Improvement Index (CII) as the figure of merit [36]. Higher values of CII indicate improvement in contrast of lesion region with respect to soft tissues in the background. Secondly, to assess amount of denoising carried out and to evaluate further that the contrast enhancement is not leading to enhancement in background noise levels; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ASNR) are estimated. Higher values of PSNR and ASNR are indicative of suppression of background noise levels during contrast enhancement. Finally, to evaluate the degree of improvement in sharpness of lesion boundaries (edge enhancement), Combined Enhancement Measure (CEM) [43] is used as the quality metric. CEM is a function of three parameters: Distribution Separation Measure (DSM), Target-to-Background Contrast Enhancement based on Standard Deviation (TBCs) and Target-to-Background Contrast Enhancement based on Entropy (TBCe). Higher values of these three individual parameters (greater than zero) and lower values of CEM indicate an improvement in edge enhancement. These performance metrics not only serve as a tool for quality evaluation of obtained mammograms but also help in optimal tuning and selection of NPF parameters. The parameters are optimally selected using the metrics for contrast enhancement (CII) and that for edge enhancement (CEM) [43]. The implementation of the proposed NPF is based on the following optimally selected coefficients/parameters as mentioned in Table 2
                     .

The results of contrast and edge Enhancement for Case A_1004 (Mam #1 and #2) are shown in Fig. 1
                     . In this figure, the original mammograms in Fig. 1(a) and (e) (MLO and CC views, respectively) are transformed after contrast enhancement and shown as in Fig. 1(b) and (f), while Fig. 1(c) and (g) contains mammograms after edge enhancement (increased sharpening) using the proposed NPF. Further, in Fig. 1(d) and (g) shows the extracted ROI-lesion region after edge enhancement (with proposed method) showing clear visualization of lesion margins. In same fashion, Figs. 2 and 3
                     
                      show the edge enhanced ROI-lesion regions (with increased sharpness) in mammograms (Mam #3 and #4) and (Mam#5 and #6), respectively.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

The first illustrative discussion of the simulation results is presented based on the application of proposed NPF on Mam#1 and #2, respectively, which are the MLO and CC views of Case A_1004 (as shown in Fig. 1). Both the views (of the case in Mam#1 and #2) contain an irregular lesion with ill-defined margins. Fig. 1(b) and (f), respectively, shows the enhanced lesion region (in the foreground) with a very reasonable suppression of the background. This is a highlighting aspect of the proposed approach that it provides not just the contrast improved version of the lesion but also a clear visualization of the neighbouring background (tissues, arteries and other diagnostic details). The surrounding region to the lesion also plays an important role in the mammogram that has been realized by avoiding uncontrolled suppression of background tissues which is a common trait of the feature and region based enhancement approaches for mammograms. On the other-hand the visualization of lesion margins in the ROI could be possible only with a significant suppression of the background. This feature leads to control the overshoots in the ROI, increasing the sharpness which is necessary for highlighting the margins with respect to the background. In addition, the suspicious regions in the background are also sharpened which are assistive for assessment in terms of grades of malignancy. Evaluation by radiologists have also reported sharper lesion region in the ROI along with the pronounced visibility of a ‘micro-nodule’ after edge enhancement (in both CC and MLO views of Case A_1004) which was non perceptually distinct in the original mammograms. The same has been achieved with LIP version of NPF customized to yield edge enhancement of lesions as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (g), respectively. The zoomed version of the ROI in former results is given in Fig. 1(d) and (h). The same has been supported with a good increment in the values of CII to quantify the degree of improvement in contrast where as the magnitude of noise suppression is depicted by the values of PSNR and ASNR, respectively (as shown in Table 3
                     ). In addition, the evaluation of the edge enhancement and sharpness is provided by lower values of CEM. Similar results have been shown for Mam #3 and #4, respectively (for Case C_0031 containing an irregularly shaped lesion with spiculated margins) shown in Fig. 2. The contrast enhancement has been demonstrated in Fig. 2(b) in terms of improvement of ROI along with the visualization of the background region. The figure shows a distinct view of the blood vessels connecting to the lesion region. This is supported with a remarkable increase in the value of the PSNR as depicted in Table 3. There is a good visualization of the nodal region in the MLO view with a significantly high value of CII; even larger in comparison to the same case in CC view (Fig. 2).

The edge enhanced ROI (with the suppressed backgrounds) are shown in Fig. 2(c) for the lesion in both CC and MLO views, respectively. The spiculated margins of the lesion are distinct in the edge enhanced ROI of Fig. 2(c) along with the clear view of the adjoining blood vessels associated with the lesion. The obtained values of CEM are also significantly low (Table 3). Mam #5 and #6, respectively, are next in the sequence of the simulated results showing CC and MLO views of case C_0147 (containing lesion with lobulated shape and margins) in Fig. 3.

There is an improvement in contrast of ROI along with visualization of the neighbouring region coupled with high values of performance metrics (Fig. 3(b) and Table 3). The reconstructed image is sharp where the lesion boundaries in Fig. 3(c) give a clear depiction of the malignancy due to the edge enhancement. In addition, the evaluation by radiologists also validates the tight stippling with sharp view of blood vessels and the edges of the nodal region. As already mentioned, the proposed contrast and edge enhancement approach employing NPF has been simulated and the performance is tested on numerous mammograms from this database. However, Table 3 presents the performance evaluation of the test mammograms (listed in Table 2) showing significantly high values of CII and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR & ASNR) and lower values of CEM (above zero values for DSM, TBCs and TBCe). As depicted from Table 3, comparatively better values of performance evaluation parameters are obtained for cases Mam#1, #4 and #6, respectively. Hence, these values are bolded (highlighted) in the respective table to emphasize upon their relevance. The obtained results (mammograms) after contrast and edge enhancement are validated by the subjective evaluations made by the radiologists. The results of the enhancement approach in the present work are objectively evaluated using various Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures for validating and benchmarking of performance. However, it is also necessary that the obtained values of the performance measures should be also consistent with that of subjective evaluation, to ensure coherence with Human Visual System (HVS) characteristics.

In case of medical images (mammograms), subjective evaluations of the obtained results are carried out using opinions/ratings by medical experts/radiologists. In the present work, three radiologists are involved to provide opinion scores/ratings on the various mammogram test cases used. These numerical grading are carried out by the radiologists based on their individual observation of the mammographic images in terms of the visualization of the nodal region (lesion), its edges, background tissues and other relevant diagnostic information. It is necessary that the obtained values of the subjective evaluation should correlate with the IQA metrics used for objective evaluation. For this purpose, Pearsons’ Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) is computed between the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) by radiologists and the values of the CII and PSNR and are reported in Table 4
                     . The aggregate correlation coefficient of 0.802 demonstrates that there is 80% improvement in the contrast and sharpness of the ROI (in the enhanced mammograms) based on the observations and opinions by radiologists. The subjective ratings by the three radiologists aggregate to 80% improvement in the contrast and sharpness of the ROI. In addition, an above satisfactory visualization of the background tissues and fine details is also reported.

The comparison of the proposed approach has been also carried out with the existing state-of-art enhancement approaches like, Unsharp Masking (UM) based enhancement approach [23], Histogram Equalization based enchantment approaches [44], Alpha-Weighted Quadratic Filter (AWQF) [11,12], polynomial filter [36] and the proposed edge enhancement approach. The comparative results are shown on Mam#7 (Case A_1006 containing an irregular lesion with ill-defined margins) in Fig. 4
                     .

It can be observed from Fig. 4(b) and (c) that the response with UM based enhancement approach is coupled with minimal improvement in contrast with respect to the background. The lesion region depicts excessive brightness, obscuring the lesion edges. On the other hand, Histogram Equalization led to unwanted overshoots in ROI as well as enhancement of background region. Similarly, the response of AWQF shows over enhancement causing non-discernable foreground and background regions. However, the results of proposed NPF in Fig. 4(e)–(g), respectively, show significantly improved results in terms of lesion contrast and sharpness, its edges and proper visualization of background tissues. Here, the higher values of CII depict improvement in contrast of the ROI with respect to the background. Additionally, a higher value of PSNR accounts for the fact that there is neither any over-enhancement nor does the proposed NPF increases the background noise levels. Finally, lower values of CEM, indicate better edge enhancement with increased sharpness of the lesion region. The visual comparison in Fig. 4 supported with quantitative assessment based on the performance metrics in Table 5
                      validates the proposed edge enhancement approach as an improvement over the other approaches.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

NPF is consisting of a non-linear framework of weighted coefficients of low-pass and high-pass filters which tend to provide contrast and edge enhancement with a significant suppression of background noises. The coefficients of proposed NPF are chosen in such a manner that they are isotropic to ensure preservation of edges, fine features and improve upon the sharpness. The simulation results have shown that the response of the proposed NPF has been reasonably good on mammograms containing different types of lesions and margins using combination of Type-0 and Type-I polynomial filters. In addition, the incorporation of LIP operators improves the visualization closer and synchronous to the human perception. This is necessary as the final images are to be processed by radiologists and medical experts for analysis and diagnosis. The obtained results are validated significantly well both in terms of objective evaluation parameters of image quality as well as subjective evaluation by radiologists. The processed mammograms depict better lesion sharpness after edge enhancement coupled with visualization of lesion margins and other morphological details. Further work in this domain, comprises the study and implementation of more sophisticated modifications of LIP, i.e., Symmetric Logarithmic Image Processing (SLIP) model [45] with NPF framework for symmetric-bounded treatment of mammograms during restoration.
