                  During the last decades, multigrid methods have been extensively used in order to solve large scale linear systems derived from the discretization of partial differential equations using the finite difference method. The effectiveness of the multigrid method can be also exploited by using the finite element method. Finite Element Approximate Inverses in conjunction with Richardon’s iterative method could be used as smoothers in the multigrid method. Thus, a new class of smoothers based on approximate inverses can be derived. Effectiveness of explicit approximate inverses relies in the fact that they are close approximants to the inverse of the coefficient matrix and are fast to compute in parallel. Furthermore, the proposed class of finite element approximate inverses in conjunction with the explicit preconditioned Richardson method yield improved results against the classic smoothers such as Jacobi method. Moreover, a dynamic relaxation scheme is proposed based on the Dynamic Over/Under Relaxation (DOUR) algorithm. Furthermore, results for multigrid preconditioned Krylov subspace methods, such as GMRES(res), IDR(s) and BiCGSTAB based on approximate inverse smoothing and a dynamic relaxation technique are presented for the steady-state convection-diffusion equation.

                     results in the following sparse linear system, i.e.
                        
                           (5)

                     where the coefficient matrix A is a nonsingular large, sparse, unsymmetric, positive definite matrix of certain structure with semi-bandwidth m, while u is the FE solution at the nodal points and f is a vector, with components resulting from the combination of source terms and imposed boundary conditions, cf. [10,16,17]. The ordering of the grid points is lexicographical. In the case of triangular elements the width of the bands at semi-bandwidth m is two, while in the case of rectangular elements the width of the bands at semi-bandwidth m is three.

Explicit preconditioned methods have been extensively used for solving sparse linear systems on multiprocessor systems, and the preconditioned form of the sparse linear system (5) is
                        
                           (6)
                           
                              MA
                              u
                              =
                              M
                              f
                           
                        
                     where M is a suitable preconditioner. The preconditioner M has to satisfy the following conditions: (i) MA should have a clustered spectrum, (ii) M can be efficiently computed in parallel, (iii) “M×vector” should be fast to compute in parallel. The effectiveness of explicit approximate inverse preconditioning relies on the use of suitable preconditioners that are close approximants to the inverse of the coefficient matrix and are fast to compute in parallel, cf. [9]. In this article we present a parameterized “smoother” based on the explicit approximate inverse matrix and the explicit preconditioned Richardson iterative method.

During the last decade, multigrid methods, have been extensively used, cf. [1,3,5,12,13,18], for solving large sparse linear systems, and gained substantial interest among the scientific community for both their efficiency and convergence behavior.

Multigrid methods are based on the observation that the high frequency components of the error are damped effectively by a stationary iterative method (such as Jacobi or Gauss–Seidel), however the low-frequency components are not damped effectively. In order for low frequency components of the error to be handled, a series of coarser grids with higher mesh size, using triangular and rectangular elements, are used as shown in Fig. 1
                     . In this series of coarser grids the low-frequency modes of the error are more oscillatory and can be damped efficiently by a stationary iterative method, cf. [1,3,13,14,18]. Multigrid methods are composed by four discrete elements: stationary iterative method, restriction operator, prolongation operator and cycle strategy. The stationary iterative methods are first order iterative methods such as Richardson, Jacobi and Gauss–Seidel method. Restriction and prolongation are transfer operators from finer to coarser grids and from coarser to finer grids respectively. The cycle strategy refers to the sequence in which the grids are visited until a solution with the prescribed tolerance is obtained.

Let us consider the linear systems derived from the discretization of a PDE at different levels, required by the multigrid method, on a unit square domain with different mesh size h:

                              ,
                           
                        
                     The linear system (7) can be solved iteratively with a multigrid method. A multigrid method can be formulated by the recursive call of the two-grid method, with ν
                     1 pre-smoothing steps and ν
                     2 post-smoothing steps as well as a correction on the coarser grid, cf. [3,13,18].

                     ω
                     ⩽1. In order for a stationary method to function as smoother, the smoothing property must be satisfied, cf. [13,14] and has been proven in [6].

The choice of the relaxation parameter for the approximate inverse smoothing scheme is non-trivial and the DOUR scheme, cf. [12], is used to compute the optimal value of ω. The proposed scheme in conjunction with the DOUR method can be expressed as follows:

The DOUR method is also used in conjunction with the Damped Jacobi method, because the choice of the relaxation parameter ω is non-trivial. Further information and convergence analysis of the DOUR algorithm are given in [12].

Transfer operators are used in the multigrid method in order to project or interpolate vectors through a series of grids. Transfer operators are divided in two categories, the restriction and interpolation operators, cf. [3,5,13,18]. The full-weighting restriction operator and bilinear prolongation operator were used for the proposed multigrid schemes. These operators are related through the Galerkin condition, thus simplifying the mapping on the data, cf. [3].

The cycle strategy is an essential component of the multigrid algorithm and refers to the sequence that the computations will occur in order to obtain the required solution vector and coarse grid corrections in each level. The common cycle strategy is the V-Cycle algorithm, cf. [3,13,18]. The V-Cycle strategy with ν

The algorithm for the V-Cycle multigrid method as well as various cycling schemes, are given in [3,13,18].

The finer grids in the finite element discretization of a square domain are constructed by dividing each uniform coarse element, denoted as ec
                     , to four uniform fine elements denoted as ef
                      as depicted in Fig. 2
                     , for triangular and rectangular elements. By dividing each uniform element in four elements the position of the coarse points is retained in the finer grids, thus creating, recursively, the series of finer grids required for the multigrid method algorithm.

The PR2 method introduced in [2] is a quadratic iterative method that can be used to evaluate the inverse of a matrix. The method, when provided with a “close” initial approximation, converges quadratically to the exact inverse of a matrix through Richardson’s method in conjunction with the Iterative Refinement algorithm. The PR2 method can be described as follows:

                        The increase of the “retention” parameter δl, increases the computational cost of the refined inverse due to the sparse–sparse matrix multiplication. A very sparse approximate inverse as an initial guess requires low computational cost for refinement. When the “retention” parameter is set to δl
                        =1, the approximate inverse smoothing scheme tends to Damped Jacobi scheme. Hence the approximate inverse smoothing scheme, with the “retention” parameter set to δl
                        =2 in conjunction with one or two steps of the PR2 method, is used to improve convergence and effectiveness of the smoothing scheme.

Multigrid methods are proved efficient for wide variety of problems, cf. [1,3,5,6,13,18]. However, when the multigrid iteration operator Mh
                      has large isolated eigenvalues the convergence behavior of the classic multigrid schemes deteriorates significantly. In order to accelerate the convergence, multigrid methods are used as preconditioners to classic Krylov subspace iterative methods such as GMRES(res), IDR(s) and BiCGSTAB.

For the convection-diffusion equation, cf. (1)-(1.a), discretized with triangular and rectangular elements, the spectra of the multigrid V(2,1) and V(2,2) method in conjunction with Finite Element Approximate Inverses iteration operator Mh
                      for mesh size h
                     =1/8 and the retention parameter set to δl
                     =1 and δl
                     =2 are presented in Figs. 3 and 4
                     
                     , respectively. It can be observed that there exist large isolated eigenvalues, which increase the spectral radius, thus significantly affecting convergence for small values of the retention parameter i.e. δl
                     =1 and δl
                     =2. The multigrid method will be used as a preconditioner for the Krylov subspace iterative methods, as mentioned before. The methods that will be used is the Generalized Minimum RESidual restarted method, the Induced Dimension Reduction and the Bi-Conjugate Gradient-Stabilized method. The multigrid preconditioned algorithms for the three iterative schemes are presented below. Let us denote ν
                     1, ν
                     2 and ν
                     3 the pre-smoothing, post-smoothing and preconditioning iterations.

The Restarted Generalized Minimal Residual Method is an iterative method for the numerical solution of large unsymmetric linear systems. The GMRES(res) method approximates the solution by finding the vector in the Krylov subspace with minimal residual, through the Arnoldi iteration. The res parameter denotes the successive steps before the method is restarted, cf. [20]. The (MultiGrid V-Cycle preconditioned) MGV(ν

The preconditioned GMRES(res) variant used is presented in [20] and is available through MATLAB environment. Moreover, it exploits Householder transformations for the orthogonalization process instead of the Gram–Schmidt method, rendering the algorithm more stable.

The Induced Dimension Reduction method is an iterative method for solving large unsymmetric linear systems. The method is based on the principle of choosing the residuals through a series of subspaces of reduced dimension forcing them to zero, rather than the approach of search directions. The IDR(s) method with a shadow space of order s is based on the IDR method and generates residuals that are forced to be in a sequence of nested subspaces, cf. [8]. The algorithm of the MGV(ν

It should be noted that the standard FEM is stable for relatively low Péclet number. In that case a new algorithmic procedure, namely, generic approximate inverse, has been developed by using effectively low ratios ε/α, cf. [11]. Péclet number is dimensionless and relevant to the study of transport phenomena in fluid flow problems, cf. [18]. If this is not the case then a lower ration ε/α should be considered by using the new generic sparse approximate inverse, cf. [7], in order to examine the effectiveness.

An alternative approach to study the case of lower ratios of ε/α for the model problem is to introduce a new stable finite element formulation scheme, namely Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG), cf. [4], to improve the numerical properties and the stability of the numerical solution. In the case where the convective coefficient (α) is much greater than the diffusive coefficient (ε) the Péclet number is Pe
                     =|α|h/2ɛ
                     ≫1 and oscillations occur to the numerical solution, rendering the standard Galerkin formulation unstable, cf. [4]. By introducing an artificial viscosity term these oscillations and instabilities of the formulation are handled. Let us consider the stable Galerkin formulation of the model problem, cf.

It should be noted that in the case of non-structured meshes with local refinement, the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix is affected and it is preferable to use the algebraic multigrid method in conjunction with generic approximate sparse inverses, which is the subject to be studied in future work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The numerical results presented in this manuscript highlight the improvement of the convergence behavior of the Approximate Inverse smoother in conjunction with the DOUR method, against the Damped Jacobi smoothing in conjunction with DOUR method or the Jacobi method, for both discretization schemes of the finite element method.

Furthermore, the approximate inverse smoothing method in conjunction with PR2 refinement yields improved convergence behavior results against the approximate inverse scheme with δl
                     =2 as well as the Damped Jacobi method or Jacobi method. Furthermore, as the order of the system increases, the computational cost per iteration increases, and the cost of PR2 refinement, especially for smaller values of the retention parameter, is overlapped by the computational cost of the excess iterations performed without the PR2 refinement. It should be also stated that the proposed multigrid algorithm in conjunction with the Approximate Inverse Smoothing and the DOUR method, for the dynamic computation of the damping parameter, presented better convergence behavior than the Jacobi and Damped Jacobi smoothers even for lower values of the “retention” parameter (δl
                     =2 or m/2) which yield comparable memory requirements. For large values of the “retention” parameter (δl
                     =4m or 6m) the memory requirements of the AIP smoothing are higher than that of Jacobi method. However, in cases where the coefficient matrix is not strictly diagonal dominant it is well known that the Jacobi method will not converge, whereas higher values of the “retention” parameter of the approximate inverse smoother may lead to convergence.

Moreover, approximate inverses are effectively computed in parallel, cf. [9,13,14,16], and limit the smoothing process to Matrix–Vector multiplication resulting in a fast and easily parallelizable smoother. The parallelization issues of the proposed multigrid schemes will be studied in the near future.
