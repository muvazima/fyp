                  Evaluating an industrial opportunity often means to engage in financial modeling which results in estimation of a large amount of economic and accounting data, which are then gathered in an economically rational framework: the pro forma financial statements. While the standard net present value (NPV) condenses all the available pieces of information into a single metric, we make full use of the crucial information supplied in the pro forma financial statements and give a more detailed account of how economic value is created. In particular, we construct a general model, allowing for varying interest rates, which decomposes the project into investment side and financing side and quantifies the value created by either side; an equity/debt decomposition is also accomplished, which enables to appreciate the role of debt in adding or subtracting value to equityholders. Further, the major role of accounting rates of return as value drivers is highlighted, and new relative measures of worth are introduced: the project ROA and the project WACC, which aggregate information deriving from the period rates of return. To achieve these results, we make use of the Average-Internal-Rate-of-Return (AIRR) approach, recently introduced, which rests on capital-weighted arithmetic means and sets a direct relation between holding period rates and NPV.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The analysis of economic performance of capital asset investments is a matter of central importance in corporate finance, engineering economy and, in general, managerial science. The valuation of new industrial opportunities is often associated with estimation of economic data which are used to draw up pro forma financial statements which aim at assembling, in an economically rational way, a massive amount of information. Pro forma financial statements consist of (i) income statements, where incremental revenues and costs associated with the project are collected, (ii) balance sheets, where sources of funds (equity, debt) are recorded as well as uses of funds (fixed assets and working capital), (iii) cash flow statements, which convert the estimated accounting and economic data into a stream of free cash flows (Titman and Martin, 2011). The use of such financial modeling is rather common in corporate projects and in private equity investments, and it is an indispensable tool in project finance transactions. Project finance is a no-recourse form of financing, whereby a new legal entity is created, named Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), with the explicit aim of undertaking a project with limited life (Gatti, 2012). Originated in the energy generation sector, project finance is now widely used for several kinds of engineering projects, such as oil and gas, power and telecom projects, and, more recently, Internet and e-commerce projects (Borgonovo, Gatti, and Peccati, 2010)
                  

The abundant quantity of economic, accounting, and financial data which are recorded in the pro forma financial statements is usually condensed into one single metric, expressing the project’s economic profitability, which is either an absolute measure of economic profitability, such as the Net Present Value (NPV), or a relative measure of worth, such as a rate of return (most notably, the Internal Rate of Return, IRR).

As for the NPV, its use in industry for project valuation is commonplace (Borgonovo and Peccati, 2004; 2006; Gallo and Peccati, 1993; Giri and Dohi, 2004; Herroelen and Leus, 2005; Herroelen, Van Dommelen, and Demeulemeester, 1997; Wiesemann, Kuhn, and Rustem, 2010) and it is endorsed as a theoretically correct decision criterion in corporate financial theory (see Brealey, Myers, and Allen, 2011; Berk and DeMarzo, 2011). The IRR, albeit subject to several drawbacks (see Magni, 2013, for a compendium of eighteen flaws) is often used in place or even in conjunction with the NPV for investment evaluation, as well as other criteria such as payback or residual income (Lindblom and Sjögren, 2009; Magni, 2009; Remer, Stokdyk, and Van Driel, 1993; Sandahl and Sjögren, 2003).

While the standard NPV does detect value creation, it does not identify the projects’ value drivers and is not capable of explaining, in a detailed way, how the economic referents underlying the project contribute to generating (or subtracting) value. In other words, the NPV alone cannot disentangle the constituents of a project: for example, given that the NPV does not distinguish investment from borrowing, it does not tell us whether value is created because funds are invested at a return rate greater than the minimum required rate of return or value is created because funds are borrowed at a borrowing rate which is smaller than the maximum acceptable borrowing rate. Also, the standard NPV cannot separate the contribution of equityholders from the contributions of debtholders in value creation or value destruction. Nor is it available, in the literature, a sufficiently general model able to establish a direct link between the accounting data estimated in the pro forma financial statements and the project’s NPV. Paradoxically, while cash flows necessarily arise from (pro forma) accounting data, it is usually believed that accounting rates of return such as Return On Equity (ROE) or Return On Assets (ROA) have no financial meaning and are not reliable for economic analysis (Kay, 1976; Peasnell, 1982a; 1982b; Stark, 2004; Whittington, 1988).

The aim of this paper is just to provide a methodological framework capable of exploiting, to a full extent, the information provided by the financial modeling underlying a capital asset investment. In particular, it aims at detecting the value drivers of a project and investigating their formal and conceptual relations; it aims at showing how value is created and, in particular, (i) whether such a value is made out of investment or out of financing (ii) what the role of equityholders and debtholders is in generating value, (iii) how accounting variables can be aggregated in metrics that are economically significant and that enable one to establish a direct link between the project’s ROE and ROA and the project’s NPV.

To achieve the required results, we build upon Magni’s (2010; 2013) approach, which uncovers the existing relations between a project NPV and its period rates of return. This approach, named Average Internal Rate of Return (AIRR), also enables to compute, from the financial statements, a unique NPV-consistent project rate of return which is devoid of the flaws which mar the IRR. Owing to the flexibility of the AIRR approach, we also allow for varying rates, and define a new return metric, named the project ROA, which aggregates all the estimated ROAs, and a new cost of capital, named the project WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), which aggregates all the project’s period WACCs.

A twofold decomposition will be finally supplied, which decomposes the value created by source of funds (debt vs. equity) and by the nature of capital (investment vs. financing).

The remainder of the paper is summarized as follows.

                        
                           •
                           
                              Section 2 summarizes the results of Teichroew, Robichek, and Montalbano (1965a); 1965b) (TRM) which allow for a project to have financing periods as well as investment periods. Investment periods generate returns for the firm at a (constant) investment rate, financing periods generate borrowing costs at a (constant) financing rate. TRM devised two NPV-consistent decisions rules that assume that the cost of capital is constant and equal to either the investment rate or the financing rate.


                              Section 3 supplies the missing link among investment rate, financing rate, cost of capital and Net Present Value (NPV). The AIRR approach is used for dividing the economic value created into investment NPV and financing NPV and for combining investment rate and financing rate into an economically significant project rate of return.


                              Section 4
generalizes the results of the previous section removing the restrictive assumptions of constant rates: varying investment rates and varying financing rates are allowed, as well as varying costs of capital. Using again the AIRR approach, the project investment rate and project financing rate are obtained and combined into a project rate of return. Also, a project cost of capital is obtained, which is splitted up into an investment cost of capital and a financing cost of capital, which act as benchmark return rate and benchmark financing rate in the investment and financing periods, respectively.


                              Section 5
takes into consideration the role of equity and debt in value creation and shows the relations among the various rates (ROE, ROD, ROA) and the various project-specific costs of capital (cost of equity, cost of debt, WACC). The NPV is decomposed into equity and value component and, using the results of the previous sections, each component is in turn decomposed in investment NPV and financing NPV and a project ROA is obtained, which, compared with the project WACC, signals value creation or destruction.


                              Section 6 illustrates a simple example of a levered project, that is, a project which is partly financed with debt, where it is assumed that some periods are financing periods.

While many industrial opportunities are pure projects (i.e., either investment or financing), some other opportunities are mixed projects. It may occur, in some periods, that the invested capital is negative: this means that the project acts as a financing rather than as an investment; more specifically, in these periods, the assets used by the firm for undertaking the project serve the scope of financing the stakeholders (equityholders and debtholders), who take on the unusual role of capital borrowers, instead of being capital providers. In mixed projects, the identification of a period as an investment period or a financing period is essential to better disentangle the way value is created or destroyed by the project: in an investment period, the return on capital is a rate of return, and the cost of capital is the minimum return rate required by the capital providers. However, in a financing period, the capital is a borrowed amount, so the “return” on capital is not a rate of return at all: it is to be interpreted as a borrowing rate, and the cost of capital expresses the maximum financing rate acceptable by the stakeholders.

Whether a project is pure or mixed depends on whether the capital committed is positive or negative. For example, consider a bank account whose interest rate is 5 percent if the account balance is positive and 10 percent if the account balance is negative. Suppose a client of the bank deposits € 100 in the account, then withdraws € 215 at the end of the period, then deposits € 110 at the end of the second period and closes off the account. The cash-flow vector of this transaction is 
                        
                           (
                           −

                           121
                           )
                        
                     : in the first period, the customer invests € 100 in the account. At the end of the period, before the withdrawal, the account balance is positive and equal to 
                        
                           100
                           (
                           1
                           +
                           0.05
                           )
                           =
                           105
                        
                     ; by withdrawing € 205, the account balance turns negative and equal to € 
                        
                           −
                           110
                           ,
                        
                      which means that, at the beginning of the second period, the client borrows € 110 from the bank. At the end of the second period, the customer repays debt plus interest and closes off the account with a payment of € 121: 
                        
                           −
                           110
                           (
                           1
                           +
                           0.1
                           )
                           +
                           121
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . This simple transaction is a mixed project: the first period is an investment period (a € 100 account balance represents invested capital), the second period is a financing period (a € 
                        
                           −
                           110
                        
                      account balance represents borrowed capital).
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        From the bank’s perspective, it is the other way around: investment in the second period, financing in the first period.
                     
                  

Therefore, in general, a project can be described as having two sides: an investment side, consisting of periods where capital is invested, and a financing side, consisting of periods where capital is borrowed. A pure project can be seen as a particular case of mixed project where all periods are either investment periods or financing periods.

Consider an economic agent (e.g., a firm) facing the opportunity of investing in a project whose cash-flow stream is

                           =

                                 0
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 a
                                 1
                              
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              
                                 a
                                 n
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                     . We assume that the project-specific cost of capital is ϱ, which represents the expected rate of return of an alternative opportunity that investors forego which is equivalent in risk to the project.

Teichroew, Robichek and Montalbano (TRM) (Teichroew et al., 1965a; 1965b) just proposed a model of economic profitability capable of managing both pure and mixed projects, and derived two rate-of-return-based decision rules consistent with the NPV criterion. We summarize TRM model as follows.

Any project, just like the bank-account example illustrated above, may be interpreted as an economic relation between two parties, the project and the investor (e.g., the firm) which exchange monetary amounts at
                      at the various dates. This situation is described by TRM (1965a; 1965b) in terms of project balance, denoted as Ft

                      (see TRM, 1965a, p. 401; TRM, 1965b, p. 169). When Ft
                     ( · ) < 0, the firm loans to the project, so it is in a lending position; when Ft
                     ( · ) > 0, the firm loans from the project, that is, it is in a borrowing position. Therefore, generally speaking, the investor can be a lender in some periods and a borrower in some other periods. The rate rI
                      is the rate at which a firm injects funds in the project whenever it is in a lending position, while the rate rB
                      at which a firm borrows from a project whenever it is in a borrowing position. If the pair (rB, rI
                     ) fulfills the terminal condition, then rB
                      is said to be a project financing (or borrowing) rate (PFR),

                      and rI
                      is said to be a project investment rate (PIR). It is worth noting that the notion of project balance is equivalent to the notion of capital (invested or borrowed); for example, if

                      it means that the investor invests € 100 in the project at the beginning of interval

                     . In other words, € 100 is the firm’s capital invested in the project. If

TRM did not provide any functional relation between NPV(ϱ) and the two-rate model presented. We now supply the missing functional relation, explicitly linking, rB, rI
                      and NPV(ϱ). This will enable us to (i) understand the implicit assumption of TRM’s rules, (ii) grasp the role played by the cost of capital in value creation and its relations with rB
                      and rI
                     , (iii) appreciate the role of investment periods and financing periods in creating value, and (iv) supply a unique project rate of return.

                            and rI
                           , as expressed in (2), not necessarily equal to ϱ. Then, the economic value created can be partitioned into two shares: an investment NPV

The proposition provides a functional relation among the rates and the NPV. Also, the NPV is decomposed and, as such, it enables the evaluator to obtain information on the way value is created: value is created (destroyed) either by investing capital I at a greater (smaller) rate than ϱ in the investment periods or by borrowing capital B at a smaller (greater) rate than ϱ in the borrowing periods. Eq. (8) and the associated Proposition 4 makes it clear that the net effect depends on the relation among three rates: rB, rI
                      and ϱ (as well as on the capital bases I and B). It is also clear that the market rate ϱ has a twofold nature: it acts as a benchmark lending rate in the investment periods (i.e., it expresses the minimum acceptable rate of return) and as a benchmark borrowing rate in the borrowing periods (i.e., it expresses the maximum acceptable borrowing rate). The comparison between rB
                      and ϱ only tells us whether economic value is created in the borrowing periods, while the comparison between rI
                      and ϱ only tells us whether value is created in the investment periods. The direct comparison of rI
                      and rB
                      is not informative.


                     Proposition 4 also sheds light on the meaning of TRM’s rules. Rule (4a) can be derived from (8) by assuming that the PFR rate is equal to the cost of capital (

                     ), which means to assuming that the borrowing periods are value-neutral (i.e.,

                     (ϱ) signals value creation or destruction. Similarly, rule (4b) can be derived from (8) by assuming that the PIR rate is equal to the cost of capital (

                     . But TRM did not commit themselves to the choice of either combination. They left the choice to the evaluator, without providing clues as to when either alternative should be more appropriate. Furthermore, both assumptions 
                        
                           
                              r

                           ϱ
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              r
                              I
                           
                           =
                           ϱ
                           ,
                        
                      are unrealistic and practically unhelpful: in real-life applications (and, in particular, in industrial projects and project finance transactions), firms do not usually borrow funds at the cost of capital nor invest funds at the cost of capital. Both rB
                      and rI
                      are different from ϱ, which means that, notwithstanding its important theoretical contribution, TRM rules are only applicable to exceptional economic transactions.

A third feature of the TRM model is that neither rI
                     (ϱ) nor rB
                     (ϱ) refer to the whole project; they refer to the investment side and the financing side of the project, respectively. In other words, rI
                     (ϱ) represents the rate of return of the project in the investment periods (under the assumption 
                        
                           
                              r

                           =
                           ϱ
                        
                     ), and rB
                     (ϱ) represents the rate of cost in the borrowing periods (under the assumption 
                        
                           
                              r
                              I

                           ϱ
                        
                     ). TRM did not supply a project rate of return, capable of measuring the project’s economic profitability, i.e., capable of combining the performances of the investment side and the financing side.

Recently, a new approach to economic profitability has been introduced and developed, named Average Internal Rate of Return (AIRR) (Magni, 2010; 2013) which enables combining the PFR and the PIR in order to supply an overall project rate of return. It suffices to consider (8) and impose the invariance requirement

                     Proposition 5 fills the gap between TRM’s PIR and PFR and the notion of project rate of return: PIR and PFR, which measure value creation in their own specific setting (investment periods and financing periods, respectively) are naturally combined into a unique metric which summarizes the value created in relative terms (i.e., percentage), so constituting a counterpart of the NPV, which measures value creation in absolute terms (i.e., euros).

                     : compared with the benchmark ϱ, value creation is determined. Eq. (13) then informs one that the investor invests I at a rate rI
                      and borrows B at a rate rB
                     , which is equivalent to investing a net capital

                            then r is a rate of cost and ϱ acts a benchmark borrowing rate, so value is created if and only if r < ϱ. The sign in (15) is then reversed.

                        Remark 1
                        It is worth noting that the invariance condition (13) we have used to derive the project rate of return is a particular case of the invariance condition (Magni, 2010, p. 159) used to derive an Average Internal Rate of Return (AIRR). In general, an AIRR is defined as any capital-weighted mean of period rates kt

                              5
                              More properly, given that the weights can be negative, the aggregations consist of affine combinations. For this reason, the resulting mean can be greater than the greatest period rate or smaller than the smallest period rate.

This means that (14) is just a particular case of AIRR, lying on the iso-value line, which describes the infinitely many combinations of capital and rate leading to the same NPV (see Magni, 2013).

In such a situation, we are able to understand how value is affected by two contrasting forces: investment NPV is positive, for value is created in the investment periods (18.76 percent > 7 percent) whereas financing NPV is negative, for value is destroyed in the financing periods (20 percent > 7 percent). In other words, the firm borrows funds at a greater rate than the benchmark borrowing rate, but also invests at a greater rate than the benchmark lending rate. The net effect is determined by the capital base to which the excess rates are applied. In particular, Table 1
                            reports the capital amounts, the cash flows and the project rate of return, obtained as an average of the PFR and the PIR. It is worth noting that the first two periods are borrowing periods. In these periods value is destroyed for financing occurs at a greater rate than the cost of capital. The overall borrowed capital is 65.38, and the excess financing rate is

Rather, the two rates can be conveniently combined via the AIRR approach into a significant project rate of return, which can be compared with the cost of capital.

                            However, TRM model cannot be used for practical purposes, just because it artificially forces either the investment side or the financing side to be value-neutral, so distorting the economic analysis of the project. The AIRR approach enables the evaluator to free from TRM’s restrictive assumptions and properly rest on the actual economic data and, in particular, to combine the actual PIR and PFR into a significant project rate of return.

                              In Section 5 we will show how to derive the actual PIR and the actual PFR from the project’s pro forma financial statements.
                           
                        

In the following sections, we will make extensive use of the AIRR approach and aggregate non-constant rates via weighted means in order to derive the investment rate, the financing rate, and the project rate of return, as well as the project cost of equity, the project cost of debt, and the project WACC.

In Section 3 we have removed the restrictive assumption according to which either investment rate or financing rate is equal to the cost of capital. In this section, we further generalize the approach by allowing varying investment and financing rates and varying costs of capital.

                     Proposition 6 provides a full generalization of the previous section. Whatever the pattern of investment rates, financing rates, and costs of capital, the PIR (

Likewise, the cost of capital is decomposed into an investment cost of capital (capital-weighted average of the period costs of capital in the investment periods) and a borrowing cost of capital (capital-weighted average of the period costs of capital in the borrowing periods). To better appreciate the result, one should bear in mind that the costs of capital ϱ

                        Example 3
                        An investor has the opportunity of depositing and withdrawing cash flows from an account balance with prefixed borrowing rates and lending rates which change period by period. The borrowing rates are activated when the account balance is negative and the lending rates are activated when the account balance is positive.

To assess the net effect of these two conflicting results, the 19 percent and 16 percent investment rates are aggregated into a unique metric which summarizes the overall performance in the investment periods: from (21a),

The net effect is positive, so the investment side of this transaction creates value. As for the financing side, the second period destroys value, for funds are borrowed at 13 percent while the market only requires 10 percent. In the third period, value is created, for funds are borrowed at 8 percent while the market requires a 16 percent interest rate. To assess the net effect, one aggregates the project borrowing rates and the costs of capital by applying (21b) and (21d).

While this generalization does enrich the economic analysis of the project, nothing is said about the way the project is financed, and the way equity and debt interact in the investment and financing periods. The next section is just devoted to showing how the economic information collected in the pro forma financial statements can be used for investigating the role of equity and debt in value creation, as well as the role of Return On Assets (ROA) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

When a project is undertaken, equity and/or debt is involved. Let Et
                      be the equity invested in the project at time t, and let Dt
                      denote the amount of outstanding debt at time t which finances the project, net of short-term financial assets such as cash, bank accounts, etc.,

To compute the project value, one needs to compute the project-specific Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which must reflect the specifics of the individual project and thus it may differ from the firm’s WACC (see Titman and Martin, 2011, chap. 5). If the project is financed with nonrecourse debt, a specific amount of debt is attached to the project, which is helpful for computing the weights on the investment’s debt and equity financing. In this case, the project is very similar to an independent firm and the project is the sole source of collateral. In project financing transactions, a new legal entity is indeed created, called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or project company: the capital invested in the project by the sponsoring firm is the SPV’s equity and the SPV’s debtholders have no recourse to the sponsoring firm’s assets. If, conversely, the project is financed on-balance sheet, one must first estimate the debt and equity that can be attributed to the project and then estimate the cost of capital (this is a more complex task, which involves managerial judgment, for the financing of the project is intermingled with the financing of the firm’s other investments).

                        While a firm can adjust debt in such a way as to keep a constant target debt/equity ratio, in project-financed investments the amortization schedule is prefixed and debt cannot be targeted so as to keep the weights constant.

                     Proposition 7 highlights the role of the two dualities existing in a project: the duality investment/financing and the duality equity/debt. Eq. (51) divides the project NPV into value created by investing capital and value created by borrowing capital; Eq. (52) distinguishes the value created by equityholders from the value generated by debtholders. Corollary 1 condenses the four souls of the project into a succinct, economically significant, relation informing that value creation is measured by an (overall) excess return whose sign and magnitude creation depends on the net capital committed C and the difference between the overall ROA and the overall WACC (see Table 2
                     ).

                            < 0 is economically significant and less uncommon than one might think. To better appreciate the economic interpretation of this case, consider that Ct

                            denotes the fixed assets, net of depreciation. Consider also that a change in sign means that the financial role of a balance sheet item is reversed: a negative asset becomes a borrowing, and a negative liability becomes an investment. More specifically, when the two sides of the equalities are positive, as usual, the relation tells us that the funds raised from capital providers (debtholders and equityholders) are invested in working capital and net fixed assets; when the two sides are negative, it means that the assets are used to finance debtholders and equityholders. In other words, capital providers do not provide economic resources at all; rather, they absorb resources from the assets. To see how this is possible, just consider that the capital Ct
                            is negative whenever both NFA and WC are negative or, alternatively, when either

The first case is less common but not impossible (for example, net fixed assets can be negative when there are disposal costs associated with them which exceed their residual value and working capital is sufficiently small in value); the second case is more common: working capital can be negative if there are considerable upfront payments from customers, who then “coin” money for the firm. More generally, every time accounts receivables and inventories are sufficiently low as opposed to accounts payables (e.g., whenever the company raises cash quickly from customers, even before purchasing materials from suppliers), the working capital is negative.

In particular, the first addend expresses the project’s economic profitability: if the ROA exceeds the costs of assets, the operating assets involved in the project create value to equityholders. The second addend discloses the effect of financial position on equity value creation; depending on whether the cost of debt is greater or smaller than ROD, debt adds or subtracts value to equityholders (as long as D > 0).

To better interpret the results, we remind that, to a firm, a positive asset and a negative liability represent uses of funds (i.e., an investment), so the corresponding rate is a rate of return (i.e., lending rate), whereas a negative asset and a positive liability represent sources of funds (i.e., financing), so the related rate is a rate of cost (i.e., a financing rate). Also, a positive return rate for an investment means that capital invested increases (income is positive), while a negative return rate for an investment means that the capital invested decreases (income is negative); vice versa, a positive financing rate means that capital borrowed increases (interest expense is positive), while a negative financing rate means that capital borrowed decreases (interest expense is negative). Consider a project finance transaction and suppose a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is created to undertake a capital asset project with estimated life equal to five years. At time 0, the sponsoring firms (the SPV’s equityholders) contribute € 1800 and a group of banks (the SPV’s debtholders) contribute € 1200, for a total of € 3000 investment. Pro forma financial statements are drawn on the basis of estimated revenues, costs, depreciation and on the amortization plan of the loans. Table 3
                      collects the input data (in boldface) and the pro forma balance sheets and income statements.

                      71.7 of which is created in the investment periods and 217.7 is generated in the financing periods. It is worth noting that debtholders destroy value in the borrowing periods, that is, in those periods where net assets are negative, they lend money at a financing rate (4.45 percent), which is smaller than the 6.73 percent required return to debt. From the shareholders’ point of view, in the borrowing periods, the equity value created (230.9) is greater than the project NPV: in other words, the shareholders’ financing policy is a value-creating policy: debtholders are paid less than the market would require by an amount of € 13.1. In the lending periods, the reverse obtains and the debtholders are paid at an interest rate (7.47 percent) which is greater than the interest rate required by the market (5.55 percent): this implies that equityholders give up part of the project NPV to debtholders. The additional equity value created by the financing policy in the borrowing periods is more than compensated by the loss in equity value in the investment periods, which is just the reason why the equity NPV is smaller than the project NPV.

Economic assessment of industrial projects is often accompanied by a thorough work of estimation for several economic, accounting, and financial variables underlying the project. Estimated data are then gathered, in an economically meaningful way, in sophisticated models consisting of a series of financial statements (i.e., balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements). The financial experts then condense the forecasts into a single metric expressing economic value created by the project: Net Present Value (NPV), if an absolute amount is required, or a rate of return, if a relative measure of worth is needed. This paper shows that the considerable amount of information gathered by pro forma financial statements can be used for accomplishing an economic analysis and for reconciling accounting variables and financial metrics, which are often considered conflicting. In particular, we use a recent approach, named AIRR approach (Magni, 2010; 2013) to show that such accounting metrics as the Return On Equity (ROE), Return on Debt (ROD) and Return on Assets (ROA) bear significant relations to the project NPV. They supply additional information as to how value is created and how equity and debt interact in generating value. We also show how to gather varying WACCs to obtain a single project WACC, which combined with the project ROA, determines value creation or destruction.

Our framework includes, beside standard projects, more complex environments, such as nonconventional (mixed) projects: in these projects investment periods alternate with financing periods, so that the roles of the rates and of the costs of capital alternate: in investment periods, rates are investment (i.e., lending) rates, whereas in financing periods, rates are financing (i.e., borrowing) rates.

Making full use of the information collected in the pro forma financial statements, this analysis enables the evaluator to appreciate the role of the various value drivers for generating economic value. We achieve a detailed decomposition of rates, costs of capital, capital amounts and NPV which enables the evaluator to accomplish a richer economic analysis which is impossible to accomplish with the only information provided by the NPV or the IRR.

A Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) is a variant of the IRR which consists of modifying the stream of the free cash flows in such a way that the IRR of the modified cash-flow stream exists and is unique. The project ROA we have introduced in this paper differentiates itself from a MIRR in several ways.

In first place, while the project ROA is unambiguously computed from the pro forma financial statements, it is not clear how the original cash-flow stream should be modified for computing a MIRR. Ross, Westerfield, and Jordan (2011) classify the procedure into three classes: the discounting approach, which consists in discounting back the negative cash flows; the reinvestment approach, which consists in compounding all cash flows except the first out to the end of the project’s life; the combination approach, where negative cash flows are discounted back and positive cash flows are compounded to the end of the project.

                     However, (A.1)–(A.3) are three out of many other ways of adjusting the original cash-flow stream into a modified one which supplies a unique IRR (for example, the so-called Sinking Fund Methods represent other ways of obtaining MIRRs, see Herbst, 2002, chap. 11). Furthermore, a two-rate MIRR is sometimes considered, where negative cash flows are discounted at a discount rate j which is different from the reinvestment rate, k, and each of them may differ from the cost of capital. In this case, the MIRR is the rate y such that

                        Note that (A.3) is a particular case of (A.4) where 
                              
                                 k
                                 =
                                 j
                                 =
                                 ϱ
                              
                           . Note also that, except (A.1), the other versions imply that MIRR is a geometric mean, as opposed to the project ROA, which is an arithmetic mean.
                     
                  

As a result, while the project ROA presented in this paper is a well-defined unambiguous metric, the MIRR is a methodology comprising a vast class of metrics: there are many different ways of adjusting the cash-flow stream, so there are many different MIRRs, and “there is no clear reason to say one of [the] methods is better than any other” (Ross et al., 2011, p. 250). So, MIRR is not really unique: there are as many MIRRs as are the ways of modifying the cash-flow stream.
                        19
                     
                     
                        19
                        Evidently, this non-uniqueness is different from the non-uniqueness of IRR: “multiple IRRs” means “multiple solutions of a polynomial equation”, whereas “multiple MIRRs” means “multiple ways of modifying the project’s cash flow-stream”.
                     
                  

A second feature which differentiates MIRR from project ROA is that, in contrast with the latter, the MIRR cannot be considered the project’s rate of return, for “it’s a rate of return on a modified set of cash flows, not the project’s actual cash flows” (Ross et al., 2011, p. 250). Indeed, to take reinvestment of interim cash flows into consideration means to include other future investments that should not affect the decision process. As Brealey, Myers and Allen (2011, p. 141) put it: “The prospective return on another independent investment should never be allowed to influence the investment decision”.

The latter consideration leads to the third difference: project ROA is consistent with the NPV whereas MIRR is not. To understand this statement, first note that the two-rate MIRR may signal value creation when the NPV is negative and vice versa. Therefore, coherence with the NPV rule is not guaranteed. As a simple counterexample, consider the cash-flow stream 
                        
                           (
                           −
                           100
                           ,
                           390
                           ,
                           −
                           503
                           ,
                           214.5
                           )
                        
                      which has multiple IRRs equal to 10 percent, 30 percent, 50 percent. Suppose 
                        
                           j
                           =
                           ϱ
                           =
                           15
                           
                           percent
                        
                      and 
                        
                           k
                           =
                           8
                           
                           percent
                        
                     . Value is destroyed by the project, for 
                        
                           NPV
                           =
                           −
                           1.73
                           ,
                        
                      whereas MIRR signals value creation (applying (A.4), the solution is 
                        
                           y
                           =
                           39.36
                           
                           percent
                           ,
                        
                      which is greater than the cost of capital, 
                        
                           ϱ
                           =
                           15
                           
                           percent
                        
                     ). As for the other versions of the MIRR, while it is true that, formally, y > ϱ if and only if NPV > 0, the MIRR approach makes explicit use of reinvestment (barring the discounting approach), so it summarizes the performance of a course of action which includes the project and the reinvestments of the interim cash flows. Conversely, NPV does not assume reinvestment of interim cash flows: NPV is the difference between the project value and the project cost, and the project value does not depend on reinvestment of cash flows (and, in particular, on the riskiness of such reinvestments) but on the risk-adjusted cost of capital, that is, the expected rate of return of an equal-risk asset traded in the market. This implies that the MIRR is based on assumptions which are different from the NPV and provides a piece of information which is not equivalent to that provided by the NPV. The project ROA does not depend on reinvestments of cash flows, so providing a piece of information which is consistent with that provided by the NPV.

A fourth difference lies in the fact that the use of the MIRR approach rules out the possibility of decomposing economic value created into debt component and equity component. The reason is that the MIRR has no direct relations with the economic referents of the project. More precisely, the invested capital ct
                      used for computing the project ROA consists of recognizable resources (property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, etc.) which stem from actual economic transactions and which are estimated through careful deliberations about how benefits are expected to be distributed through time and the uncertainties associated with their realization; in contrast, MIRRs have no such empirical referents, being it simply an outcome of solving a polynomial equation.
                        20
                     
                     
                        20
                        And considering that the equation derives from a distortion of the project’s cash flows, the relation with the empirical referents is diminished further still.
                     
                  

Finally, the average-based approach introduced enables to manage time-variant costs of capital in an easy way: the project ROA is a weighted average of the project’s ROAs and the project WACC is the weighted average of the various period WACCs, so the comparison between project ROA and project WACC signals value creation. Conversely, it is not clear whether and how an economically significant cutoff rate can be derived such that its comparison with MIRR correctly signals value creation.
