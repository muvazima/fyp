                  Discontinuities are common in the pricing of financial derivatives and have a tremendous impact on the accuracy of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method. While if the discontinuities are parallel to the axes, good efficiency of the QMC method can still be expected. By realigning the discontinuities to be axes-parallel, [Wang & Tan, 2013] succeeded in recovering the high efficiency of the QMC method for a special class of functions. Motivated by this work, we propose an auto-realignment method to deal with more general discontinuous functions. The k-means clustering algorithm, a classical algorithm of machine learning, is used to select the most representative normal vectors of the discontinuity surface. By applying this new method, the discontinuities of the resulting function are realigned to be friendly for the QMC method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the QMC method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Monte Carlo (MC) method and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method have been successfully used to a wide range of finance problems, such as the pricing and hedging of complex financial derivatives (see Glasserman, 2004; Jin, Li, Tan, & Wu, 2013). By suitable transformations, these problems can often be represented as the integral of a real-valued function H over the d-dimensional unit cube

                      instead of random ones in MC sampling. The low discrepancy points are relatively uniform so that it is common for QMC to produce much more accurate answers than MC does. The justification is through the well-known Koksma–Hlawka inequality, which claims that the QMC integration error is of

                      for functions with finite variation in the sense of Hardy and Krause (see Niederreiter, 1992).

The advantage of the QMC method for high-dimensional finance problems was shown in many empirical studies (see Joy, Boyle, & Tan, 1996; Paskov & Traub, 1995). The concept of effective dimension offers a possible explanation for the success of QMC method for high-dimensional problems (see Wang & Fang, 2003). It is widely believed that functions of small effective dimension are easier to integrate by the QMC method. To this end, some path generation methods (PGMs) are proposed to reduce the effective dimension, such as the Brownian bridge (BB) (Caflisch, Morokoff, & Owen, 1997; Moskowitz & Caflisch, 1996), the principal component analysis (PCA) (Acworth, Broadie, & Glasserman, 1998) and the linear transformation (LT) method (Imai & Tan, 2006). However, they do not consider the discontinuities of underlying functions.

In practice, a broad class of finance problems involves discontinuities. If the boundaries of discontinuity are not parallel to the axes, these discontinuities may be detrimental to the QMC method. The efficiency of the QMC method could be recovered if the discontinuities are realigned to be axes-parallel. Wang and Tan (2013) proposed the orthogonal transformation (OT) method for a particular class of discontinuous functions and suggested to realign discontinuities onto axes-parallel hyperplanes. Subsequently, He and Wang (2014) developed a PGM called the QR

                        The term “QR” is from the QR decomposition in linear algebra (see Golub & van Loan, 2013).
                      method to deal with multiple discontinuity structures. The QR method makes the surfaces of discontinuities parallel to as many axes as possible. Both the OT and QR methods improve the efficiency of the QMC method significantly for many problems with discontinuous functions arising from finance. Wang (2016) proposed a procedure to handle high dimensionality and discontinuities concurrently. But for payoffs involving complex discontinuity structures, the OT and QR methods cannot be applied directly.

In this paper, we propose a new PGM called the auto-realignment method to deal with payoffs with complex jump structures. Our approach obtains the information of the discontinuity surface from a set of low discrepancy points. We use the k-means clustering algorithm to automatically select several representative hyperplanes to approximate the discontinuity surface. These hyperplanes are characterized by their corresponding normal vectors. The basic idea of the auto-realignment method is intuitive: The more points distribute around the discontinuity surface with a certain normal vector, the more important is this normal vector. We could apply the QR method to realign these hyperplanes such that they are parallel to as many axes as possible. The new method can make the discontinuities of the payoffs more QMC-friendly. The auto-realignment method merits several advantages: It selects representative normal vectors and quantifies the importance of chosen vectors automatically without tedious recognition. Moreover, the performance of the auto-realignment method is more effective and robust than other PGMs, as confirmed by the numerical experiments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The OT method is reviewed in Section 2. The proposed auto-realignment method is formally presented in Section 3. Section 4 performs some numerical experiments for pricing exotic options. Section 5 concludes this paper.

                        . Since the STD, BB and PCA constructions for the BM do not take the payoff functions into account, they may have bad performance for payoff functions with jump structures. In the next subsection, we review the OT method that deals with simple discontinuities.

The discontinuities which are axes-parallel are considered as QMC-friendly since high efficiency can still be expected in QMC. Wang and Tan (2013) proposed the OT method that transforms the discontinuities to be QMC-friendly. The OT method targets the following special class of discontinuous functions

The OT method mainly focuses on indicator functions with respect to one linear structure 
                           q

                           x
                        . But for payoffs involving complex discontinuities, it is difficult to figure out the right generating matrix 
                           A
                         such that the discontinuities are realigned to be QMC-friendly.

Since the nature of discontinuities of the underlying functions has a tremendous impact on the accuracy of the QMC method, the success of the OT method motivates us to develop a general PGM for payoff functions involving complex discontinuity structures.

How to find the representative normal vectors on the discontinuity surface? Our strategy is to obtain a whole picture of normal vectors on the discontinuity surface from a number of sample points. Then we use k-means clustering algorithm to automatically select several most representative normal vectors on the discontinuity surface. The details are stated as Steps (1)–(3) below.

                                 around the discontinuity surface Σ and calculate their corresponding normal vectors

                                 of the discontinuity surface.
                              

Theoretically it is difficult to choose the required points exactly on Σ. Thus an area with positive probability {
                                    z
                                 : |f(

It is natural to quantify the importance of certain normal vector 
                                    l
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                  by the number of vectors clustered in the set 
                                    
                                       C
                                       i
                                    
                                 . The more vectors amass in 
                                    
                                       
                                          C
                                          i
                                       
                                       ,
                                    
                                  the more frequently random points distribute around the discontinuity surface with the normal vector 
                                    l
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 , which implies that this structure is more important. Namely, the normal vector 
                                    
                                       l
                                       1
                                       *
                                    
                                  is the centroid of the cluster which contains the most vectors, and 
                                    
                                       l
                                       r
                                       *
                                    
                                  is the centroid of the cluster which contains the least vectors. That is why we choose the weight matrix as 
                                    
                                       L
                                       =
                                       (
                                       
                                          l
                                          1
                                          *
                                       
                                       ,
                                       ⋯
                                       ,
                                       
                                          l
                                          r
                                          *
                                       
                                       )
                                       ,
                                    
                                  whose columns are the representative normal vectors of the discontinuity.

After obtaining the weight matrix 
                           L
                        , as suggested by Theorem 1, we perform a QR decomposition of 
                           L
                         such that 
                           
                              L
                              =
                              QR
                              ,
                           
                         where 
                           Q
                         is an orthogonal matrix and 
                           R
                         is an upper triangular matrix. We find the orthogonal matrix 
                           U
                         of the auto-realignment method by setting 
                           
                              U
                              =
                              Q
                           
                        . The resulting generating matrix is given by 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                                 AUTO
                              
                              =
                              
                                 A
                                 0
                              
                              U
                              ,
                           
                         where 
                           A
                        
                        0 is the initial generating matrix given in (7).

We start with this section by verifying that the orthogonal matrix 
                           U
                         indeed makes the discontinuities of the payoff function (7) more QMC-friendly. Recall that the new discontinuity surface of the payoff function is given as

                                    ˜
                                 
                                 
                                    |
                                    
                                    f

                         It is enough to verify that the normal vector on the surface 
                           
                              Σ
                              ˜
                           
                         is nearly parallel to many axes.

Note that the discontinuity surface Σ is well approximated by hyperplanes with normal vectors

                           Remark 1
                           In order to apply the auto-realignment method, we need to specify the number of clusters r. Here we suggest practical criteria for choosing r. Let AQR(r), 
                                 
                                    r
                                    ∈
                                    N
                                    ,
                                 
                               denote the auto-realignment method which chooses r clusters. Since it is inefficient to choose nearly parallel normal vectors for the weight matrix

To demonstrate the efficiency of the auto-realignment method, variance reduction factors (VRFs) of using various PGMs in QMC with respect to the crude MC method are assessed and compared. The VRF measures the efficiency gain of QMC estimators as in many related literatures (see Dingeç & Hörmann, 2012). The VRF is defined by

We compare six QMC-based schemes with the crude MC method (using the STD construction for generating the BM). The six QMC-based schemes are divided into two groups. The first group consists of Schemes 1–2 which use STD and PCA constructions to generate the BM. The second group consists of Schemes 3–6, which are problem-dependent PGMs.

                                 The VRFs of QMC-based estimates are affected significantly by PGMs. The proposed AQR* method is the most superior in terms of VRFs, irrespective of the nominal dimension and the strike price. The VRFs of using the AQR* method in QMC can be at least double than those of using the other PGMs.

The VRFs of the QMC-based STD method are much lower than those of using the other QMC-based PGMs. The VRFs of the PCA method seem to be invariant to the nominal dimension. The PCA method only provides moderate advantage over the STD method since it does not tackle the discontinuity structure of the integrand. This implies that the jump structures of the integrand have a great impact on the performance of QMC methods.

The OT method works the best when the strike price 
                                       
                                          K
                                          =
                                          100
                                          ,
                                       
                                     and its performance gets worse when the digital Asian option is deep out-the-money or deep in-the-money. The reason is that the weight matrix chosen by the OT method is independent of the strike price K. So when the strike price K is much larger or smaller than 100, the linear structure used by the OT method does not approximate the discontinuity structure well. The performance of the AQR(1) method and the OT method are nearly the same when the strike price K is around 100, while the AQR(1) method exhibits obvious advantage over the OT method when the strike price 
                                       
                                          K
                                          =
                                          120
                                       
                                    . This implies that the typical normal vector 
                                       
                                          l

                                     chosen by the auto-realignment method approximates the discontinuity surface better than the OT method when the digital Asian option is deep out-the-money or deep in-the-money.

The efficiency gain of the AQR* method is significantly larger than the AQR(1) method, which implies that the discontinuities of the payoff function cannot be approximated by just one structure. Thus the AQR* method which chooses r

                                          ,
                                          ⋯
                                          ,

                                             *
                                          
                                       
                                     is much better than just applying single structure.

The comparison of results of the CQR method and the AQR* method confirms that the procedure of finding several representative normal vectors of the discontinuity surface is indispensable. If we use the normalized gradient vectors calculated on d arbitrarily chosen points to approximate the discontinuity surface, the performance of the CQR method is not very well compared with the AQR* method and even worse than AQR(1) in some cases.

Next we turn to the convergence graphs in Fig. 1
                            for the digital Asian option. The parameters are given as d ∈ {64, 128} and 
                              
                                 K
                                 =
                                 100
                              
                           . In these graphs, the horizontal axis gives the number of low discrepancy points N (which ranges from 20 to 220) plotted on a log scale. The vertical axis gives the mean squared error (MSE) obtained from 500 independent simulations also plotted on a log scale. The RQMC method yields an unbiased estimator. Thus we use the sample variance as the estimate of the MSE. Fig. 1 shows that the AQR* method has the least MSE and exhibits the fastest convergence rate among other PGMs. Thus the superiority of the AQR* method over the other PGMs is confirmed.

                                 The AQR* method is the most superior in terms of VRFs, irrespective of the nominal dimension and the barrier.

The OT method and the crude QR method are affected by the nominal dimension of the problem. These two methods perform better in low-dimensional cases than in high-dimensional cases. When the strike price K and the barrier B are closer, the efficiency of these two methods gets worse. The performance of the AQR(1) method and the OT method are nearly the same in this case.

The efficiency gain of the AQR* method is significantly larger than the AQR(1) method. This confirms that the AQR* method which chooses r
                                    * representative normal vectors is much better than the AQR(1) method which chooses only one structure.

The convergence graphs of MSE for the digital Asian barrier option is presented in Fig. 2
                           . The parameters are given as d ∈ {64, 128} and 
                              
                                 B

                           . The results are also very encouraging. The AQR* method has the least MSE and exhibits the fastest convergence rate among various PGMs. The comparison confirms the superiority of the AQR* method over other PGMs.

In this subsection we consider the case of digital option based on multiple underlying assets. We assume that the risky assets follow the multi-dimensional geometric BM. Under the risk-neutral measure, their dynamics are given by the stochastic differential equations

                                  the efficiency of the PCA method and the CQR method decreases. This implies that the PCA method and the CQR method may not be a stable good PGM. The CQR which chooses d arbitrary structures may be inappropriate.

The performance of the AQR(1) method and the OT method are nearly the same observed from Table 3. The comparison of the AQR* method and the OT method implies that it is insufficient to use only one normal vector to handle the discontinuities. The normal vectors on the discontinuity surface of the payoff function may be distributed more dispersedly than in the single asset case, which may be the reason of the inefficiency of the OT method and the AQR(1) method. Thus choosing enough representative normal vectors on the discontinuity surface is indispensable when we tackle the complex discontinuity structures.

                        . Obviously, the AQR* method has the least MSE and exhibits the fastest convergence rate among all PGMs. The comparison once more confirms the superiority of the AQR* method over the other PGMs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Many financial derivatives involve jump structures in their payoff functions. These structures may deteriorate the efficiency of the QMC method significantly. Although the OT method can recover the superiority of the QMC method for problems involving simple discontinuity structures, but for those payoffs involving complex discontinuities, they cannot be applied directly.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we use the machine learning technique to learn the information of the complex discontinuities more thoroughly in an automatic way. Learning the nature of the discontinuities completely is the key step to design a problem-dependent PGM. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new PGM called the auto-realignment method to handle complex discontinuities. The proposed method finds several representative normal vectors of the discontinuity surface by using the k-means clustering algorithm. After finding the appropriate weight matrix, we use the QR method to realign the discontinuity surface such that it is parallel to as many coordinate axes as possible. Thus the discontinuity structure of the transformed function will be much more QMC-friendly. As illustrated in the experiments, the proposed PGM is effective and robust.

The idea of machine learning plays an important role in designing the new PGM. We expect to find a better PGM via more efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. As future research, it is worth developing similar methods for pricing options and estimating Greeks under Lévy processes.
