                     Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative organism of tuberculosis. Extensively drug resistant strains and latency have posed formidable challenges in the treatment of tuberculosis. The current study addresses an alpha/beta hydrolase fold bearing enzyme, epoxide hydrolase Rv1938 from Mtb. Epoxide hydrolases are involved in detoxification processes, catabolism and regulation of signaling molecules. Using GROMACS, a 100ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for Rv1938. Cavities were identified within the protein at various time frames of the simulation and their volumes were computed. During MD simulation, in addition to the substrate binding cavity, opening of two new cavities located behind the active site was observed. These cavities may be similar to the backdoor proposed for acetylcholinesterase. Structural superimposition of epoxide hydrolase from Mtb with the epoxide hydrolase of Agrobacterium radiobacter1 AD1 (Ephy) indicates that cavity1 in Mtb lies at an identical position to that of the water tunnel in Ephy. Further, docking of the substrate and an inhibitor with protein structures obtained from MD simulation at various time frames was also performed. The potential role of these cavities is discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major disease infecting one-third of the world population. According to WHO reports, about 8.6 million people were affected with TB in 2012 and 1.3 million succumbed to the disease (WHO, 2013). Emergence of multi drug resistant strains and dormancy of Mtb have posed serious challenges in the treatment of tuberculosis. Another issue is the synergy between TB and HIV that has necessitated new therapies against these infections.

Mtb primarily infects the lungs and interacts with the dendritic cells, pulmonary epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. However, they are found mainly in the macrophages during infection (Gupta et al., 2012). Granuloma that develops at the site of infection is surrounded by lymphocytes and is loaded with foamy macrophages and other mononuclear phagocytes (Russell et al., 2010). For its survival, Mtb forms lipid bodies using host lipid as its energy source (Peyron et al., 2008). Latent TB is hard to diagnose and also serves as a reservoir for the transmission of the infection. The bacteria reside within the host for decades in a dormant state and reactivate when the host immunity declines. Hence, it is necessary to identify drugs that act against these non-replicative dormant bacteria.

Analysis of the complete genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Cole et al., 1998) has revealed the presence of six epoxide hydrolases (Rv3617, Rv1938, Rv1124, Rv2214c, Rv3670 and Rv0134). Further sequence analysis suggested that the Mtb genome encodes around 30 possible epoxide hydrolases including these six (Biswal et al., 2008). Epoxide hydrolases (EH) catalyze the conversion of epoxides into corresponding diols. Epoxides are toxic and highly reactive compounds which are also harmful to the pathogen. Multiple copies of EH in Mtb and toxicity of epoxide compounds suggest that inhibiting the EH enzyme could lead to anti-tubercular therapy (Johansson et al., 2005).

Further, two loci mel1 and mel2 in Mycobacterium marinum that confer enhanced host cell infection were identified. Mtb has six genes (Rv1936, Rv1937, Rv1938, Rv1939, Rv1940 and Rv1941) that are homologous to mel2 locus of M. marinum. Mutant M. marinum with mutations at mel1 and mel2 were unable to infect the murine and fish macrophage cell lines. Rv1938, epoxide hydrolase B (EHB) shares 82% sequence identity with melH gene of the mel2 locus of M. marinum (El-etr et al., 2004) .
                  

Rv1938 belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold. EHB is a 356 residue enzyme with a catalytic alpha/beta hydrolase domain (residues 1–129, residues 276–356) and a cap domain (residues 130–275). Asp104, Asp302 and His333 constitute the active-site pocket and residues Tyr164, Tyr272, Phe36 and Trp105 form the oxyanion hole. A comparison between EHB of Mtb and human EH shows differences in certain structural elements. These include residues 132–149 (part of the loop that connects the hydrolase and cap domain), residues 190–206 and 214–226 of the cap domain and residues 303–315 of the hydrolase domain which form a substrate binding cavity. Regions formed by residues 150–163, 227–250 of the cap domain and residues 20–29 of the hydrolase domain are longer in Mtb EHB when compared to human EH (Biswal et al., 2008).

Considering the critical role of epoxide hydrolase for the survival of bacillus, it is an important drug target for tuberculosis treatment. The dynamics of epoxide hydrolase, Rv1938 from Mtb is elucidated with an objective to gain insights into the domain movements and the conformational changes that occur in this enzyme. Further, the protein structures obtained at different time frames were docked with the substrate and inhibitor to highlight the essential structural features for ligand binding. MD simulations have been used in the past to understand the activity and behavior of biomolecules (Adcock and McCammon, 2006).

The crystal structure coordinates of EHB from Mtb bearing PDB ID: 2E3J was obtained from Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000). In the 3D structure of EHB, residues 1–3 and 207–213 were missing. Residues 207–213 were modelled using Modloop server (Fiser and Sali, 2003). This structure was used as the starting structure for MD simulations and is shown in Fig. 1
                        a.

MD simulation was performed using GROMACS (Berendsen et al., 1995; Pronk et al., 2013). The topology was generated using pdb2gmx tool with standard pH 7 amino acid protonation state. G43a1 force field was used for the simulation. The starting structure was solvated with the extended single point charge (SPCE) water model in a cubic box with 3nm space around the solute. The net negative charge of the system was neutralized by replacing the water molecules with 17 Na+ ions. In total there were 190,763 atoms in the simulation; 187,239 atoms of these were water molecules. Energy minimization was done using steepest descents method. Following energy minimization, the system was equilibrated for 100ps under NVT (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) and NPT conditions (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) using leap-frog integrator. This was followed by an all atom molecular dynamics simulation for 100ns. The simulation was repeated for another round of 100ns with G43a1 force field and with AMBER99SB-ILDN force field to validate the consistency in the results.

The system was weakly coupled to an external bath using V-rescale thermostat. The reference temperature was set as 300K and LINCS algorithm (Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992; Hess et al., 1997) was used for bond constraints. Long range electrostatic interactions were treated with particle mesh ewald (PME) (Essmann et al., 1995) and the time step used was 2fs.

GROMACS built-in tools were used for the analysis of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg). Location of cavities and their volume was calculated using CASTp server (Dundas et al., 2006). Solvent Accessible Surface area (SASA) was calculated using PyMol interface (Schrödinger LLC, 2010).

Essential dynamics was performed using the entire trajectory, to identify the global motions. Gromacs tools g_covar and g_anaeig were used. Analysis was done using Cα atoms. A covariance matrix was constructed and diagonalized. Eigenvectors were generated based on the covariance matrix diagonalization. Porcupine plot was generated for the first eigenvector using PyMol (Schrödinger LLC, 2010). Sausage plot was calculated using MD trajectory and the motion observed along eigenvector1 was displayed using MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996).

An enzyme kinetic study by Biswal et al. (2008), identified trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide as a substrate towards which Mtb EHB Rv1938 had higher specific activity. The substrate, trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide and an inhibitor, carbanilide were used for the docking study. The SMILES representations were retrieved from PubChem compound database (Bolton et al., 2008). Using canonical SMILES, the 3D structure of the ligands were generated using Corina molecular networks (Sadowski et al., 1994). The ligands used in our study are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1c. Blind docking was performed using Autodock (Morris et al., 2009) with default grid spacing of 0.375Å. Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used as the local search parameter. Docking included a flexible ligand and rigid protein molecule. Ten docking runs were carried out for each ligand. Atomic contacts between the ligand and the protein were analyzed using Accerlys Discovery Studio visualizer (San Diego: Accelrys Software Inc., 2012).

The 3D structures of Mtb EHB Rv1938, obtained at each nanosecond interval from the simulation were docked separately with the substrate, trans-1,3-diphenylpropene oxide and the inhibitor, carbanilide. From the ten docking runs of each of these docking studies, the complex with lowest energy was used for the further analysis.

Sequences of epoxide hydrolase from Mtb (A4KI82) and Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (O31243) were retrieved from UniprotKB (Consortium, 2014). Sequence alignment was performed using Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) and secondary structure annotation was prepared using ESPript (Gouet et al., 2000).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Molecular dynamics simulation of Mtb EHB Rv1938 was performed for a time frame of 100ns. Stability of the structure was analyzed using RMSD and Rg calculations. The protein stabilized around 10ns and remained stable till 100ns. The final RMSD value was 0.274nm. Rg value measures the compactness of the protein. The Rg values varied between 1.905nm and 1.864nm. The drift in Rg value is less, suggesting that it has maintained a compact structure with an average Rg value of ∼1.875nm. Together, these results indicated that the simulated structures show a stable trajectory as the difference in RMSD and Rg values are less. The RMSD and Rg graphs are shown in Fig. 2
                        a and Fig. 2b respectively.

Residue wise fluctuations of Mtb EHB Rv1938 were analyzed using RMSF values. The RMSF graph is shown in Fig. 2c. The convergence of the RMSD and RMSF graphs of the three simulation runs of 100ns each is presented in Supplementary Fig S1. RMSF profile identifies the flexible regions in the protein. Cα atoms were used for the calculation. The residues with RMSF of 0.15nm and above were considered as mobile. Residues Gly12, Pro23–Asp24, Gln26–Gly27, Gly52–Gly54, Phe131, Gly141–Phe144, Arg147, Glu155, Ala157–Gly160, Gln171–Asp172, Ile175–Thr176, Glu179, Lys203, Ala205–Met215, Ala223, Ala229–Ala232, Glu242–Ala246, Gly266–Pro268, Asp284–Lys288, Arg314–Val318 and Gly352–Pro356 were the mobile regions. Sausage plot showing the fluctuations during MD simulation is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.

Amongst the mobile residues, Pro23, Asp24, Gln26, Gly27, Arg314 in the hydrolase domain and Gly141, Glu155, Ala157–Pro159, Val206, Ser214, Glu230–Ala232 and Glu242–Ala246 in cap domain belong to regions that have conformations significantly different from humans. The modeled loop also showed mobility.

NC loop in epoxide hydrolase is found after the β6 strand and it links the cap and hydrolase domain (Barth et al., 2004). In Mtb EHb, residues Ile127–Pro149 form a long loop that connects the cap and the hydrolase domain (Biswal et al., 2008). This region is also found after β6 strand and will henceforth be referred as the NC loop. The residues in this loop except Gly141–Phe144, Arg147 have low RMSF values throughout the MD simulation. The rigidity of this loop may have some functional significance. Literature reports suggest that part of this loop (residues Ala132–Pro149) has a different conformation from that of humans and may play an important role in substrate specificity (Biswal et al., 2008).

The active site residues are situated deep inside the active site gorge and are part of the substrate binding pocket. The cap domain is positioned above the active site occluding the active site. Active site residues include Asp104, Asp302 and His333. The oxyanion hole formed during the catalytic process is stabilized by residues Tyr164, Tyr272, Phe36 and Trp105 (Biswal et al., 2008). The dynamic behavior of the oxyanion forming residues and the active site residues that participate in the catalytic mechanism was explored during MD simulation.

The RMSD and the chi-1 dihedral angle change of residue His333 is shown in Fig. 3
                        a and Fig. 3b respectively. The RMSD value of His333 at starting position is 0.01nm and it reaches a maximum at 38.57ns with a RMSD value of 0.17nm. We observe that His333 oscillates back and forth from its original position. The superimposed image of His333 at 38ns with respect to its starting position is shown in Fig. 3c. Studies on serine proteases have proposed flipping of imidazole ring of His as an important event in the catalytic mechanism as it serves as a vehicle for proton transfer (Rebek, 1990; Zhou and Zhang, 2011). We do not know if this oscillation of His333 has any correlation with the Histidine flipping mechanism and possible role in proton transfer. We also observe that throughout the MD simulation, His333 is in contact with water molecules except at 38ns. Our docking studies also show that the substrate binding pocket becomes inaccessible to the substrate after 37ns. From the RMSD graph of nucleophile residue Asp104 shown in Fig. 4
                        , we observe that it starts oscillating from around 8.82ns and continues to do so till the end of the simulation.

We also observe that the distances between the oxyanion hole residues, Tyr164 and Tyr272 change, showing a pattern of alternating increase and decrease in distances throughout the simulation. These residues perhaps act as a gate and help the substrate to enter or exit the substrate binding pocket.

Though we observe some dynamic motions for residues Asp302, Phe36 and Trp105 at different time intervals, a clear inference cannot be made with reference to the enzyme mechanism of epoxide hydrolase.

In Mtb EHB, the active site residues and the substrate binding site are on the periphery of the cavity that lies between cap and hydrolase domain. The substrate binding pocket is bordered by residues Phe36, Asp104, Trp105, Pro108, Val129, Pro130, Ile137, Gly138, Leu139, Trp163, Tyr164, Gln165, Phe168, Leu189, Val193, Leu226, Tyr272, Val303, Gly304, Trp307, Gly308, His333 and Trp334 (Biswal et al., 2008). The volume of this pocket was analyzed throughout the simulation period. The volume of this pocket varies between 112Å3 and 714Å3.

CASTp is an online server that finds and measures the volume of pockets and voids from a protein structure (Dundas et al., 2006). This tool was used to find the cavities that had volume above 100Å3. The crystal structure and structures obtained from MD simulation at time intervals of 1ns were used. In addition to the substrate binding pocket, two other new major cavities that open up during MD simulation were identified. Amongst these, the pocket lined with residues His5, His16, Ala17, Val18, His34, Glu38, Ser39, Trp40, Ala59, Ile60, Asp61, Gln62, Tyr65, Gly66, Arg67, Phe255, Glu259, Phe260, Ser263 and Gly264 occupied a volume equivalent to that of the substrate binding pocket. It is situated behind the active site and will henceforth be referred to as cavity1. Its volume varied between 94.1Å3 and 728.7Å3. A graph showing the volume of the substrate binding pocket and cavity1 during MD simulation is represented in Fig. 5
                        . It can be seen that initially the volume of the substrate binding pocket is larger than that of cavity1. During the simulation we observe that volumes of the substrate binding pocket and cavity1 fluctuate showing a repeated pattern of increase and decrease in volume.

At certain nanoseconds, CASTp server also identified another cavity with higher volume than that of substrate binding pocket and cavity1. The residues lining this cavity include Phe36, Gly64, Gly66, Lys70, Tyr71, Arg72, Gln74, Tyr77, Phe168, Ala169, Gln171, Ile174, Ile175, Ile178, Glu179, Leu182, Trp185, Glu261, Gly264, Phe265, Leu269 and Ser270. This cavity is also situated behind the active site and will be referred to as cavity2. Cavity1 and cavity 2 are located adjacent to each other. Studies have shown that enzymes such as carboxylesterase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase from the alpha beta hydrolase fold family have a back door to the active site tunnel (Gilson et al., 1994; Bencharit et al., 2002; Suárez and Field, 2005). We speculate that these cavities may possibly behave like a backdoor in Mtb EHB. The conformational changes of the cavities found in this study at various time frames is shown as Supplementary Fig. S3.

Essential dynamics (ED) or principal component analysis (PCA) was done to identify the prominent characteristic motions in EHB. Covariance matrix was constructed with a trace value of 5.71385nm2. The top 20 eigenvectors contributed to 74% of the total mean square fluctuation. The porcupine plot highlighting the collective motions of the substrate binding pocket, cavitiy1, cavity2 and NC loop is presented in Supplementary Fig. S4.

It is observed that the shifts in the NC loop, substrate binding pocket and cavity2 are directed towards the active site. One half of cavity1 shows movement towards the active site and the other half towards the surface of the enzyme. Residues Glu242–Ala246 that form a loop is found between cavity1 and cavity2. Residues Gly141, Glu155, Ala157–Pro159, Val206, Ser214, Glu230–Ala232 of the cap domain are located between that substrate binding pocket and cavity2. The displacement of these loops is highly correlated with the opening of cavity2. The conformations of loops are different from that of human epoxide hydrolase.

Docking studies revealed that the substrate and inhibitor bind to the rear cavities and when these ligands interact with residues that form the potential backdoor, there is no interaction with substrate binding pocket residues and vice versa. The binding energies and the residues that are in contact with the substrate and inhibitor are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2
                        
                        , respectively. The binding energies of the substrate and the inhibitor with the rear cavities seem to be almost equivalent with that of the substrate binding pocket. The 3D structures obtained from different time frames of the MD simulation were docked with the substrate and inhibitor and the docked complexes are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7
                        
                        , respectively.

We further correlated the volumes of these cavities during the simulation. It is intriguing that both the substrate binding pocket and cavity2 reach their maximum volumes at 30ns and cavity1 reaches its maximum volume at 29ns. At 29ns, the volumes of the substrate binding pocket, cavity1 and cavity2 are 589.5Å3, 728.7Å3 and 140.9Å3, respectively and at 30ns their volumes are 714.2Å3, 305.1Å3 and 954.8Å3, respectively. Substrate binding pocket is lined with residues that are predominantly hydrophobic except the catalytic residues (Biswal et al., 2008). Since it is mostly hydrophobic, it is buried within the enzyme. The residues bordering cavity1 and cavity2 are surface accessible. While viewing from the top of the cavity2, we observe that substrate binding pocket is at the base of cavity2. Residues lining cavity2 also lie in both the cap and hydrolase domain. Cavity2 and substrate binding pocket are contiguous and along with cavity1 they form “L” shaped tunnel with nucleophile Asp104 located near the bend of “L”. We hypothesize that around the simulation time frames when the volume of the cavities reaches the maximum value, the “L” shaped tunnel is formed through which product exit and/or water entry may occur. This “L” shaped tunnel found in our studies is analogous to the “L” shaped tunnel found in the murine soluble EH (Argiriadi et al., 1999).

A conserved motif “HGXP” is found in all the members of epoxide hydrolase family (Lacourciere and Armstrong, 1994; Arand et al., 1994). This motif may have a role in stabilizing the position of the putative hydrolytic water molecule (Nardini et al., 1999). Site-specific mutagenesis studies in rat microsomal epoxide hydrolase have shown that the His residue which is part of this motif may directly or indirectly affect the conformations of the active site (Bell and Kasper, 1993). In the Mtb EHB, this motif 34HGFP37 is found in turn3 and is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between His34 ND1 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Gly35. Here, residue Phe36 belongs to substrate binding pocket and His34 is part of cavity1. Interestingly, we observe flipping of imidazole ring of His34 at 7ns. The RMSD and the chi-1 dihedral angle change of the conserved residue His34 is shown in Fig. 8
                        a and Fig. 8b respectively. The superimposed image showing the His34 flipping at 7ns with respect to its starting position is shown in Fig. 8c. Fig. 8a shows that there is a sharp increase in RMSD at 7.95ns. The RMSD value of His34 reaches a maximum of 0.17nm at 7.95ns while at the initial time point of the simulation, its RMSD value is 0.02nm. The chi-1 angle of His34 shows a change from 60° to −60° suggesting that the imidazole ring of His34 undergoes an 180° rotation. We also observe that at the same time frame, volume of cavity1 is greater than the volume of substrate binding pocket. As noted earlier, the RMSD profile of Asp104 shows that it starts oscillating from 8.82ns. It is possible that the flipping of His34 and oscillation of Asp104 may have some correlation.

MD simulation studies also have proposed regions that could possibly have a role in creating water channels in many enzymes (Selvan et al., 2010; Oprea et al., 1997). Amongst the EH enzyme family, an epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 has a 20Å tunnel that connects the back of the active site cavity and the surface. This provides access of water molecules to the active site. The catalytic water molecule is found hydrogen bonded to His275, one of the catalytic triad residues (Nardini et al., 1999). The structural superimposition and sequence alignment of Mtb EHB and Ephy is shown in Fig. 9
                        . Structural superimposition shows that the tunnel and cavity1 lie in identical positions.

Since water molecules also bind to residues lining of cavity1 and also owing to its location being identical to the water channel of Ephy, the possibility of this being a water channel cannot be excluded. Since His34 is part of cavity1 and when viewing through cavity1 it is located at the base of cavity1, we hypothesize that residue H34 may act as a gating residue for the water channel.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Based on the MD simulation and docking studies we propose that cavities identified in this study may behave like a back door to the active site of Mtb EHB Rv1938, as seen in many other enzymes of the alpha beta hydrolase fold. To our knowledge this is the first time such back door cavities have been identified in Mtb EHB Rv1938. The MD simulation study has provided a different perspective to the static crystal structure of epoxide hydrolase, Rv1938. The opening of additional cavities identified in this study, offers a good experimental lead. However, the exact role of these cavities has to be validated experimentally. Mutations or design of inhibitors that block these cavities can be explored further.
