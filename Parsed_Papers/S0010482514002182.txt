                  Projection reconstruction nuclear magnetic resonance (PR-NMR) is a technique for generating multidimensional NMR spectra. A small number of projections from lower-dimensional NMR spectra are used to reconstruct the multidimensional NMR spectra. In our previous work [1,2], it was shown that multidimensional NMR spectra are efficiently reconstructed using peak-by-peak based reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. We propose an extended and generalized RJMCMC algorithm replacing a simple linear model with a linear mixed model to reconstruct close NMR spectra into true spectra. This statistical method generates samples in a Bayesian scheme. Our proposed algorithm is tested on a set of six projections derived from the three-dimensional 700MHz HNCO spectrum of a protein HasA.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well known that the structures of molecules of interest are studied both by X-ray crystallography and by NMR spectroscopy. While X-ray crystallography works only in a solid state, NMR spectroscopy characterizes three-dimensional structures, dynamics and molecular interactions of molecules in a liquid state and even in a gas state. It is also known that multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is very useful for obtaining more accurate and precise structure of molecules. However, a serious limitation of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is the long time required to record a set of multidimensional NMR experiments. The minimum measurement time of an N dimensional NMR experiment increases as the number of dimensions increases. This makes higher multidimensional NMR spectroscopy intractable in practice. For these reasons, several investigators have been attempting to speed up these measurements through more efficient approaches [3–7], which are traced back to the concept of accordion spectroscopy [8]. One of the recent approaches designed to address this problem is GFT-NMR by Kim and Szyperski [9]. GFT-NMR experiments detect sums of and differences in chemical shifts by linking the various evolution dimensions. Another approach, which is the main consideration of this paper, is projection reconstruction NMR (PR-NMR) by Freeman and Kupce [10–13]. To implement the reconstruction of multidimensional NMR spectra, we have investigated the use of several deterministic and statistical approaches [2,1,14]. Although deterministic algorithms including back projection and lowest value algorithms can reconstruct the spectra quickly, the reconstructed spectra are rather different from the underlying true spectra. Meanwhile, the statistical approaches based on a Bayesian scheme are relatively slow but provide reconstructions that are closer to the true spectra than those using deterministic approaches. In addition, there are two types of schemes for reconstructing spectra from projections: the pixel-by-pixel approach and peak-by-peak approach. In our previous papers [1,2,14], we demonstrated maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction, maximum a posterior (MAP) [15,16] reconstruction and maximum entropy (ME) [17,18,3,19] reconstruction for pixel-by-pixel approach. We also showed that reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) reconstruction based on a peak-by-peak scheme can be designed with the simple linear model and work better than other approaches based on a pixel-by-pixel approach in that it reduces the complexity of the problem and speeds up the calculation.

Although the previous RJMCMC algorithm with the simple linear model works effectively in particular PR-NMR experiments, we can still improve the methodology by carefully considering the noise of each projection. In practice, each projection is NMR spectra obtained from separate lower dimensional experiments meaning that each projection may have a different noise level. In this paper, an extended and generalized RJMCMC based algorithm is proposed to replace the simple linear model with the linear mixed model to explain such different noise levels per each projection.

                        These noises are regarded as random effect of the linear mixed model in this manuscript.
                     
                  

As mentioned in the introduction, the serious limitation of the promising multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is the long minimum measurement time, which increases as the number of dimensions increases. This makes higher multidimensional NMR spectroscopy impracticable. For example, suppose that n time points are sampled in each evolution period for a d-dimensional NMR experiment. In this case, the total experimental time is determined by the number of time points (n), the number of scans (N
                        
                           a
                        ), the number of dimensions (d), and the duration of each scan, typically about one second [20]. The minimum experimental time of the phase sensitive d-dimensional NMR experiment increases exponentially with the dimension as the dimension increases so therefore it is proportional to 
                           ∝
                           
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 d
                              
                           
                        . Therefore, several investigators have been attempting to speed up these measurements by more efficient approaches [3–7], which are traced back to the concept of accordion spectroscopy [8]. One of the recent approaches to address the measurement time problem is projection reconstruction NMR (PR-NMR) by Freeman and Kupce [10–13]. The PR-NMR reconstructs multidimensional NMR spectra by using relatively lower dimensional NMR spectra quickly. Apart from Kupce and Freeman, several other groups have contributed to the PR-NMR and its related topics [21–25].

                         evolution periods and 1 acquisition period. For example, there exist two consecutive evolution periods (t
                        1 and t
                        2) for a 3-D experiment. In NMR spectroscopy, a signal that evolves at a chemical shift

                        2. Thus, it can be regarded as an inter-modulation of the chemical shifts

Projection reconstruction NMR (PR-NMR) is based on the inter-modulation of chemical shifts. The basic idea of PR-NMR is to increase the evolution times t
                        1 and t
                        2 jointly at relative rates in order to generate a projection of the spectra onto a plane inclined at a proper angle. If t

                        However, some parameters among predictor variables can have random effects under uncertainty and such a simple linear model with fixed effects cannot explain the parameters well. The linear mixed model (LMM) is a statistical model containing both fixed and random effects to address this problem. The common form of the LMM is

Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) has been a popular method for addressing model selection problems [26] in many applications such as image processing [27,28] and nuclear spectroscopy [29]. RJMCMC enables Markov chains to move in between different dimensions of parameters. This can be used to infer the joint distribution of two types of parameters, a model indicator k and a parameter vector 
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                        . This is described as inferring 
                           p
                           (
                           k
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                           |
                           y
                           )
                        , where 
                           y
                         is observed information. The conventional MCMC mentioned cannot solve this problem since it is not straightforward in comparing the densities of objects in different dimensions. The reversible jump MCMC, suggested by [30], samples over a union space on the different dimensions of parameter spaces by applying the dimension matching procedures in a generalized MCMC framework.

Reconstruction of multidimensional NMR spectra from a small number of projections can be achieved using two strategies: pixel-by-pixel modeling [14,2] and peak-by-peak modeling [1,2]. While pixel-by-pixel modeling determines all pixels on an image individually in terms of the given projections, the peak-by-peak approach reconstructs an image using a finite collection of specific peak shapes. Even though the peak-by-peak model is an idealization of reality, it is a very reasonable assumption since the NMR peak shape can be well approximated as a specific shape such as Gaussian or Lorentzian. In the peak-by-peak approach, each peak consists of a center position, amplitude, and peak-width. Peak-by-peak estimation can be more efficient since it models explicitly the sparseness inherent in the NMR spectra. Thus, in the peak-by-peak approach, we do not have to directly update all areas of the image as would be required in the pixel-by-pixel approach. Another interpretation is that a solution can rapidly be obtained since the number of parameters for peak-by-peak estimation is much smaller than that for pixel-by-pixel. Here, then, we define the underlying image model at pixel location

                         for the center position and σ for peak width, as shown in Eq. (2). Two or more individual widths of the peaks may provide more accurate reconstruction than a single line width but we use a single width for our approach for two reasons. First, considering only a single width reduces time complexity in estimation; therefore, this can speed up our proposed approach. Second, we can reconstruct any shape of peaks only with such a single line width. That is, our proposed approach is based on a few assumptions. One is that the shape of the peak is considered as a Gaussian shape function. The other assumption is that a single line width can be used to approximate all peaks. Of course, our proposed algorithm may not perform well if the assumptions are not correct. Therefore, we simulate additional experiments to verify the assumptions used in this paper before applying these to real experimental NMR data.

First, our proposed approach uses a Gaussian shape function to design the peak profile in this paper although other line shape functions such as Lorentzian and Laplacian can also be effectively used. However, in fact, it is known that none of these correctly represents the underlying actual spectral line shape, which is defined by the decay rate of the time signal and appodization function. Fig. 1
                         demonstrates a comparison between actual non-Gaussian synthetic spectra and their reconstructed shape using the Gaussian shape function of the Eq. (2). The solid lines of Fig. 1(a) and (c) are the spectra with a single Laplacian shaped peak and the dashed lines of the subfigures are the reconstructed spectra with a Gaussian shaped function. As can be seen in the subfigures, the reconstructed spectra with 10 Gaussian components (K=10) are much closer to the actual Laplacian shape than one with a Gaussian component (K=1). In a way similar to Laplacian, the spectra with Lorentzian shaped peaks can also be well approximated using only Gaussian shaped functions as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d).

To validate the other assumption, we generate a synthetic spectra with two Gaussian shaped peaks that have different amplitudes and widths as shown in Fig. 2
                        . The left peak of the synthetic spectra is constructed with the location parameter

                        , the spectra are reconstructed varying the number of Gaussian components. The dashed line of Fig. 2(a) shows the reconstructed spectra with K=2 and that of Fig. 2(b) demonstrates the reconstructed spectra with K=10. As can be seen in this Fig. 2(a), the right peak, with a different width, is not properly reconstructed even in the Gaussian case because of the different width of the peak. However, both peaks are closely approximated to the actual spectra only with a single width Gaussian when 10 Gaussians (K=10) with a common single width are used to compose the spectra. That is, as K increases, such differences or errors from different shapes or different widths are significantly reduced, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d) and Fig. 2(b). Eventually, we can model real NMR peaks with various shapes by composing Gaussian shaped components that have a single width.

                           X
                        , from Fig. 3(b). Since there are 5 peaks in the image and each projection has 512 points, the number of columns is 5 and the number of rows is

Although the simple linear model of the previous section works effectively in certain PR-NMR experiments [1], we can still improve the methodology by carefully considering the noise from each projection. In practice, each projection is NMR spectra obtained from separate lower dimensional experiments meaning each projection may have a different noise level. In order to subtract the noise from the spectra, we need to understand the noise. In general, there are two different types of noise: projection noise and full plane noise. In each experiment (of lower dimensional NMR spectra), a certain amount of noise can be added into all projected spectra with variance 
                           
                              
                                 σ
                              
                              
                                 μ

                        . We refer to this noise as projection noise for a particular projection. Full plane noise is the other type of noise that is randomly added in a particular location of the spectra. In PR-NMR, only projection noise may be considered by setting 
                           
                              
                                 σ

                           0
                        . However, we added the “full plane noise” in order to indirectly consider the noise reduction of the reconstructed spectra rather than projected spectra. Such a denoising scheme for the full plane spectra is commonly applied even in one or two dimensional NMR processing [31]. We show the existence of both types of noise from Tables 1 and 2
                        
                         in Section 5. We now map these two noises to the statistical terms that are commonly used in the linear mixed model. The projection noise is regarded as a projection-specific random effect and the full plane noise is interpreted as a fixed effect in the linear mixed model. By carefully separating noise in the linear mixed model, we can expect better and well reconstructed multidimensional NMR spectra. Now our linear mixed model is defined as

                         may not be straightforward since there is no known pattern for projection noise in a generalized form. One of the simple ways to determine the pattern of each projection is to use a low-pass filter, such as average filter or Gaussian filter, that passes slowly changing regions or signals and reduces or removes the amplitude of signals from quickly changing regions in the projection. For simplicity, we assume that there exists a constant amount of noise in each projection, and then we say that the expectations of the projection noise are scaled with variance

Therefore, the linear mixed model reduces to a simple linear model when the random effect becomes zero. From this point of view, the linear mixed model is a sort of generalization of the linear model but has a richer structure to explain the data. Note that we can still represent such a richer linear mixed model with a simple linear model by only changing the structure of covariance as follows:

Since the peak-by-peak approach presents a computational challenge in that the number of peaks is not known a priori, trans-dimensional methods were applied in order to estimate the number of peaks in our previous paper [1]. Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is used to approach the trans-dimensional problems.

With such a unified and simplified form represented by Eq. (8), we use the following marginalized likelihood for both the simple linear model and the linear mixed model. The marginalized likelihood is obtained by integrating out the amplitude parameters by assuming that the amplitudes follow normal distribution as follows:

                                 Update the profiles of peaks via RJMCMC. This step of the proposed algorithm is very similar to that of our previous approach where the details of the algorithms of RJMCMC for PR-NMR are described [1]. The difference is the replacement of the simple linear model with the linear mixed model resulting in a richer covariance than with the previous approach. The updated covariance of each sample is used to build the likelihood

                        Fig. 4(a) shows the projections of 13C15N correlation peaks in the 700MHz HNCO spectrum of the protein HasA.

This is the observed dataset 
                           Y
                        . Figs. 4(b) and 6(a) show a contour image and its segmented binary image of a desired target map, respectively. The binary image is obtained by a simple single thresholding segmentation technique onto the ground truth spectra. The F1F2 plane is extracted from a full three-dimensional HNCO experiment on HasA, performed using the conventional method where both evolution times are incremented independently. The 16 peaks include a doublet and very weak peaks, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Now, our task here is to reconstruct the underlying multidimensional spectra of Fig. 4(b) from the six lower dimensional projected spectra of Fig. 4(a) by using several deterministic and statistical approaches. Given this dataset, we have checked the characteristics of the dataset before applying the reconstruction approach to verify the assumption that each projection can have different amplitudes in scale. Thus, we summed all values of spectra in each projection to check whether the spectra are scaled up or down at the rate ρ
                        
                           i
                         for the i-th projection. As shown in Table 1, the summed values for 0° are rather different from others so this proves that each projection has a differently scaled amplitude for each projection. For a stable estimation, we re-scaled the i-th projection by 
                           1
                           /
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        . In addition, another interesting factor to characterize the data is the noise level. The noise level of each projection can be different with varying projection angles although the projections are made from the same 3D HNCO spectra. Table 1 also shows that noise levels vary in terms of the projection angles. In particular, there is huge noise at a 90° projection. In the table,

                         indicate the mean and standard deviation of noise level ϵ, respectively.

As can be seen in Fig. 5
                        , the best result is obviously obtained from the second approach of Fig. 5(c), but note that we have to carefully and manually set the model parameters σ
                        
                           e
                         at 10 in this approach.

However, in general, we do not know the standard deviation of the noise; if we under-estimate it by 0.1 as in Fig. 5(b) or over-estimate it by 30 as in Fig. 5(d), the restored spectra are rather different from the desired spectra. In the case of the under-estimation of σ
                        
                           e
                        , we obtain unwanted peaks, which are simply denoted as “false alarm”. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish the real peaks from the false alarms since noises are considered as signals and the filtering technique fails. When we use an over-estimation of σ
                        
                           e
                         as in Fig. 5(d), we lose many weak but desired peaks in the reconstructed spectra. For these reasons, it is very crucial to obtain a precise and accurate σ
                        
                           e
                         in the simple linear model. We therefore need to address this problem by automatically estimating σ

                         may not be sufficient for obtaining spectra close to the underlying target map if lower dimensional spectra are independently corrupted by unwanted noise. Owing to such complicated models and datasets, we generalize the linear model to linear mixed model with fixed effect. In this paper, we name this generalized model Mixed

                                             (
                                             R
                                             |

                                             ,
                                             M
                                             )
                                           in a Bayesian framework [33]. However, we do not have any known prior information about 
                                             R
                                          , so we simulate only ML estimation for performance evaluation in this paper.


                                          ME (Maximum entropy): This reconstructs a desired spectra 
                                             R
                                           by maximizing the entropy with a Lagrange multiplier [34,35]. Nowadays, it is common to use maximum entropy as a prior knowledge in Bayesian statistics, but we do not use ME for the prior in this paper. In addition, maximum entropy reconstruction algorithms are very popular in multidimensional NMR domains. However, this is rather different from our problem since the conventional maximum entropy reconstruction algorithms are considering sub-sampling with sparse sampling strategies rather than projection space. From this point of view we cannot use recent ME reconstruction algorithms developed by several researchers because of their different data characteristics for PR-NMR [3,19]. More details on other types of sub-sampled NMR datasets are described in [36,37].

                         shows the reconstructed spectra by several pixel-by-pixel (b–e) and peak-by-peak (f–i) approaches referred to above. In particular, all RJMCMC reconstruction algorithms including our proposed approaches are peak-by-peak approaches and the sub-images are the averaged reconstructed spectra after burn-ins from the four different approaches. In order to estimate the number and profiles of peaks, the four variants of RJMCMC techniques are also compared with other pixel-by-pixel approaches and we generate in total 6000 samples including 3000 burn-in periods. As can be seen in the figures, many false ridges exist in most pixel-by-pixel approaches (including LV, ABP, and ML) except ME. Interestingly, in ME reconstruction strong signals are enhanced but low signals are suppressed in the reconstructed multidimensional spectra. The likelihoods of Fig. 6(g) and (i) are designed with the linear mixed model to explain the projection noise for each projection. The model parameters σ

                        Table 3
                         demonstrates the performance comparison with several popular metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), Kullback Leibler distance (KLD), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and area under curve (AUC). See the appendix for more details on the metrics used. Mixed model based approaches have smaller RMSEs and KLDs and higher SSIMs and AUCs compared with other algorithms except PSNR. Here, maximum entropy appears to have the best result in PSNR because the strong signals are enhanced and the effects of the enhanced signals are larger than the side-effects of the suppressed signals. Therefore, mixed model based approaches (Mixed

                        (a). The ROC is obtained by comparing two segmented binary spectra. One binary spectra is obtained by applying a single thresholding technique into a desired spectra of Fig. 6(a) and the other binary spectra is obtained by increasing a single threshold from 0 to 1 to segment the restored spectra.

In this plot, the sensitivity of ME reconstruction algorithm sharply increases but it falls to about 0.8 after FPR=0.01. This indicates that ME reconstruction finds a few strong peaks well in the low threshold but that it fails to uncover weak signals as the threshold increases.

                         converges to about 40. An alternative view concerning the number of peaks is the histogram/distribution of the number of peaks in Fig. 8(c), and the MAP approach has a set of samples with more peaks than the ML approach. Additionally the mixed model has more peaks than the linear model.

                           Convergence is asserted provided all the PSRF values fall below 1.2, a value that is known to work well in practice [38]. If this criterion is not satisfied for all estimands, then it is indicative of a lack of convergence and the simulation run needs to be lengthened.
                         All four variants of RJMCMC techniques pass the convergence checking.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Projection reconstruction nuclear magnetic resonance (PR-NMR) is an efficient technique for reconstructing multidimensional NMR spectra with only a small number of lower dimensional projected NMR spectra. Because reconstructing multidimensional NMR spectra from the projections for PR-NMR is an ill-posed inverse problem, Bayesian inference has been used to overcome the problem in two ways: the pixel-by-pixel and the peak-by-peak approaches. In this paper, we extended and improved our previous peak-by-peak based reconstruction algorithm which employs reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). First of all, we introduced the linear mixed model with random effect to explain the projection noise that might exist in each projection of PR-NMR. Second, we added an extra procedure to estimate the standard deviations of noises that were assumed known in the previous work. Lastly, we have introduced a unified and simplified form for both a simple linear model and a linear mixed model. Therefore, we do not need to change and can reuse the previous systems of PR-NMR.

                              Structural similarity (SSIM): the other metric is structural similarity based on image quality assessment, which is well known in the computer vision and image processing society. This metric is able to explain the strong dependencies between pixels of highly structured spectra [39].
