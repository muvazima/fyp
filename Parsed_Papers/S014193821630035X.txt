                  The quality of depth maps affects the quality of generated 3D content. Practically, the depth maps often have lower resolution than that of color images, thus, Depth map Up-sampling (DU) is needed in various 3D applications. DU can yield specific artifacts which can degrade the quality of depth maps as well as constructed stereoscopic (color plus depth map) images. This paper investigates the effect of DU on 3D perception. The depth maps were up-sampled using seven approaches and the quality of stereoscopic images obtained from up-sampled depth maps was estimated through subjective and objective tests. The objective quality prediction was performed using a depth map quality assessment framework. The method is able to predict the quality of stereoscopic images through evaluation of their corresponding up-sampled depth maps using 2D Image Quality Metrics (IQMs). In order to improve the quality estimation, the framework selects the 2D IQMs with highest correlation to subjective test. Furthermore, motivated by previous researches on multiple metrics combination, a new metric fusion method is proposed. Experimental results show that the combined metric delivers higher performance than single metrics in 3D quality prediction.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Following the rapid advances of three-dimensional (3D) technologies and the demand for attractive services such as 3D television (3DTV) and Free Viewpoint Video (FVV), the success of 3D applications depends on providing high quality content. In 3D systems, depth map has an important role for 3D content generation and the 3D quality highly depends on the accuracy of depth data.

The value of each pixel in depth images determines the position of the associated color pixel in 3D space. Depth maps can be captured using Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth-sensing cameras in which an up-sampling step is needed to increase the spatial resolution of depth maps. Another method is to obtain depth maps from a pair of images with different viewpoints using stereo matching algorithms [1,2].

Depth maps are widely used in 3D transmission to save bandwidth. Fehn et al. [3] proposed to transmit color image and its corresponding depth map called 2D+Z format. The stereopairs can be generated in receiver side with Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) technique [4]. The 2D+Z format delivers higher transmission efficiency than stereo-pair formats since depth maps can be highly compressed [5].

Depth map should have the same spatial resolution as color image and be well aligned in object boundaries with color data. The depth maps from stereo matching methods often have some regions with unreliable depth data especially in texture-less areas and repeated patterns. Moreover, the depth edges may not be well aligned with the color image. The ToF cameras can overcome the limitations of stereo matchers and provide more accurate depth estimation independent of surface texture, but at the cost of lower resolution [6,7]. Thus, Depth map Up-sampling (DU) is needed in many high quality 3D systems. Another application of DU is to save bandwidth in multi-view video transmission where depth video frames are usually down-sampled prior to encoding [8] and DU techniques are needed in decoder side.

Different up-sampling methods were proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of depth maps [9â€“11]; however, DU can yield distortions such as ringing artifacts as well as jagged and blurred edges. The DU methods are usually evaluated in terms of bad pixel rate or by 2D Image Quality Metrics (IQMs) while perceptual 3D factors are not taken into account. In spite of the importance of DU in 3D applications, investigation about the effect of DU approaches on 3D perception has been an unexplored issue. In this paper, the degradation effects of different DU methods on stereoscopic images are investigated. First, depth maps were up-sampled using different DU approaches and then a subjective test was used to assess the quality of stereoscopic images obtained from the up-sampled depth maps and color images.

Subjective assessment is time-consuming, expensive and sensitive to conditions such as image/video contents and 3D displays [12,13]. Therefore, a reliable objective method is desirable to evaluate the quality faster and free of human interference. Here, in addition to subjective test, a depth quality assessment framework is provided to compare the effect of different DU methods on 3D quality. The proposed framework is able to efficiently predict the quality of stereoscopic images through objective quality evaluation of their up-sampled depth maps.

Recently, there are emerging research works in the field of 3D IQMs which can effectively estimate the quality of 3D images by considering the interaction between two eyes and physiological studies of binocular perception [14]. Chen et al. [15] developed an objective 3D IQM based on the theories of binocular rivalry. Banitalebi-Dehkordi et al. [16] proposed a new 3D metric by taking into account the cyclopean views, contrast sensitivity of HVS system and the disparity of the views. Lin and Wu [17] utilized the binocular integration behaviors to measure the stereoscopic image quality. A 3D IQM was developed in [18] that captured the information from cyclopean view, binocular rivalry, and the scene geometry for quality evaluation.

The aforementioned 3D metrics considered binocular artifacts in quality estimation; however, the intention of this paper is to provide a depth quality assessment framework for stereo images affected by DU artifacts. The distortion from DU methods can be classified as monocular (2D-based) type that is different from binocular distortions. When the degradation in a stereoscopic image is derived from distortion of its 2D components (i.e. depth map and color image), a straightforward way is to estimate the 3D quality by evaluating the 2D components through 2D IQMs [19,20].

Various 2D IQMs can be used to evaluate the quality of up-sampled depth maps, but they may deliver different results. Since the aim is to predict the 3D quality from depth quality assessment, it is required to choose the IQMs that have higher correlation with 3D subjective assessment. For 2D IQM selection, the amount of consistency between depth quality scores obtained from each 2D IQM and 3D subjective assessment is computed through correlation. The metrics with higher correlation are considered to be better for 3D quality prediction.

In order to improve the depth quality assessment framework, a metric fusion method is proposed. Since there is no single metric that significantly outperforms others, a new concept is to combine different metrics [21]. Previous works in the field of metric fusion mainly focused on 2D applications. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of 2D IQMs fusion to improve 3D quality prediction. The objective results obtained from 2D IQMs are combined using a regression approach to achieve a higher correlation with the subjective test of 3D images. Our experimental results show that the combined metric improves quality evaluation compared to single 2D IQMs.

This paper examines the effect of different DU approaches on 3D perception using subjective and objective methods. A depth quality assessment framework is proposed to objectively predict the quality of stereoscopic images with up-sampled depth maps. Furthermore, the proposed 2D metric fusion method can improve the 3D quality prediction.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows: Some related works are reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the depth map quality assessment framework that includes 2D metric selection and metric fusion approaches. Information about the data set as well as objective and subjective tests is provided in Section 4. In Section 5, the experimental results are presented. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Several methods were proposed in previous works that utilized 2D metrics for 3D quality prediction. In order to choose suitable 2D IQMs, the correlation between the result of each 2D metric and a 3D subjective assessment was obtained in the presence of distortion. Researchers are variant with their opinions of both distortion types and 2D images (depth map or rendered views) based on their 2D IQM selection experiments.

Bosc et al. [20] examined the reliability of 2D image metrics in 3D evaluation by studying the effect of synthesis artifacts on stereoscopic images generated from seven DIBR algorithms. Hewage et al. [22] computed the correlation between subjective and objective assessments on asymmetrically coded stereoscopic videos. The authors evaluated the quality of color images as well as rendered left and right views using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Video Quality Metric (VQM) [23]. The results showed that VQM outperforms the other two metrics. You et al. [24] applied four distortion types (Gaussian blurring, white noise, JPEG and JPEG2000 compression) to a right view to evaluate the performance of various 2D metrics in 3D quality assessment.

Unlike the aforementioned approaches, another possible method is to include probable depth map artifacts since the quality of synthesized views depends on the accuracy of the depth information. Banitalebi-Dehkordi et al. [25] examined the capability of five quality metrics for 3D quality evaluation by comparing the objective scores of distorted depth maps and subjective results in the context of 3D transmission. The depth map artifacts due to compression and packet loss were considered in their experiment. In this work, the effect of DU artifacts on depth maps and 3D image is investigated to select the validated 2D IQMs for 3D evaluation.

In addition to 2D metrics validation, a metric fusion approach is proposed to improve the quality evaluation results. Okarma [26] showed that a combination of metrics achieves a higher correlation with subjective scores compared to a single metric. Further investigations by fusing some different quality metrics and using new combination methods were performed in [27]. Liu et al. [28] examined the validity of metric fusion through analysis of different metric combinations. They divided the distorted images into various groups based on distortion types and observed that a single quality metric cannot work well for all distortion types. According to their analysis, each quality metric is suitable for a number of distortion types; however, none of these methods can perform well for all groups of distortions.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This section explains the depth map quality assessment framework used for quality prediction of stereoscopic images with up-sampled depth maps.

Up-sampling can generate distortions especially on the edge regions. In a depth map, the gray level difference at two sides of a boundary edge implies two regions with different depths. Therefore, a distorted edge can significantly affect the perceptual quality of the stereoscopic image reconstructed from an up-sampled depth map. DU produces different artifacts depending on the up-sampling methods used. In order to obtain various up-sampling artifacts, seven up-sampling methods based on interpolation kernel and bilateral filter principles are used in this research. Table 1
                      summarizes the up-sampling algorithms.

The quality assessment framework uses two methods to predict 3D quality through 2D IQMs: The first approach selects the best single 2D IQMs for 3D quality prediction and the second method combines the metric scores. In the following, 2D IQM selection and metric fusion approaches are described.

Different 2D IQMs can be utilized to evaluate the quality of up-sampled depth maps; however, some of them have higher correlation with human judgment. Thus, a test methodology is provided to choose the suitable 2D IQMs for 3D perception considering DU artifacts. The overall flow diagram of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1
                        . In order to study the effect of DU artifacts, the original test depth maps were down-sampled by a factor of two and the low-resolution depth maps were up-sampled using seven up-sampling algorithms. Therefore, seven up-sampled depth maps were generated from each original test depth map. The quality of up-sampled depth maps was evaluated using several full-reference 2D IQMs. Moreover, seven stereoscopic images were constructed by the DIBR technique and were evaluated through a subjective test. Finally, the correlation between the subjective evaluation and each objective result was examined and the 2D IQMs with higher correlations were selected.


                        Fig. 2
                         presents the detailed validation test chain for PSNR metric. After generating seven up-sampled depth maps from original test images, each up-sampled depth image was evaluated using PSNR metric (PSNR 1,â€¦Â , PSNR 7). The up-sampled depth maps were also used to construct a set of stereoscopic images. The stereoscopic images were evaluated by human subjects (Mean Opinion Scores (MOS)). Finally, the amount of consistency between PSNR and MOS scores was computed using correlation. Similarly, this chain was repeated for all 2D IQMs [PSNR, VIF, VIFP, VSNR, WSNR, SSIM, NQM, IFC, UQI, GMSD, SD] and a correlation value was obtained for each metric. When comparing the correlation coefficients, 2D metrics yielding higher correlation with subjective test were selected as validated metrics for 3D evaluation.

In recent years, several quality metrics have been proposed; however, none of them significantly outperform the other metrics. One metric may show performance improvement for a specific distortion type but it cannot achieve better results for other distortions. The complexity of visual content and distortion types as well as the sensitivity of quality metrics to types of distortion has motivated the necessity of combining multiple metrics for better quality assessment.

In order to combine multiple 2D metrics, a regression approach is adopted. Linear regression is a method of mathematical statistics that predicts the outcome of response variable Y by fitting a linear equation to an independent variable X. The multiple linear regression uses several independent variables (X
                        1, X
                        2,â€¦, Xn
                        ) and the response variable E(Y|X) is modeled as a function of two or more independent variables as shown in (1).

                        where Î± is the intercept and Î² denotes slope or weight coefficient. These parameters are estimated from observations of response and independent variables.

The quality scores obtained from 2D IQMs are inserted into the regression equation as independent variables. The regression model generates new results with higher correlation to response variable (subjective score) by assigning a suitable weight to each 2D IQM score. Thus, a combined metric can be achieved by fitting a linear equation to the independent variables.

This section provides descriptions of the test sequences, objective metrics and subjective test method used in this work.

Five test sequences each with two different viewpoints were selected for the experiment. Therefore, ten synthesized sequences for each up-sampling algorithm were utilized (70 synthesized sequences in total): Ballet (1024Ã—768 â€“ 100 frames), Breakdance (1024Ã—768 â€“ 100 frames), Balloons (1280Ã—720 â€“ 300 frames), Kendo (1280Ã—720 â€“ 300 frames), and Poznan-street (1280Ã—720 â€“ 250 frames). The first two sequences were selected from the multi-view image sequences generated by Microsoft Research [36]. The rest of the sequences were obtained from the data set recommended by the MPEG 3D video coding (ISO/IEC MPEG). More details for Kendo and Balloons data sets can be found in [37] and for Poznan-street data set in [38]. Fig. 3
                         shows the original color images and their corresponding depth maps.

Using still images could also be a possible scenario [20], thus, considering the large size of the data set, some selected frames were used in this experiment. From each viewpoint, six frames were selected (twelve frames for each video) and the corresponding depth map of each frame was up-sampled by seven methods. The frame numbers are listed in Table 2
                        .

Different 2D IQMs were applied to assess the quality of up-sampled depth maps. The quality metrics are introduced as follows:

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is the ratio between the power of signal to noise. This metric computes the signal fidelity of the distorted image compared to the reference image.

Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) [39] is an image quality metric that uses information theoretic criterion [40] for image fidelity measurement. The pixel based version of VIF criterion is called VIFP.

Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio (VSNR) [41] is a wavelet-based metric approach which measures the quality by computing the contrast thresholds for detection of distortion.

Weighted Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WSNR) is a ratio between the average weighted signal power and the average weighted noise power. The Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) is used as a weighting function.

Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) [42] is a tool for image quality evaluation that measures the similarity between two images. SSIM is based on modeling any image distortion as a combination of luminance distortion, contrast distortion and loss of correlation.

Noise Quality Measure (NQM) [43] quantifies the injected noise. NQM takes into account the variation in contrast sensitivity and local luminance mean, contrast interaction between spatial frequencies and contrast masking effects.

Information Fidelity Criterion (IFC) [44] computes image quality using the scene statistical model in an information-theoretic setting. The shared information between the distorted and reference images is evaluated using a distortion model.

Universal Quality Index (UQI) [45] models image distortion as a combination of loss of correlation, luminance distortion and contrast distortion.

Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD) [46] considers the gradient sensitivity to image distortion and uses a variation of gradient based on the local quality map for quality prediction.

Sharpness Degree (SD) [47] is used to represent the extent of sharpness of the image and is defined by:

With the exception of GMSD and SD, MeTriX Mux Visual IQM Package [48] was used for the other metrics in the experiment.

The subjective test was performed to evaluate the quality of synthesized views generated by the DIBR. Twenty-five non-expert observers (12 male and 13 female) participated in the experiment. The stimuli were displayed on a LG 47LA6100 3DTV and the viewers were equipped with polarized 3D glasses. As mentioned earlier, only selected frames were presented to the subjects.

The subjective test was carried out using the Double Stimulus Continuous Quality Scale (DSCQS) method recommended by the International Telecommunication Unionâ€™s Recommendation (ITU-R). The observers were asked to rate the perceived image quality on a scale of 1â€“5 according to ITU-R BT.500-11 recommendation [2]. The five-level scale is shown in Table 3
                        . The MOS was obtained by averaging the viewersâ€™ opinions.

To detect outliers, a rejection analysis was performed on subjective results. An observer rating was considered as an outlier if the correlation between the MOS and the subjectâ€™s rating results for all images was less than 0.7. According to correlations, there was no outlier among the subjects.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The experimental results are presented and discussed in the following subsections.

In order to compare the performance of DU approaches on 3D perception, the quality of stereoscopic images obtained from seven DU methods was measured. Table 4
                         shows the results of subjective assessment averaged over all videos. Furthermore, quality of up-sampled depth maps was evaluated using the 2D IQMs. Table 5
                         represents depth maps quality after applying each DU method using various metrics. The rank order evaluation is also included.

According to the subjective test scores, BLU and BCU (with rank 1 and 2) exhibit the best performance out of the seven algorithms. Also, depth quality rankings in Table 5 shows that BLU and BCU ranked as first or second by all 2D metrics (except by SD metric). Considering that most of the data loss occurs on the edge locations, it can be inferred that the recovered edges obtained from the interpolation (BLU and BCU) is more suitable for visual comfort [49]. The JBU method (rank 3) has the best performance among bilateral-based approaches.

As shown in Table 4, NAFDU attains rank 7 in subjective assessment and delivers the lowest visual comfort among seven DU methods. Furthermore, Table 5 shows that the quality of depth maps obtained from NAFDU approach always ranks in the last four places except for the SD metric in which NAFDU is ranked first. The quality evaluation comparison shows that the SD results are considerably different from other metrics. The reason of difference is explained in the next subsection.

Comparing the rankings of subjective scores and depth quality evaluation in Tables 4 and 5, it can be inferred that depth quality is related to stereoscopic image quality and some 2D IQMs can better show this relationship. Therefore, 3D quality can be predicted by depth quality evaluation while the prediction accuracy is increased by choosing the 2D IQMs with higher correlation to subjective test.

The consistency between each objective score and subjective measurement was examined using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The objective and subjective results were normalized first because each objective metric shows the results in related units (e.g., PSNR/dB). The normalization of each evaluation value (score) is given by:

                        where scorenorm
                         is the normalized opinion score. The m
                        min and m
                        max are the minimum and maximum scores, respectively.

The quality scores were obtained for five test videos that their depth maps were up-sampled by seven DU methods (35 up-sampled sequences). Then, the correlation between a 2D IQM and subjective scores was computed using the whole set of 35 up-sampled sequences.


                        Table 6
                         presents the statistical dependency between objective IQMs and subjective test in terms of PCC, SROCC and RMSE across five video sequences and seven DU algorithms.

As mentioned earlier, there is a significant difference between the SD quality results and other metrics. The SD metric has a negative correlation (âˆ’0.59) with subjective test. This means that less sharpness is related to a higher subjective score. In other words, visual comfort has a positive correlation with less sharpness. This will confirm the fact that an image with a high spatial frequency reveals more noticeable visual discomfort than an image with low frequency [50]. To obtain a positive correlation, all sharpness values were subtracted from the maximum (SD
                        max - SD) after normalization. The positive correlation of SD shown in Table 6 is obtained from this modification.

The results in Table 6 reveal a noticeable relation between 3D perception and depth map quality. Among the objective IQMs, NQM is the most correlated metric with the PCC of 0.72, the SROCC of 0.70 and the RMSE of 0.23. Comparing the objective scores (Table 5) with the subjective measurements (Table 4), NQM quality results are close to subjective test. Using NQM, BLU and BCU show the best performance with quality scores of 39.88 and 39.14, respectively. Similarly, the highest scores belong to BLU and BCU with quality scores of 4.14 and 4.07. Likewise, both metrics show that NAFDU has the lowest quality compared to other up-sampling approaches.

This section examines the quality estimation performance using the combination of multiple 2D metrics. The final evaluation score can be obtained by linear combination of single 2D IQM scores as independent variables with suitable weights in which a multiple regression approach is used for weight calculation.

The regression method assigns larger weights to the 2D IQMs that have higher contribution in prediction model while smaller weights are assigned to the metrics with less predictive importance. According to (1), the combination of eleven metrics introduced in Section 4.2 can be computed as:

The Î² values imply the contribution of 2D IQMs in regression model. Using all 2D IQMs in the regression, we observed that three metrics namely: UQI, NQM and SD had the highest contribution (larger weights) while the weights of the other metrics were very small or zero.


                        Fig. 4
                         presents the performance of the metric fusion method based on the number of combined 2D IQMs. The combination was started from three aforementioned IQMs and a new metric was added in each step. We used this combination order to better compare the contribution of the three IQMs with other metrics; however, the order of combination does not affect the results. As shown in figure, the highest performance is achieved by fusion of UQI, NQM and SD 2D IQMs while the performance is slightly improved when other metrics are added. Therefore, the combination of these three 2D IQMs can deliver comparable performance to all metrics combination but with less computational burden.

The reason for higher contribution of the three metrics can be described by their higher independency from each other. The authors in [28] also confirmed that the fusion of multiple metrics with many common characteristics cannot deliver an additional advantage compared to a single metric.

In order to explain the reason that the three metrics are more effective in the fusion method, we compared the similarity between objective IQM results using the correlation coefficients. Table 7
                         shows the PCC values between 2D IQMs. The results confirm that the objective metrics have high correlation in many cases; however, the correlation values for some metrics are low. These low-correlated (independent) metrics share less characteristics. Furthermore, if the independent metrics have high correlations with the subjective test, it can be inferred that they use variant quality factors that are effective in 3D quality estimation.

Observing the results of Table 7, the SD metric exhibits weaker correlations with respect to VIF, IFC and UQI. Among those, UQI shows a higher correlation with subjective measurement. Therefore, SD and UQI are suitable candidates. Furthermore, NQM has a weak correlation with UQI (0.43) and the highest correlation with the subjective test. Therefore, UQI, SD and NQM have more predictive importance while other metrics have less contribution in prediction.


                        Table 8
                         shows the performance of all metrics combination in terms of PCC, SROCC and RMSE values across 35 sequences (five videos and seven DU approaches). Moreover, the Î² weights of UQI, NQM and SD metrics that have the highest contribution are reported. As mentioned earlier, the weights of other 2D IQMs are very small or zero. Comparing the results, the combined metric with PCC of 0.85, SROCC of 0.87 and RMSE of 0.18 shows higher performance than NQM as the best metric.

                         compares the performance of different 2D IQMs and the combined metric. The PCC and SROCC values of the combined metric are higher than all 2D IQMs. Moreover, the lowest RMSE value is achieved from the metric combination method.

                         presents the scatter diagrams and the fitted lines for UQI (a), NQM (b), SD (c) and the combination of all metrics (d) with respect to MOS. The diagram points were obtained using the quality scores of the entire set of five video sequences up-sampled by seven DU methods. The points of each video are shown by a specific color. Note that the MOS values were normalized to unity.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper studies the effect of DU on overall 3D quality. The depth maps were up-sampled using seven DU approaches and they were used to construct stereoscopic images. Then, the degradation effect of each DU method was investigated by quality evaluation of the stereoscopic images and up-sampled depth maps. According to the results, BCU and BU are the most suitable up-sampling approaches while NAFDU exhibits the highest degradation effect.

Since distortion of depth map directly disturbs 3D quality, a depth quality assessment framework is adopted to predict the stereoscopic image quality by evaluation of their corresponding up-sampled depth maps. Various 2D IQMs can be utilized for depth quality evaluation, however, it is needed to choose the metrics that are highly correlated with subjective assessment. The framework selects the most suitable 2D IQMs by comparing their performance through PCC, SROCC and RMSE values. The analysis shows that some objective metrics correlate well with the subjective measurement and NQM has the best performance.

Since there is no single IQM which can deliver the best performance for all types of distortions, a metric fusion method is proposed to take advantage of multiple metrics for better 3D quality estimation. The experimental results indicate that using the combined metric for quality evaluation can achieve higher consistency with subjective evaluation compared to single 2D IQMs. Previous works that used 2D IQMs for 3D evaluation often tried to find the most suitable metric, however, we showed that the combination of all metrics is a more reliable tool for 3D quality prediction.
