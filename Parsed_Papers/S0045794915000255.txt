                  The consistently linearized eigenproblem (CLE) plays an important role in stability analysis of structures. Solution of the CLE requires computation of the tangent stiffness matrix

The numerical investigation consists of the analysis of a circular arch subjected to a vertical point load at the vertex, and of a thrust-line arch under a uniformly distributed load. The main conclusion drawn from this work is that the DBFDA is superior to the LBFDA.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Buckling is one of the most important causes of loss of the integrity of structures. Hence, the investigation of this phenomenon is very important in structural analysis and design. The so-called consistently linearized eigenproblem (CLE), originally proposed in [1,2], was initially used for ab initio estimates of stability limits by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM) [3]. Herein, ab initio means “without incremental analysis”. Compared to other modes of accompanying linear eigenvalue analysis, as proposed e.g. in [4,5], for specific problems, such as, for example the von Mises truss subjected to a point load at the vertex, the CLE provides a better estimation of the buckling load (see Fig. 2.19 in [2]). Later on, Mang and collaborators employed the CLE for assessing the initial postbuckling behavior of elastic structures [6–8]. The CLE also plays a role in the energetical classification of limiting cases of loss of stability such as lateral torsional buckling [9].

The mathematical formulation of the CLE reads as

                     , with respect to λ for the special case of a co-rotational beam element. The second one is a finite difference approach, herein referred to as load-based finite difference approximation (LBFDA); the third one is also a finite difference approach, herein designated as displacement-based finite difference approximation (DBFDA). These two designations reflect the specific character of the two finite difference approximations. Solutions of the CLE, based on the first approach, are considered as the benchmark results. Results obtained by means of the LBFDA and the DBFDA will be compared with corresponding results obtained with the help of the analytical method. The comparison involves the convergence rate, the accuracy, and the computing time.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, basic mathematical properties of the CLE will be presented. Section 3 is devoted to the derivation of an analytical expression for

                      for a co-rotational beam element. In Section 4, the two finite difference approaches will be delineated, including consideration of programming aspects. In Section 5, the theoretical findings will be verified in the frame of a numerical investigation. In particular, a circular arch subjected to a vertical point load at the vertex, and a thrust-line arch subjected to a uniformly distributed load will be investigated with special emphasis on loss of stability. Conclusions from this investigation will be drawn in Section 6.

Because of its simplicity, the co-rotational approach is widely used in nonlinear finite element analysis [10–12]. Herein, a two-dimensional co-rotational beam element, based on the Euler–Bernoulli assumptions, is developed. The displacement of the element is decomposed into the rigid-body part and the deformational part, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . The rigid-body displacement includes two parts, a translation (from

                         at the vertex. The geometric properties and the material parameters are also shown in this figure. The arch is discretized by 100 two-node beam elements. It is analyzed by means of FEMv2 as well as by MSC.MARC 2012.

The vertical displacement of the central node is chosen as the representative degree of freedom. The load–displacement paths obtained from the two FE codes are shown in Fig. 5
                        . The result obtained from MSC.MARC 2012 agrees very well with the one obtained from FEMv2.

The convergence rate of a numerical approach for calculation of a quantity is directly related to the slope of the curve in a log–log plot [16]. The red line in Fig. 6 is parallel to the black line, indicating that the convergence rate of the error norm based on the DBFDA of

                        , the error is increasing, which is the consequence of the limitation of the number of digits in the representation of numbers in the computing machine. Hence, the lowest point of each curve characterizes the accuracy of the respective FDA. According to Fig. 6, the accuracy of the DBFDA is higher than the one of the LBFDA.

                        Geometric parameters and material data are shown in Fig. 10
                        . Contrary to a three-hinged arch of the same geometric configuration, subjected to the same load as the two-hinged arch shown in Fig. 10, the latter, strictly speaking, is no thrust-line arch. However, since its bending moments are negligibly small [14], it is justified to speak of a thrust-line arch. For such an arch, buckling occurs from a membrane stress state.

Herein, the structure is analyzed by means of FEMv2 as well as MSC.MARC 2012. The arch is discretized by 100 two-node beam elements. The vertical displacement of the central node is chosen as the representative degree of freedom. The load–displacement paths obtained from FEMv2 and MSC.MARC 2012 are shown in Fig. 11
                        . The results obtained from MSC.MARC 2012 agree very well with the ones obtained from FEMv2. Fig. 11(a) shows the entire computed load–displacement curve, containing a bifurcation point 
                           
                              S

                        , followed by a snap-through point, D. Hence, the latter is physically insignificant. Fig. 11(b) illustrates the initial part of the load–displacement path.

Motivated by visualization of the concept of energy-based categorization of buckling problems by means of spherical geometry, methods for numerical solutions of the CLE, representing the mathematical tool for this categorization, were proposed and evaluated in this paper.

                           The two-dimensional co-rotational beam element, used in FEMv2, was found to be suitable for static structural stability analysis. The structural response agrees very well with the one obtained by means of the commercial finite element program MSC.MARC 2012.
