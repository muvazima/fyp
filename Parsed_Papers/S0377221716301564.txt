                  We introduce in this paper a new definition for the overall system efficiency in network DEA, which is inspired by the “weak link” notion in supply chains and the maximum-flow/minimum- cut problem in networks. We use a two-phase max-min optimization technique in a multi-objective programming framework to estimate the individual stage efficiencies and the overall system efficiency in two-stage processes of varying complexity. This enables us to estimate unique and unbiased efficiency scores and, if required, to drive the efficiency assessments effectively in line with specific priorities given to the stages. A comparison with the multiplicative decomposition approach on data drawn from the literature brings into light the advantages of our method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Network DEA is an extension of conventional DEA (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978) developed to take account of the internal structure of the decision making units (DMUs). In network DEA, the DMU is considered as a network of interconnected sub-units (commonly called stages, divisions, sub-processes), with the connections indicating the flow of intermediate products (measures). Färe and Grosskopf (1996, 2000) are among the first to deal with efficiency assessments in network DEA. Thorough classifications of network DEA models and methods developed for various network configurations are given in Castelli, Pesenti, and Ukovich (2010) and Kao (2014b). Moreover, a collection of network DEA models is given in Cook and Zhu (2014). In this paper however, we concentrate on two-stage series processes. Prominent approaches developed to deal with two-stage series processes are those proposed by Chen, Cook, Li, and Zhu (2009), Kao and Hwang (2008), Liang et al. (2008) and Li, Chen, Liang, and Xie (2012). Extensions to multistage processes are given in Kao (2009), Kao (2014a) and Cook, Zhu, Bi, and Yang (2010), among others. The multiplicative decomposition approach (Kao & Hwang, 2008) and the additive decomposition approach (Chen et al., 2009) are the first methods to assess the stage efficiencies and the overall system efficiency jointly in one program. Earlier, Seiford and Zhu (1999) assessed the efficiency of commercial banks in US by considering the bank operations as a two-stage process. They assessed, however, the stage efficiencies and the overall system efficiency independently with distinct standard DEA models. Recently, Despotis, Sotiros, and Koronakos (2016a) introduced the composition paradigm in two-stage network DEA. They used a bi-objective linear programming model to estimate the efficiency scores for the individual stages, which they were composed ex post to obtain the overall system efficiency. Despotis, Sotiros, and Koronakos (2016b) extended the composition paradigm to multi-stage processes of varying complexity by employing a min-max optimization model in a multi-objective programming framework. An application of the latter approach to the assessment of the academic research activity is given in Despotis, Koronakos, and Sotiros (2015). The advantage of the composition approach is that, unlike the additive and the multiplicative decomposition methods, it provides unique and unbiased efficiency scores. The natural representation of the supply chain operations as a multistage process is indicative of the synergy of supply chain management and sustainability with network DEA, as they benefit mutually from the development of methodological tools for performance measurement. In this context, noteworthy approaches are, among others, those in Chen, Liang, and Yang (2006), Liang et al. (2006), Liang, Cook, and Zhu (2008), Chen and Yan (2011) and Yang et al. (2011), which are based on cooperative and non-cooperative game theoretic concepts and Chen, Zhu, Yu, and Noori (2012), Tajbakhsh and Hassini (2015), where sustainability practices are introduced in network DEA models.

In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of the system efficiency in two-stage processes, inspired by the “weak link” notion in supply chains and the maximum-flow/minimum- cut problem in networks. Adapting the above notion to fit the multistage processes dealt with in network DEA, we develop a max-min optimization model to estimate the stage efficiencies and the overall efficiency in a multi-objective programming setting.

The paper is organized as follows. Section two outlines the independent assessments approach, the multiplicative method (Kao & Hwang, 2008), as representative of the joint assessments approach to which we are compared and the composition approach introduced in Despotis et al. (2016b). We employ the independent assessments to estimate upper bounds for the stage efficiencies. Section three is devoted to the development and illustration of our new approach in two-stage processes of varying complexity. Conclusions are drawn in section four.

Consider the elementary case where each DMU transforms some external inputs X to final outputs Y via the intermediate measures Z with a two-stage process, as depicted in Fig. 1
                     . In this basic setting, nothing but the external inputs to the first stage enters the system and nothing but the outputs of the second stage leaves the system. This particular configuration is characterized as Type I structure in Despotis et al. (2016b).

Typically, the efficiencies of the first and the second stage of a DMU j are defined as follows:

The holistic approach requires that the efficiencies of the individual stages and the overall efficiency of the unit are estimated jointly in one program. The driver of the assessment is the overall efficiency, which is decomposed to the stage efficiencies having assumed a specific functional form that links the overall efficiency with the stage efficiencies. The multiplicative decomposition method (Kao & Hwang, 2008) and the additive decomposition method (Chen et al., 2009) are the two basic methods that materialize the holistic approach. Commonly, the efficiencies of the first and the second stage of a DMU j are defined as in (1) and they differ only in the definition of the overall efficiency. In particular, in Kao and Hwang (2008) the overall efficiency

                        . In Chen et al. (2009), the overall efficiency is defined as a weighted average of the individual efficiencies, where the weights are DMU-specific and endogenously estimated when the overall efficiency is optimized. Despotis et al. (2016a) showed that the additive decomposition method leads to biased efficiency assessments. In the present work, however, we will focus only on the multiplicative method, which is closely related to our approach. The model below estimates the stage efficiencies by optimizing the overall efficiency with respect to the multiplicative method:

Unlike the decomposition paradigm where the optimality criterion is to maximize the overall efficiency of the unit under evaluation, in the composition approach introduced in Despotis et al. (2016a), the drivers of the efficiency assessments are the stage efficiencies. The optimality criterion is to assess the stage efficiencies as close as possible to their independent (ideal) counterparts. This is accomplished by means of a bio-objective linear program, which is solved by a min-max model to derive unique stage efficiencies at a minimum un-weighted Tchebycheff distance (L
                        ∞ norm) from the corresponding independent efficiency scores. Then, the overall efficiency of the unit is derived ex post by aggregating the stage efficiencies. The assumption made for the orientations of the DEA models (output for the first stage, input for the second) secures the linearity of the models developed, however, it limits the applicability of the method to simple two-stage serial processes only.


                        Despotis et al. (2016b) extended the composition approach to general multi-stage serial processes. The generalization was made possible due to the input orientation assumed for all the stages, but at the expense of the linearity of the models.

The following bi-objective mathematical programs, which were introduced in Despotis et al. (2016b) for a simple two-stage process, are the common origin of our new approach that we will present in the next section.

Model (9) derives from (8) by applying the C–C transformation with respect to the first objective function, i.e. multiplying all the terms of the fractional objective functions and the constraints by t>0, such that

                         and setting tη = v, tω = u, tφ = w. Notice that in model (9) the second objective function is still in fractional form. In Despotis et al. (2016b), the optimal pair of stage efficiencies is a Pareto optimal solution at a minimum un-weighted Tchebycheff distance from the ideal efficiency scores. Given the optimal solution, the overall efficiency score is obtained as the ratio of the total virtual output to total virtual input. No functional form is assumed to link the overall efficiency with the stage efficiencies.

The multiplicative decomposition method outlined in the previous section estimates the overall system efficiency of the evaluated unit as the squared geometric average of the stage efficiencies. Given that

                     . This property declares that the less efficient stage is determinant of the overall system efficiency. This is a natural property that can be easily identified in multistage processes, such as in supply chains. In such a context, the less efficient stage is called the “weak link” of the supply chain. In this line of thought, Kao (2014a) states that “Efficiency decomposition enables decision makers to identify the stages that cause the inefficiency of the system, and to effectively improve the performance of the system”. However, in order to draw safe conclusions about the system efficiency, the identification of the weak link should meet two properties: (a) uniqueness and (b) being supported by a reasonable and meaningful search orientation. As mentioned in Kao and Hwang (2008), the stage efficiency scores obtained by the multiplicative method are not unique in general, i.e. different efficiency scores can be obtained for the two stages that maintain the same overall efficiency. Consequently, the weak link might be interchanged between the two stages, depending on the decomposition selected. Thus, the uniqueness property is not met by the model (7). Despotis et al. (2016b) illustrated such an example, which we will revisit below to illustrate our approach in comparison with the multiplicative method.

We define the system efficiency as the minimum of the stage efficiencies, i.e.

To conceptualize our argument, let us resort to a max flow-min cut analogue. Fig. 2
                      provides an alternative representation of the basic two-stage process, where the role of nodes and links is interchanged. The link that connects the nodes X and Z represents the first stage of the process, with the nodes X and Z representing the inputs to and the outputs from the first stage. The second link represents the second stage, whose inputs and outputs are Z and Y respectively. At the DMU level, X and Y are the external inputs and outputs respectively and Z represents the intermediate measures linking the two-stages. The labels e
                     1 and e
                     2 assigned to the links represent their capacity, that is the efficiencies of the stages. Given the stage efficiencies e
                     1 and e
                     2, the system efficiency eo
                      can be viewed as the maximum flow through the two-stage network and can be estimated as the min-cut of the network, which, in the case of the simple network of Fig. 2, is given by the minimal of the capacities of the two links, i.e.

                              o
                           
                           =

                              {
                              
                                 
                                    e
                                    1
                                 
                                 ,
                                 
                                    e
                                    2

                     .

What is left to do now is to estimate the capacities (individual efficiency scores) of the two stages in a manner that the minimal capacity (the weak link) and, thus, the overall system efficiency gets the maximum possible value. This is accomplished with the following weighted max-min formulation, which seeks to maximize the minimum weighted achievement from a zero-level efficiency:

In Despotis et al. (2016b), the two-stage processes are categorized in four types, from the elementary (type I) to the general (type IV). The type I structure is the simple two-stage process depicted in Fig. 1. We will develop our approach for this simple process and then we will escalate our models for the general type IV structure. With respect to the bi-objective mathematical program (9) introduced in Despotis et al. (2016b), the search for the individual scores of the two stages is made in two phases: Phase I locates a point on the upper-right boundary of the feasible region in the objective functions space of (9) by means of max-min model (11), which maximizes the minimal efficiency score, whereas Phase II provides a Pareto optimal solution.

Model (12) is the canonical form of the max-min model (11). The solution of a weighted max-min problem, such as model (12), is weakly Pareto optimal (see, e.g. theorem 5.7.1 in Miettinen, 1998, pp.171). At optimality, at least one of the first two constraints in (12) will be binding. Although model (12) is non-linear, it can be solved by bisection search in terms of θ in the bounded interval [0,1], since 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1 (c.f. Despotis et al. (2016b) for an analogous treatment in a min-max formulation). Let

The underlying idea in model (12) is to locate a point on the upper-right boundary of the feasible region in the objective functions space of (9), which is formed by the intersection of the boundary with a ray from the origin (0,0) to the ideal point

                        . However, as the weak Pareto is a weaker property than Pareto optimality, it is not unlikely that the solution of (12) is Pareto optimal. This depends on the shape of the boundary of the objective functions space where the Pareto front is located, on the position of the ideal point relatively to that boundary and on the weights used to drive the search, which in our case are related to the components of the ideal point. This radial search approach for obtaining the individual efficiency scores will be visualized in the illustration given below. The Phase II model below provides a Pareto optimal solution to (9). The model (13) is equivalent to employing lexicographically the L
                        1 norm on the set of optimal solutions of (12) (see, e.g. Steuer & Choo, 1983).

                        Illustration
                     

To illustrate our approach we use the synthetic case, originally presented in Despotis et al. (2016b), with 30 DMUs, two inputs (X1, X2), two intermediate measures (Z1, Z2) and two outputs (Y1, Y2) as shown in columns 1–7 of Table 1
                        . The figures in columns 8–10 are the overall and stage efficiency scores obtained by the multiplicative model (7). Columns 11–12 provide the maximal and the minimal efficiencies for the first stage that maintain the overall efficiency score, whereas columns 13–14 present the corresponding efficiencies for the second stage. They are all calculated by applying the uniqueness test proposed in Kao and Hwang (2008). The results show that the efficiency decompositions for the units 8, 13, 18, 19, 23 and 30 are not unique.

The unit 18, for example, is characterized by two extreme efficiency decompositions

                        obtained by model (7). Consequently, the identification of the weak link for unit 18 is not unique. Indeed, according to the first decomposition, the second stage is identified as the weak link, whereas the second decomposition identifies the first stage as the weak link of the process. Table 2
                         presents the results obtained by applying the proposed two –phase approach. Columns 2–3 present the independent efficiency scores of the two stages obtained from models (4) and (5). Columns 4–7 present the optimal value of θ, the efficiency scores of the two stages obtained by model (13) and the overall system efficiency, in line with the definition (10). Notice that the phase II did not alter the efficiency scores obtained in phase I, for any of the DMUs. That is, the phase I solutions are Pareto optimal.

The curve AD in Fig. 3
                        
                         depicts the Pareto front for unit 18. The coordinates of the point E(0.5046, 1) are the independent efficiency scores of the two stages. This is the ideal point in the multi-objective programming terminology. The points A(0.2378, 1) and D(0.5046, 0.4910) are the extreme points on the upper-right boundary of the feasible set in the objective functions space. The LP models that provide these two points are given in Appendix. The points B(0.3021, 0.8201) and D represent the two extreme decompositions mentioned above. The segment BD of the Pareto front depicts alternative decompositions, all maintaining the same optimal overall efficiency

                        , as shown in Table 1. Among them, D is located as an optimal solution by the multiplicative decomposition model (7).

The point C(0.3536, 0.7007), which is formed by the intersection of the dotted line OE with the Pareto front, depicts the unique Pareto optimal point obtained by model (13) (same as from model (12)). Thus, the overall system efficiency of unit 18 is

                        . This is a reasonable assumption but not necessarily restrictive. For instance, one might weight differently the two stages in model (12), if it is to give some other priority to one stage over the other. In such a case any other point on the Pareto front could be located. In a real-world application, the management might be interested to investigate the range of weights, in which the status of the stage, characterized as weak link, is preserved. Table 3
                         provides such information concerning the sensitivity of the weak link when the weights given to the two stages vary.

For each unit it is sufficient to calculate the coordinates of the two extreme points A(N
                        1, E
                        2) and D(E
                        1, N
                        2) on the Pareto front (columns 2–3 and 6–7 respectively) and the weights that drive the ray from the origin to these points (columns 4–5 and 8–9 respectively). Columns 10–11 show the ranges of the weight q
                        2, in which the status of the identified weak link for each unit is preserved. Given the ideal values E
                        1 and E
                        2, the values N
                        1 and N
                        2 are obtained by solving the models given in the Appendix. Then, the normalized weights are as follows:

                        Fig. 4 exhibits the three possible positions of the Pareto front AD with respect to the bisection line OB. The units depicted are No 15, 12 and 2. If N
                        1 > E
                        2, then the line AD lies on the right of OB and the second stage will be steadily the weak link (Fig. 4a). This is the case for units 10, 15, 24 and 26. If N
                        2 > E
                        1, then the line AD lies on the left of OB and the first stage will be steadily the weak link (Fig. 4b). This is the case for the units 3–8, 11–13 and 22. If none of the above holds, the line AD intersects with the bisection line OB and the weak-link is differentiated on the left and on the right of the intersection point (Fig. 4c). This is the case for the units 1, 2, 14, 16, 18-21, 23, 25, 27–30. The units 9 and 17 are differentiated from the others, as they achieve their ideal efficiency scores and the Pareto front degenerates to a single point.

The general two-stage process depicted in Fig. 5
                         differentiates from the elementary one in that the first stage produces some final outputs K that exit the system, beyond the intermediate measures Z, and the second stage uses some extra external inputs L.
                     

In this case, the efficiencies of the first and the second stage of DMU j are defined as follows:

This holds because, in such a case, the ray from the origin to the ideal point is the bisection line, which coincides with the search direction in the min-max sense when the un-weighted Tchebycheff distance is assumed.

Then, because the first stage has an extra output K, flowing directly out of the system, the overall efficiency of the system may be contributed by K without being stuck by the “weak link”.

                         as the overall efficiency ignores the relative advantage of the unit against its peers on L and probably underestimates the overall system efficiency. In a general two-stage process, these effects must be considered jointly, in a manner that the potential advantages-disadvantages of one stage, caused by the extra inputs L and outputs K, are transferred to the other stage. An effective way to absorb these effects in favor of the system efficiency is proposed below. Given the optimal solution

In (18), the adjusted stage efficiencies originate from the network structure depicted in Fig. 6a., which is a modification of the general two-stage process. The valued input

                         to the second stage is used as an input and, at the same time, as an output from the first stage. So, the term

                         is added to the numerator and to the denominator of the original efficiency ratio to obtain the modified efficiency score

                         of the second stage. The modified structure in Fig. 6a is an alternative, yet equivalent representation of the structure in Fig. 6b, coined by Kao (2014a) to deal with general multistage systems (the reader is referred to that work for the technicalities of the approach). In the latter, the motivation was to adjust the conventional stage efficiency scores, so as they meet the property that the system efficiency is the product of the stage efficiencies. This is accomplished by introducing the two dummy processes labeled 3 and 4, in a parallel configuration with the original stages 1 and 2 respectively.

                        . As long as the calculation of the adjusted efficiency scores are based on concepts introduced by Kao (2014a), our results are comparable to those obtained by applying his methodology (see illustration below). However, our methodology differs substantially in the optimality criterion used. Indeed, our optimality criterion is to maximize the lowest of the stage efficiencies, whereas the optimality criterion in Kao (2014a) is to maximize the overall efficiency, which, consistently to the multiplicative decomposition approach, it is defined as the ratio of the total virtual external output

As an illustration, we use the dataset given in Despotis et al. (2016b), as presented in Table 4. Table 5 presents the results obtained by applying the proposed max-min approach (columns 2–9) and, next to them, the results obtained by applying the methodology proposed in Kao (2014a) (columns 10–14).

The Fig. 7 exhibits the Pareto fronts (curves AB) of four indicative units (namely, units 1, 5, 16 and 30) shown in Table 4. The points E represent the ideal points whose coordinates are the independent efficiency scores of the two stages, whereas the points C correspond to the assessed stage efficiency scores. The points A and B, which represent the extreme points on the Pareto fronts, are obtained by solving analogous LPs to those given in the Appendix. Notice that the points C are formed by the intersection of the ray from the origin to the point E with the Pareto front.

The stage efficiency scores of the units 11, 12, 17 and 28 in Table 5 are identical to the scores given in Despotis et al. (2016b). This is justified by the fact that, for these units, the independent efficiency scores are equal to each other, as mentioned above. At this point, it is worth comparing the individual efficiency scores of unit 24 with those given in Despotis et al. (2016b). Fig. 8
                         facilitates the comparison. In the latter, the phase-I yielded the point D(0.9623, 0.8658) on the segment CD of the boundary, which is parallel to the horizontal axis. Therefore the point D is weak Pareto. Then, the phase-II provided the Pareto optimal point F(1, 0.8658) by increasing the efficiency score of the first stage. The solution obtained by model (14) for the same unit is depicted on the point B(0.9597, 0.8671), which lies on the Pareto front. So, the phase II did not alter this solution.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We introduced in this paper a novel approach to two-stage network DEA. We use a multi-objective formulation and a max-min programming technique to assess the individual stage efficiencies and the overall system efficiency, by maximizing the lowest of the stage efficiencies (weak link). The two-phase procedure that we propose provides Pareto optimal solutions and a unique point on the Pareto front in the objective functions space, i.e. unique efficiency scores for the two-stages. The search direction is driven by the assumption that the efficiency scores of the two stages are proportional to their independent counterparts. Thus, a point is located on the Pareto front along this direction by maximizing the minimum of the stage efficiency scores. Then the system efficiency is given as the minimum of the stage efficiencies. Although the above assumption is rational, it is not restrictive in our models. External priorities for the two-stages might be assumed to locate a different point on the Pareto front, i.e. different stage and overall efficiencies. A systematic investigation of the sensitivity of the weak link is also provided in order to identify adequately the source of inefficiency. An issue that needs further investigation, which is beyond the scope of this paper, is the derivation of efficient projections for the inefficient units directly from the proposed models. Our approach is developed for simple and general two-stage series processes, however, the adaptation of the models to deal with other two-stage architectures (such as those categorized as type II and type III in Despotis et al. (2016b)) is straightforward. An issue that needs further investigation and could be a subject for further research is the adaptability of the weak-link approach to general network structures involving series and parallel processes.
