                  We extend the well-known spatial competition model (d’Aspremont, Gabszewicz & Thisse, 1979) to a continuous time model in which two firms compete in each instance. Our focus is on the entry timing decisions of firms and their optimal locations. We demonstrate that the leader has an incentive to locate closer to the center to delay the follower’s entry, leading to a non-maximum differentiation outcome. We also investigate how exogenous parameters affect the leader’s location and firms’ values and, in particular, numerically show that the profit of the leader changes non-monotonically with an increase in the transport cost parameter.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Researchers in economics and marketing have emphasized the importance of (horizontal) product differentiation in the context of firm competition (e.g. Brown, 1989; d’Aspremont, Gabszewicz, & Thisse, 1979; Lancaster, 1990). When firms launch their new products into markets, timing and product characteristics are some of the important factors for their profits (e.g. Krishnan & Ulrich, 2001). Taking into account firms’ decisions regarding product differentiation, researchers theoretically and/or empirically investigate how firms determine the timing of launching their products and those characteristics (e.g. Lambertini, 1997; Thomadsen, 2007).

From the theoretical point of view, Lambertini (2002) presented pioneering work that discusses the strategic interaction between the optimal locations of the inventor (the market leader), who anticipates subsequent entry and the location choice of the follower in a Hoteling-type spatial competition model, as in d’Aspremont et al. (1979).

                        Location point is interpreted as a firm’s differentiation selection because the distance between a firm’s location point and a consumer’s address corresponds to that between a firm’s attribute and a consumer’s ideal point. This interpretation is standard in spatial economics and marketing literature.
                      He was the first to introduce a dynamic model in the sense that time is continuous, the firm locations are fixed once entry is made and that firms earn their profits in each instance. Regarding the time structure, several papers deal with sequential locational entry in a discrete time model, which allows qualitative analyses such as how many steps the timing of investment would change given a change in other parameters (e.g. Prescott & Visscher, 1977). However, a more rigorous quantitative analysis, such as determining the percentage change in the investment time attributable to a percentage change in a parameter, requires a continuous time model.

                        4
                        Continuous time models are often used in models such as real option game models that investigate the timing problem of firms’ entry without the locational context (e.g. Dixit & Pindyck, 1994, Chapter 9; Azevedo & Paxson, 2014). These studies introduce one or more probabilistic fluctuations into their models. Our model is deterministic and does not focus on this randomness, but instead, focuses on the relation between location and entry timing. The real option game approach is useful for taking into account the endogenous timing decision.
                     
                  

This novel point is from Lambertini (2002) and differs significantly from those in related theoretical papers discussing sequential location choices based on Hoteling-type spatial competition models (e.g. Götz, 2005; Neven, 1987).
                        5
                     
                     
                        5
                        Many papers discussed sequential location choices in spatial competition models. Kress and Pesch (2012) and Biscaia and Mota (2013) provided comprehensive surveys on spatial competition.
                      Those related papers are static Hoteling models in the sense that each firm has only one profit earning chance.
                        6
                     
                     
                        6
                        
                           Lambertini (1997) and Meza and Tombak (2009) considered the endogenous timing of locations in such static Hoteling models.
                      
                     Lambertini (2002) considered two scenarios: (i) the follower’s timing of entry is exogenous and (ii) the follower’s timing of entry is probabilistically determined. Therefore, the follower does not endogenously determine its optimal timing of entry in either scenario. To summarize, Lambertini (2002) considered a continuous time model, but an endogenous entry timing model with continuous time has not been considered in locational models. Because the entry timing of followers significantly influences market leaders as well as followers (Kalyanaram, Robinson, & Urban, 1995; Vakratsas, Rao, & Kalyanaram, 2003), we need to overcome the weakness in the model given by Lambertini (2002) and endogenize the follower’s entry-timing decision. Therefore, our paper substantially extends the model of Lambertini (2002).

We incorporate several aspects into the standard Hoteling duopoly model in d’Aspremont et al. (1979). The time horizon is infinite, as in Lambertini (2002). Each firm sets a price and earns a profit in each instance if it exists in the market, implying that a delay of entry causes a loss of profit opportunity. In anticipation of subsequent entry by the follower, the market leader initially sets its location. Because the leader’s location decision influences the profits of the follower, it also affects the timing of the entry (the length of the monopoly period), thus representing an additional value of our paper. After the location choice of the market leader, the follower determines the timing of entry and its location. When the follower enters the market, it incurs an investment cost that exponentially decreases with the standard discount rate. In contrast, consumer size increases with a growth rate lower than the discount rate. By balancing the benefit and cost of staying outside, the follower determines its entry timing and location. We also note that this formulation is suitable for perishable goods as consumers repeatedly purchase the good.
                        7
                     
                     
                        7
                        Perishable goods are defined as non-durable goods that last only for each infinitesimal instance of time. We will mention this point further in Discussion and concluding remarks.
                     
                  

Compared with Lambertini (2002), our contributions in this paper are threefold. The first contribution is that we endogenize the follower’s timing. The second contribution follows the first, as we introduce investment costs and a growth rate in consumer size to make the model more realistic. In addition, the growth rate ensures that the entry occurs within a finite time
                        8
                     
                     
                        8
                        This phenomenon implies that just introducing a timing endogeneity into Lambertini (2002) without a growth rate yields no entry and a perpetual monopoly by the leader.
                      and, in turn, affects the leader’s location. The third contribution is a strategic interaction between the leader’s location and the follower’s entry timing. In addition to the effects considered by Lambertini (2002), the leader’s moving closer to the center increases the follower’s incentive to delay its entry, prolonging the monopoly regime. Thus, by endogenizing the follower’s timing, the leader has a stronger incentive to move closer to the central point. Although this strategic interaction among the leader’s location, the follower’s location and its entry timing is an important aspect of this problem, Lambertini (2002) does not take into account this strategic interaction because of his assumption of an exogenous entry timing by the follower.

We also show that the follower always chooses to maximize the distance between the firms whereas the leader has an incentive to locate closer to the center to delay the follower’s entry, possibly leading to a non-maximum differentiation outcome. Furthermore, the location interval between the leader and the follower is negatively correlated with the length of time for which the follower stays outside. These results are similar to those in Lambertini (2002), although the mechanism behind these results definitely differs between the two papers.

Finally, we show that the entry timing becomes earlier as the growth rate of consumer size or the parameter of consumer transport cost increases, and becomes later as the discount rate increases. We numerically investigate how those exogenous parameters influence their profits. A notable result is that the profit of the market leader non-monotonically changes with an increase in the consumer transport cost parameter.

                        9
                        The transport cost parameter can be interpreted as a parameter that describes the level of product differentiation because the cost parameter corresponds to a consumer’s disutility between the consumer’s ideal point and the degree of a product’s attribute. This interpretation is standard in the literature on spatial economics and marketing.
                     
                  

Two firms, i ∈ {1, 2}, produce homogeneous goods. Consumers are uniformly distributed over the unit segment [0, 1] as proposed by Hoteling (1929).

                      Each consumer at point x ∈ [0, 1] repeatedly purchases at each instance

                      whereas firm 2 is the follower who enters at time T
                     2, to be subsequently and endogenously determined. In this way, firm 1 decides x
                     1 at time

                      once and subsequently chooses price p
                     1t
                      at each time t. After observing firm 1’s actions before firm 2’s entry, firm 2 chooses to enter at time T
                     2 and location x
                     2 and thereafter chooses p
                     2t
                      at each time t. Firm i can choose its location only when it makes its entry in the project, at which time it incurs an entry cost Fi
                     (Ti
                     ). We also assume (without loss of generality) that x
                     1 ≤ 1/2 holds in equilibrium.

Now, let us describe the present value of the firms at time 0 given that firm 2 would enter at point x
                     2 at time

                     . Note that firm 1 enters at point x
                     1 at time 
                        
                           t

                     . The timing is exogenous

                        A similar interpretation is made in Chronopoulos, De Reyck, and Siddiqui (2014) as a non-preemptive duopoly. In their paper, the roles of the leader and the follower are defined exogenously. Consequently, the future cash flows of the leader are discounted to time

                        We can interpret α as the increasing rate of consumer population. Let N denote the population of consumers at time 0. Then, the population at time t is Neαt
                           . In our model, we normalize 
                              
                                 N

                           . Therefore, our interpretation of α being the market growth rate is equivalent to this population interpretation. It is typical to consider population in the standard Hoteling setting. Since Malthus (1798)’s famous argument, academic scholars often set assumptions that the sizes of population and/or market grow exponentially. The validity of exponential market growth is noted in many industries, for example, Lages and Fernandes (2005) on telecommunication services, Victor and Ausubel (2002) on DRAM, and Vakratsas and Kolsarici (2008) on pharmaceuticals.

                     Assumption 2 (ii) suggests that F
                     1 is small enough that the leader can earn non-negative total profit at time 0 whenever the follower enters and wherever the follower locates. Similarly, Assumption 2(iii) suggests that F
                     2 is sufficiently large enough so that it is optimal for the follower to enter sequentially at T
                     2 > 0 in an equilibrium, because we would like to avoid simultaneous entry at time 0 and focus on sequential entry.

                        If simultaneous entry occurs, this model reverts to the standard location–price model of d’Aspremont et al. (1979).
                      This assumption also implies that the leader, but not the follower, has already learned how to enter the market efficiently.

In this section, we derive the price, location and timing outcomes in the subgame perfect equilibrium. First, given locations x
                     1 and x
                     2, we consider the problem of prices at each time t before and after the entry of firm 2. Then, we derive the local profits of the leader and the follower at each time t.

The following are the equilibrium prices. Notably, the maximization of the instantaneous profit flows is equivalent to the maximization of the total profits. In other words, firm 1 maximizes the following equation with respect to p
                     1t

From Lemma 2, we show that the follower always locates as far away from the location of the leader as possible when entering the market. This result replicates that of Lambertini (2002) and seems to be robust to the endogeneity of the follower’s entry timing. Substituting the equilibrium profits and the location of the follower into the total profit functions V

The following corollaries show the change in the follower’s entry timing as the leader’s location x
                        1 and the exogenous parameters change.

                           Corollary 1
                           
                              If x
                              1 
                              is increased, the optimal timing for the follower to enter is delayed.
                           


                        x
                        1 affects the entry timing of the follower as follows. Only the denominator within the fraction inside the log in Eq. (17) is composed of the locations chosen by the firms. Thus, we focus on this part of the equation, namely, 
                           
                              
                                 π
                                 2
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    x
                                    1
                                 
                                 ,
                                 1
                                 )
                              
                           
                        . When firm 1 locates away from firm 2 (or x
                        1 is decreased), firm 2 can deliver the product in a broader region (
                           
                              x
                              ¯
                           
                         decreases), and firm 2 can earn a higher profit (
                           
                              π
                              2
                              D
                           
                         increases). Therefore, firm 2 enters earlier (later) if firm 1 locates away from (closer to) firm 2.

                           Corollary 2
                           
                              If F
                              2 
                              or r is increased, or as c or α is decreased, the optimal timing for the follower to enter is delayed.
                           

As is seen in the next subsection, x
                        1 depends on the previous parameters. Therefore, a change in these parameters affects the entry timing of the follower through a direct effect (Corollary 2) and an indirect effect (Corollary 1).

Finally, we consider the problem of the leader. Substituting the outcomes of the follower, Lemma 2 and Proposition 1 into the total profit function of the leader, the maximization problem of the leader is given by

The sign of Eq. (21) is the key and determines the location of the leader: whether it is located at the center (1/2), edge (0), or an interior point (strictly between 0 and 1/2). The first term of Eq. (21) represents the gain from the delay of entry by firm 2 that is caused by an increase in x
                        1, allowing firm 1 to maintain its monopoly profit before the duopoly regime begins. This term is not present in Lambertini (2002) and captures the essence behind our results. Therefore, if this term turns out to be large, our result may become significantly different from that of Lambertini (2002). The second term of Eq. (21) signifies the increase in the monopoly profit attributable to moving closer to the center. The third term of Eq. (21) shows how the duopoly profit decreases as firm 1 moves closer to firm 2, thus intensifying competition.

                           Although T
                              2 is not endogenized, the second and third terms describe how Lambertini (2002) determined the leader’s location.
                         The first two terms are positive and the last term is negative. Thus, if the effect of the last term is relatively small, the optimal location of firm 1 is 1/2.

We now investigate the effect of each parameter on the equilibrium location of firm 1, which we denote as

As α approaches r, the weight on the periods after which firm 2 enters the market gets larger. Therefore, firm 1 needs to take into account profitability under the duopoly situation. The significance of the last term dominates that of the other two terms, which implies that the optimal location of firm 1 is 
                           
                              
                                 x

                              0
                           
                        . In contrast, if α becomes smaller, the converse holds. Since V
                        1 is continuous with respect to α, there always exists some level of α that leads to an interior solution for x
                        1. Meanwhile, the effect of parameter r is essentially the opposite of that of α.

Parameter 
                           
                              u

                         appears only in the first term, which is increasing in

                        . As the location of firm 1 becomes closer to the center, the leader obtains the monopoly profit for a longer time because the follower’s timing of entry is delayed from Corollary 1. An increase in 
                           
                              u

                         yields a stronger incentive to obtain this profit. Thus, as 
                           
                              u

Regarding F

                         in that an increase in F
                        2 or a decrease in c increases 
                           
                              
                                 T

                        . Thus, the effects of these two parameters counter each other. Note that the term

                         is independent of c or F
                        2. From Corollary 2, increasing F
                        2 delays the entry of the follower (increasing

                        ), and F
                        2 does not affect Eq. (21) in other ways. The discounted present value of the increase in profit from a longer monopoly regime attributable to firm 1 locating closer to the center is decreased. Thus, the first term is decreasing in F
                        2. The second term is increasing in F
                        2 because the increase in the monopoly profit for firm 1 from its moving closer to the center is sustained longer due to the entry delay. Similarly, the third term is also increasing in F
                        2, as the decrease in the duopoly profit for firm 1 from its moving closer to the center is devalued from the entry delay. These three effects are complicated, and none of them are analytically dominant. We numerically examine this issue in the next section.

The effect of parameter c counters that of F
                        2 with respect to how they affect 
                           
                              
                                 T

                              2
                           
                        . In addition, c enters in all the profit levels. Namely, c has two contrasting effects on the profit of firm 1. First, the monopoly profit of firm 1 is decreasing in c. When the firm supplies to all consumers, it needs to compensate consumers for transport costs by lowering its monopoly price. The compensation is higher as the consumer transport cost parameter increases. Second, the parameter c is positively related to the duopoly profit of firm 1 as in the standard Hoteling model with price competition. The effect of the first term is lower as the parameter c increases, whereas those of the second and third terms are higher. Therefore, the relative importance of the three terms influences the effect of c on the location choice of firm 1. Unlike the previous argument, this effect depends on the parameters α and r. We apply the previous argument regarding α to the effect of parameter c on the optimal location of firm 1. If α approaches r, the significance of the last term dominates that of the second term, which implies that the optimal location of firm 1 is more likely to become

                         as c increases. In contrast, if α becomes smaller, the significance of the second term dominates the last, which implies that the optimal location of firm 1 is more likely to become

                         as c increases. If r is sufficiently large, for example

                        Proposition 3 shows that three types of equilibrium location for the leader can emerge. Similar to Lambertini (2002), we show that firm 1 can locate at 0, 0.5 or an interior location depending on the parameter values. However, a case exists in which the introduction of endogenous entry timing leads to different equilibrium location outcomes compared with Lambertini (2002) using the same parameter values. To grasp the intuition behind this result, we proceed with a numerical analysis in the next section.

In this section, we investigate in detail the underlying properties of our model using numerical analysis. First, we investigate the effects of the key parameters, α, c and F
                     2, on firm 1’s equilibrium location, which we denote as 
                        
                           
                              x

                              ,
                              
                                 x
                                 1
                                 
                                    *
                                    *

                              }
                           
                        
                     . In particular, focusing on the equilibrium-path behavior, we illustrate that all three types of equilibrium location patterns actually exist. Then, we show the importance of the endogeneity of T
                     2, namely the first term of Eq. (21). Finally, we examine the effects of the parameters on the total values of the firms in equilibrium.

This subsection examines the effects of parameters (α, c, F
                        2) on the equilibrium location of the leader.

First, let us consider the effect of α on 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                        . Let us set the parameters as 
                           
                              r
                              =
                              0.1
                              ,
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯
                              
                              =
                              4
                           
                         and 
                           
                              c
                              =
                              1
                           
                        . We use three tables to illustrate the relationship between α and the equilibrium location for the leader. F
                        2 is set at 20, 50 and 100 for Tables 1–3, respectively.
                           18
                        
                        
                           18
                           We use these parameter values since they provide the best illustration for the interior (not 0 or 1/2) equilibrium location for firm 1.
                         The values of α are incremented by one ten-thousandth. As explained in Proposition 2, we pointed out that the location 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         moves from 1/2 to 0 as α approaches r. We confirm this result from all three tables.
                        
                        
                     

Additionally, we investigate the effects of F
                        2 on 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         when α approaches r. 
                           
                              α
                              ¯
                           
                         denotes the lowest value for which the equilibrium 
                           
                              x
                              1

                         is 0, and 
                           α
                         denotes the highest value for which the equilibrium 
                           
                              x

                              E
                           
                         is 1/2. Tables 1–3 imply that both 
                           
                              α
                              ¯
                           
                         and 
                           α
                         are increasing in F
                        2. This implication is consistent with the intuition offered in the previous section. In addition, the range of the interior location, 
                           
                              
                                 α
                                 ¯
                              
                              −
                              
                                 α
                                 ̲
                              
                              ,
                           
                         is increasing in F
                        2. Therefore, as F
                        2 increases, the equilibrium location is likely to become interior or 1/2 and not 0.
                           19

                           These examples may illustrate that the range of α that leads to an interior location for firm 1 is rather small. However, our purpose in using these examples is to show that this range actually does exist and that the range of α that leads to locating away from 0, the edge of the market, is large.
                        
                     

Second, we investigate the effect of c on the equilibrium location of the leader. Fig. 1
                         illustrates the equilibrium location of firm 1 for different values of c when 
                           
                              
                                 F
                                 2
                              
                              =
                              20
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 F
                                 2
                              
                              =
                              13
                           
                        . Consider the case in which an interior solution can exist. An interior solution exists when α approaches r. We consider the same values as in the previous numerical analysis; 
                           
                              r

                              0.1
                              ,
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.096
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯

                              4
                           
                        . As

                              c
                              ,
                           
                         
                        c ∈ (0, 4/3). When 
                           
                              
                                 F
                                 2
                              
                              =
                              20
                              ,
                           
                         the value of 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         declines from 1/2 to approximately 1/10 as c increases. In this case, firm 1 never locates at point 0. When 
                           
                              
                                 F
                                 2
                              
                              =
                              13
                              ,
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              x

                              E
                           
                         moves from 1/2 to 0 as c increases. Fig. 1 demonstrates the following concept. If the interior solution exists in the equilibrium, 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         is decreasing in c. As F
                        2 increases, 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         is more likely to take a higher value for a given c.

Third, we show the effects of both c and F
                        2 on the equilibrium location of the leader. Tables 4
                         and 5
                         illustrate the equilibrium location of firm 1 for different values of c and F
                        2 when 
                           
                              r
                              =
                              0.1
                              ,
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯
                              
                              =
                              4
                           
                         and 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.098
                           
                         for Table 4 and 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.097
                           
                         for Table 5. For these values of r and 
                           
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯
                              
                              ,
                           
                         these values of α allow interior solutions of x
                        1. Thus, for α very close to r, at approximately 0.099, we primarily have 
                           
                              
                                 x
                                 1
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ; however, for most values of α, we tend to have the other corner solution at 
                           
                              
                                 x
                                 1
                              
                              =
                              1
                              /
                              2
                           
                        .

By examining the interior solutions, we can better understand the effects of c and F
                        2. Values of c increase by 0.1 up to 1.3, as 
                           
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯
                              
                              >
                              3
                              c
                              ,
                           
                         
                        c ∈ (0, 4/3). F
                        2 is increased from 10 to 200 in increments of 10. Both tables show two trends. As c increases, if an interior solution exists in the equilibrium, 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         decreases. As F
                        2 increases, 
                           
                              x
                              1
                              E
                           
                         increases if the interior solution exists in the equilibrium. As noted in the previous section, the effects of these two parameters tend to counter each other.

Finally, we have summarized how the parameters affect the equilibrium locations for the firms in Table 6. Note that this result is obtained under the parameter values in this section and depends on the magnitudes of parameters, in particular r and α.

One of the main points of this paper in contrast to previous papers, including Lambertini (2002), is that the follower’s entry timing is endogenized and the leader determines its location considering this move. To determine its importance, we examine the relative sizes of the three terms in Eq. (21). Eq. (21) is the first-order derivative of V
                        1 with respect to x
                        1. The first term represents how the marginal change in the leader’s location delays the follower’s entry, allowing the leader to prolong its monopoly regime.

Using the parameters and the leader’s location x
                        1 in Table 2, we derive concrete values of Eq. (21) in four cases. The common parameter values are 
                           
                              r
                              =

                        . The result is summarized in Table 7.

The sum column in Table 7 indicates how firm 1 decides its location. If the value in the column is negative (positive), then firm 1 locates at 0 (0.5). If it is 0, an interior location between 0 and 0.5 may arise.

                           20
                           The first and third terms in Table 7 change in a non-monotonic manner with respect to α. This is because 
                                 
                                    x
                                    1

                               is confined to be at 0 when the sum at the rightmost column is negative and at 0.5 when it is positive. When the sum is zero and 
                                 
                                    x
                                    1
                                    E
                                 
                               is strictly between 0 and 0.5, the terms move in a monotonic manner with respect to α.
                        
                     

The last four rows in Table 7 are interesting. If the first term is not present, the sum will be negative, and firm 1 has an incentive to move closer to 0. Therefore, compared with Lambertini (2002), firm 1 is more likely to locate closer to the center, forcing firm 2 to delay its entry. This effect of delaying entry does not exist in Lambertini (2002).

Finally,
                         from the firms’ point of view, their total values are more or at least as important as their entry timing and locations. We examine how the parameters 
                           
                              u
                              ¯
                           
                         and c, commonly used in the Hoteling settings, affect firm values. The result for 
                           
                              u
                              ¯
                           
                         is straightforward, but that for c is more complicated.

An increase in 
                           
                              u
                              ¯
                           
                         improves the leader’s value and possibly worsens the follower’s value. 
                           
                              u
                              ¯
                           
                         only appears in the monopoly profit phase of the leader. As it increases, firm 1 has more incentive to move closer to the center, giving firm 2 an incentive to delay its entry if the leader has not already located at the center. Because there is only one effect to be considered, the result is simple.

Examining the impact of the change in c on the values of the leader and follower requires greater care. We set the parameters as 
                           
                              r
                              =

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 u
                                 ¯
                              
                              =
                              4
                           
                        . Fig. 2
                         demonstrates that the value of the follower is monotonically increasing in c whereas that of the leader does not move monotonically. In a Hoteling setting, transport cost c can be interpreted as the degree of product differentiation. A larger c indicates a greater degree of product differentiation.

In our model, if c increases, the follower always enjoys a positive effect on its total profit, which is not always true for the leader because the effects of an increase in c are classified into three categories: (i) a decrease in T
                        2, (ii) a decrease in

                         and (iii) an increase in 
                           
                              π

                        . In other words, as product space becomes more differentiated, (i) the follower enters earlier, (ii) the monopoly profit decreases and (iii) the duopoly profits after entry increase. The follower only faces (i) and (iii), which are both positive effects for the follower, yielding that V
                        2 is increasing in c. However, effects (i) and (ii) are negative for the leader, whereas effect (iii) is positive. As c increases, (ii) and (iii), presented by

                         respectively, are linearly changed whereas (i), presented by

                         decreases proportionally to 
                           
                              −
                              log
                              c
                           
                        . Thus, when c is close to zero, the effect (i) dominates (iii), and V
                        1 is decreasing in c. When c is relatively large, effect (i) is small, effect (iii) dominates (i) and (ii) and V
                        1 is increasing in c.

In the usual static Hoteling game, only effect (iii) exists, yielding that greater differentiation on a product space always enlarges the values of duopoly firms. This result is well known in the related literature. However, in our dynamic Hoteling game, greater differentiation in a product space may not benefit both firms, thus indicating the importance of introducing timing into the consideration.

In this paper, we develop a duopoly model that determines the follower’s entry timing, firms’ locations and their prices. Examining the timing of investments is important when considering firms’ entry strategies. Hence, we extend Lambertini (2002), which in turn extends the location-price competition model (d’Aspremont et al., 1979) by using a continuous time model in which firms earn profits in each instance and the follower’s entry timing is given exogenously. Our model endogenizes the follower’s entry timing. In doing so, we introduce parameters such as investment costs and a market growth rate to make the model and the outcome more realistic.

We find that these changes create a strategic interaction between the leader’s location and the follower’s entry timing. As a result, the leader has greater incentive to locate closer to the center to delay the follower’s entry. We also find that the follower always locates as far away as possible from the leader, which is a robust result also seen in Lambertini (2002). Numerical analyses are also presented that investigate how the exogenous parameters affect the leader’s location and the firms’ values. In particular, the profit of the leader changes non-monotonically with an increase in the transport cost parameter.

Our paper might be complementary to the finding in Thomadsen (2007) who computationally investigates the location strategies of McDonald’s and Burger King in the United States and shows that the quality and cost advantages induce the advantageous firm (McDonald’s) to locate around the center and the disadvantageous firm (Burger King) to locate between the center and the market edge in a linear city. These results seem consistent with those in our paper. This means that our paper shows another route to derive the above asymmetric locations in the sense that the first-mover advantage in a dynamic setting is also an important factor of positioning strategies.

Another empirical finding by Thomadsen (2007) is that the distance between the two firms increases as the market area is widened. As shown in Fig. 1 and Tables 4 and 5, our result indicates that the distance between two firms increases as transportation cost c increases. In our model, we normalize the market to length 1, which implies the magnitude of c corresponds to market area, because it signifies the difficulty for consumers to purchase away from their locations. Thus, these results are consistent with each other.

We believe that our setting can be applied to the situations where consumers repeatedly purchase the product, the market is growing and the products are horizontally differentiated. The fast food industry is one of these situations. Leibsohn (2007, p. 46) graphically summarizes the change in the number of McDonald’s outlets in the United States. Fig. 3 in his paper shows that the number of its outlets gradually increases. This steady growth of entry implies that the size of the fast food market has gradually grown and that our model prediction would be applicable to this market where products are geographically and/or characteristically differentiated.

                           21
                           
                              Toivanen and Waterson (2005) also empirically investigate the entry strategies of McDonald’s and Burger King in the UK market where the number of those outlets gradually increased in the period of 1991–1995 (Table 2 in their paper).
                         Other industries that are applicable to our model include telecommunications and pharmaceuticals.
                           22
                        
                        
                           22
                           These industries have products that are often treated as horizontally differentiated in related researches (see, e.g., Brekke, Königbauer, & Straume, 2007; Foros & Hansen, 2001). Pharmaceutical companies are able to horizontally differentiate their products along two dimensions: indications and side-effects, that is, efficacy and safety (Ethiraj & Zhu, 2008). Products of internet service providers can be differentiated among them through including some products, e.g. Cable-TV by cable-TV-access suppliers, a subsidy of telephone service by telephone providers, and so on (Foros & Hansen, 2001). The growth of market size is discussed in Footnote 14.
                        
                     

There are four potential future studies. The first addresses the result for which the relationship between the firm values and the transport cost parameter c is nontrivial. c can be interpreted as a parameter that describes the degree of product differentiation. Therefore, c is important for firms and their marketing strategies, necessitating its careful estimation.

Second, we can also consider a second mover advantage in a sense that the follower enjoys benefit from delaying entry. One way this occurs is through the change in the product quality of the follower, allowing the follower to produce a higher quality product as emphasized in Ethiraj and Zhu (2008).
                           23
                        
                        
                           23
                           They empirically investigate how entry timing of followers (imitators) and horizontal/vertical product differentiation among products influence the relative profit levels of the first mover (the innovator) and the followers, and show a positive relationship between delaying entry (imitation time lag) and the likelihood of which the followers gain higher profits than the first mover. They also show that the first mover keeps its higher profitability under higher horizontal differentiation.
                         Because the quality difference between firms directly influences their location strategies even in a Hoteling model with one period profit opportunity (e.g., Matsumura & Matsushima, 2009; Ziss, 1993), the increase in quality due to entry delay must affect the outcomes in our paper. Another direction of the second mover advantage is technological improvement, letting the follower to adopt the current level of technology with a lower entry cost. This point is considered in the fields of real option and economics as a problem of technology adoption when constructing a continuous time model.
                           24
                        
                        
                           24
                           For a very simple extension of our model with technological improvement, see the Appendix.
                        
                     

Third, one may consider extending our model by incorporating more than two firms. As shown in previous researches (see, for instance, Brenner, 2005, Fig. 2 on p. 860), when three firms exist, all the firms locate within the linear city in the static setting. This means that the leader’s location strategy depends on the number of subsequent firms. We would guess that the leader locates at the center in the three firms case because one of the firms locates at the center in equilibrium in this static case.

The fourth issue, which is theoretically important to consider, is making the entry timing fully endogenous. In this paper, we allow the follower to enter endogenously; however, the game starts when the leader enters at 
                           
                              T
                              =
                              0
                              ,
                           
                         thus exogenously. This setting is intentional in order to compare our results to Lambertini (2002). However, we may allow the leader to endogenously enter and, more interestingly, allow a preemption by the firms to enable full analysis of the endogenous entry timing model, as indicated by Fudenberg and Tirole (1985). These are the extensions that are worth considering for future research.

 

The duopoly result is a straightforward maximization of profit by the two firms, as previously stated. See, for example, d’Aspremont et al. (1979).

As for a monopoly, firm 1 is located at or to the left of 1/2, which we denote as x
                        1. Firm 1 sets up its price so that the consumer at 1 or at a point to the left of 1 is indifferent between purchasing and not purchasing. That is, the consumer at 1 has no surplus, as otherwise firm 1 has an incentive to increase its price without losing any of its consumers. Let this indifferent consumer be denoted 
                           
                              x

Finally, we must show that the monopoly and duopoly results are sensitive to time only with respect to the entry timing. We show in three steps that this point holds.

First, after the follower enters the market (at a given T
                        2), the corresponding profits are independent of time t. That is, firm 1 maximizes the following with respect to p

                        Therefore, the profit maximization problem corresponds to the maximization of the integrand. Therefore, firm 1 achieves the monopoly instantaneous profit flow as previously given.

Hence, we show that the maximization of the instantaneous profit flows is equivalent to the maximization of total profits.

                        and thus the second term is also finite. The third term has the numerator equal to 1 and the denominator approaching 0. Thus, this term determines the sign of the whole equation and is negative. Hence, ∂V

                         in the first term is unaffected here.) The first and last terms approach 0. The second term does not, and is positive. Hence ∂V
                        1/∂x
                        1 is positive, making the optimal location for firm 1 to be 1/2.

                        1/∂x
                        1 is equal to 0. In this case, it is optimal for firm 1 to locate strictly inside 0 and 1/2.

In order to investigate the effect of a technological improvement on Proposition 1 (the timing of the follower), we examine the following modified model:

If the fixed cost of the follower decreases as market time increases, the value of the follower V
