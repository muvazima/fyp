                  This paper analyses farming efficiency by the means of the partial frontiers and Multi-Directional Efficiency Analysis (MEA). In particular, we apply the idea of the conditional efficiency framework to the MEA approach to ensure that observations are compared to their homogeneous counterparts. Moreover, this paper shows that combining the traditional one-directional and multi-directional efficiency framework yields valuable insights. It allows one to identify what factors matter in terms of output production and input consumption. The application deals with Lithuanian family farms, for which we have a rich dataset. The results indicate that the output efficiency positively correlates to a time trend and negatively to the subsidy share in the total output. The MEA-based analysis further suggests that the time trend has been positively affecting the productive efficiency due to increase in the labour use efficiency. Meanwhile, the increasing subsidy rate has a negative influence upon MEA efficiencies associated with all the inputs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since Farrell (1957) developed the idea of relative efficiency measurement, we can distinguish two broad approaches to measure efficiency. First, parametric methods do require the a priori specification of a representation
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Primal representations of the production technology include production function and distance functions, among others. Dual representations of the production technology include the cost function, the profit function and the revenue function.
                      of the production technology, which is often unknown. Therefore, they can easily lead to specification errors (Yatchew, 1998). On the other hand, non-parametric methods do not require any assumptions on the functional form of the representations of the production technology. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA; Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978) can be given as a typical non-parametric frontier method. However, being a deterministic method in its nature, it does not account for random errors. Particularly this random variation is likely to occur in the context of farm efficiency analysis due to measurement errors, fluctuations related to operation environment, etc.

A partial frontier approach addresses these shortcomings. The partial frontiers (also referred to as the robust frontiers) are introduced by Cazals, Florens, and Simar (2002). The idea is to benchmark an observation not against all the observations dominating it but rather against a randomly drawn sample of these. The latter methodology has been extended by introducing the conditional measures enabling to analyse the influence of the environmental variables on the efficiency scores (Daraio & Simar, 2005, 2007a, 2007b).

The traditional Farrell's and Shepard's efficiency measures define a proportional contraction (resp. expansion) of inputs (resp. outputs). In many settings, including agriculture, the output-oriented direction is insightful as it reveals the output gap for given input levels. It can be used for benchmarking purposes as well as for policy insights in the potential improvements. Nevertheless, information on the potential input reductions or output expansions yields only partial insights due to three reasons. First, it considers proportional contractions or expansions.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        However, it is possible to employ the subvector approach based upon the radial measures to obtain non-radial efficiencies (Färe et al., 1994). Indeed, we will follow this approach to a certain extent when employing the Multi-directional Efficiency Analysis.
                      In many settings, including agriculture, it is particularly interesting to obtain insights on the potential reduction of each input variable separately. The proportional contractions for all inputs hide too much information such that it is less useful for farmers and policy makers. Second, a decomposition of the (aggregate) efficiency scores into the input-specific efficiency scores would enable one to identify the sources of (in)efficiency, i.e. the inputs correlating to an overall decrease in productivity and efficiency. Third, for many observations it is not relevant to be benchmarked against any other observation as external variation might influence the input–output ratio. Indeed, it is more relevant to be benchmarked against context-specific ideal points, which operate in a similar operational environment.

A technique which allows us to deal with those issues is Multi-directional Efficiency Analysis (MEA, Bogetoft & Hougaard, 1999). The latter methodology has been employed to analyse productive efficiency across various sectors, namely health care, banking, and energy (Asmild & Matthews, 2012; Asmild & Pastor, 2010; Wang, Wei, & Zhang, 2013).

In this paper we will combine the traditional measures to estimate relative efficiency with multi-directional efficiency. We show that this allows us to identify factors of efficiency along with the sources relaying the impact of these factors. This yields valuable and complementary insights for the evaluated observations, policy makers and researchers.

The economic crisis stressed the importance to look for efficiency gains in the agricultural sector. As it is the case in all Central and East European (CEE) countries, the agricultural sector constitutes an important part of the Lithuanian economy. Eurostat (2014) reports that the share of the gross domestic product (GDP) generated in the latter sector decreased from 4 per cent in 2004 down to 2.3 per cent in 2009; however it rebounded to 3.2 per cent in 2011 (in current prices). To compare, the respective figures for the 27 European Union (EU) Member States (EU27) are 1.8 per cent, 1.3 per cent, and 1.5 per cent. As for the “old” EU Member States (EU15), these figures are even lower, viz. 1.6 per cent, 1.2 per cent, and 1.3 per cent. The same pattern is revealed by considering the structure of employment: the share of employees working the agricultural sector is 15 per cent back in 2004, whereas it subsequently decreased to 8.3 per cent in 2008 and further down to 7.7 per cent in 2011. Meanwhile, the EU27 featured the shares of 5.8 per cent, 5 per cent, and 4.9 per cent, respectively. Considering the EU15, the corresponding figures are 3.2 per cent, 2.8 per cent, and 2.8 per cent. Thus, the Lithuanian agricultural sector still plays a relatively more important role in the Lithuanian economy as opposed to the economically advanced EU Member States. Even though the outcomes of the economic transition are evident, agriculture remains an economically and socially important activity in Lithuania.

In addition, the Lithuanian agricultural sector faces certain transformations due to the historical context prevailing in the CEE countries. Specifically, the collectivisation and de-collectivisation rendered distortions of the factor markets, which, in turn, have been shaping farmers’ decisions to a certain extent. Another important factor of the agricultural development in Lithuania is the European integration processes. Lithuania acceded to the EU in 2004 and thus adjusted its agricultural policy in the lines of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). As a result, the farm structure has been changing in terms of both land area and farming type. The aforementioned circumstances stress the need for researches into efficiency of the Lithuanian farms. In particular, these studies should identify the main reasons of inefficiency and possible paths for development. From an empirical perspective, this paper paves the road to do so.

This is not the first paper to analyse agricultural efficiency in CEE countries. Gorton and Davidova (2004) presented a survey of the relevant studies. Thiele and Brodersen (1999) used data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyse the underlying differences in efficiency as regards East German and West German farms. Brümmer (2001) employed DEA and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to analyse the efficiency of Slovenian farms. Brümmer, Glauben, and Thijssen (2002) utilised SFA to analyse the changes in total factor productivity in dairy farms across Germany, Poland and the Netherlands. Bezlepkina and Oude Lansik (2006) utilised DEA in a two-stage framework to analyse the impact of financial indicators upon technical efficiency in Russian farms. Later on, Bojnec and Latruffe (2011, 2013) analysed the relationships between size and efficiency of Slovenian farms. Bojnec and Fertő (2013) employed SFA to analyse the relationships between efficiency and off-farm income. Latruffe, Balcombe, Davidova, and Zawalinska (2004, 2005) employed the bootstrapped DEA along with the SFA to estimate the efficiency of Polish farms. Balcombe, Davidova, and Latruffe (2008) analysed the determinants of the total factor productivity change in Polish farms. Davidova and Latruffe (2007) related the Czech farm efficiency to the financial indicators. Latruffe, Davidova, and Balcombe (2008) utilised the double bootstrapping methodology to assess the Czech farm efficiency. Chaplin, Davidova, and Gorton (2004) analysed the efficiency of Polish, Czech, and Hungarian farms. Latruffe, Fogarasi, and Desjeux (2012) compared the Hungarian and French farm performance by the means of DEA and meta-frontier approach. Baležentis and Kriščiukaitienė (2013) analysed the determinants of Lithuanian family farms’ efficiency by the means of the Tobit model, whereas Baležentis, Kriščiukaitienė, and Baležentis (2014) employed the bootstrapped DEA and the non-parametric regression for the latter purpose. Fousekis, Kourtesi, and Polymeros (2014) utilised the conditional framework to analyse the performance of Greek olive farms.

This paper exhibits certain noteworthy methodological and empirical features. From a methodological perspective it extends the MEA-model to include the operational environment. We do so by limiting the MEA reference observations to observations which have similar characteristics, as determined by a nonparametric multidimensional kernel specification. Second, this paper provides a framework to juxtapose the traditional one-directional efficiency estimations with multi-directional efficiency estimations. We show that a combination of the two approaches yields complimentary and valuable insights. Third, we examine the variables that correlate to agricultural efficiency in Lithuania. Given the economic crisis, the relatively high share of agriculture in GDP and call for efficiency gains within the European Common Agricultural Policy, insights in the drivers of efficiency are important for policy makers. The application makes use of rich farm-level data coming from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics, 2010).

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the frontier methods, viz. order-m and MEA measures along with their conditional extensions. Section 3 presents the data used for benchmarking. The results are discussed in Section 4. The article concludes with policy advice and general remarks.

In empirical studies, the ‘true’ set T and hence the efficiency scores are unknown. We only observe a random sample of the decision making units (DMUs), χK
                         = {(xk, yk
                        )|k = 1, 2, ..., K}. For this sample of observations, one can estimate relative efficiency by using a non-parametric method (Charnes et al., 1978; Deprins, Simar, & Tulkens, 1984; Farrell, 1957).


                        Cazals et al. (2002) introduced the probabilistic description of the production process. The latter approach is particularly useful for the estimation of the robust frontiers. The production process can be described in terms of the joint probability measure on

As a remedy to the outlier problem, Cazals et al. (2002) suggested considering the expected minimal value of m i.i.d. random variables, {Yl

                                    X

                                 y
                                 |
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                              =
                              Pr

                                 Y
                                 ≤
                                 y
                                 |
                                 X
                                 ≤
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                           
                        , and obtain the random production possibility set of order m for DMUs consuming less than x.

The order-m measures enable one to estimate the efficiency scores by ignoring the outliers, yet they still do not enable to assess the influence of the environmental variables upon the productive efficiency. As a remedy, Cazals et al. (2002) introduced the conditional measures of efficiency (see Section 2.3).

The conventional FDH approach compares an observation to the point on the production frontier defined by moving along the ray in between the point of origin and an observation. Therefore, some information regarding input- or output-specific inefficiencies might be masked. The MEA model accounts for this by benchmarking an observation against an ideal point determined by its operational environment, i.e. the curvature of the production frontier (surface). The MEA model has first been proposed by Bogetoft and Hougaard (1999) and Asmild, Hougaard, Kronborg, and Kvist (2003).

The MEA approach works in a similar vein as slacks (cf. Tone, 2001, 2002). As Avkiran, Tone, and Tsutsui (2008) pointed out, the slack-based measures might involve non-radial movements yielding change in proportions of the input (or output) mix. They therefore introduced the connected slack-based measure of efficiency based on arbitrary parameters defining the feasible region. The main difference between the slack-based FDH and MEA stems from the fact that MEA uses the observation-specific directional vectors and thus measures the input-specific efficiencies against different ideal points ensuring the proportional reductions in inputs (or outputs). Suchlike analysis is especially topical for the agricultural sector as input markets can be regulated via the support policies. Another input-specific measure is the Russell measure (Färe & Knox Lovell, 1978). However, Bogetoft and Hougaard (1999) showed that the latter measure does not ensure technological monotonicity, as benchmark is defined by the intersection of a supporting hyperplane based on the observed input quantities and a technology set. The MEA, thus, is superior from this viewpoint.

In a similar vein as Wang et al. (2013), calculating the input specific efficiency scores of farm (x
                        0, y
                        0) is defined as

The conditional measures of efficiency are developed for a univariate framework by Cazals et al. (2002), for a continuous multivariate framework by Daraio and Simar (2005) and for discrete control variables firstly by Bădin, Daraio and Simar (2010) and then by De Witte and Kortelainen (2013).

                              For some innovative applications applying conditional efficiency measures, see the recent studies by Halkos and Tzeremes (2013), Serra and Lansink (2014), Cordero et al. (2015) and Tzeremes (2015).
                            The conditional measures seek to compare homogeneous DMUs among themselves. The conditional framework of efficiency measurement assumes that the environmental variables impact the distribution of efficiencies, the very efficiency frontier, or both (Bădin, Daraio & Simar, 2012).

The environment a certain observation operates in can be described by a vector of environmental variables,

The support of SY
                           (y|x, z) defines the production possibility set given Z = z. In order to account for outlying observations, one can consider the expected maximum of the output of the m randomly drawn observations with X ≤ x as a yardstick. The conditional order-m output efficiency score is then obtained as:

                           where Kh
                           ( · ) is a kernel function with an associated bandwidth vector, h. The compact support kernels (e.g. Epanechnikov, 1969) should be used for the conditional efficiency analysis. The environmental variables can be both discrete and continuous (Racine & Li 2004). As suggested by Jeong, Park, and Simar (2010) and De Witte and Kortelainen (2013), the kernel of Aitchison and Aitken (1976) can be used for unordered discrete variables, whereas that of Li and Racine (2007) – for ordered discrete variables. Hall, Racine, and Li (2004) and Li and Racine (2008) presented the least squares cross validation method for bandwidth selection.

The influence of the environmental variables upon the efficiency scores can be quantified by computing the ratios of the conditional measures over the unconditional ones:

                            ∈ z denotes the continuous elements of z. The statistical significance of the environmental variables can be further analysed by employing procedures described in Racine, Hart, and Li (2006). These are implemented in the R package np (Hayfield & Racine, 2008). By drawing the partial regression plots, one can easily check the direction of the influence of the environmental variables upon the efficiency ratios. In an output-oriented framework, an upward slope of a regression curve implies a positive influence of an environmental variable on the productive efficiency (Daraio & Simar, 2007b). The opposite holds for an input-oriented framework. Furthermore, in order to disentangle the behaviour of the dependent variable associated with changes in the independent ones, one can draw the partial regression plots for different quantiles of the independent variables (i.e. environmental variables). These plots then would show the influence of each environmental variable upon the efficiency ratio while the remaining environmental variables are held at the respective quantile.

The significance of the explanatory variables is tested in the spirit of Racine (1997) and Racine et al. (2006). However, it is due to Daraio and Simar (2014) that the statistics of interest might be improved by employing the double bootstrap procedure in case measures other than order-α are used.


                           Zschille (2014) suggests that the conditional measures of efficiency can be based not only on order-m measures, but also on any other estimator. We apply this insight to extend the MEA approach to conditional estimators.

In the conditional MEA model we restrict the reference set by considering densities generated by the kernels used for the environmental variables. The coordinates of an ideal point in the conditional framework are found by solving the following programme for each input:

The second stage analysis can be facilitated analogously to the order-m scores.

The data for 200 farms selected from the FADN sample cover the period of 2004–2009. In total, our balanced panel data set includes 1200 observations. The FADN has been established in order to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the EU common agriculture policy. Its primary users are government agencies and research institutions across the EU. The farms are included into the survey sample on a basis of the farm structure survey and agricultural census data. This might create some sampling bias as FADN focuses on commercial farms, which are generally larger ones.

The selection of input and output variables is in line with earlier literature (e.g., Bojnec & Latruffe, 2008). We define input variables which correspond to the land, labour and capital resources of farms. The utilised agricultural area (UAA) in hectares is chosen as land input variable, annual work units (AWU) as labour input variable, intermediate consumption in local currency Litas (Lt), and total assets in Litas as a capital factor. The last two variables are deflated by respective real price indices provided by Eurostat. The three output indicators represent crop, livestock, and other outputs
                        4
                     
                     
                        4
                        Other output includes rental income, forestry produces, receipts of tourism etc.
                      in Litas, respectively. The output indicators are deflated by respective price indices and aggregated into a single one. The aggregation is necessary to ensure that the output values are reasonable and comparable across farms of the different specialisation. Moreover, the aggregation in one variable avoids zero values for highly specialised farms and increases the operationality of the model (as order-m computations are quite cumbersome with our dataset).

Descriptive statistics are provided in Table C.1. It is clear that the analysed sample covers relatively large farms (mean agricultural area of 244 hectares). As for labour force, the average is 3.6 annual work units.

Using the conditional efficiency model, we include characteristics of the operational environment in the analysis. The existing literature suggests that farming efficiency might be impacted by farm size, technology, farmers’ characteristics, market integration, and temporal variations. Abdulai and Tietje (2007) estimated a stochastic production frontier for German dairy farms which included a set of explanatory variables. The latter set included the ratio of assets to livestock units, farmer's age and education, off-farm employment, farm size in terms of herd size and UAA, hours worked, and expenditures for feed and livestock. Kumbhakar, Lien, and Hardaker (2014) analysed the efficiency of Norwegian grain farms by the means of SFA and used the following environmental variables: off-farm income share, subsidy income share, entrepreneurial orientation index obtained during a survey, farmer experience in years, and education dummies. Latruffe et al. (2004) considered the following variables as determinants of efficiency: total output, technical ratios (land to labour, capital to labour), the use of external factors (share of hired labour, the share of rented land), the degree of market integration (the share of marketed output), soil quality index, and farmer's age. It is due to Davidova and Latruffe (2007) that the following variables had been taken into account when analysing the patterns of farming efficiency in CEE countries: size variables (UAA), variables capturing the use of external factors (the share of hired labour, the share of rented land), and financial ratios (the ratio of debt to assets, the ratio of current debt to current assets). Balcombe et al. (2008) accounted for farm size (UAA), the ratio of capital to labour, the share of hired labour, the degree of market integration, age, the share of other income, education, and time period. Bojnec and Latruffe (2013) explained the variation in the efficiency scores by considering the farm size, the share of rented land, the ratio of assets to labour input, farming type dummy, and time period dummy.

Using these insights from earlier literature, we use the following variables to account for the heterogeneity among farms. First, a time trend (Year) to account for temporal variations in output. Second, the logged UAA (lnUAA) represents the scale of operation and is considered as a proxy for farm size. Thanks to using logarithms we mitigate the significant variation in the size. Third, age of the farmer (Age) is introduced to ascertain whether young farmers-oriented measures can influence the structural efficiency. Fourth, the ratio of crop output to the total output (CropShare) captures the possible difference in farming efficiency across crop and livestock farms. Fifth, the effect of production subsidies on efficiency is estimated by considering the ratio of production subsidies to output (SubsShare). Finally, the technological environment and capital accumulation is assessed by considering the logged ratio of assets to labour input (lnAssetsAWU).

Note that the environmental variables should not be controlled by the producer (cf. Bădin et al., 2012). Yet, in our setting and in many other agricultural studies, some of the environmental variables are either involved in production model or are dependent on such variables. Specifically, we include the logged UAA along with crop share as the environmental variables as these are likely to be associated with different shapes of production frontiers. Indeed, we thus assume that the latter factors are not likely to be impacted by farmers’ decisions in the short run.

Furthermore, we assume no separability
                        5

                        Indeed, a formal test for separability has been offered by Daraio et al. (2010). For the implications involved when accepting or dropping the separability assumption, see Simar and Wilson (2011).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results are discussed in two steps. First, we present the outcomes of the one-directional output efficiency. The outcomes learn the extent to which farms can increase their outcomes with given inputs. As a drawback, it considers the mix of the input variables to determine the relative output increases. To estimate for each input separately the input overuse, we rely on the conditional MEA model. The proposed framework thus allows us to check whether the same efficiency factors impact the output and input gaps. Consequently, the factors of efficiency can be related to respective sources of efficiency, viz. inputs.

In line with Daraio and Simar (2005) the size of the partial frontier is determined as the value for which the change in the percentage of super-efficient observations with m becomes about constant. In our application, this corresponds to m = 400. This implies that a farm is compared to 400 randomly drawn observations consuming at most the same amount of inputs.

The mean unconditional output efficiency score is 1.29, whereas the conditional efficiency score is only slightly lower and amounts to 1.27 (Table C.2). It defines for an average farm the proportionate increase in the (aggregate) output that should occur in order to approach the production frontier. Fig. 1
                         presents the trend of the unconditional and conditional efficiency measures. Various observations can be made. First, the average difference between the unconditional efficiency estimates and the conditional efficiency estimates is rather small. Second, the conditional measures have a lower variance throughout the research period (the coefficient of variation is 39 per cent for the unconditional measures and 33 per cent for the conditional ones). Third, after a period of decreasing efficiency, from 2006 onwards relative efficiency increases (note that in a Farrell efficiency an increase in slope corresponds to a decrease in efficiency). During the last period we observe again a decrease in efficiency.

To examine which variables matter in farm efficiency, we regress the ratio of the conditional over the unconditional estimates on the environmental variables. In line with Jeong et al. (2010) and De Witte and Kortelainen (2013) we use a non-parametric regression to do so. The results are presented in Table 1
                        . Only two of the six variables appear to have a statistically significant influence upon the ratio: the time trend and production subsidies. Whereas the trend is significant at the level of 10 per cent, the subsidy share is significant at 1 per cent (Table 1). Although the remaining four variables are insignificant, the direction of their influence on efficiency scores might be interesting. We present the partial regression plots for the median in Appendix A, while partial regression plots for the first and third quartile are available upon request.

We discuss the partial regression plots more into detail. The partial regression plots for the time trend (Fig. A.1) indicate that there is an increasing trend in efficiency after accounting for the influence by the remaining efficiency factors during the research period. The year 2006 marks a point of slow-down in the increase of efficiency as revealed in Fig. A.1. The low efficiency gains associated with the years 2004–2007 might be due to the transformations (i.e. changes in the production and farm structure) Lithuanian farms experienced after the accession. However, the growth in efficiency during 2008–2009 is observed irrespectively of the quantiles the explanatory variables are held at (to save space, available upon request). These findings suggest that Lithuanian family farms managed to improve their productive efficiency after integration in the EU, yet the growth rates are subject to changes in the operational environment and eventually turned into negative ones.

As for the land input, the partial regression plots show that it impacted the efficiency in the way of a quadratic function. The minimal efficiency is maintained in the region of 55–150 hectares (i.e. the values within (e
                        4, e
                        5)). Thus, the small and the large family farms seem to fall among the most efficient ones. Indeed, smaller farms might maintain higher market integration and control more parts of the supply chains thus experiencing incentives for increasing the intensity of their production processes. The main concern regarding the farming efficiency remains with those middle-sized family farms. However, the link between farm size and the efficiency score ratio is not significant in the conditional framework.

Farmers’ age has no significant influence on the efficiency score ratio, albeit the partial plots indicate some decreases in efficiency for the aged farmers. Even though the variations in efficiency are rather meagre along with the age, the peak is reached at around 50 years.

The production subsidy share has a significant influence on the efficiency ratio. The partial plots in Fig. A.1 indicate that the subsidy rate is negatively related to efficiency. The relation is a linear one; therefore the influence of the rate of subsidies remained constant, which implies that a relative increase in subsidies with respect to the total output induces a decrease in efficiency irrespectively of the subsidy rate already achieved.

Finally, the logged ratio of assets to labour input has no significant influence on the efficiency ratio. Indeed, an increase in efficiency can be observed for the smallest values (around e
                        9 = 8100 Lithuanian Litas/annual work units = 2350 Euro/annual work units). The partial regression plots suggest that a further increase in the assets per labour unit boost the efficiency for the largest values of e
                        14 = 1,200,000 Lithuanian Litas/annual work units = 350,000 Euro/annual work units. This finding might be related to the undergoing transformations in the farms. Indeed, farms are acquiring new assets (machinery, buildings, etc.) as various means of support became available under the EU Common Agriculture Policy. Yet not all of these investments are able to increase the productivity in the short run, and excessive investments might never be recovered.

The conditional order-m measures of Section 4.1 enable us to analyse the overall pattern of the efficiency scores and determinants prevailing in Lithuanian family farms. For policy-making and farm management decision support, though, it is also useful to analyse the input-specific determinants of efficiency. Balcombe et al. (2008) state in this respect “that under the transition conditions farmers had more control over the reduction of their inputs than over the expansion of their outputs.” Therefore, the output-oriented overall results should be complemented with the input-oriented results for each input separately. To enrich the previous analyses with input specific information, we employ the conditional MEA.

The unconditional MEA estimates are summarised in Table 2
                        . The mean input-specific efficiency scores range between 0.78 and 0.83. These figures indicate that Lithuanian family farms still need to improve their practices to ensure substantial increase in the productive efficiency. The average efficiency is highest for land and intermediate consumption. The asset efficiency is the lowest, indicating that Lithuanian farms might have been overinvesting.

The conditional MEA efficiency scores (Table 2) are generally higher than the unconditional counterparts. In the conditional framework, the labour input and intermediate consumption appeared to be the most efficient inputs with mean efficiency scores of 0.88. Therefore one might conclude that labour use efficiency differed along with the farm size, specialisation and other environmental variables. These differences are actually not accounted for in the unconditional setting. The asset input featured the lowest efficiency score of 0.82 as it is the case in the unconditional framework.

The second stage analysis for the MEA scores is carried out by employing a non-parametric regression. The resulting partial regression plots
                           6

                           Note that an increasing regression curve implies an unfavourable influence of a certain environmental variable on the efficiency in the input-oriented model.
                         are given in Appendix B, whereas Table 3
                         summarises the tests of significance.

First consider the input variable ‘Land’ in Fig. B.1. For this input, only the ratio of assets to labour input is significant among the environmental variables. The general trend is that efficiency increased as the ratio of assets to labour units increased. Thus, a sufficient amount of capital accumulated in farms led to increase in land use efficiency. The share of subsidies is significant at a 15 per cent-level. The partial plots suggest that there is a linear relationship between subsidy share and efficiency. Therefore, the influence of subsidies on the land efficiency is possibly a negative one. The influence of the time period on the land efficiency does not follow a clear trend. Specifically, these are only years 2004 and 2009 that exhibited a clear decrease in efficiency. The land efficiency generally decreased as the UAA increased. An increase in efficiency, though, is noticed at the size of around 150 hectares ( = e
                        5). These findings are probably related to decreasing returns to scale prevailing in the large farm region. Contrary to the findings of the relationships between farmer's age and efficiency in the order-m model, the MEA suggested that land efficiency increased with increasing age. The relationship between crop share in the total output and land efficiency suggests that an increasing share of crop output induced increasing efficiency of land use.

Second consider the input variable ‘Labour’ in Fig. B.2. The labour efficiency is significantly influenced by a number of the environmental variables (Table 3). These are time trend, crop share, subsidy share, and the ratio of assets to labour input. Noteworthy, the latter three variables are significant at the level of significance of 5 per cent, whereas the first one featured significance at the level of 10 per cent. Holding the environmental variables at their medians, the labour efficiency had been increasing since year 2006 (Fig. B.2). The increasing crop share in the total output correlates to decreasing efficiency. Indeed, the relationship is a linear one implying a constant decrease in efficiency as the production structure and specialisation changed. This suggests that crop farms are using labour less efficiently even though they require lower quantities of the latter input. As for the production subsidies, they are related to the labour efficiency in a negative way. This implies that increasing ratio of the subsidies to the total output is related to decreasing efficiency. However, some positive trends are identified for the extremely high values of subsidy rates: efficiency somewhat increased when subsidy rates exceeded 400 per cent. The influence of the ratio of assets to the labour input reveals a decreasing trend such that an increasing amount of assets per labour unit would benefit to the labour efficiency. The labour efficiency and the farm size seem to follow an inverted U-shape pattern. This implies that the highest labour efficiency is reached among the farms with UAA of some 150 hectares ( = e
                        5). Even though similar pattern is observed for other variables, the labour efficiency is peculiar with highly evident decrease in efficiency for both small and large farms. Farmer's age has a negative effect on the labour efficiency in general.

Third consider the input variable ‘Intermediate Consumption’ in Fig. B.3. For this variable only the subsidy rate has a significant correlation to the efficiency scores. An increasing rate of subsidies has a negative influence upon the intermediate consumption efficiency. This indicates that farms receiving higher subsidies might be less curious regarding the efficient use of seeds, fertilizers and other intermediate products. The time trend is vague for the intermediate consumption efficiency. The farm size does not play an important role as a determinant of the intermediate consumption efficiency. Indeed, one can observe a slight decrease in efficiency as the farm size approaches 150 hectares, however, the same level of efficiency is maintained for the whole range of 50–150 hectares. The influence of age varies across the quartiles of the environmental variables. Specifically, the partial regression plot suggests that age has a positive effect on intermediate consumption for both young and old farmers. A steep decrease in efficiency is observed as the crop share in the total output approached the value of 40 per cent with rather meagre effect for the higher values.

As a final input variable, consider ‘assets’. The asset efficiency is significantly related to a single variable, viz. subsidy share (Table 3). However, the two additional variables—farmer's age and the ratio of assets to the labour input—features the p-values close to 0.2. Therefore, they can also be considered as factors of the asset efficiency. The influence of production subsidies on the asset efficiency is not as clear as it is the case with other input variables. When keeping the environmental variables at their medians, the asset efficiency begins to increase when subsidy rates exceeded 200 per cent of the output (Fig. B.4), increased after subsidy rate reached 300 per cent of the output and decreased once again after the subsidy rate approached 400 per cent. These findings imply that the asset efficiency is maintained by keeping the subsidy rate at the highest or the lowest value. This might be explained by the fact that a certain critical amount of subsidies is needed in order to improve the technical efficiency of a farm. The farmer's age has a negative effect on the asset efficiency in general. We observe a linear relationship implying that increasing age induces higher asset efficiency. The partial plots confirm that the lowest asset use efficiency is maintained in the region of 60,000–440,000 Lithuanian Litas/annual work units, i.e. 17,000–128 Euro/annual work units. Farms that accumulated either lower or higher amount of capital featured higher efficiency levels. The time trend suggests that the asset efficiency has been increasing since 2007. The farm size in hectares is negatively related to the asset efficiency. Indeed, the steepest decrease in efficiency is observed up to 150 hectares, whereas larger farms are specific with slightly higher efficiencies.

It is clear that combining the one and multidirectional efficiency estimation yields valuable and complementary insights. Whereas the output-oriented one-directional model revealed the importance of the time trend and the subsidy share on the efficiency estimations, the input-oriented MEA model complemented these results by further suggesting possible sources, i.e. inputs, of these inefficiencies. We explore how the one-directional results fit into the multidirectional framework.

First, for a given set of inputs the time trend influences the attainable levels of outputs. Farms increase their output-efficiency over time. On the other hand, the time trend has only a significant influence on labour use efficiency, whereas no significant relationships with other inputs were revealed. Analysis of the sample data implies that the average labour input tends to increase across all farming types throughout the research period of 2004–2009. The operation scale, though, increased to an even higher extent thus resulting in an increasing labour productivity (and efficiency). Specifically, the mean labour input increased from 3.0 annual work units up to 4.0 annual work units in the crop farming, from 4.1 annual work units up to 4.3 annual work units in the livestock farming, and from 2.5 annual work units up to 3.5 annual work units in the mixed farming. The mean total output per annual work units, nevertheless, increased from 115,000  Litas up to 189,000  Litas in the crop farming, from 81,000 Litas up to 139,000 Litas in the livestock farming, and from 39,000 Litas up to 95,000 Litas in the mixed farming (deflated values). This source of efficiency can be related to increasing human capital quality in the Lithuanian agricultural sector.

Second, we observed that the subsidy share significantly influenced the output-oriented efficiency scores. In addition, the latter variable is significantly related to all the inputs except for the land input. One can therefore conclude that all the inputs were used less efficiently with an increasing subsidy intensity. The latter finding is intuitive given similar relationships have already been reported across the EU countries (e.g. Bojnec & Latruffe, 2013). The MEA-based decomposition of the efficiency scores indicate that the input ‘asset’ was used in the least efficient way if compared to the remaining inputs. It is only the subsidy share variable that appears to have a significant impact upon asset use efficiency. Therefore, subsidies are likely to reduce the asset efficiency as they induce capital accumulation, which, in turn, does not always render increase in productivity.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper analysed the determinants of efficiency prevailing among Lithuanian family farms. For the latter purpose, both aggregate (Farrell) one-directional and multidimensional input-specific efficiencies are computed. From a methodological perspective, we adopt the Multi-Directional Efficiency Analysis (MEA) to the conditional efficiency framework such that it allows for a more reliable efficiency estimation. Moreover, thanks to this methodological advance, one can estimate the influence of environmental variables on the efficiency scores.

The output-oriented one-directional conditional efficiency estimation suggests that the time trend and subsidy rate have a significant influence on relative efficiency. The former has a positive influence (i.e. a technical progress is observed), whereas the latter features a negative correlation. The multi-directional conditional input-specific analysis renders somewhat different sets of significant variables as well as their influence directions. The land use efficiency is significantly impacted by the ratio of assets to labour input, whereas time trend and subsidy share variables also exhibited rather small areas of rejection of the null hypothesis of insignificance. The labour efficiency is significantly dependent on the time trend, crop share in the total output, subsidy rate, and asset intensity. The intermediate consumption efficiency appeared to be significantly related to the subsidy rate only. Finally, the asset efficiency is significantly dependent on the subsidy rate with farmer's age and asset intensity featuring rather low p-values. Therefore, the application of different frontier methodologies enabled to identify the factors of efficiency in terms of output production and input consumption.

The results suggest that the livestock farming is relatively more efficient than the other farming types. However, the profitability of the livestock farming is not sufficient to increase the attractiveness of the latter farming type. Therefore, the support policy should aim at increasing support for the livestock farms. The employed data sample covered a variety of farming types. Further analyses could focus on farming type-specific samples to check whether there exists any kind of difference in the determinants of efficiency among Lithuanian family farms.

In this paper we employ the FDH along with order-m measures, yet the MEA is employed in the deterministic form. A further research avenue is therefore extending the MEA into the probabilistic framework as described by Simar and Vanhems (2012) and Daraio and Simar (2014). However, it must be noted that the probabilistic setting renders the instances of super-efficiency, which, in turn, induce infeasibilities in the MEA. Furthermore, we could analyse “pure” and managerial efficiency (Bădin et al., 2012).
