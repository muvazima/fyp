                  In this paper, we consider the discrete optimization via simulation problem with a single stochastic constraint. We present two genetic-algorithm-based algorithms that adopt different sampling rules and searching mechanisms, and thus deliver different statistical guarantees. The first algorithm offers global convergence as the simulation effort goes to infinity. However, the algorithm’s finite-time efficiency may be sacrificed to maintain this theoretically appealing property. We therefore propose the second heuristic algorithm that can take advantage of the desirable mechanics of genetic algorithm, and might be better able to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Empirical studies are performed to compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithms with other existing ones.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Optimization via simulation (OvS) is the process of optimizing the expected performance of a discrete event, stochastic system through computer simulation (e.g., Abo-Hamad & Arisha, 2013; Arreola-Risa, Giménez-García, & Martínez-Parra, 2011; Chen, 2011; Hong & Nelson, 2009; Tsai, 2013; Tsai & Chu, 2012; Yu, Tsai, & Huang, 2010). Hong and Nelson (2009) classified OvS problems into three categories based on the feasible region structure: continuous OvS, discrete OvS (DOvS), and ranking and selection (R&S). For the R&S problems, the number of alternatives in the feasible region is so small (often less than 500) that we may simulate all solutions and choose the best (or near the best) among them with a specified confidence level (see Kim & Nelson (2006) for a survey). For DOvS problems, we have a very large number of feasible solutions (discrete design variables), and the existing algorithms often emphasize a global convergence to the optimal solution asymptotically. In practice, decision makers usually need to consider multiple performance measures rather than a single one due to physical or managerial requirements. For instance, in a typical flow-line problem, the decision maker is interested in finding a buffer allocation setting to maximize the expected throughput over a fixed planning horizon, while also keeping the expected overall work-in-process no greater than a certain level. Recently, more research interest in the OvS literature has been directed to solving problems with stochastic constraints or multiple performance measures. Morrice and Butler (2006) developed a R&S procedure based on multi-attribute utility theory to allow tradeoffs between conflicting targets. Kabirian and Ólafsson (2009) proposed a heuristic iterative algorithm for finding the best solution in the presence of multiple stochastic constraints. Kleijnen, van Beers, and van Nieuwenhuyse (2010) combined methodologies from metamodeling and mathematical programming for solving constrained optimization of random simulation models. Bhatnagar, Hemachandra, and Mishra (2011) and Szechtman and Yücesan (2008) proposed stochastic approximation algorithms for constrained optimization via simulation. Luo and Lim (2011) proposed a new approach that converts a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by using the Lagrangian function. Similarly, Park and Kim (2011) presented a method called penalty function with memory, which is added to the objective function and then replaces a DOvS problem with stochastic constraints into a series of new unconstrained problems. Vieira Junior, Kienitz, and Belderrain (2011) proposed a novel simulation allocation rule to be used in a locally convergent random search algorithm, called COMPASS (Hong & Nelson, 2006), to handle stochastic constrained problems. Hunter and Pasupathy (2013) and Pujowidianto, Hunter, Pasupathy, Lee, and Chen (2012) applied a large-deviations approach to provide an asymptotically optimal sample allocation that maximizes the rate at which the probability of false selection tends to zero. These methods have a requirement that all the solutions be simulated at least once, so they are more appropriate to the setting where the solution space is finite and contains a small number of elements. Andradóttir and Kim (2010) presented one type of R&S procedure (called the Feasibility Determination Procedure, or FDP) that checks the feasibility of each solution among a finite set with respect to a stochastic constraint. Instead of giving a guarantee of correctly choosing the best solution, Bayesian procedures maximize the posterior probability of correct selection within a given simulation budget. There are some works which developed efficient Bayesian procedures to address the constrained optimization problem (e.g., Guan, Song, Ho, & Zhao, 2006; Jia, 2009; Lee, Pujowidianto, Li, Chen, & Yap, 2012; Li, Lee, & Ho, 2002). It should be noted that the existing algorithms handling stochastic constraints are more appropriate to be used when the number of solution designs is not too large. This implies that they will become inefficient (i.e., require excessive sampling cost) when applied to a very large solution space.

Most commercial OvS solvers use optimization metaheuristics, such as tabu search, neural nets, and genetic algorithms (GAs), that have generally been designed and proven to be effective on difficult and deterministic optimization problems. While these algorithms often find promising solutions quickly, they may also become pure random search methods if the stochastic variation of output (i.e., simulation noise) is high or the number of obtained samples for each solution is set too low. That is, their implementations do not always adequately account for the presence of statistical errors. In addition, these algorithms do not provide any statistical guarantee regarding the quality or goodness of the final selected solution. To handle the aforementioned issues, Boesel, Nelson, and Kim (2003) proposed an adaptive genetic-algorithm-based procedure to account for simulation noise in the stochastic optimization context. Their procedure also guarantees to return the best solution over the solutions visited by a heuristic search procedure. Subsequently, Xu, Nelson, and Hong (2010) used the niching GA together with COMPASS (Hong & Nelson, 2006) to establish local optimality with statistical confidence when simulating only a small portion of the feasible solutions. Nazzal, Mollaghasemi, Hedlund, and Bozorgi (2012) proposed a simulation optimization methodology that combines the GA and a R&S procedure under common random number (CRN). They developed a new R&S procedure to select a nonempty subset so that the best solution is contained in the subset with a pre-specified probability. Fitness values and selective probabilities are then computed based on the estimated performances which are obtained from the aforementioned R&S procedure. Notice that these genetic-algorithm-based procedures are adapted for solving the DOvS problem, but can only optimize the expected value of a single performance measure (see Ólafsson (2006) for a review of metaheuristics for OvS). To handle the multi-objective simulation optimization problem, Lee, Chew, Teng, and Chen (2008) developed a solution framework which integrates evolutionary algorithm with multi-objective computing budget allocation method (MOCBA). They employed MOCBA to efficiently allocate simulation replications to solutions in the current population. The proposed approach is applied on a multi-objective aircraft spare parts allocation problem to find a set of non-dominated solutions. Horng, Lin, Lee, and Chen (2013) used GA in combination with a surrogate model to find a set of good solutions in the global search stage. In the second stage they employed a probabilistic local search method to identify the approximate local optima. In the final stage OCBA is used to obtain the best solution among the promising ones identified previously.

In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms (based on GA) that are both theoretically robust and of practical value for solving the DOvS problem with a single stochastic constraint. In both proposed algorithms we use GA to guide the search process, because it is a population-based algorithm that simultaneously considers multiple candidate solutions and is shown to be more robust to stochastic noise (Xu et al., 2010). GA works with a population of potential solutions and moves this population toward the optimum iteratively. The terms iteration and generation are used interchangeably in this work to refer to the process of transforming one population of solutions to another. The proposed GA is adapted to handle two performance measures with stochastic noise (i.e., a stochastic objective and constraint) in a simulation environment. Two types of R&S procedure are incorporated into our DOvS algorithms to enhance its statistical efficiency and validity. We use FDP (see Andradóttir & Kim (2010)) repeatedly in the proposed GA to ensure that the candidate solutions in a population are feasible with respect to the stochastic constraint (with some confidence). See Appendix A.1 for the statistical guarantee provided by FDP. At the end of the algorithms we also invoke the clean-up procedure proposed in Boesel, Nelson, and Ishii (2003) to select the best with respect to the stochastic objective from a set of potential solutions. See Appendix A.2 for a detailed description of this clean-up procedure. The first proposed DOvS algorithm guarantees global convergence as the simulation effort goes to infinity (under the condition that the picked solution is feasible), and also guarantees to choose the best among all evaluated possibly feasible solutions with a specified confidence level. Of course it is somewhat reassuring to have convergence statements, in the sense that the algorithms will eventually reach the global optimal when given large enough simulation effort. However, the algorithm’s finite-time efficiency may be sacrificed to maintain this theoretically appealing property. Further, this algorithm has to visit every solution infinitely often to guarantee convergence, which is not very practically meaningful especially when the sampling budget is limited. We therefore propose the second DOvS algorithm, which is more heuristic-oriented and can take advantage of the desirable inherent properties of GA (e.g., the adaptive constraint-handling techniques and the mechanism of elite population, see Coello (2002)). The second algorithm is designed to identify the best solution among the final elite population, and may deliver competitive performance in a reasonable computation time.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define the DOvS problem with a single stochastic constraint, and introduce the relevant notations and assumptions. Sections 3 and 4 present two DOvS algorithms that adopt different sampling rules and searching mechanisms, and thus provide different statistical guarantees. We give a high-level review of the existing techniques we incorporate, and a detailed description of only the most critical enhancements. An empirical evaluation to compare different algorithms is provided in Section 5, while the paper ends with some concluding remarks in Section 6. The convergence proof and some details of our algorithms are contained in Appendix A.

Our goal is to select the solution with the largest or smallest expected performance (in terms of the stochastic objective) among a large number of candidate solutions that satisfy a single stochastic constraint.

                      are simulated independently (i.e., CRN is not used across different solutions). Our DOvS algorithms consist of two types of R&S procedures: FDP and the clean-up procedure. The efficiency of FDP will not be benefited by the use of CRN, since a feasibility check does not require comparisons among solutions. In addition, it is difficult for the two-stage clean-up procedure to account for the effect of CRN, especially when the number of candidate solutions is very large (see Nelson, Swann, Goldsman, & Song (2001) for a discussion). Without loss of generality, we assume that a smaller

                      (some other components are probably fixed). This nondecreasing assumption is quite reasonable for many service systems, such as call center staffing and emergency vehicle dispatching (e.g., Atlason, Epelman, & Henderson, 2004; Cezik & L’Ecuyer, 2008). For instance, in a call center staffing problem, 
                        
                           h

                           )
                        
                      could represent the aggregated service level over all periods, defined as the fraction of calls answered within a specified time limit. The staffing level

                      giving the number of employees working the jth shift. In the literature related to this problem, it is often assumed that the service level is concave and component wise increasing as a function of the staffing-level vector.

In the following sections, we describe two GA-based algorithms for solving the DOvS problem with a single stochastic constraint. The proposed simulation optimization framework for both algorithms has three stages, Initialization, Searching & Comparing, and Selecting. Assumptions 1 and 2 are required for the statistical validity of the first algorithm. This delivers global convergence as the simulation effort approaches infinity, and also guarantees to select the best among all potential solutions that have been declared to be feasible by FDP. On the other hand, the second algorithm only needs Assumption 1. It can only pick up the best among a small number of promising solutions (without achieving global convergence), but may demonstrate better empirical performance when given a fixed amount of sampling budget.

In this section we present a statistically valid algorithm that can offer global convergence as the number of samples goes to infinity, and at the same time guarantees to select the best among all potential solutions that have been declared to be feasible by FDP with a specified confidence level. In the Initialization stage we intend to pick up a number of possibly feasible solutions that serve as starting solutions for the next stage. We use FDP to ensure that the initial solutions are feasible with a specified confidence level. In the Searching & Comparing stage we employ the Stochastically Constrained Genetic Algorithm (SCGA) in conjunction with FDP to explore the feasible region for promising solutions, where each operator of the conventional GA is adapted for efficient use in a stochastic environment. The operators used to make iterations are grouping and mating, where a subset of current solutions (i.e., parents) are selected based on their performance, and crossover, where the properties of each pair of solutions are integrated into one, as well as mutation, where each offspring is modified based on some rule. In the final stage we invoke the clean-up procedure proposed in Boesel et al. (2003) to select the best (with respect to the stochastic objective) from the set of feasible solutions identified by SCGA. We use their clean-up procedure instead of the typical Rinott’s (1978) procedure, because the number of observations already taken from each solution is usually unequal. Notice that a heuristic search procedure like GA may revisit candidate solutions, and thus take different numbers of observations from them. We use

If the set of feasible solutions is empty, we return to the beginning of this stage. If the number of feasible solutions is less than M, we generate new solutions from the current feasible ones by increasing any of their coordinate components (inside the solution space) until M solutions are collected.

                                       Step 2.

                                       Step 3. Crossover: Apply Max–min Arithmetical Crossover to each pair of parents to generate four offspring. For each group of offspring, use the Set Check Procedure to determine their feasibility, and pick up the best two solutions according to the aggregated sample means of the objective performance measure.


                                       Step 4. Mutation: For each offspring, determine if it needs to undergo mutation according to the specified mutation probability p. Choose one coordinate of that solution with a probability

                                       . Use the Golden Section Method in combination with the Set Check Procedure to find the lower boundary of the feasible region (along the direction of the chosen coordinate). Then apply Uniform Mutation to change its value.


                                       Step 5. Stopping rule: Terminate SCGA and go to Selecting stage if the budget or improvement conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, let

In the Initialization stage, we first randomly choose M solutions from the solution space, although some of these may not be feasible. Notice that we require the initial solutions to be feasible with some confidence level in order to deliver convergence to the global optimum as the number of simulated observations goes to infinity (see Appendix A.3). Therefore, we apply FDP to identify feasible solutions that satisfy the single specified stochastic constraint among these M solutions. If some solutions are eliminated, we then generate new ones by increasing any coordinate value of the surviving solutions (uniformly inside the solution space), until the number of initial solutions is added up to M. More specifically, for

                         for the others. Based on Assumption 2, we can conjecture that these newly generated solutions are also feasible. On the other hand, if FDP returns an empty set, then we go back to the beginning of this stage (i.e., generate M new solutions from the solution space). The same process is then repeated with the new set of solutions.

In the second stage we employ SCGA to search the entire solution space for promising solutions. The basic elements of SCGA include the fitness function, grouping procedure, parent selection, crossover operators, and mutation operators. “Fitness” is a term used in the GA literature to represent the value of the performance measure for a solution. Note that the fitness function we mainly use in the Grouping and Crossover steps corresponds to the aggregated sample means with respect to the objective performance. In general, the solutions with better fitness values are assigned a better chance of being selected for mating. We use FDP from time to time in the algorithm to check the feasibility of candidate solutions, and this is embedded into the set check procedure (described in Section 3.2.3). When using FDP in the Crossover and Mutation steps, the fitness function depends on the evaluation of the constraint performance measure. Each step of the algorithm is described in detail as follows.

The basic principle of GA is that solutions with better performance should have a higher probability of surviving and being selected to generate new solutions through the crossover operator (i.e., they pass on their characteristics to future populations). Since our algorithm operates in a noisy environment, it is more difficult to declare which solutions are truly better because of the sampling variance. We thus use the adapted linear ranking scheme (see Baker (1987)) together with a statistical grouping procedure (see Boesel (1999)) to assign selection probabilities to each solution among 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       P
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . In the linear ranking scheme, each solution’s survival probability depends only on the rank, not the magnitude, of the solution’s fitness value (estimated performance) within the current population. The implementation of a rank-based scheme means that the selection probabilities do not change too drastically as a result of incorrect ranking (due to the presence of stochastic variation). We also adopt the grouping approach described in Boesel (1999), where the sample variance information is considered and all members of each group are assigned their group’s average selection probability. This approach is proven to minimize the difference between the selection probabilities assigned in deterministic and stochastic environments. In this way, the selection scheme is adapted for efficient use in a stochastic setting.

We use stochastic universal sampling (SUS) to determine which individuals are chosen for mating (reproduction). The SUS scheme constructs a roulette wheel where the area for each solution in the current population is proportional to its selection probability (which is computed in the Grouping step). A single spin of the roulette wheel will simultaneously select all the M individuals for reproduction. More specifically, after the spin the pointer will rest on the area of some individual which is then selected as the first parent. We then select other individuals as parents by advancing the pointer at a constant spacing of 
                              
                                 1
                                 /
                                 M
                              
                            (until we choose a total of M parents). By contrast, the ordinary roulette wheel scheme (RWS) only selects one individual for one spin. The selected individuals are placed back into the pool, and can be selected again. The process is repeated iteratively until M individuals are obtained. Therefore, the SUS scheme can achieve a certain spread because it ensures that individuals are picked from the full range of descending fitness values, whereas the RWS scheme might only pick from the top end of that ranking. In summary, the use of SUS scheme helps to prevent premature convergence by holding back outstanding individuals from taking over the population within a few generations (see Baker (1987)).

In this step we need to implement FDP repeatedly to determine the feasibility of candidate solutions if necessary. To avoid incurring excessive sampling cost because of using FDP too often, we develop the set check procedure, which is valid because of Assumption 2 (described as follows). Since a GA tends to generate the same solution more than once, the set check procedure first checks the database to see if the solution has been visited previously, or if the feasibility of that solution can be determined directly based on Assumption 2. If not, we then implement FDP, and need to take observations from the solution.

In SCGA we use the max–min arithmetical crossover, which makes it easier to check the feasibility of each offspring (as will be explained later).

In summary, we apply the max–min arithmetical crossover to each pair of parents to produce four offspring (i.e., the linear combinations, the maximum and the minimum values of all coordinates of any two parents). We then pick two solutions (corresponding to each pair of parents) that are declared to be feasible and have better estimated objective performance. This mechanism is designed to ensure that the solutions in the pool

                            are feasible (at least with a statistical guarantee), which is required to attain global convergence of SCGA. We use the max–min arithmetical crossover in order to explore as many different candidate solutions as possible, and therefore making the searching process of our algorithm more likely to escape from local optimums.

The purpose of using mutation operators is to randomly modify the individual contents to promote the diversity of the current population. To achieve this, we implement uniform mutation, which is one of the commonly used mutation operators in real coded GAs (see Michalewicz (1996)). For each offspring, we determine if mutation needs to be performed based on the specified mutation probability p. We then choose one coordinate of that solution with a probability

                           , and perturb its value randomly along the feasible region. For instance, if the second coordinate of the offspring

More specifically, we choose a new value of that coordinate randomly along the feasible region. However, the DOvS problem we want to solve contains a stochastic constraint, which means it is difficult (or impossible) to directly determine the boundary of the feasible region with respect to the chosen coordinate of the offspring. We thus propose using the Golden Section method (see Bazaraa, Sherali, & Shetty (2006)) in combination with the set check procedure to efficiently find the lower boundary of the feasible region (along the direction of the chosen coordinate). The Golden Section method was originally developed as a sequential search technique for finding the minimum or maximum of a unimodal function by successively narrowing the range of parameter values. Notice that the assumption of unimodal function is quite analogous to Assumption 2 (see Section 2). The basic idea is to regard the boundary of the feasible region of our problem as the optimal point of a unimodal function (assumed by the routine Golden Section method). One advantage of using Golden Section method is that we do not need to determine the number of function evaluations in advance, prior to starting the search (see Bazaraa et al. (2006)). We give an illustrative example as follows. Suppose that the range of parameter values of the chosen coordinate is between 0 and 100. We first use the golden ratio

At the end of the Searching & Comparing stage we have a set of solutions (

                        ) that have been declared to be feasible, with a specified statistical guarantee, either by employing FDP or by comparing with those visited solutions already determined to be feasible based on Assumption 2. In this final stage those solutions are passed to the clean-up procedure (see Boesel et al. (2003)), which provides a statistical confidence as to which of these is the best (in terms of the stochastic objective function). The clean-up procedure was originally developed to help identify the best solution among those discovered during a searching process. It is designed to quickly filter out obviously inferior solutions with a screening procedure (using only the samples already collected by the searching process), and then distinguish the best solution by carrying out additional simulation effort from the remaining solutions. Our DOvS algorithm thus guarantees that it returns the best solution with a specified confidence level from all those visited by the searching process. Of course, if the searching process visits all the feasible solutions, then the statistical validity applies to the entire solution space. Notice that the screening procedure takes into account the relative performance of the candidate solutions, and this is a favorable feature, because there is very likely to be a large number of potential solutions with widely differing performance at the end of the stochastic search.

In this section we propose a heuristic algorithm that can take advantage of the essential mechanics of GA, such as the adaptive constraint-handling techniques (see Coello (2002)) and elitism. The implementation of an elite population means that superior solutions are always conserved through evolutions, which is often used in routine GAs to speed up convergence. However, a consequence of using an elite population is that it invalidates the global convergence statement of our GA-based DOvS algorithm. The algorithm’s finite-time performance may be improved, because the algorithm design is more flexible without adhering to the convergence claim. Another desirable feature of this algorithm is that we do not use FDP so often (compared to GCDA); in this case FDP is only applied to the elite population once in the final step. Notice that we do not need to ensure that each solution in the current population is feasible with some specified guarantee, which is however required for GCDA to attain global convergence. We thus expect to use less simulation effort in determining the feasibility, which means more solutions can be evaluated under a given amount of sampling budget. Therefore, this approach is more likely to uncover promising solutions in the searching process (in terms of the stochastic objective). In the Initialization stage we randomly pick up M solutions from the solution space and note that we do not use FDP here. In the Searching & Comparing stage we employ the Heuristic Constrained Genetic Algorithm (HCGA) to explore the feasible region for promising solutions. A critical difference between SCGA and HCGA is the fitness assignment. For HCGA, we treat the objective and constraint separately when computing the fitness value, which is one of the commonly used constraint-handling techniques. We also introduce a penalty factor to eliminate the selection bias (see Section 4.1). In the final stage we invoke the clean-up procedure proposed in Boesel et al. (2003) to select the best (with respect to the stochastic objective) among the elite population identified by HCGA. The Selecting stage is basically the same as that in SCGA, and the only difference is that the clean-up procedure is applied to the possibly feasible solutions among the elite population, instead of the feasible set. A flowchart of HCDA is given in Fig. 2
                     . A high-level description of the heuristic constrained DOvS algorithm (denoted as HCDA) is given as follows.

                                       Step 5. Crossover: Apply the traditional Arithmetical Crossover to each pair of parents to generate two offspring.


                                       Step 6. Mutation: For each offspring, apply Non-uniform Mutation to perturb its value, with mutation carried out according to the specified mutation probability p.


                                       Step 7. Evaluation: For each newly generated offspring, obtain

                                       Step 8. Elite population: Based on the aggregated sample means, choose the best solution in terms of the objective performance, among the solutions satisfying the stochastic constraint. If all solutions violate the constraint, choose the one with the smallest amount of violation. In either case, obtain additional

                                        observations for the chosen solution, and move it to the elite population

                                       Step 9. Generation of the next population: Combine the current offspring and parents, and choose the best M solutions according to the rule described in the above step.


                                       Step 10. Stopping rule: Terminate HCGA and go to Step 11 if the budget or improvement conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, let 
                                          
                                             t

                                       , and go to Step 1.


                                       Step 11. Feasibility check: Apply FDP to all solutions in the elite population

                                                   t
                                                
                                             
                                          
                                       . If all solutions are declared to be infeasible, then return to the Initialization stage. Otherwise, go to the Selecting stage.


                              Selecting (Clean Up): Apply the Clean-up procedure to the potential solutions (that have been declared to be feasible by FDP) among 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          E

                               to identify the best one.


                           If 
                           
                              Assumption 1 
                           holds, then in the Selecting stage HCDA guarantees to select the best solution among the elite population

                                       t
                                    
                                 
                              
                            
                           with a specified confidence level.
                        

The proof here is straightforward.

To obtain the selection probabilities with respect to the stochastic objective (denoted as 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                        ), we apply the linear ranking scheme and statistical grouping procedure to the objective performance values of each solution among 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Loosely speaking, the solutions with better objective performance are assigned a higher probability of being selected for mating. In addition, the selection probabilities with respect to the stochastic constraint (denoted as 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) are determined by evaluating each solution’s amount of violation (compared to the constraint threshold). Our approach is to treat constraint satisfaction and objective performance separately when computing the fitness value, which is one strategy used to handle constrained problems in the GA literature (see Ray, Kang, & Chye (2000)). Further, we introduce a so-called penalty factor

                         to balance the dominance between 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    s

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d

                         for feasible and infeasible solutions. This can be done by discounting the fitness value of an infeasible individual by the penalty factor

                         is high, its impact against the fitness value of infeasible solutions is not obvious. In contrast, if the feasibility proportion

                         is low, the selection probability of infeasible solutions will be significantly decreased, which implicitly makes feasible solutions easier to select. This approach appears to be similar to the idea of stochastic ranking proposed in Runarsson and Yao (2000).

In the Crossover step we apply the typical arithmetical crossover to each pair of parents to produce two offspring. Michalewicz (1996) suggested that the arithmetical operator works the best for real coded GAs.

                        . This can be regarded as a linear combination of two vectors. In the Mutation step we apply non-uniform mutation to perturb the value of each offspring, given that it needs to perform mutation according to the specified mutation probability p. By contrast, for GCDA we need to use uniform mutation to preserve the guarantee of global convergence.

                         is the maximum number of generations allowed, and b is a parameter determining the degree of non-uniformity. In the initial generations the non-uniform mutation operator tends to explore the solution space uniformly, and in the later generations it tends to search the space locally (Michalewicz, 1996).

                         observations for each newly generated offspring. Based on the accumulated sample means, we choose the best solution in terms of the objective performance (if this solution satisfies the stochastic constraint). If all solutions violate the constraint, we then choose the one with the smallest amount of violation. In either case, we move the chosen solution to the elite population

                         observations. Due to the effect of stochastic variation, the solution with the best sample average may not coincide with the true best solution encountered during the searching process. Therefore we propose using the elite population to preserve all of the potentially promising solutions and carrying out additional simulation replications to obtain more precise performance estimators.

In this section, an extensive empirical evaluation is performed to compare the performance of the following algorithms for solving the DOvS problem with a single stochastic constraint:
                        
                           1.
                           The constrained DOvS algorithms proposed in Sections 3 and 4 are performed, including the Global Convergent Constrained DOvS Algorithm (GCDA) and Heuristic Constrained DOvS Algorithm (HCDA).

We also perform a modified version of GCDA, where FDP is replaced by a fixed-sample-mean comparison, and it is called Fixed Sample Constrained Algorithm (FSCA). Notice that the algorithm maintains the advantages of using a genetic algorithm, but cannot guarantee the feasibility and global convergence of the selected solution.


                              Lee et al. (2012) proposed a new optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) approach for constrained R&S problems. The goal is to maximize the posterior probability of correctly selecting the best feasible solution within a given simulation budget. Notice that the OCBA approaches do not provide a guaranteed probability of correct selection, but they work well for average cases.

We consider FSCA in the empirical study, because it can be viewed as a naive approach where the feasibility of each solution is determined via a sample average, without using any statistically valid procedure. The sample size is fixed and chosen arbitrarily by the analyst before the experiment, and is set as thirty in the following experiment. Note that the performance difference between GCDA and FSCA represents the effect of using FDP (or not) in the constrained DOvS algorithm. For GCDA, HCDA and FSCA, we can terminate the Searching & Comparing stage at any point at which acceptable performance has been achieved, although GCDA is globally convergent as the simulation effort goes to infinity. That is, the Searching & Comparing stage can be terminated when the improvement in solution quality obtained upon a specified number of consecutive generations is insignificant. This represents the case when the chosen solution dominates the others within these iterations. Of course, we can also terminate the algorithm when the specified sampling budget (in terms of the number of simulation replications) is exhausted at the current generation. As for the OCBA algorithm, in each trial we first randomly select a fixed number of solutions without replacement (within the solution space), and treat them as the set of available solutions at the beginning of the experiment. We then try to select the best solution by taking into consideration of both optimality and feasibility among the randomly chosen solutions. Notice that the OCBA algorithm finds good enough solutions with high probability by randomly sampling and evaluating enough of them. By contrast, GCDA and HCDA are guaranteed to choose the best from a small set of promising solutions identified by the Searching & Comparing stage.

To obtain good control over the factors that can affect the performance of the algorithms, we select two known response-surface functions to which we add normally distributed noise. The objective function of the first test problem is the multimodal function used in Xu et al. (2010), and is referred to as

When only considering the objective function, this problem contains twenty-five local optimums and a global one, and it represents a response surface where most solutions differ widely in performance. To examine the performance of the algorithms when encountering different proportions of feasible solutions (in the solution space), the value of Q is varied with

Notice that in practice the simulated system is often so complex that the objective and constraint functions are not analytically tractable, and thus are unknown. However, the expected function structure is not required for the application (or validity) of our algorithms. For each problem configuration, 100 macro-replications (complete repetitions) of each algorithm are performed. In all experiments, the nominal probability of correct selection is set at 1−
                        α
                        =0.95. To compare the performance of the algorithms we record the Average Performance (i.e., expected value of the objective response function) of the final selected solution (AP), the Average Number of Visited solutions (ANV), the Average Number of Samples (ANS) required by each algorithm (without dividing by the number of visited solutions). We also record the estimated Probability of Correct Decision (PCD) which stands for the probability of correctly identifying feasible solutions (for 100 macro-replications). The feasibility of the final selected solution in each trial can be determined easily by comparing the expected constraint function with the threshold value. To simplify the experimental presentation, we round the values of AP to the nearest thousandth, the values of PCD to the nearest hundredth, and the values of ANV and ANS to the nearest whole number.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

The performance plot demonstrates the average for one hundred trials of the true expected objective value of the final solution selected by each algorithm (i.e., AP) as a function of the number of replications consumed. First, we look at an easy scenario for the first test problem (with 
                           
                              Q
                              =

                         and 
                           
                              σ
                              =
                              0.3
                           
                        ), where half solution space is feasible and the stochastic variation is low. In Fig. 3
                         we can see that HCDA performs the best in terms of AP, which is not surprising because it spends less simulation effort in determining the feasibility of each solution. This implies that more solutions can be evaluated when compared to other algorithms (under a given amount of sampling budget), and thus it is more likely to uncover promising solutions (in terms of the objective function). This argument can be validated by observing that HCDA visits the most candidate solutions in Table 2
                         (i.e., it has the largest ANV). Another factor contributing to HCDA’s success is the use of an elite population, which preserves potentially superior solutions through evolutions. In the empirical study, it should be noted that OCBA is the only algorithm that is not combined with GA. Therefore it is not surprised that our procedures have better performance because GA samples promising solutions more intelligently, while we randomly pick up candidate solutions for OCBA. In the experiments we use OCBA as a benchmark for comparison because it is possibly the most efficient R&S procedure to achieve an approximate probability of correct selection (in terms of required simulation efforts; see Branke, Chick, & Schmidt (2007)). We believe it is worthwhile to develop efficient algorithms that can take advantage of both Bayesian-type procedures (e.g., OCBA) and GA for constrained simulation optimization. However this topic requires extensive investigation and is beyond the scope of the paper (see Section 6 for a discussion). Notice that the paper focuses on selection procedures that take a frequentist perspective. We also find that the PCD of FSCA is smaller than that of the other algorithms, because it only uses ordinary sample means to check the feasibility (sample size of thirty in our experiment). In other words, the disadvantage of FSCA is that it lacks the ability to choose an appropriate sample size value (to check the feasibility), and thus cannot deliver a sound statistical guarantee. By contrast, for the procedures GCDA and HCDA which use FDP, the more stochastically variant the solution is, the larger the sample size that will be specified automatically (in order to satisfy the PCD requirement; see Remark A.1). Notice that in this easy scenario we have a low level of stochastic variation, and therefore the inferiority of FSCA regarding PCD is not very obvious, as the PCD value for FSCA is still greater than

                         illustrates the performance of each algorithm (in terms of AP) for an easy scenario of the second test problem (with 
                           
                              Q

                              -

                        ), where a 72% solution space is feasible and the stochastic variation is low. For this relatively easy case we can see that GCDA, HCDA and FSCA can reach near optimal solutions when using more than 40,000 replications. Further, in the initial evolution the AP performance of GCDA is better than that of FSCA. This is due to the fact that FSCA may prescribe more samples than needed to check the feasibility for this easy scenario. In the experiments we compute the sample averages of thirty replications for FSCA, and use

                         as the initial number of replications for the FDP part of GCDA. In other words, the total number of replications required to check the feasibility (determined by FDP) may be less than thirty. We obtain a small number of samples initially, and go back for more only when necessary. Therefore, in this case GCDA may visit more solutions than FSCA, and be able to uncover more promising ones. We also present results for the difficult scenario of the second test problem (with 
                           
                              Q

                        ) in Fig. 5
                         and Table 3
                        . In this scenario, only 29% of the solution space is feasible and the level of stochastic variation is high. The AP performances of HCDA and FSCA are superior to those of the other algorithms, although they have inferior PCD performances. In this case the inferiority of the AP performances for OCBA is more obvious. Notice that in this difficult scenario it is possible that all the solutions contained in the elite population are not feasible, which also somewhat explains why HCDA cannot attain the global convergence guarantee. As the percentage of feasible solutions in the solution space is smaller (or the noise variance is larger), the PCD performances of HCDA, FSCA and OCBA deteriorate significantly, while the PCD values of GCDA are still over the nominal level specified in FDP (i.e., 0.95, see Table 1). The fixed-sample-size algorithms are appropriate to use when the stochastic variation is low enough (or the sample size is large enough), so that the assignment of selection probabilities and the feasibility check are accurate enough to allow choosing a promising solution. If the sample size is set too low, we may use too few data for each solution, making the algorithms become pure random search methods, or leading to an infeasible solution. If the sample size is set too large, then too much sampling cost is wasted on inferior solutions, thereby reducing the number of solutions that can be evaluated under a given sampling budget. By contrast, GCDA can provide a feasibility guarantee for the chosen solution by implementing FDP, although in this case more sampling cost is usually needed. We can see that the statistical guarantee becomes more and more difficult to obtain as problem dimensionality d increases. In other words, the difference between GCDA and HCDA (in terms of AP) becomes more substantial as the dimensionality increases. For instance, when given a sampling budget of 40,000, there is an increase of 23% in the AP of GCDA when compared to HCDA and 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              2
                           
                         (as shown in Table 2). By contrast, the AP value of GCDA is approximately 2.5 times that of HCDA when 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              4
                           
                         (as shown in Table 3). We believe that this is a price we need to pay to attain both provable convergence and guaranteed feasibility.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we present two GA-based efficient algorithms that are specifically designed for the DOvS problem with a single stochastic constraint. We use GA to guide the searching process in a noisy environment, because it seems quite robust to statistical errors introduced in the performance estimates (see Boesel (1999)). The first proposed algorithm, GCDA, guarantees global convergence as the simulation effort goes to infinity, and at the same time guarantees to select the best among all visited solutions that have been declared to be feasible (upon termination of the algorithm) with a specified confidence level (see Remark A.2). The second algorithm HCDA pursues finite-time empirical efficiency and focuses on employing adaptive constraint-handling techniques and the mechanism of elite population. If statistical validity is a concern of the analyst, we recommend using GCDA. If the analyst can tolerate the lack of statistical validity and the problem dimension d is not small (or the level of stochastic variation is low), then HCDA is recommended.

There are several possible directions to extend the methodology developed in the paper. For instance, we could exploit variance reduction techniques to improve the algorithm’s efficiency (Tsai & Kuo, 2012). Another possible extension is to use other metaheuristics to guide the searching process (e.g., simulated annealing). The other possible extension is to consider the DOvS problem with multiple stochastic constraints (Batur & Kim, 2010). Notice that the conservatism of the feasibility check procedure becomes more serious as the number of solutions or constraints increases. This implies that our GA-based algorithms may lead to excessive sampling cost, especially for the case of GCDA where FDP is repeatedly employed in the searching process. We may also need to determine appropriate weights regarding the relative importance of each constraint when evaluating each solution’s amount of violation (compared to the constraint threshold). The other research topic worthy investigating is to incorporate OCBA into GA-based algorithms for constrained simulation optimization. For instance, we could stop an OCBA call in each iteration when an approximate probability of good selection or the expected opportunity cost reaches a pre-specified level (see Branke et al. (2007)). We also could employ the subset selection procedure of Chen, Fu, and Lee (2008) to choose an elite population for each generation of GA. Some extension of these existing procedures is required to handle stochastic constraints. It would be better to exploit accumulated simulation observations since GA may revisit candidate solutions.

In this subsection we describe the Feasibility Determination Procedure (FDP) proposed by Andradóttir and Kim (2010) that will be used repeatedly in our algorithms. FDP checks the feasibility of each solution among a finite set with respect to a stochastic constraint. However, for stochastic problems it is not always possible to identify the solutions that satisfy the stochastic constraint exactly with a finite number of simulated observations. Andradóttir and Kim (2010) thus introduced a tolerance level, which allows choosing the solutions whose expected performance corresponding to the stochastic constraint is within a so-called acceptable region, which is looser than the defined true feasible region. The following description and notations are based on Andradóttir and Kim (2010). First, we need to specify the lower and upper bound values for the constant Q, namely

We use a similar argument as in Appendix A.1 of Xu et al. (2010). First, we introduce the notations that we will use in this proof. Let

                         denote the feasible region that is defined by the stochastic constraint, and let

                         denote the allowable error of feasibility check in FDP. We also let

                         denote the set of solutions sampled in the kth generation. To attain the global convergence of SCGA as the number of generations goes to infinity, we need to satisfy the following requirements:
                           
                              1.
                              In the Initialization stage, the initial M solutions are feasible (at least with the specified confidence level).

In the Mutation step, each coordinate of the chosen offspring might be selected with a probability of at least

Notice that the validity of the set check procedure depends on Assumption 2 and the condition that the solutions among

                         are feasible with some confidence. We also need Requirement 1 to specify that the solutions among

                         are feasible with some confidence. Of course, the analyst could remove Assumption 2 to make it a more general algorithm. The only consequence is that we need to implement FDP to nearly every sampled solution to check its feasibility, resulting in more computational time being needed. Further, we establish Assumption 1 to support the validity of FDP and the clean-up procedure.
