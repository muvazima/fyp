                  We examine a supply chain in which a manufacturer participates in a sealed-bid lowest price procurement auction through a distributor. This form of supply chain is common when a manufacturer is active in an overseas market without establishing a local subsidiary. To gain a strategic advantage in the division of profit, the manufacturer and distributor may intentionally conceal information about the underlying cost distribution of the competition. In this environment of information asymmetry, we determine the equilibrium mark-up, the ex-ante expected mark-up and expected profit of the manufacturer and the equilibrium bid of the distributor. In unilateral communication, we demonstrate the informed agent’s advantage resulting to higher mark-up. Under information sharing, we show that profit is equally shared among the supply chain partners and we explicitly derive the mark-up when the underlying cost distribution is uniform in [0,1]. The model and findings are illustrated by a numerical example.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Supply chain competition is increasingly replacing the firm versus firm framework of market competition (Ha & Tong, 2008). Ideally, partners in a supply chain should cooperate and proceed together with coordinated decisions against competing supply chains (Gumus & Guneri, 2007). In a manufacturer–retailer scheme, the two agents will have to determine the inventory level, the order quantity, the transfer sales price and the market price, ensuring profit maximization (Hu, Beil, & Duenyas, 2013; Lovejoy, 2010). Typically, the market demand function involves uncertain parameters and the supply chain partners have asymmetric information about the possible states of the demand (Ha & Tong, 2008).

We extend this framework examining the purchase of a product or service for which there is no active market and, therefore, the end-user initiates a procurement auction. When the quantity of a supply is large, even if the product is sold in the retail market on a retail, the procurer may run an auction mechanism to purchase the object at a bid price, which is lower than the retail price. Public tenders or bidding in a Request for Quotation are common examples of such auctions. We consider a procurement mechanism of a sealed-bid auction, where the awarding criterion is the lowest bid. This form of auction is commonly used in public procurement contracts both in the EU (European Parliament and Council Directive, 2004) and the U.S. (Federal Acquisition Regulation, 2005).

In our setting, the upstream agent of the supply chain is a manufacturer, who collaborates with a downstream distributor. For example, the Austrian firm Rosenbauer International AG, a leading fire fighting vehicle and equipment manufacturer, has established a worldwide network of distributors and provides its customer support “via a global sales and services organization with the cooperation of selected partners” (Rosenbauer Group website). Clearly, the vast majority of state and municipal procurement for these products is through a tender process.

We examine the environment in which the manufacturer is unwilling to participate directly to the procurement auction. Instead, the manufacturer prefers to supply the auctioned item to the distributor, who eventually bids in the auction. There are many reasons for which a manufacturer may decide to sell through a distributor. In many cases, the manufacturer is located overseas and he is unfamiliar with the local market, which may present various barriers for entry. The terms of the supply often require that the supplier should provide maintenance and repair service, which the manufacturer is unable to offer to the end user without the cooperation of a local firm. Moreover, the manufacturer may evaluate the establishment of a local subsidiary company as unprofitable, since the local customer pool is usually limited and the outcome of the particular procurement auction remains uncertain, whereas the investment and the corresponding fixed cost are in most cases considerably high. This supply chain framework is consistent with the estimate that 60% of US companies and 70% of European companies use foreign-based agents or distributors to export their products (Jobber, 2010). The appointment of local distributors, who will promote a product and penetrate the local market, appears to be preferable when the profit is expected to be low or the risk involved is high (Arnold, 2000). In general, manufacturers may decide to make their products available to end-users using distributor channels because of the expertise and capacity of the distributors in the promotion, sale and technical support of the corresponding products.

In public procurement, only authorized distributors or manufacturers are usually allowed to participate in a supply or service auction. For example, the US government typically requires from distributors, who want to become suppliers to the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide a letter from the corresponding manufacturer which certifies their status as authorized distributors (Letter of Supply in US GSA website). Moreover, manufacturers have to provide confirmation that, if their authorized distributor is awarded the procurement contract, they will properly supply to the distributor the auctioned item. Authorized distributors are carefully selected on the basis of geographic location or with regard to product or market segmentation. In general, the partner manufacturer and the authorized distributor are bound by a formal contractual agreement, which extends beyond the scope of a particular auction project. Therefore, in a procurement auction, the agents of the supply chain have established a long lasting collaboration and, for this reason, the respective manufacturers will typically refrain from cooperating with other bidders.

Moreover, participants in public procurement auctions are usually not allowed to propose variants to their tenders. For example, EU regulations specifically prohibit variant offers, when the criterion of awarding a supply or service contract is the lowest price (European Parliament and Council Directive, 2004; Guide to the Community Rules on Public Supply Contracts, Guide to the Community Rules on Public Service Contracts). Consequently, in public procurement, distributors are legally bound to present only one proposal coming from a single manufacturer. Further, most manufacturers expect from their foreign authorized distributors not to sell competing products (Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Canada). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in the procurement auction environment that we examine, a distributor will choose to cooperate with a single upstream agent.

We embed our supply chain model in a setting of information asymmetry. In a manufacturer–retailer supply chain with downstream market competition instead of an auction, the asymmetry of information is reflected in the representation of the market demand curve and the unit cost of the retailer. Typically, in the literature, the market demand function includes random parameters and, as a result, the supply chain partners have asymmetric information about the possible states of the demand. For example, Ha and Tong (2008) consider a manufacturer who does not observe the intercept of a linear demand curve, although this parameter is known to the retailer. Wang, Lau, and Ling (2008) considered a manufacturer–retailer supply chain, where the downstream agent sells in an active market, which is described by a linear demand curve, instead of participating in a downstream auction. The manufacturer has incomplete knowledge about the stochastic parameters of a linear demand function and the retailer’s cost, whereas the retailer is fully aware about the form of the demand curve. Wang et al. (2008) showed that in this setting it is preferable for the distributor to withhold or distort information and increase the manufacturer’s uncertainty about the parameters of the demand. We pose a similar question in the environment of a downstream procurement auction and we investigate how the two agents interact by exchanging information.

We model supply chain information asymmetry in an innovative way through the underlying distribution of the cost of the competition. The probability distribution of cost plays a crucial role in the determination of the bid price and, consequently, the transfer price. The manufacturer, who is active in international markets, usually has a more comprehensive and global view of the competition. In contrast, the distributor possesses more accurate information about the local market competition. Therefore, each supply chain partner estimates differently the probability distribution of the cost of competing bidding supply chains.

Collaborative partnership in the supply chain requires trust and commitment for long term cooperation (Kiefer & Carter, 2009). In general, however, within a manufacturer–distributor supply chain and under conditions of unequal power, the party which possesses the greater relative power tends to behave exploitatively towards the less powerful agent (Ghauri & Usunier, 2003). Our analysis contributes in the understanding of this behavior. In our setting, although both supply chain partners share the same goal, namely to win in the auction, there is an adversarial relationship on how the profit made will be divided among them. Consequently, the agents may decide to avoid an open and truthful exchange of information between them. Intuitively, the motive of each partner is to gain a strategic advantage, which will allow a higher mark-up for the particular agent while maintaining a competitive bid. The source of this conflict of interests may be traced to the dual role of the distributor, who simultaneously acts as a purchasing agent for the manufacturer and as a selling agent for the downstream customer (Jobber, 2010).

In our framework of information asymmetry, we examine the role of communication in the determination of the mark-up of each agent and the division of the total potential profit. We explore the interaction among agents in an auction with intermediaries, with heterogeneous beliefs and limited communication across the supply chain. To the best of our knowledge, this supply chain structure has not been previously examined in the existing literature of auction theory. Initially, we consider the case of limited exchange of information within the two partners, who do not disclose their knowledge and beliefs about the competition. When the upstream agent believes that the competition is less intense compared to how the downstream player expects his opponents to behave, we establish analytically that the manufacturer is motivated to mislead the distributor about the level of competition, as described by the cost probability distribution. The distributor acts in a similar way, when the manufacturer engages in one-way upstream communication. Unilateral upstream or downstream exchange of information, where one agent reveals to the other one the underlying cost probability distribution, provides an information advantage to the informed party, which we formally derive and express in the form of a higher mark-up. In information sharing, which occurs under an open, complete and truthful upstream and downstream exchange of information, both partners share the same view on the underlying probability distribution of the cost of the competition and profit is equally divided.

Our results are useful to supply chain management, explaining the fragility of partnership with respect to the division of profits, generated by information asymmetry in an auction setting. Our work raises the need to design contractual agreements within the supply chain, which induce truthful information sharing and equal allocation of profits.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A review of the existing literature is examined in Section ‘Literature review’. The model description is formally presented and the assumptions made are explicitly stated in Section ‘The model’. In Section ‘Equilibrium mark-up and bidding strategies’, under information asymmetry within the supply chain, we derive the equilibrium mark-up for the manufacturer and the equilibrium bid for the distributor, who participates in the downstream auction. Further, in Section ‘Upstream one-way communication in the supply chain’, we examine the supply chain with upstream communication and we analytically establish the manufacturer’s advantage over the distributor in the division of profits. In Section ‘Downstream one-way communication in the supply chain’, we look at the symmetric case of downstream one-way communication, and we find that the distributor enjoys an advantage in terms of the mark-up. In Section ‘Information sharing across the supply chain’, we show that, with information-sharing, the profit is equally shared among both supply chain partners. Moreover, when the underlying cost distribution is the uniform in [0,1] distribution, and there is information sharing, we derive explicitly the equilibrium mark-up and we investigate the effect of double marginalization on the bid price. In Section ‘Expected mark-up and profit of the manufacturer’, we present an expression of the expected ex ante mark-up and profit of the manufacturer, under the beliefs of the manufacturer. Section ‘Numerical illustration of the model’ illustrates the model and discusses the findings by a numerical example. A discussion with conclusions can be found in Section ‘Discussion – Conclusion’. All proofs are deferred to Appendix A.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The seminal paper of Maskin and Riley (2000) introduced asymmetry in auctions of two participants, by assuming that the probability distribution of one bidder’s valuation stochastically dominates the respective probability distribution of the other player. Intuitively, one bidder tends to consider “higher” values compared to his opponent. This heterogenous environment has been extended by Kirkegaard (2012) to account for other forms of stochastic dominance. In our setting, although auction bidders are assumed to be symmetric, asymmetry rests within the bidding supply chain itself. The asymmetric beliefs of the supply chain agents of our model are represented in a setting of stochastic dominance among the respective probability distributions of the cost of the competition.

When the winning bidder of an auction is not the player with the highest valuation, a resale process, after the auction, leads to new profitable trade opportunities. In this two-stage framework, the auction winner acts as an intermediary agent. Therefore, the allocation of the auctioned object generates double marginalization. In the symmetric model of Haile (2003), the auction winner runs a new second price auction to resell the object to his opponents. Hafalir and Krishna (2008) constructed equilibrium bidding strategies in a two bidder asymmetric first price auction with valuations which are stochastically ranked, whereas the resale stage is in the form of take-or-leave-it offer. Conditions for the design of seller optimal auctions with resale were developed by Zheng (2002). Bikhchandani and Huang (1989) developed a model of competitive bidding in Treasury-Bill primary auctions, in which bidders participate for the purpose of resale in a secondary market. In our model, conditionally on being the auction winner, the distributor supplies to the auctioneer the object that has been previously purchased from the manufacturer. Therefore, our setting can be viewed as a resale auction in a procurement environment, where the trade following the auction is made among agents already committed to the resale.

Auctions often appear in different supply chain schemes. The auction is usually placed upstream in the supply chain and an active market exists downstream. The price information disclosed by the auction has an impact on the downstream demand. Chen and Vulcano (2009) examined a supply chain where an upstream supplier – for example, a manufacturer – auctions to two bidders his inventory or capacity, which is viewed as bundle. Additional units can be purchased at a fixed unit cost. Subsequently, the two players act as downstream resellers competing in an active market, in which the demand curve is described by a linear function with random intercept. Mokherjee and Tsumagari (2004) examined a supply chain network with double marginalization, where two suppliers deliver a quantity of input to a principal, while subcontracting and collusion is possible among the agents. The auction in our setting is positioned downstream and the competition is, in fact, among bidding supply chains.

In the environment of online auctions, ad agencies act as intermediaries in an auction for online display advertisements producing a double marginalization. Each intermediary first runs a contingent auction selling the display to advertisers. Subsequently, based on the contingent price received, the intermediaries bid among themselves in a downstream central auction for the purchase of an ad slot impression. Feldman, Mirronki, Muthukrishnan, and Pai (2010) considered the case when there is only one buyer for each intermediary and the central auction has the form of a second price auction. In this setting, they found that offering the display to the buyer at a take-it-or-leave-it price is a dominant strategy. This transfer price serves as the bid price of the intermediary at the central auction. At a symmetric equilibrium, the intermediary should select the price level randomly within an interval which depends on the reserve price of the central auction. When there are multiple buyers for each intermediary, the authors conjecture that the optimal mechanism for the contingent auction has the form of a second price auction. Although, the model of Feldman et al. (2010) and our procurement auction both examine a downstream auction in the presence of intermediaries, there are two profound differences that should be stressed. First, Feldman et al. (2010) considered a second price downstream auction in which it is a dominant strategy for the players to bid their value. Our setting is a sealed bid lowest price auction, in which bidders add a mark-up on their cost. Therefore, in our environment, the asymmetry of information about the competition creates an important interaction among agents in the determination of the mark-up of each agent, which is the focus of our analysis. The second distinctive difference stems from the role of the intermediary party. In Feldman et al. (2010), it is the intermediary who determines the transfer price in a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the buyer, while the transfer price is also the bid price. In our setting, however, it is the upstream agent (the manufacturer) who sets the transfer price, whereas the intermediary (the distributor) adds the final mark-up to determine the bid price. Therefore, our model describes a fundamentally different auction environment, which poses completely new and challenging questions.

We consider a supply chain where an auctioneer wants to purchase an indivisible item, which a manufacturer will supply through a distributor. The auction environment is an independent private value sealed bid auction. Each bidder knows precisely his own cost and assumes that the cost values of his opponents are independent and identically distributed random variables. In the symmetric setting that we consider, all players believe that the underlying cost distribution is the same for all auction participants. The auctioned item is awarded to the bidder who sells at the lowest price. This type of auction is widely used in public procurement and it is also common in industrial requests for quotations (RFQ). In terms of monetary payoffs, all bidders are risk-neutral sellers. The auctioned item can be either a product or a service.

The manufacturer incurs a cost c to provide the item to the distributor. This cost is perfectly known to the manufacturer but remains unknown to the distributor. The manufacturer determines the transfer price, at which the item is made available to the distributor, by adding an appropriate mark-up m to the cost c. Hence, the cost of the distributor is m
                        +
                        c.

Downstream the supply chain, the distributor participates in the procurement auction, submitting a sealed bid β. It is assumed that no cost is born by either the manufacturer or the distributor by participating in the auction. Therefore, any cost due to the preparation of the offers, or a possible submission of sample products or a product presentation, or any financial expenses, as for example, for issuing a letter of bank-guarantee for participation to the auction, is regarded nonexistent or negligible. The distributor bids against n opponents in the auction. It is assumed that n
                        ⩾2. The manufacturer and the distributor have both decided to co-operate in this procurement project.

The symmetric equilibrium bid b is assumed to be an increasing function of the cost of each bidder. The distributor sets the bid price assuming that the cost of each one his opponents is an independent and identically distributed random variable, which follows a cumulative probability distribution Φ with support in the interval [0,
                        ω] and having a continuous density φ. When the bid is β
                        =
                        b(c
                        +
                        m), the probability of winning the auction is

                         The hazard rate associated with the distribution Φ is given by σΦ
                        
                        =
                        φ/Φ. The reverse hazard rate associated with F is denoted by λF

                        f/F, where f is the derivative of F.

Following a game-theoretic approach, the distributor selects the bid price β, which maximizes his expected profit: Π(β, c
                        +
                        m|F)=(β

                        m)F(b
                        −1(β)).

The reserve price, above which no sale takes place, is denoted by K. Following Krisna (2010), at the reserve price K, we have b(K)=
                        K. For simplicity, we will assume that K
                        =
                        ω.

The distributor does not know the actual cost c of the manufacturer and observes only the non-negotiable transfer price c
                        +
                        m, which constitutes his cost. Moreover, the distributor believes that the probability distribution of the underlying cost of the competition is best described by Φ. The distributor will determine the bid price by applying a mark-up μ to the transfer price, so that β
                        =
                        c
                        +
                        m
                        +
                        μ.

Upstream the supply chain, the manufacturer assumes that all auction participants, including the distributor, select their bids in a game theoretic manner. Moreover, he believes that the cost of each opponent of the distributor follows a cumulative probability distribution Ψ with support in the interval [0,
                        ω] and density ψ. The random variables of the cost of each player are considered to be independent. Although the manufacturer and the distributor both share some information about the bid prices of the previous supplies in the local and the international market, their beliefs about the cost of the competition do not coincide. The manufacturer, who is typically active in overseas markets, usually has more extensive and more recent knowledge about the level of competition for the auctioned item in the international environment. The manufacturer is unwilling to disclose to the distributor the content of this information and he may even deliberately refrain from providing information to the distributor. The motive of the upstream agent is to falsely create the impression that competition is tougher in an effort to force a lower mark-up μ in the final bid of the distributor. Consequently, the distributor remains unaware of the probability distribution Ψ considered by the manufacturer. In general, under information asymmetry, the probability distribution Ψ will be different from Φ.

At the same time, the distributor may also be unwilling to communicate to the manufacturer accurate or up-to-date information about the competition, which shows up in the local market. It may also happen that the distributor intentionally overstates the level of competition in an attempt to lower the transfer price, which will either lead to a more competitive bid or allow a higher margin for the distributor. As a result, the manufacturer incorrectly believes that the distributor determines the bid price considering an underlying cost probability distribution Γ rather than Φ.

In the special case of upstream one-way exchange of information, the distributor reveals to the manufacturer the underlying distribution Φ, and, therefore, Φ
                        =
                        Γ. In downstream unilateral communication, the manufacturer informs the distributor about Ψ and believes that the downstream agent will employ Γ
                        =
                        Ψ. When the manufacturer and the distributor engage in perfect, open and truthful information sharing, both partners agree about the underlying cost probability distribution of the competition. Therefore, under information sharing, Ψ
                        =
                        Φ
                        =
                        Γ and the agents of the supply chain achieve a perfect alignment of incentives and goal convergence.

The expected profit of the manufacturer is: π(m, β, c|G, H)=
                        mG(b
                        −1(β)). The manufacturer chooses the mark-up m which maximizes π(m, β, c|G, H), under the condition that the distributor selects the optimal bid β. We summarize the notation used in Table 1
                        .


                        Fig. 1
                         presents the sequence of decisions and events, depicting the interaction of the supply chain agents.

We proceed to present in detail the assumptions, which are needed to derive the equilibrium pricing strategy of the supply chain agents. In general, the manufacturer has the opportunity to be involved in a large number of procurement auctions of the same object, which take place in the international market. Therefore, the manufacturer has recent information about the level of competition coming from a large pool of various auctions for the procurement of the same or similar items. Moreover, he is fully aware of the exact cost structure for producing the item and, consequently, he can accurately factor in the bid prices of the competition the expected adjustment of different cost components accounting for factors such as the change of the price of raw materials or labor. On the other hand, the distributor does not have access to this information and possesses data only about the competition in the limited number of auctions that have occurred in the local market. It is often the case, due to the nature of the item, which is procured, that such local auctions are infrequent and past data are old and less reliable. At the same time, the manufacturer is also aware of the data from these local procurement auctions, since he most likely participated in all of these auctions in the past, possibly through the same distributor. For this reason, the manufacturer is confident, perhaps erroneously, that his estimate of the probability distribution of the underlying cost of the competition is more accurate than the corresponding estimate, which is available to the local distributor. Therefore, according to the manufacturer’s point of view, the distributor incorrectly believes that the probability distribution of the underlying cost of his opponents is Γ, while the actual probability distribution is Ψ. Never-the-less, the distributor actually estimates the corresponding probability distribution by Φ rather than Γ, and it is possible that, eventually, Φ may be a more precise description of the true probability distribution of the cost of the competition.

Suppose that the manufacturer does not engage in a perfect, open and truthful exchange of information with the distributor regarding the level of competition, and, therefore, Γ
                        ≠
                        Ψ. The motive of the manufacturer is to mislead the distributor, in an effort to make him believe that competition is more aggressive. In this way, the manufacturer forces the distributor to apply a lower mark-up in the bid price, producing a more competitive offer. The manufacturer will pursue this route, only if the incorrect probability distribution Γ generates lower cost values for the distributor’s opponents compared to distribution Ψ. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that Ψ should dominate Γ in some form of stochastic ordering, since otherwise the manufacturer will choose to communicate to the distributor that Ψ rather than Γ should be employed. We make this assumption explicit and we further require that the underlying densities are continuously differentiable.

Stochastic dominance has been widely used in auction theory to reflect asymmetry among players (Maskin & Riley, 2000). The stochastic ranking of the underlying distributions captures the asymmetry of beliefs among the supply chain agents. In this respect, Assumption 1(A) states that distribution Ψ dominates distribution Γ in terms of the ratio of hazard rates. We explore further the connection of this form of stochastic dominance to other more standard types of stochastic ordering (Shaked & Shanthikumar, 2010). In particular, we show that our assumptions results to dominance in hazard rate and first-order stochastic dominance.

                         We further note that, as it will be shown in Theorem 1, below, the quantity I(x|H)/H(x) is the mark-up applied by the distributor in the formulation of the bid, when the underlying cost distribution is H. Therefore, the intuition behind Assumption 2 is that when the cost of a bidder increases, the corresponding mark-up must decrease, in an effort to keep the bid competitive.


                        Assumptions 1 and 2 are sufficient to provide the findings of our analysis. Never-the-less, we may derive the same results with the following weaker assumption.

In view of Eq. (3), when the underlying probability distribution of the cost of the competition is Φ and F
                     =(1−
                     Φ)
                        n
                     , the mark-up of the distributor is μ(c
                     +
                     m, F)=
                     I(c
                     +
                     m|F)/F(c
                     +
                     m). Upstream, the manufacturer’s mark-up m is given by the distributor’s mark-up μ(c
                     +
                     m, H) under H, inflated by the factor λH
                     /λG
                     . By Corollary 1, it is known that the factor λH
                     /λG
                      exceeds 1. We deduce that the mark-up μ(c
                     +
                     m, H), which the downstream agent applies when acting consistently to the belief of the manufacturer and he employs Γ, is lower compared to the mark-up m of the upstream agent. Never-the-less, the actual mark-up of the distributor is in fact μ(c
                     +
                     m, F), rather than μ(c
                     +
                     m, H). Hence, to accurately evaluate the division of profit between the two agents, the comparison should be made between m and μ(c
                     +
                     m, F).

Further, the upstream agent should evaluate the loss of competitiveness of the two agent supply chain in comparison to the case where the manufacturer participates directly in the auction without the involvement of any intermediary, by examining θ
                     =
                     m
                     +
                     μ(c
                     +
                     m, F)−
                     μ(c, G). In particular, θ expresses the difference of mark-up when bidding directly against the scheme of participating indirectly through a distributor. Due to double marginalization, the sign of θ will, in general, be positive. A low value of θ implies that the loss in the overall competitiveness of the final bid, due to the involvement of intermediary parties, is low.

Eq. (5) suggests that the manufacturer is sensitive to any increase of the cost and will try to decrease the mark-up m applied to the transfer price. However, this decrease of the mark-up m will, in general, be less than the corresponding increase of the cost, and, as a result, the transfer price c
                     +
                     m will necessarily become higher.

Since Assumptions 1 and 2 imply Assumption 3, we have also established the following result:
                        Corollary 2
                        
                           Theorem 1 
                           is valid under 
                           Assumptions 1 and 2.

We can also establish an upper bound for the equilibrium mark-up m of the manufacturer.

                     m, G)+
                     m
                     +
                     c is the bid price b(c
                     +
                     m|G), when the probability distribution of the underlying cost of the competition is in accordance to the belief of the manufacturer and the transfer price is c
                     +
                     m. Consequently, we conclude that inequality (6), when keeping m fixed, takes the form:

                     The interpretation of inequality (7) is that, when m remains fixed and the bidding strategy is consistent with the perception of the manufacturer about the competition, the rate of change of the bid price in terms of the cost c is at most as high as the proportion of the distributor’s mark-up μ(c
                     +
                     m, G) with respect to the manufacturer’s mark-up m. Therefore, with m fixed, when the cost c increases by one monetary unit, the increase in the bid price does not exceed the distributor’s mark-up of the bid price on a per monetary unit of m basis.

We examine the case where the distributor accurately and truthfully communicates to the manufacturer all the information that he has about the competition in the local market. In this framework, the manufacturer becomes fully aware of the available information and the method of analysis that the distributor applies for the determination of the probability distribution of the cost of the other auction participants. Consequently, the manufacturer knows precisely the probability distribution Φ, which the distributor employs to determine the bid price. This unilateral upstream communication corresponds, in our previous notation, to the case Γ
                     =
                     Φ. Theorem 1 provides the following result about the equilibrium margin of the manufacturer and the corresponding bidding strategy.

                           Under 
                           Assumption 3, when there is unilateral upstream communication, m⩾μ.
                        


                     Corollary 3 states that the manufacturer applies a higher mark-up compared to the distributor. The reason for the advantageous position of the upstream agent can be traced in Assumption 1. The manufacturer, although aware of the distribution Φ that the distributor considers when determining the bid, knows that the actual probability distribution of the competition is Ψ. Never-the-less, the manufacturer does not inform the distributor about the probability distribution of the cost of the competition. From Proposition 1, Ψ stochastically dominates Γ, which coincides with Φ. Therefore, the manufacturer leaves the distributor under the false impression that the cost for the other auction participants will be lower in a stochastic ordering sense. Consequently, the manufacturer misleads the downstream agent to apply a lower mark-up μ, which will ensure that the final bid price is competitive. At the same time, in light of this fact and knowing that the cost distribution of the competition is actually less aggressive, the manufacturer will set a higher mark-up m in the formulation of the transfer price. In the end, the upstream unilateral communication generates a monetary benefit in the division of profit for the upstream supplier.

In unilateral downstream communication, the manufacturer truthfully communicates to the distributor his estimate Ψ about the probability distribution of the cost of the competition. The manufacturer believes that the downstream agent will adopt Ψ and, as a result, he feels confident that the Γ coincides with Ψ. Although the distributor is fully aware of Ψ, he is not obliged to accept Ψ as the underlying probability distribution. In one-way downstream communication, the distributor does not reveal his own estimate Φ. We distinguish two cases. In the first case, the manufacturer’s estimate Ψ is fully adopted by the distributor, and, consequently, Ψ
                     =
                     Φ. In this setting the supply chain takes the same form as under information sharing, which will be treated in the next section. We now examine the setting of the second case, where the distributor decides to employ Φ rather than Ψ, and Ψ
                     ≠
                     Φ.

From Eq. (4) and by setting Ψ

We have already seen that Assumption 2 ensures that μ(x, G) is decreasing in x. We will assume further that μ(x, F) is decreasing in x. Therefore, we require that when the cost is high, the distributor will decrease his mark-up in an effort to make his bid more competitive against his opponents. In this setting, we can establish the following result.
                        Proposition 8
                        
                           Suppose that μ(x, F) is decreasing in x and 
                           Assumptions 3 
                           holds. Then, in a supply chain with unilateral downstream communication, we have m<μ.
                        

According to Proposition 8, the distributor achieves a higher mark-up compared to the manufacturer. In view of the results in the case of one-way upstream communication, we may conclude that the agent who acquires more comprehensive information about the cost distribution will ultimately enjoy a higher margin and an advantage in the division of the total profit of the supply chain. Therefore, each one of the two agents has no incentive to share his private information with his counterpart. This is in some extent similar to the “prisoner’s dilemma” in a two person game and results to poor overall performance for the supply chain as a whole.

We, now, consider the case where the upstream and downstream supply chain agents engage in an open and truthful two-way exchange of information. The motive of the agents is to combine their knowledge and to develop a common belief about the competition in the auction. Information sharing leads to one single probability distribution, which is mutually agreed by both supply chain partners as best describing the probability distribution of the cost of the auction participants. Consequently, under information sharing Ψ
                     =
                     Γ
                     =
                     Φ.

Information sharing across the supply chain ensures that the mark-up of the manufacturer is equal to the margin, which is applied by the distributor when determining the bid, and profit is equally shared by both partners. With two-way exchange of information, no agent is more informed within the supply chain and, therefore, there is no longer an information advantage which is achieved at the expense of the less informed player. The supply chain operates coherently and the goals of both the manufacturer and the distributor are perfectly aligned and focused on winning the auction. In this way, the predictive ability of the supply chain as a whole is enhanced as the two agents can share information and formulate together a common belief about the probability distribution of the cost of their competition.

If the manufacturer had decided to bid directly in the auction without any intermediary supply agent, the equilibrium bid B would be: B
                     =
                     c
                     +
                     I(c|F)/F(c). Therefore, under information sharing, bidding through the distributor raises the final bid price by an amount equal to:

It is clear that, due to double marginalization, the bid price, when auction participation involves an intermediary, is higher compared to bidding directly. In the environment of information sharing and when the underlying distribution of the cost is the uniform distribution in [0,1], the mark-up strategy of the manufacturer and the bid price of the distributor can be easily calculated and explicitly expressed.

In the case of a uniform in [0,1] underlying distribution, when no intermediary is involved, the optimal bid is: B
                     =
                     c+(1−
                     c)/(n

We observe that, for n
                     =2, the presence of intermediaries generates an additional mark-up, which is 50% of the mark-up under direct participation. As n becomes large, the additional mark-up β – B caused by the two-agent supply chain becomes approximately equal in magnitude to the mark-up without intermediaries B
                     −
                     c.

Further, the total mark-up of the manufacturer–distributor supply chain is: β
                     −
                     c
                     =(β
                     −
                     B)+(B
                     −
                     c).Therefore, for n large, β
                     −
                     c becomes approximately twice the mark-up of the supply chain without any intermediary B

                     c. In practice, the manufacturer should weigh the derived benefit of participation in the auction though the distributor against the additional mark-up in the final bid β, which comes with a corresponding drop of probability of success in the auction.

In this section, we derive the ex-ante expected manufacturer mark-up E(m) and the ex ante manufacturer profit E(π), when the underlying probability distribution of the cost of the auction bidders is Ψ. Therefore, the ex-ante expectation of the mark-up and profit of the manufacturer are calculated according to the beliefs of the manufacturer regarding the cost distribution of the competition.

We note that the scale factor 1/n comes from the symmetry of the bidders in our auction environment. Proposition 10 allows us to distinguish two additive components for the expected mark-up of the manufacturer. For an event A, I[A] denotes the indicator function of A, taking the value of 1 when A is realized and 0 otherwise. Eq. (14) can be expressed in the form:

                     Y, which occurs when the manufacturer and the distributor win the auction, as the cost Y is below the minimum cost of the competition. Therefore, intuitively, this component represents the mark-up which is achieved by the manufacturer from the bidding process. The second term in Eq. (16) expresses the margin which is generated by the lack of exchange of information between the supply chain agents. When the minimum cost of all competitors X

                     ) stands below the cost Y, the manufacturer can still obtain a potential profit due to the erroneous perception of the distributor about the competition. According to the manufacturer, the distributor employs Γ as the underlying probability distribution rather than Ψ, and, for this reason, he bids more aggressively compared to the bid price under Ψ. The manufacturer–distributor supply chain can be successful in the auction even though Y exceeds the minimum cost of the competition. Therefore, the second component in Eq. (16) captures this additional contribution to the manufacturer mark-up.

Similarly to Eq. (16), we may represent the expected profit of the manufacturer in Eq. (15) as the sum of two components:

                     As before, intuitively, the first component expresses the contribution to the manufacturer’s profit by the auction bidding process, while the second term captures the profit which is achieved by the lack of communication within the supply chain.

In this section we illustrate the model investigating different scenarios of communication among the agents and employing particular forms for the underlying probability distributions.

We consider first the case where the two agents are not willing to inform their supply chain partner about their belief for the probability distribution of the cost of the competition. In the scenario that we investigate, the manufacturer believes that the cost x of the other bidders follows distribution Ψ, with cumulative distribution function Ψ(x)=(1−
                        ex
                        )/(1−
                        e), for x in [0,1]. Moreover, the manufacturer is of the opinion that the uniform distribution in [0,1] best describes the belief of the distributor about the competition. Consequently, Γ(x)=
                        x, for x in [0,1].

We observe that distribution Ψ first-order stochastically dominates distribution Γ, as Ψ(x)=(1−
                        ex
                        )/(1−
                        e)⩽
                        Γ(x)=
                        x. It is easy to verify that the conditions of Assumption 1 are satisfied for these two distributions. In particular, for Assumption 1(A), we note that the ratio of the hazard rates:

                        Assumption 1(B) holds with γ(x)=1, γ′(x)=0, ψ(x)=−ex

                         provides the mark-up m when n takes values from 2 to 5 and for different values of c. We observe that as c increases the markup m drops, which is, of course, expected from Eq. (5) of Theorem 1. Further, as the number n of competing bidders increases, competition becomes more aggressive and the mark-up m becomes lower.

In the scenario that we examine and for illustrative purposes, the downstream agent believes that the probability distribution of the cost of the competition is best described by Φ(x)=(1−

It is clear that, in the absence of exchange of information, the beliefs of the two supply chain agents remain completely different. The mark-up of the distributor μ for the corresponding values of c and nι can also be found in Table 2.

We proceed with a scenario of one-way upstream communication. In particular, the distributor believes that the underlying probability distribution Φ of the cost of the competition is best described by the uniform in [0,1] distribution and he unilaterally informs the manufacturer about this belief. As a result, the upstream agent is certain that Γ is the uniform in [0,1] distribution. Never-the-less, the manufacturer believes, without informing the distributor, that the actual probability distribution of the competition is Ψ(x)=(1−
                        ex
                        )/(1−
                        e) for x in [0,1]. The mark-up of the manufacturer m and the distributor’s margin μ, when c ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 and for different values of n, appear in Table 3
                        .


                        Table 3 demonstrates that the value of μ is, in all cases, lower than the corresponding value of m in consistency with Proposition 7. The manufacturer enjoys an information advantage, which allows him to apply a higher margin and capture a larger share of the overall profit of the supply chain. It is also clear from Table 3 that as the cost c increases, the impact of the information advantage becomes less intense and the difference between m and μ decreases. In essence, the higher value of c forces both supply agents to apply relatively low margins, shrinking the effect of the information advantage of the manufacturer. A similar remark can be made for the difference in the two margins as the number n of opponents increases. The presence of more aggressive competition lowers the effect of the advantageous position of the informed agent.

We now turn our attention to a scenario of downstream communication. In this setting, the manufacturer believes that the underlying probability distribution of the cost of the competition is Ψ(x)=(1−
                        ex
                        )/(1−
                        e) for x in [0,1] and communicates this information to the downstream agent. The manufacturer believes that the distributor determines the bid price using the probability distribution Γ(x)=
                        Ψ(x). We consider the case in which the distributor is confident about his own estimate Φ(x)=(1−
                        e
                        2
                        
                           x
                        )/(1−
                        e
                        2) for x in [0,1] and, consequently, he will not adopt the probability distribution, which the manufacturer proposes. At the same time, communication is one-way and the distributor does not communicate to the upstream agent his beliefs.

We observe that Φ(x) first order stochastically dominates Ψ(x). Intuitively, the cost of the competition tends to take lower values under Ψ(x) and, therefore, under Ψ(x) the manufacturer is forced to apply a lower mark-up m in the transfer price, to ensure that the final bid price is competitive. Proposition 8 allows us to compute the corresponding mark-up, which the each one of the two supply chain agents will employ. In particular, m is the solution of the following equation:

                        The values for the mark-up m and μ, when the number of components n is from 2 to 5 and c ranges from 0.1 to 0.9, can be found in Table 4
                        .


                        Table 4 clearly illustrates the information advantage of the downstream agent by the unilateral downstream communication, as it is evident from the fact that the distributor is able to enjoy a higher mark-up compared to the manufacturer. When the cost c increases, the difference in mark-up for the informed agent diminishes. Intuitively, the distributor will have to counter the high values of the cost c with a lower mark-up μ.

Finally, we consider a scenario in which the manufacturer and the distributor engage in truthful bilateral information sharing. The two supply chain partners both agree that the underlying distribution describing the cost of the auction participants is given by Φ(x)=
                        Γ(x)=
                        Ψ(x)=(1−
                        ex
                        )/(1−
                        e) for x in [0,1]. From Proposition 9, the manufacturer and the distributor apply the same mark-up m, which we obtain by solving Eq. (16). Table 5
                         provides the mark-up m when n ranges from 2 to 5 and for different values of c.

Comparing Table 5 with Tables 3 and 4, we observe that, when there is bilateral exchange of information, no agent enjoys an information advantage and the mark-up of the informed player is drastically reduced, while, at the same time, the margin of the uninformed supply chain partner increases. The drop of the mark-up of the informed agent, once bilateral communication is established, appears to be higher than the raise of the margin of the uninformed player. The reason for this asymmetry is that agents revise their mark-up differently. The uninformed agent, who had expected more aggressive competition and, now, learns that the cost of each one of his opponents is in fact “higher” in a stochastic sense, is able to increase his margin and avoid unnecessarily low pricing. The informed agent, on the other hand, will see his margin suffer because he can no longer exploit the erroneous perception of his supply chain partner about the underlying competition. As c and n increases, both agents are forced to lower their mark-ups in order to ensure that the final bid price remains competitive, and, therefore, information sharing tends to provide less intense changes in the margins of the two players compared to the respective values in one-way communication.

We may also compare the margins in information sharing, as it appears in Table 5, with the respective mark-ups of Table 2, where there is no exchange of information. It is evident that both agents apply a lower mark-up once they communicate to each other their beliefs about the competition. In bilateral communication, the manufacturer can no longer expect that the distributor will erroneously overrate the aggressiveness of the competition and, consequently, the transfer price will necessarily drop. On the other hand, the distributor revises his initial belief about the competition and, in our scenario he fully adopts the perspective of the manufacturer. Due to information sharing, the distributor realizes that the cost of his competitors is “lower” in a stochastic sense than what he had anticipated, and, therefore, he is forced to decrease his margin. Never-the-less, although the mark-up of both agents is reduced, the supply chain partners, under information sharing, can more accurately predict the behavior of the other bidders.

In our numerical illustration, we have considered the case where, under information sharing, the distributor fully adopts the perspective of the manufacturer about the competition. In practice, the bilateral exchange of information will enable both agents to revise their initial probability distributions for the underlying cost, until they reach a common perspective about the competition.

We have examined a supply chain with double marginalization leading to a sealed bid lowest price procurement auction with private values. In this environment, following a game-theoretic approach, we derived the optimal mark-up of the upstream and downstream supplier. The proposed bidding strategies maximize the expected profit of each agent. In our analysis we have assumed that all players are risk neutral with respect to monetary payoffs and know precisely their own cost. Moreover, bidders are assumed symmetric in terms of the underlying cost distribution and cost values are independently distributed. In future research, each one of these assumptions could be relaxed by expanding the model within the standard methodology of auction theory.

We have assumed that each agent of the supply chain cooperates with only one player and we have argued that this assumption is plausible in procurement environments, such as public procurement. In general, however, the manufacturer or distributor may decide to cooperate simultaneously with other competing agents. For example, the manufacturer may offer the same product to more than one distributor with or without price differentiation. It will, then, be important to clearly define the information structure of such a supply network. For example, the model should clarify which, if any, of the competing distributors are aware of the fact that the manufacturer is willing to supply the same product to different agents, as well as to what extent the different transfer prices are known. Moreover, conditionally on the information about the different transfer prices, bidders will asymmetrically revise their prior probability distribution of the cost of the competition, generating an asymmetric auction environment.

A more complex network would allow some distributors to cooperate with multiple manufacturers and some manufacturers to supply more than one distributor (Elmaghraby, 2000). Clearly, this form of supply chain introduces another layer of competition between manufacturers and distributors, and it could be argued qualitatively that it will lead to more aggressive bidding. Information asymmetries become more involved and partnership commitments are no longer in place. In this scheme, it will be necessary to specify how distributors will choose the manufacturer that they will eventually cooperate with in case of winning. One alternative would be to conduct a contingent auction to select the manufacturer, who will supply the product. This contingent auction could take place before or after the central downstream auction. Similarly, the manufacturer may implement a contingent auction mechanism to select the distributor who is willing to pay the highest transfer price to purchase the product. The investigation of the optimal mark-up and the equilibrium bidding strategies of these complex supply chain arrangements constitutes a challenging direction of future research. In conclusion, we believe that, in future research, the supply chain structure that we developed could serve as the basis for the analysis of more complex supply chain environments, with various types of interactions among agents and under different communication systems.

Our findings demonstrated that the form of supply chain that we examined is sensitive to information asymmetry between agents. Concealing information about the level of competition provides an advantage in the division of the total profit. On the contrary, information sharing results to an equal distribution of the total profit among the supply chain partners. Information asymmetry was based exclusively on lack of information sharing. Agents in our model may choose to conceal or, alternatively, share information but, clearly, another and, certainly, unethical, if not illegal, option would be to deliberately distort information, which is communicated to the other party. In such a general scheme, each agent communicates the most preferable for the agent probability distribution of the underlying cost of the competition. Of course, it remains unclear whether the particular probability distribution will be eventually adopted by the other supply chain agent. Although we have assumed in our analysis that the manufacturer and distributor do not engage in such unethical behavior, intentional distortion of information may actually appear in practice.

In general, it is not easy to enforce and monitor the exchange of information between supply chain partners. The type of information required will have to be clearly defined and agreed between the agents involved. Ideally, there should be an agreement on the type of data, which will be shared, and the statistical techniques that will be used to estimate the underlying cost distribution of opponent bidders. In this respect, a number of obstacles may prohibit information sharing. Data gathered from past auctions is typically filtered in many ways with regard to its relevance to future supplies. Moreover, the estimate about the underlying probability distribution of competitors’ cost is, usually, not formally recorded in a company’s knowledge base. Consequently, the design and negotiation of contracts leading to partnership relations with information sharing and cooperative decision making is a challenging task. Information models of supply chain networks (Fiala, 2005), combining non-cooperative and cooperative behavior, may be useful in this direction. The optimal information sharing mechanism may eventually involve bilateral negotiation. In order to induce each agent to truthfully report to his partner the available private information, each agent’s profit can be set to be his Shapley value, which provides the payoff that each player should reasonably expect in a co-operative game (Osborne & Rubinstein, 1994). Intuitively, the Shapley value reflects the notion that each agent’s payoff from bargaining depends on the agent’s marginal contribution to the total supply chain performance. Exploring bargaining mechanisms along this framework remains an open question.

Finally, the auction setting could be extended to include multi-dimensional competition as, for example, auctions for which price and quality are both evaluated by a scoring rule (Beil & Wein, 2003; Che, 1993). In such an environment, the structure of information asymmetry in the manufacturer–distributor supply chain becomes more complex and the exchange of information more difficult to achieve. It would be of interest to investigate whether similar results to our findings may be derived in a multi-dimensional auction setting.

Eq. (4) is equivalent to the implicit equation A(c, m)=0. We employ the Implicit Function Theorem, according to which in a neighborhood of (c, m), we can write m

                           m(c). Moreover, we compute:

Consider the case where m
                     ⩾
                     m
                     ∗. Suppose that z
                     <
                     c. Eq. (5) ensures that the function z
                     +
                     m(z) is non-decreasing and the function m(z) is non-increasing. Then, z
                     +
                     m(z)⩽
                     c
                     +
                     m(c), and, equivalently, c
                     +
                     m
                     ⩽
                     c
                     +
                     m
                     ∗, which is a contradiction. Consequently, we have z
                     ⩾
                     c. It follows from Eq. (5) that m(z)⩽
                     m(c). Finally, given that G(c
                     +
                     m)⩾0, it follows from equation (A.5) that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ∂

                                 ∂
                                 m
                              
                           
                           ⩽
                           0
                        
                     .

Proceeding with a similar argument, it may be shown that for m
                     ⩽
                     m
                     ∗, it holds that
