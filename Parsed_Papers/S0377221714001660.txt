                      system consisting of line-replaceable units, its operational availability depends on component reliability, its redundancy level, and spare parts availability. As a result, it is important to consider redundancy allocation and spare parts provisioning simultaneously in maximizing the system’s operational availability. In prior studies, however, these important aspects are often handled separately in the areas of reliability engineering and spare parts logistics. In this paper, we study a collection of operational availability maximization problems, in which the component redundancy and the spares stocking quantities are to be determined simultaneously under economic and physical constraints. To solve this type of problem, continuous-time Markov chain models are developed first for a single repairable k-out-of-

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Design for reliability and spare parts logistics are among the most important aspects in bringing the operational availability of a repairable system to a required level. The goal of reliability assignment is to determine component (or subsystem) reliability in order to meet the system reliability requirement. This may be achieved by investing more resources in product design and manufacturing. If the individual component reliability is difficult to achieve through engineering development, redundancy can be considered as a useful alternative. Various configurations, such as parallel system and k-out-of-
                        
                           n
                           :
                           G
                        
                      system, are widely used in redundant designs. Depending on different needs, duplicated components can be configured in hot-standby (i.e., active-standby), warm-standby, or cold-standby mode. To optimize system reliability, the number of redundant units must be determined under economic and physical constraints. In addition to design for reliability, studies on spare parts logistics are concerned with the planning and operation of inventory systems that supply spare units upon request. In other words, reliability and redundancy allocations aim at increasing the system uptime, while spare parts logistics attempts to reduce the system downtime.

To drive system operational availability, it is necessary to synthesize redundancy allocation and spare parts logistics under a unified decision-making framework. In the past, decisions on these aspects were usually made by manufacturers and end users independently. With the advent of product-service integration, there is a growing trend that the after-sales maintenance and support are fully integrated with the design and manufacturing process. Under this new business model, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) makes the full commitment to the reliability performance over the product lifetime. This new reliability management approach is often called “total lifetime service agreements” in commercial airlines, or referred to as “performance-based contracting (PBC)” in the defense industry (Kim, Cohen, & Netessine, 2007). PBC is envisioned as a new service model that lowers the ownership cost while guaranteeing the system performance. The goal of PBC is to motivate the OEM to offer reliable and cost-effective products through design for reliability and responsive maintenance services. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop new analytical models and decision-support tools that aid product manufacturers in optimizing resource allocations in design, manufacturing, and after-sales support.

In this paper, we explicitly integrate hot-standby redundancy and spares inventory to drive the operational availability of repairable systems. The goal is to maximize the system operational availability by determining the levels of component redundancy and base-stock inventory. This joint decision-making problem can be considered as an extension of reliability-redundancy allocation problems (Kuo & Wan, 2007) by incorporating spares inventory as a new dimension in decision making. On the other hand, this study also extends spare parts logistics models by incorporating the concept of design for reliability through active redundancy allocation. The contribution of this work is twofold: mathematical modeling and managerial insight. Methodologically, we make an early attempt to maximize the system operational availability by jointly optimizing the component redundancy and the spare parts stock. Moreover, the managerial insights gained from this study show that operational availability is relatively independent of parts availability when hot-standby redundancy is properly incorporated into the system. Such a joint decision-making issue has not been well studied in the areas of reliability engineering and operations management.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A review of related literature is provided in Section 2. Section 3 presents a detailed problem description and the basic assumptions. Section 4 provides the mathematical models for a repairable k-out-of-

Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and discusses our future research directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Reliability-redundancy allocation problems are often formulated to either maximize system reliability or to minimize costs subject to reliability requirements (Kuo & Wan, 2007). Decision variables usually include component types, component reliability, and redundancy level. Essentially, such mathematical formulations belong to mixed integer non-linear programming problems that have been shown to be NP-hard (Chern, 1992). To solve this type of optimization problems, various techniques, such as branch-and-bound (Ha & Kuo, 2006), genetic algorithm (Coit & Smith, 1996), tabu search (Kulturel-Konak, Smith, & Coit, 2003), and column generation (Zia & Coit, 2010), have been reported in the literature.

To streamline the maintenance and repair of these systems, spare parts logistics issues need to be carefully studied. The theory of spare parts logistics can be dated back to 1960s when Sherbrooke (1968) introduced the multi-echelon technique for recoverable item control (METRIC) model with the objective of minimizing the parts backorders. Following this seminal work, a variety of inventory models have been developed, which include multi-indenture, capacitated repair, and transshipment (Axsäter, Howard, & Marklund, 2013; Cochran & Lewis, 2002; Muckstadt, 1973). In general, these models seek the best stocking level and/or stocking locations to maximize the spare parts availability, or to minimize the inventory cost while satisfying a pre-determined service level. Two continuous-review policies are often used in managing spare parts inventory (Guide & Srivastava, 1997; Kennedy, Patterson, & Fredendall, 2002): (1) 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy, where s is the reorder point and S represents the order-up-to-level; and (2) 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      policy, where Q represents the order quantity, and r is the reorder point. Because repairable parts are often capital-intensive and have long lifetime, a one-for-one replenishment policy is frequently adopted (i.e., base-stock model, 
                        
                           (
                           S
                           -
                           1
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                     ) (Graves, 1985). As an alternative, Diallo, Aït-Kadi, and Chelbi (2008) sought a joint preventive maintenance and spare parts provisioning strategy to improve the system availability using a 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      policy. Recently, Jin and Liao (2009) proposed a multi-phase adaptive 
                        
                           (
                           Q
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                        
                      control policy considering fleet size expansion, which differs from those well-studied fixed-fleet-size problems (Elsayed, 2012). With few exceptions, the METRIC model and its variations usually use inventory backorders or parts fill rate to measure the system performance.

Recently, a small, but growing, number of papers intend to maximize system availability by synthesizing reliability allocation with spare parts provisioning. For example, Öner, Kiesmüller, and van Houtum (2010) used an Erlang loss model (i.e., 
                        
                           M
                           /
                           G
                           /
                           s
                           /
                           s
                        
                      queue) to estimate the parts availability, based on which the system cost was minimized by coordinating the component reliability with the base-stock level. Jin and Tian (2012) jointly optimized the component reliability and spares inventory to minimize the product life-cycle cost for a growing installed base. More recently, Selçuk and Agˇrali (2013) investigated the trade-off between component reliability and the spares stocking level for multi-item systems subject to parts availability requirements.

It is worth pointing out that the main focus of the aforementioned studies is on the allocation of inventory resources and parts availability. However, it is obvious that the parts availability is not fully aligned with the operational availability because the latter also depends on the component redundancy level. In particular, if n identical components are working in a hot-standby mode (de Smidt-Destombes, van der Heijden, & van Harten, 2004), the redundancy level is said to be n. de Smidt-Destombes, van der Heijden, and van Harten (2006) studied the availability of k-out-of-
                        
                           n
                           :
                           G
                        
                      systems, but they only concentrated on spare parts logistics without considering redundancy allocation. Moghaddass and Zuo (2011) investigated the trade-off between the configuration of a repairable k-out-of-n:G system and its maintenance time. An optimization model was used to minimize the overall operation and maintenance cost under availability, space, and budgetary constraints assuming spare parts are always available.

In the literature, there are two papers that are the most closely related to our work. Graves (2003) studied a service support system for a fleet of home-installed dialysis units. The objective is to determine the inventory and work load of service engineers from the manufacturer’s perspective when a unit can be re-manufactured at a repair center. The operation of this service support system is similar to our integrated product-service system, in which both product failures and maintenance logistics are considered. However, our study is focused on a customer who has a spare parts inventory but not a repair center. Moreover, we study the availability of a k-out-of-n system with hot-standby redundant units instead of a single-unit system, and our goal is to simultaneously determine the redundancy and spares stocking levels.

The other paper addressing the joint optimization of component redundancy and spares stocking is due to Öner, Scheller-Wolf, and van Houtum (2013). In their model, on-site cold-standby components are allocated for individual systems each consisting of multiple components. This model is equivalent to a two-echelon service supply chain network, in which the spares inventory at the customer site is treated as cold-standby units. In their study, each subsystem is equivalent to a 1-out-of-2 system with one cold-standby unit. Their contribution lies in the joint optimization of component redundancy and spare parts inventory. The decision is whether a single component or two parallel components should be adopted for each subsystem considering additional costs. In this paper, we also focus on system operational availability by adopting redundancy strategy, but our approach is different from that of Öner et al. (2013) in three aspects. First, we consider hot-standby redundancy, for which the standby units and the primary units in the system are in a fully active mode. If components are in cold standby as used in Öner et al. (2013), switching failures may occur when standby units are to be activated. Second, our k-out-of-n system model (

                      as in Öner et al. (2013). Third, we develop analytical models to characterize system operational availability and parts availability, and to further explore their relationship. In Öner et al. (2013), however, the cumulative downtime was used to measure the system availability, yet the correlation between the parts availability and system operational availability was not provided.

As a motivating example, we consider a company that plans to establish a manufacturing facility with n identical machines and to store spare parts of a critical component for those machines. If the critical component on a machine fails, production on this machine stops. To meet the production demand, at least k machines must be operational at any point in time, and the operational availability of the manufacturing system is the corresponding probability. Spare parts can be ordered from a supplier with a random lead time. Given a limited budget for keeping those machines operating and managing the spare parts inventory, the goal is to maximize the operational availability of the fleet. A similar problem can be found in a distributed energy storage system, where a certain number of batteries are expected to be available for supplying the required amount of electricity at a certain voltage level (McDowal, 2009). For these examples, each failure of the system does not prohibit the operation of the rest of units. Another situation is that failures of a certain number of components force the system and the rest of components to stop until some or all of the failed components are replaced or repaired. For example, it may be possible to drive a car with a V8-engine if at least four cylinders are operational. In CANDU nuclear power plants, when any of the ten reactor operational parameters under surveillance goes beyond the safety range, the contacts of at least two relays in the emergency shutdown systems are open upon receiving the trip signal, and the shutoff rods are dropped into the reactor to shut it down (Power, 1999).

All the four systems in the above examples can be treated as a repairable k-out-of-
                        
                           n

                      system with hot standby units. Although their shut-off rules are different, both the redundancy level (i.e., n) of the component and the inventory level of spare parts must be determined simultaneously.


                     Fig. 1
                      illustrates the operation and support of such a repairable system, in which the levels of redundancy and base stock are to be determined simultaneously. It is worth pointing out that Moghaddass, Zuo, and Qu (2011) considered three types of shut-off rules, i.e., suspended animation (SA), continuous operation (CO) and mixture of the two, as well as R repairmen in analyzing the reliability and availability of a repairable k-out-of-

                      system. Under the SA shut-off rule, no component operates while the system is in a down state. On the other hand, when the CO shut-off rule is used, non-failed components continue to operate regardless of the number of failed components. In this paper, we focus on the case with a mixed shut-off rule (CO and SA are its special cases) and one repairman in redundancy allocation and spare parts logistics, but the cases with R repairmen and batch spare parts orders can be handled similarly. Moreover, we extend the model for a single repairable k-out-of-

Because of the series structure, the system is available if and only if all the subsystems are available. To assist our presentation, the following assumptions are made for such joint decision-making problems.

A base-stock inventory control policy is adopted for spare parts provisioning, and the spare part is capital-intensive and provided by a supplier under a one-for-one replenishment policy. An order is placed right after the completion of a replacement action, and the replenishment lead time follows the exponential distribution

                                     is the mean replenishment lead time;

When a spare part is available, the time required to replace a failed unit follows the exponential distribution 
                                       
                                          exp
                                          (
                                          r
                                          )
                                       
                                     where 
                                       
                                          1
                                          /
                                          r
                                       
                                     is the mean replacement time. Replacing failed unit (s) by a dedicated repairman (first-come, first served [FCFS]) will not affect the lifetimes of non-failed units.

It is worth pointing out that the assumption about independent failures is frequently used in system reliability analysis (Kuo & Zuo, 2003; Moghaddass et al., 2011), which makes reliability-redundancy allocation problems easier to solve. However, this assumption does not always hold true in some real-world applications. In some systems, the failure of a component may increase the failure rates of the rest of components. In this paper, we only focus on redundant systems with independent failures. For more complex systems with dependent failures, readers are referred to (Elsayed, 2012).

                        . It is worth pointing out that the on-hand inventory j in each state includes the spares that have been allocated to replace those failed units and the ones to be allocated. At the beginning, the on-hand inventory equals the base-stock level m. Upon a unit failure, an available spare part is allocated by the repairman, but the on-hand inventory level remains unchanged until either a failed unit is actually replaced and a new part is ordered (j drops by one), or a previously ordered part arrives before the ongoing replacement is complete (j increases by one). The model in Fig. 2 is generic. Under the SA shut-off rule, the associated CTMC can be represented by Fig. 2 with

                        ; under the CO shut-off rule (i.e., 
                           
                              s

                        .

To illustrate Proposition 1, we consider a problem setting given in Table 1
                        . One can see that, when 
                           
                              λ
                              ,

In the literature, most studies on redundancy allocation neglects spare parts in decision making. The next proposition shows the role of spare parts replenishment and repair in determining the long-run mean time between failures of the system (MTBFS).

For the same problem setting as given in Tables 1 and 2
                         shows the impact of spare parts replenishment rate on the system’s MTBFS. Obviously, neglecting the shortage of spare parts leads to an optimistic estimate of MTBFS. This can be verified by calculating the corresponding MTBFS using

Moreover, we define the spare parts availability as the probability that the number of on-hand spare units is not less than the number of failed units (i.e., the probability of no stock-out). Then, the spare parts availability can be expressed as

                         failed units, spare parts are available if the on-hand inventory is high enough for replacing all the failed units. Theoretically, the base stock level can exceed the redundancy level. However, in reality, the base stock level is always less than the redundancy level since the spare parts are expensive. In practice, it is important to balance the component redundancy level and spare parts inventory under budgetary constraints while meeting operational and/or spare parts availability goal. The following theorem offers the insight into the relationship between the system operational availability and spare parts availability.

Note that, our model does not naturally include the case with

                         (i.e., zero inventory). In fact, this case belongs to a classical redundancy allocation problem. Because the customer does not hold spare parts, another CTMC model should be used. In particular, if the lead time is zero, the corresponding CTMC model is exactly the same as the one provided by Moghaddass et al. (2011) under a one-repairman case; when the lead time cannot be ignored, the CTMC model in Fig. 4
                         should be used, where

                        ) represents the state that there are i non-failed components and a part is (not) delivered at present. Similar analysis can be conducted to evaluate the operational availability and to optimize the redundancy level n for such a system. In this paper, we only focus on the case with 
                           
                              m

                        ), each subsystem can be represented by a CTMC model similar to the one in Figs. 2 or 3. Assuming these subsystems are mutually independent, the availability of the overall system can be simply expressed as the product of the availabilities of the subsystems

Our objective is to determine the optimal strategy for allocating component redundancy and spare parts such that the system operational availability is maximized. Meanwhile, the spare parts availability is required to be above a certain level in order to mitigate backorders. Let RPA be the required parts availability and

Furthermore, due to budget and/or physical constraints, let N and M be the upper limits for the redundancy level and the base-stock level, respectively. The optimal joint redundancy allocation and spare parts inventory control policy can be obtained by solving the following integer nonlinear programming problem

                         to achieve the highest OOA. On the other hand, if the operational cost

                         is increased (Cases 3.D, 3.B, and 3.E), the OOA decreases because one has to lower the redundancy or the inventory level to meet the budget constraint. However, when the holding cost

                         is increased (Cases 3.F, 3.B and 3.G), the situation is different in that the OOA does not have the monotonic behavior. For example, when 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                              
                           
                         is increased from $1/day to $2/day, we can choose to increase the base-stock level from 2 to 9 which increases the OOA with a reduction in the redundancy level from 5 to 4; as 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                              
                           
                         is increased from $2/day to $3/day, we can reduce the base-stock level from 9 to 6 resulting in a lower OOA. Moreover, the monotonicity properties of OOA and optimal parts availability (OPA) are not necessarily the same when the redundancy and inventory are coordinated simultaneously. This observation is quite important in PBC programs, as the customers’ focus is typically on whether the system is able to meet the operational availability goal even though the parts availability is low. Moreover, if the spare parts lead time becomes shorter (Cases 3.H, 3.I, and 3.B), it is possible to maintain a higher OOA without changing the redundancy level of the system while reducing the base-stock level. Lastly, when the part replenishment rate 
                           
                              τ
                           
                         is increased from 1 part/day to 2 parts/day, the base-stock level decreases from 11 to 9 while both the OPA and OOA increase. This is because when spare parts can be replenished in a shorter time, the parts availability requirement RPA can still be satisfied with lower inventory.

The patterns in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                         are similar to that of Table 3. The 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         marks indicate that the decisions change due to the increased number of suspended components. However, most of the optimal decisions remain the same. With the same optimal decisions, the OOA and OPA increase as the number of suspended components (i.e., s) increases. Similar analysis can be conducted for other parameter settings.

Moreover, when the redundancy level is predetermined (say

For comparison purposes, several cases presented in Table 3 are included by considering different, yet fixed, redundancy levels.

                        , the OPA decreases as the redundancy level increases and it may reach a quite low level (e.g., 0.5836). This means that, once the redundancy level is predetermined, the system’s operational availability can still be maintained at a high level because of the redundancy although the parts availability may be below the targeted level. This is quite important and indeed contrary to prior research (e.g., de Smidt-Destombes et al. (2004)).

To further explore the implication of our joint decision-making methodology, we consider an actual type of capital equipment consisting of several repairable k-out-of-
                           
                              n
                              :

                         subsystems. Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is a high-end electronic system broadly used to test micro-devices at the back-end of semiconductor manufacturing process. Depending on the system performance, the price of a system ranges from $1–3 million (not including the operation and maintenance costs). From a functional point of view, an ATE machine can be considered as a series system consisting of five k-out-of-
                           
                              n
                              :
                              G
                           
                         subsystems. These subsystems include Digital, Direct Current (DC), Analog, Microwave, and Support modules. For each subsystem, the customer is able to determine the redundancy level of individual modules at the time of purchase. Fig. 6
                         shows a generic ATE system configured with nine Digital, four DC, three Analog, two Microwave, and two Support modules. There are still several empty slots in the system for adding redundant modules. In addition to a budgetary constraint, the number of slots in such an ATE system is the physical constraint that must be satisfied. It is worth mentioning that the failure downtime cost is quite high for such an ATE system. Indeed, a study showed that the hourly downtime cost of an ATE system ranges from $10,000-$30,000 depending on the device under test (Evans, 1999). As a result, the operational availability of an ATE system is vitally important, which can be maximized via a joint consideration of module-level redundancy and spare parts provisioning.

                        ). One can see that the optimal decision is to allocate one more component to Digital and DC subsystems while remaining the minimum numbers of components for other subsystems. This is because the required numbers of non-failed components for these two subsystems are higher than the others. With high reliability and short replenishment and repair cycles, the result suggests to store two spare parts for DC as the corresponding holding cost is low and required number of non-failed components is high, while keeping only one spare part for the other four subsystems.

                         also shows a sensitivity analysis on the most critical component in this system, i.e., Microwave, which has the highest failure rate, longest replenishment lead time, and lowest repair rate. One can see that the system’s operational availability is relatively robust to the deviations of failure rate (

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper proposes an integrated framework to maximize the k-out-of-n:G system availability by jointly allocating redundant components and spare parts under economic and physical constraints. CTMC models are developed to estimate the steady-state system operational availability at different redundancy and parts stocking levels. The models are further extended to series systems consisting of multiple k-out-of-n:G subsystems. Our study is among the early attempts to drive system availability through the joint allocation on hot-standby components and spare parts inventory. Three interesting findings are obtained. First, the system operational availability is always higher than or equal to the parts availability as long as the redundancy level is not below the sum of base-stock level and the minimum required working units within the system. Second, even if the parts availability descends, the system operational availability can be still increased because of the hot-standby operating mode. This is in contrast to the conventional belief that high operational availability is proportional to parts availability. Last, under the redundancy and inventory constraints, the gain of the parts availability by reducing the replenishment lead time depends on the joint consideration of the spare parts quantity and component redundancy levels.

The CTMC models (Figs. 2 and 3) presented in this paper can be potentially extended to describe a special case involving dependent failures by incorporating state-dependent transition rates. Nevertheless, some challenging issues still remain open. For instance, constructing a general model that encompasses both zero and nonzero inventory cases would be quite useful. In addition, our model is applicable to capital-intensive industries where the owners strive to fully utilize their equipment. However, in some applications the load on individual equipment (e.g., peak-time generators) may vary dramatically over time. How to model and maximize the equipment availability and service performance under a time-varying load is another attractive topic. These research directions will be pursued in our future work.
