                  Nowadays, the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic sarcoma pose a major surgical challenge for reconstruction in orthopedics. With the development of manufacturing technology, the metal 3D-printed customized implants have brought revolution for the limb-salvage resection and reconstruction surgery. However, the tumor resection is not without risk and the precise implant placement is very difficult due to the anatomic intricacies of the pelvis. In this study, a surgical navigation system including the implant calibration algorithm has been developed, so that the surgical instruments and the 3D-printed customized implant can be tracked and rendered on the computer screen in real time, minimizing the risks and improving the precision of the surgery. Both the phantom experiment and the pilot clinical case study presented the feasibility of our computer-aided surgical navigation system. According to the accuracy evaluation experiment, the precision of customized implant installation can be improved three to five times (TRE: 0.75±0.18mm) compared with the non-navigated implant installation after the guided osteotomy (TRE: 3.13±1.28mm), which means it is sufficient to meet the clinical requirements of the pelvic reconstruction. However, more clinical trials will be conducted in the future work for the validation of the reliability and efficiency of our navigation system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During the past decades, the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic sarcoma still pose a major surgical challenge in orthopedics [1]. With the development of molecular biology, biological materials, medical imaging, biomechanics, surgical techniques, comprehensive treatment, etc., the survival rate of pelvic sarcoma patients has been significantly increased [2]. However, since the traditional clinical treatments of pelvic sarcoma including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy cannot remove the pelvic oppression thoroughly, leading to high rate of associated complications, it is still a significant clinical problem in terms of improving the curative effect of patients, especially for the malignant tumors of the pelvis [3]. Nowadays, the resection surgery of pelvic sarcoma combined with the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been one of the most important kinds of orthopedic surgeries, while being widely accepted as a standard treatment by surgeons [4]. The advantages of the pelvic sarcoma resection surgery are described as follows: firstly, it can obtain an adequate surgical margin with the pelvic tumor completely removed; secondly, the local pain can be relieved promptly and the quality of life for the patient can be greatly improved [5]; thirdly, it can eliminate the oncothlipsis to the pelvis and prevent tumor recurrence effectively [6].

After the pelvic sarcoma resection, the implant placement is also important for the function reconstruction. However, since the conventional off-the-shelf implant (usually just several types are available) cannot register uniquely to the adjacent tissues due to the different characteristics of the human body, it still remains a significant challenge for the ideal reconstruction for patients. For example, owing to the racial differences (such as bone size, shape, structure, etc.), some commercial humeral implants based on the Western population are currently not entirely compatible with Asian patients [34]. Furthermore, this unmatched structure may affect the stability of the implant and cause the complications [35]. In addition, the standard prosthesis may be incompatible with the diversity of osteotomy positions and surrounding regions in limb salvage surgery.

Therefore, the patient-specific implants have been proposed and developed during the past decades. Since the custom-made implant is designed based on the patient's own medical images (such as CT data, MRI data, etc.) and the preoperative planning, it can provide more accurate implant positioning, better anatomical match, more predictable surgical result, and better limb axis alignment [36]. Some applications of the patient-specific implant have been reported in the literature. For example, Gerbino et al. utilized polyetheretherketone (PEEK) customized prostheses for primary and secondary reconstruction of complex craniofacial defects [38]. Demange et al. demonstrated that the patient-specific lateral unicompartmental implants can allow a better tibial coverage and provide excellent short-term clinical and radiological results as compared to the standard, off-the-shelf commercially available unicompartmental implants in lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasties [36]. However, due to the limitations of the traditional manufacturing technology, the customized implant with complex shape may not be easily manufactured through the traditional machine tool.

With the tremendous development of 3D printing technique over the past years, a great revolution has been brought in the fields of engineering, medicine and many more [37]. Compared with the traditional CAD/CAM technologies, the 3D printer can fabricate the products and implants directly from a 3D virtual model with very complex geometries. Therefore, it provides a new concept for the clinical treatment in orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, etc. Recently, with the rapid development in additive manufacturing technology, the 3D printing machine with new metal alloy powder and metal fabrication strategies has been presented [8,9]. For example, Jardini et al. designed and fabricated a 3D-printed bio-model and customized implant for the surgical reconstruction of a large cranial defect [7]. Ciocca et al. utilized a customized titanium mesh for prosthetically guided bone regeneration of atrophic maxillary arches using 3D printing technology [10]. However, the application for the pelvic sarcoma reconstruction surgery is rarely reported in literature.

Nevertheless, the difficulties of this kind of surgery are obvious. Due to the deep position in the pelvis and the surrounding intricate anatomical structures [11], it is not easy to find the bone tumor in the early stage, and the accuracy and reliability of the pelvic sarcoma resection cannot be effectively assured. Moreover, the intra-operative installation of 3D-printed patient-specific implant is difficult since the traditional equipment cannot be used and the actual position and orientation of the implant cannot be determined according to the pre-operative surgical planning.

Nowadays, the use of computer-aided navigation technology has become more and more important in terms of improving the accuracy of surgery [12]. Many surgical navigation systems including commercially available and researching softwares have been presented for clinical applications in orthopedics. For instance, Behrendt et al. used the commercial software Spine and Trauma Fluoro-3D 1.6.0 (Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) to evaluate the accuracy of 3D navigation for iliosacral screw fixation [13]. Inui et al. performed 31 total knee arthroplasties using the Stryker 3.1 image-free navigation system (Stryker Corporation, USA) [14]. Ungi et al. developed a spinal needle navigation system based on a free, open-sourced software package named 3D Slicer (Oueen's University, Canada) to improve targeting accuracy and efficiency in facet joint injections [15]. However, the applications of computer-aided surgical navigation are rarely reported regarding the pelvic sarcoma resection surgery combined with metal 3D-printed customized implant placement.

In this study, a method for calibrating the patient-specific implant was proposed, and a surgical navigation system has been developed that encompasses the image segmentation, 3D-reconstruction, pre-operative surgical planning, calibration, registration, and intra-operative tracking. With the aid of this navigation system, the precision of pelvic tumor resection and implant placement can be improved, and the reliability and safety of the surgery can be achieved. The phantom experiment and the clinical report demonstrated the feasibility of our navigation system, and highlighted its benefits.

The workflow of the surgical navigation system is shown in Fig. 1
                     , and described as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Image segmentation. On the basis of the original CT-scanned data, threshold, region growing and manual contouring methods are adopted for the segmentation of the pelvis, sarcoma, bladder, etc.


                              3D-reconstruction. Then, the virtual three-dimensional models can be reconstructed through the marching cubes algorithm [16]. The results are further processed by mesh simplification, smoothing and trimming.


                              Pre-operative surgical planning. Based on the series of 2D images and the 3D-reconstructed data, the pre-operative planning can be performed including the 3D geometrical measurement, the optimization design of the osteotomy trajectory, the simulation of implant placement, etc. In addition, the position and orientation of the implant can be adjusted to avoid injuring the surrounding critical anatomical structures, according to the corresponding contours of the planned cutting planes on the series of 2D images (axial, coronal, and sagittal).


                              Design and manufacturing of 3D-printed customized implant. According to the planned cutting result, the patient-specific implant can be designed through the collaborations with surgeons (Fig. 6(a) shows a customized implant designed via the UG software (Unigraphics NX, Siemens PLM Software, Germany), and it can be saved as a Stereo Lithographic (STL) file and imported into our surgical navigation system.) This customized titanium alloy implant (shown in Fig. 6(b)) is then manufactured through the 3D printing machine (Arcam, Sweden) using the electron beam melting (EBM) technology.


                              Calibration of the surgical instruments and implant. Since only the reference frames with mounted sphere-shaped retro-reflective markers can be tracked by the optical locating device (Polaris Vicra, NDI Inc., Canada), the calibration procedures are required before the navigated surgery so that the movements of the 3D-printed implant or the surgical instruments can be represented through the reference frames attached on them.


                              Registration. The procedure of registration is to bring two coordinate systems into spatial alignment, which means the pre-operative images are registered with the patient on the operative table [17]. In our surgical navigation system, two kinds of registration methods are adopted, respectively the point-based registration method based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, and surface matching registration method based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm [18–21].


                              Real-time navigation for the tumor resection and implant placement. After the procedures of calibration and registration, the position and orientation of the surgical instruments can be tracked in real time and rendered on the computer screen. Hence, the tumor can be resected according to the pre-operative planned trajectory and the precision can be improved. Furthermore, during the installation process of implant, the virtual model varies on both of the 2D and 3D views in real time so that the operation efficiency can be enhanced.

Although most existing commercial or researching surgical navigation systems have solved the calibration of surgical instrument using a calibration tool [22,23], their methods were not suitable for calibrating the patient-specific implants with various shapes. Therefore, a novel method was proposed in this study so that the movement of the implants can be tracked during the intra-operative placement process, and the principle is described below.

The coordinate systems in surgical navigation system are established shown in Fig. 2
                        : World coordinate system (WCS-XYZ) is determined by the Polaris optical tracking system; Virtual coordinate system (VCS-X
                        0
                        Y
                        0
                        Z
                        0, also referred to as the image coordinate system) is determined by the pre-operative planning image data; Reference coordinate system 1 (RCS1-X
                        1
                        Y
                        1
                        Z
                        1, also referred to as the reference frame coordinate system of the patient) is determined by the reference frame mounted on the pelvis of the patient; Reference coordinate system 2 (RCS2-X
                        2
                        Y
                        2
                        Z
                        2, also referred to as the reference frame coordinate system of the 3D-printed customized implant) is determined by the reference frame fixed on the implant; while A1 and A2 are the transformation matrices with which RCS1 and RCS2 can respectively be transformed to WCS; A10 is the registration transformation matrix with which RCS1 can be transformed to VCS; In addition, it should be noted that VSC can be regarded as identical to the modeling coordinate system of implant. Therefore, Mcal is the calibration transformation matrix that determining the spatial relationship between the coordinate systems of the 3D-printed implant (VCS) and the reference frame (RCS2), shown in Fig. 3

Since the transformation of a rigid body under world coordinate system can be described through the unit quaternion and the translation vector, the transformation matrices A1 and A2 are calculated on the basis of seven elements provided by the Polaris optical tracking system. And the registration transformation matrix A10 can be calculated through the point-based or surface matching registration methods [24,25].

As for the calibration transformation matrix Mcal, the “Point-to-Point” registration method was proposed, and the detail is described as follows:

Firstly, several pinholes are designed and marked on the surface of implant as fiducial landmarks. The coordinates of theses fiducial landmarks under the image coordinate system are pre-defined during the design procedure (for example, four fiducial landmarks are shown in Fig. 3). Meanwhile, the corresponding coordinates of these fiducial landmarks under the implant reference frame coordinate system can be obtained through the positioning probe [22], shown in Fig. 4
                        . Then, the calibration transformation matrix Mcal will be calculated through the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm [26].

Finally, on the basis of the above-mentioned algorithm, the function module of the implant calibration is programmed using some well-known open-sourced toolkits such as the VTK, CTK, ITK, IGSTK and QT, and integrated into our self-developed navigation software [12,24].

@&#RESULTS@&#

In order to validate the feasibility and reliability of our surgical navigation system, the phantom experiments and the following clinical application have been conducted for a voluntary sixty-two-year-old patient suffered from pelvic sarcoma, and the details are described as follows.

The phantom experiment was performed before the real clinical surgery. With the original CT data obtained through a CT scanner (GE medical system, USA) with a 1mm slice increment, the image segmentation for the critical anatomical structures and 3D reconstruction can be realized in the pre-operative planning software of our surgical navigation system (Fig. 5
                         shows the pelvis model and the blood vessels models (reconstructed according to the MRI data of the same patient)). Based on the 3D-reconstructed data, a rapid prototype (RP) pelvis model was fabricated through fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology, shown in Fig. 8(b). Then, the positions and orientations of three cutting planes were planned, and adjusted to meet the clinical requirements according to the contours displayed on all 2D images (shown in Fig. 5).

On the basis of the pre-operative surgical planning, a customized implant was designed to achieve the optimal function reconstruction through the discussion with surgeons, and then it was manufactured through the 3D printing machine Arcam A1 (Arcam, Sweden) using the titanium alloy power, shown in Fig. 6
                        (b). The reference frame was mounted on the implant through a threaded hole for the intra-operative motion tracking.

After the initialization of the surgical navigation system, the 3D-printed customized implant was calibrated through the paired-point registration method introduced in previous section. As for the calibration of the surgical instrument, Fig. 7
                         shows the calibrations for the axis of surgical drill and the surface of surgical saw respectively through the axial hole and the slot in the calibration tool.

During the registration procedure, three corresponding pelvic osteal marker pairs (such as the anterior superior spine, tuberculum pubicum and posterior superior iliac spine) were firstly selected to implement the point-based registration. Then, the point cloud data were acquired through the positioning probe for the surface-matched registration, so that the general registration error can be corrected. After registration, the position and orientation of surgical saw was tracked in real time and displayed on both of the 2D and 3D views, shown in Fig. 8
                        (a). Therefore, the simulation of pelvic sarcoma resection can be performed while the surface of saw was aligned with the planned resecting plane. In addition, the implant can be intra-operatively tracked and installed carefully according to the pre-operative position under the interactive guidance of 2D and 3D image rendering environment (shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c)).

The basic aim of using our image-guided system is to improve the precision of implant placement and prevent the intra-operative possible human errors in the anatomically complex operation sites. Therefore, the phantom experiment of comparing the accuracy of the implant installation with and without navigated guidance was conducted comprising two groups. Group one included four non-navigated implant installation repeats after the guided osteotomy. Group two included four image-guided implant installation repeats (the position of intra-operative tracked implant model displayed on the computer screen in real time).

While every time of the non-navigated or the image-guided implant installation was accomplished, the actual implant model displayed on the computer screen (the red model in Fig. 8(c)) was exported as a file in ‘.stl’ format. Then, the coordinates of four fiducial landmarks on the actual implant model under the virtual coordinate system were obtained through an image recognition technique [12] (listed in Table 1
                        ). Furthermore, based on the coordinates of homologous landmarks obtained from pre-operative planned implant model, the deviation of each landmark can be calculated and recorded (listed in Table 1). The mean FRE (fiducial registration error) in non-navigated group was 2.37±0.89mm. In comparison, the mean FRE in image-guided group was 0.47±0.16mm, which was improved more than five times. Fig. 9
                         shows the deviation comparison of each landmark between the non-navigated group and image-guided group.

In addition, each of the saved implant model was imported to a specific self-developed software using VTK to compare with the pre-operative model for performing the graphical post-processing. After calculating the distance between homologous points on the intra-operative saved implant model and the pre-operative planned model, the regional precision was best demonstrated by mapping the distance errors onto a virtual 3D implant model.

According to the color maps of the two groups shown in Fig. 10
                         (the error distribution of four non-navigated implant installation repeats after the guided osteotomy) and Fig. 11
                         (the error distribution of four image-guided implant installation repeats), the mean TREs (target registration error) in non-navigated implant installation group were 2.23±0.94mm, 3.13±1.28mm, 2.61±1.1mm and 2.71±1.47mm, respectively, while the mean TREs in image-guided implant installation group were 0.63±0.17mm, 0.75±0.18mm, 0.65±0.27mm and 0.70±0.27mm, respectively. Therefore, image-guided implant installations were significantly more accurate than non-navigated operations. Furthermore, since each of the non-navigated implant installation was based on the result of previous navigated resection, so the measured TREs were relatively lower than the complete non-navigated installation.

This pilot clinical study was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Shanghai 9th People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The clinical investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this treatment intervention were registered.

First of all, the patient was placed on the operation table, and the general anesthesia was implemented. The reference frame was mounted on the pelvis of the patient using the surgical drill after the soft tissue was dissected, shown in Fig. 12
                        .

After the patient-to-image matching was accomplished, the intra-operative positions and orientations of surgical instruments such as the surgical drill and saw were tracked and rendered on the computer screen (shown in Fig. 13
                        (a) and (b)). Therefore, the surgeon resected the pelvic tumor according to the pre-operative planned trajectory (Fig. 13(c) shows tumor resected with safe margins). Furthermore, after the tumor resection, the 3D-printed customized implant was installed under the image-guided environment so that the limitation of intra-operative visibility can be overcome. The post-operative follow-up reported that all resection margins were sarcoma-free, and the status of the patient recovery was satisfactory.

Therefore, the phantom experiment and clinical case presented the feasibility of our computer-aided surgical navigation system, and the accuracy validation results proved that it can improve the safety of the pelvic tumor resection and reconstruction surgery.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Since the 1980s, the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic sarcomas have become increasingly important in the field of orthopedics for improving the curative effect and survival rate of the patient. Over the last decades, the surgical treatment of pelvic sarcomas integrated with the neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been a recognized effective treatment by the surgeons due to the obvious advantages [27].

Besides pelvic tumor resection, the implant manufacturing and placement are also important for the clinical treatment. Compared with the conventional machine processing, additive manufacturing technology has helped to achieve several advances in the medical field due to the merits of humanization design, low cost, high production efficiency, etc. [28]. Although the 3D-printed products can provide the benefits of customization and personalization, the challenge that prevents the wide use of clinical applications is the immaturity of the processing technology of the metal 3D printing. With the development of additive manufacturing technologies (such as selective laser sintering (SLS), direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), electron beam melting (EMB), etc.), the customized implant can be fabricated with metal alloys and its properties such as resistance to fatigue and wear, fracture toughness and high corrosion resistance can achieve the clinical requirements [29]. For example, Mangano et al. fabricated a custom-made root-analog titanium implant through the technology of direct laser metal forming for the implant dentistry [30]. However, this kind of implant used for the limb-salvage resection and reconstruction surgery are rarely reported in literature.

In addition, due to the anatomic intricacies of the pelvis, the resection and placement surgery still poses a major challenge for the treatment of patients with primary bone sarcomas in the pelvis [31]. Furthermore, since the pelvic tumors are often lying close to major blood vessels, nerves, and urinary and gastrointestinal structures, it is difficult to control the position and orientation of the surgical saw while resecting tumors with safe margins. Meanwhile, unlike traditional standard implants, the common tools cannot be used for assisting the customized implant installation and the actual position of the implant will deviate from the ideal position of the pre-operative surgical planning.

Nowadays, the computer-aided surgical navigation systems have been widely used in various surgeries for the purpose of minimizing the risks and improving the precision of the surgery. For example, Cartiaux et al. conducted an experimental study to investigate cutting accuracy during navigated and non-navigated simulated bone tumor cutting in the pelvis [32]. Sternheim et al. developed the in-house navigation software (GTx Eyes) based on the open-source Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit for guiding the pelvic osteotomy and tumor resection surgery [33]. However, the above-mentioned surgical navigation systems are not applicable for the installation of a 3D-printed patient-specific implant in the pelvic sarcoma resection and reconstruction surgery.

In our surgical navigation system, a novel method for the calibration of a patient-specific implant was proposed so that the real time tracking of the intraoperative installation of the implant can be realized. With the use of this surgical navigation system, the precision of the tumor resection and 3D-printed customized implant installation can be improved. The position and orientation of surgical saw can be tracked on the computer screen in real time so that the surgeon can operate according to the preoperative plan and an adequate resection margin can be obtained. Furthermore, the intra-operative installation of the implant can be navigated under the guidance of the interactive 2D and 3D views until it is aligned with the pre-operative planned position. The accuracy evaluation demonstrates that the TRE of implant installation with our imaged-guided system can be improved to 0.75±0.18mm, which is more than four times compared with the TRE of the non-navigated implant installation after the guided osteotomy. Therefore, it is sufficient to meet the clinical requirements of the pelvic reconstruction.

Nevertheless, it is just a pilot study and there are still some research and exploration required to do in the future work. A related limitation of using our surgical navigation system is that the preparation for the navigation procedure is relatively complicated and it may add time for the whole surgery. For example, before the tracking of the surgical saw and 3D-printed customized implant, some necessary performances are required including the fixation of the reference frames, calibration and registration. It will affect the continuity of the surgery with more surgical time and result in more bleeding, which may then have negative impact on the optical tracking performance of the reflective passive markers attached on the reference frames. Currently, a new kind of markers named “Radix Lens” has been developed. Since this reflective marker sphere has a smooth plastic surface that naturally sheds liquid, it is easy to wipe clean to recover tracking.

The “rigid registration” is the current approach used in our navigation system to register the patient's position in relation to the image data set. However, owing to the deformations caused by soft tissue or respiratory movements, this approach may not be sufficient for some surgical or interventional procedures [39]. Thus, it is clear that a novel “non-rigid” registration method will be developed for our next surgical navigation system.

In terms of the real time performance of the surgical navigation system, we will not only improve the hardware but also develop some novel software algorithms. For example, the advanced algorithms for volume visualization are under development to improve the rendering speed of large datasets. Over the past years, graphics processing unit (GPU) based volume rendering systems have been widely used for the medical image processing. In the previously published work, Johnsen et al. released an open-source finite element toolkit called “NiftySim” which provides the option of execution on fast GPU hardware [40]. In the near future, this toolkit may be embedded directly in our surgical guidance system so that it will have high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities using the GPU technology.

In addition, more clinical trials will be conducted for validating the reliability and efficiency of our surgical navigation system. Meanwhile, the augmented reality technology is becoming a promising application in the medical field recently due to its characteristic of combining real objects and virtual (computer-generated) objects in a real environment. Currently, the surgical navigation system based on augmented reality is also under development at our research institute.
