                  The problem of dimensionality reduction is to map data from high dimensional spaces to low dimensional spaces. In the process of dimensionality reduction, the data structure, which is helpful to discover the latent semantics and simultaneously respect the intrinsic geometric structure, should be preserved. In this paper, to discover a low-dimensional embedding space with the nature of structure preservation and basis compactness, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm, called Structure Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SPNMF). In SPNMF, three kinds of constraints, namely local affinity, distant repulsion, and embedding basis redundancy elimination, are incorporated into the NMF framework. SPNMF is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by an effective iterative multiplicative update algorithm. The convergence of the proposed update solutions is proved. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and six real world data sets demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms, especially some related works based on NMF. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed updating rules is experimentally validated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recent years have witnessed large volumes of high-dimensional data in information retrieval, computer vision and pattern recognition, which have strongly motivated the development of technologies on dimensionality reduction [1]. Subspace learning, which dominates dimensionality reduction, has been widely exploited in image understanding and computer vision researches. It is helpful to reveal low dimensional structure embedded in high dimensional space. Namely, given an observed high dimensional data set

                     d. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [2–4] and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [5,4,6,7] have been the two most popular linear algorithms because of their relative simplicity and effectiveness. Optimal Component Analysis (OCA) [8,9] is proposed to search for an optimal space. To detect the underlying lower dimensional manifold structure, some manifold learning methods have been proposed, such as ISOMAP [10], Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [11], Laplacian Eigenmap [12], Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) [13] and Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) [14]. Recently, the algorithms based on factor analysis [15–18] have become popular for data representation. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [19] is an effective and attractive factor analysis method due to its theoretical interpretation and desired performance. NMF can support the parts-based representation of objects, which accords with the cognitive process of human brain from the psychological and physiological studies [20–22].

NMF aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product provides a good approximation to the original matrix. It is optimal for learning the parts of objects because the non-negative constraints allow only additive combinations. Whereas, NMF assumes that data points are sampled from a Euclidean space and does not exploit the geometric structure of the data. Besides, there are no extra constraints on the embedding spaces corresponding to the non-negative matrices.

In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning method, named Structure Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SPNMF), to properly preserve the local affinity structure without the distortion of the distant repulsion property. The local affinity structure indicates the local neighborhood correlation, that is, if point x
                     
                        j
                      is a neighbor point of x
                     
                        i
                     , v
                     
                        j
                      should also be close to v
                     
                        i
                     . The distant repulsion property is inspired by the observation that points which are far apart are generally semantically different. That is, the distant data points in the original space should be kept distant. Additionally, to learn better parts-based representation, we also require that a basis vector should not be further decomposed into more components and different bases should be as orthogonal as possible to reduce redundancy [23,24]. Therefore, we add the constraint of embedding basis redundancy elimination on NMF. We can optimize SPNMF via an iterative multiplicative updating algorithm and theoretically guarantee its convergence. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data and six real data sets to evaluate the performance of our method on clustering and classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that SPNMF outperforms NMF and its variants as well as other state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods, which reveals that it can indeed discover the low dimensional spaces embedded in high dimensional spaces.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

                           To discover the intrinsic geometric and discriminating structure of the data space, we incorporate three kinds of explicit constraints: local affinity, distant repulsion, and basis redundancy elimination, into the standard NMF framework.

We formulate our proposal as an optimization problem and provide an iterative multiplicative updating algorithm to solve it. A proof of the convergence of the proposed algorithm is also provided.

We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Compared to other dimensionality reduction techniques, SPNMF achieves the best performance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present a brief review of some related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose our SPNMF algorithm and its learning procedure. The convergence of our method is also proved. Experimental results on synthetic data and six real data sets (widely used as benchmarks) are illustrated in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 discusses our conclusion with future work.

                     [25]. In practice, we often have p
                     ≪
                     d and p
                     ≪
                     n. Therefore, NMF essentially tries to find a compact representation of the original data. On the other hand, the non-negative constraints on U and V only allow additive combinations among different bases. It is believed that NMF can learn a part-based representation [19]. It has been demonstrated to be an ideal dimensionality reduction algorithm for image processing, face recognition [19,23] and document clustering [26,27].

There are many variants of NMF proposed recently. Local NMF (LNMF) [23] imposes a spatially localized constraint on the bases. A NMF with sparseness constraints is proposed in [28]. In [29], NMF is constrained with neighborhood preserving regularization, resulting in a Neighborhood Preserving NMF (NPNMF). NMF is also constrained with local learning regularization, resulting in a Local Learning regularized NMF (LLNMF) [30]. Both of them not only inherit the advantages of NMF, e.g. nonnegativity, but also overcome the shortcomings of NMF, i.e. Euclidean assumption. To discover the hidden topics and the intrinsic geometric structure simultaneously, Locality Preserving NMF (LPNMF) [31] is proposed. Regression based NMF (RNMF) [24] is a supervised method, incorporating a regression constraint into the NMF framework and learning maximally changing parts in the basis images. Constrained NMF (CNMF) [32] is a semi-supervised matrix factorization method, which imposes the label information to the objective function as hard constraints. In [33], a robust NMF model is proposed using ℓ2,1-norm loss function, which makes it accommodate outliers and noises in a better way than standard one.

A Graph regularized NMF (GNMF) [34], which is the most relevant to our work, was proposed to preserve the local affinity structure of the data, assuming that the close points in the high dimensional space are close to each other in the low dimensional space. The geometric information of data distribution is represented with a nearest neighbor graph, attached into the NMF framework as a constraint. Different from the proposed method, GNMF has no constraint on distant data points from a repulsion view, which often leads to distorted embedding maps. Besides, there is no consideration on the basis for the low dimensional embedding space.

Our goal is to perform dimensionality reduction while preserving the local affinity and distant repulsion properties, and obtaining the compact bases simultaneously. To this end, we enforce three kinds of explicit constraints, i.e., local affinity, distant repulsion, and basis redundancy elimination, on the NMF framework. We will first explain the constraints in SPNMF, followed with its optimization algorithm. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is also proved.

Given a set of n data points X and two factor matrices U and V as in Section 2, the goal of SPNMF is to find a low dimensional embedding space that satisfies the following three criterias:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Constraint I (Local Affinity): We should ensure that the local affinity structure is invariant when embedding a point into a new space. That is, if two data points are close in the intrinsic geometry of the data distribution, their embedded latent points are also close to each other.


                                 Constraint II (Distant Repulsion): The embedding space should maintain the distant repulsion of data distribution, specially repulse (or separate) distant points in original space. Intuitively, if a point is far from another point in the original space, so is it in the low dimensional embedding space.


                                 Constraint III (Basis Redundancy Elimination): Different bases should be as orthogonal as possible to minimize the redundancy and a basis component should not be decomposed into more components.

In constraint I, to preserve the local affinity structure, we require those similar data pairs in the original space to be still close in the embedded space. It is usually referred to as local invariance assumption [35,13], which can be effectively modeled through a nearest neighbor graph on a scatter of data points. To achieve this goal, several constraints could be chosen, such as graph regularization [34], neighborhood preserving regularization [29] and local learning regularization [30]. In light of the efficiency and effectiveness (as discussed in Section 4.7), the graph regularization is utilized to preserve the local affinity structure.

To learn parts-based representations that are qualitatively better than those generated by NMF, the basis matrix should satisfy some constraints, such as the sparseness constraint [28] and the constraint in [23]. Considering the effectiveness (as discussed in Section 4.7), we expect the bases to satisfy the following constraints. First, the data points V should be represented by minimal basis components. That is, we should add a constraint to minimize the number of basis components required to represent V. Furthermore, to reduce redundancy between different bases, bases are enforced to be as orthogonal as possible. The former constraint can be formulated as

                        =0, it degenerates to the same form as GNMF. A SPNMF factorization is defined as a solution to the constrained minimization of Eq. (9).

                              Since Eq. (21) is an auxiliary function, F(U) is monotonically decreasing under this update rule.□

Based on the above two theorems, we obtain the following theorem.
                           Theorem 3.3
                           
                              The objective function E in Eq. (9) 
                              is non-increasing under the update rules in Eqs. (15)–(17). The objective function is invariant under these updates if and only if 
                              U 
                              and 
                              V 
                              are at a stationary point.
                           

First, in the tth iteration, given a fixed U

                              , we have the following inequality according to Theorem 3.1 based on the update rule in Eq. (15).

                              In other words, the proposed optimization algorithm can make the objective function convergent and the updating rules do not change U or V if and only if U and V are at a stationary point.□


                        Theorem 3.3 grantees that the update rules of U and V in Eqs. (15)–(17) converge and the final solution will be a local optimum.

In comparison to standard NMF, we introduce three regularization terms and increase the computational complexity. In this subsection, we discuss the extra computational cost of our proposed algorithms in comparison to NMF and GNMF. The common way to represent the complexity of one algorithm is using big O notation [38].

Based on the updating rules, it is not hard to calculate the arithmetic operations of each iteration. Note that k
                        1-nearest neighboring graph and the k
                        2-farthest distant graph are both sparse and there are no overlapping non-zero elements, thus we have L

                        =
                        L

                                          L

                        . In each iteration, it needs O((p
                        +1)n
                        2) to construct the sparse graph to calculate L
                        −. It is important to note that L
                        + and L
                        − are sparse matrices. Thus, we only need npk
                        1 and npk
                        2 flam (a floating-point addition and multiplication) to compute VL
                        + and VL
                        −, respectively. We summarize the arithmetic operations for SPNMF in Table 1
                        . The total time cost is O((d
                        +
                        n)np) for each iteration in SPNMF.

Besides the multiplicative updates, SPNMF also needs O(dn
                        2) to construct the k-nearest neighbor graph. If the multiplicative updates stop after t iterations, the overall cost for SPNMF is O(t(d
                        +
                        n)np
                        +
                        dn
                        2). The overall cost for NMF is O(tdnp) and the overall cost for GNMF is O(tdnp
                        +
                        dn
                        2).

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed SPNMF algorithm on synthetic data and real world data. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency, we present quantitative evaluations of the proposed SPNMF and compare it with some related approaches. Additionally, Kmeans [39] clustering and Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier [40,41] with the original data (not dimensionality reduced data) are adopted as two baselines in comparisons. Statistical significance test is also performed with a significance level of 0.05. The student t-test is employed in our experiments.

In our experiments, we use six image data sets widely adopted as benchmarks in dimensional reduction literatures [34,29]. The important statistic of these data sets are summarized below:

                                 : There are 575 gray scale image in total and a few images (views) of 20 different people. In this paper, the images were resized to 28.

We summarize the characteristics of the six real world data sets as in Table 2
                         and present some sample images in Fig. 1
                        .

Our synthetic examples are designed on two kinds of toy data sets: one distributed on two rings shown in Fig. 2
                        a and the other distributed along two perpendicularly crossing lines shown in Fig. 2f. There are 400 data points randomly distributed on the two rings. The radiuses of the inner and outer rings are from normal distributions with mean 0.8 and 1.0, and standard deviation 0.02 respectively. There are 200 points randomly distributed on the two cross lines with the variance of 0.02.

We adopt PCA [2,3], NMF [19], GNMF [34] and our method to yield 1D embeddings of these data points. In Fig. 2b–e, the horizontal axis indexes the data points where the first 200 indices corresponding to the inner ring. The horizontal axis indexes the data points where the first 100 indices corresponding to the vertical line in Fig. 2g–j. For GNMF, we set the neighbor size to 10 and the regularization parameter to 100. For our method, we set k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2
                        =10, α
                        =100, λ
                        =0.1 and γ
                        =1.

As shown in Fig. 2b–e and g–j, we can obviously observe that there are significant overlaps between the clusters in the embeddings of PCA, NMF and GNMF, and less or no overlaps between the clusters in the SPNMF. PCA optimizes the mapping only based on the repulsion correlations with distorting the affinity correlation structure. NMF tries to find a set of basis that can be used to best approximate the data without considering any structure of data. GNMF considers to preserve the local affinity structure and overlooks the distant repulsion property. Our method tries to preserve the local affinity and distant repulsion properties simultaneously. Thus, the proposed SPNMF can better preserve the intrinsic structure of the original data and achieve more discriminative representations for data. Note that in Fig. 2j, the clustering accuracies (defined by Eq. (29)) of GNMF and SPNMF on the cross lines are 0.75 and 0.88 respectively.

We first adopt data clustering to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for dimensionality reduction. SPNMF is compared with the raw features (RAW), PCA [2,3], KPCA [43], Isomap [10], LE [12], LLE [11], LPP [13], NPE [14], NMF [19], LNMF [23], SNMF [28], SONMF (Bases are enforced to be orthogonal to each other.), NPNMF [29], GNMF [34], SPNMF_r (i.e., the proposed method with setting α
                        =
                        γ
                        =0) and SPNMF_s (the proposed method only considering the structure preservation constraints without basis redundancy elimination, i.e., γ
                        =0). We utilize Kmeans to cluster the data points, and set the number of clusters to be the true number of classes. The clustering performance is evaluated by clustering ACcuracy (AC) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) measures, which are the standard measures widely used for clustering [26,34]. AC is defined as follows:

                                          ^

                        . The larger NMI is, the better the clustering result is.

In order to overcome the initialization sensitivity of Kmeans, we repeat each clustering 20 times given a certain parameter setting. Then, among all the possible parameter settings, we report the best average results for each method. For all the k-nearest-neighborhood graph based algorithms, e.g., ISOMAP, LLE, LE, LPP, NPE, NPNMF and GNMF, the neighborhood size is set by {2,3,…,10}. For GNMF, the regularization parameter is set by {0.01,0.1,1,10,100}. For SPNMF_r, the number of distant points for each point k
                        2 is also set by {2,3,…,10}. For SPNMF_s and SPNMF, k
                        1 for W
                        
                           l
                         and k
                        2 for W
                        
                           r
                         are set by {2,3,…,10}. α and γ are set by {0.01,0.1,1,10,100} and λ
                        =1(α
                        =
                        β) by virtue of experience. Empirically, the embedding dimensionality is defined as p
                        =100 for PIE dataset and p
                        =50 for other datasets.

We present the compared experimental results in Table 3
                        . It is observed that SPNMF outperforms the other methods for clustering. First, by the comparison among the local affinity geometric structure based algorithms and others, we can see that it is important and effective to preserve the local geometric structure of the data. Moreover, the advantage of the graph regularization over the neighborhood preserving [29] is indicated by comparing GNMF and NPNMF. Second, SPNMF is superior to the manifold learning algorithms due to the nonnegativity, which is more suitable for non-negative data. Third, SPNMF_r is better than NMF and SPNMF and SPNMF_s outperform GNMF, which demonstrate that the distant repulsion preservation is essential to reflect the intrinsic data distribution in dimensionality reduction. Fourth, SPNMF outperforms LNMF suggesting the importance of the structure preservation. Besides, with consideration of the basis compactness, SPNMF achieves better performance than SPNMF_s and SONMF, and LNMF generally outperforms SNMF. It shows that the used constraints on the basis are better than the sparseness constraint [28] and the orthogonality constraint. Finally, regardless of the data sets, SPNMF always results in the best performance. This shows that by leveraging the power of the parts-based representation, structure preserving regularization and basis compactness consideration, SPNMF can learn a better compact representation.

The proposed SPNMF algorithm is also applied to data classification. We compare the performance of the raw features (RAW), PCA [2,3], KPCA [43], LDA [3], KSDA [44], NPE [14], NMF [19], LNMF [23], GNMF [34], CNMF [32] and SPNMF. For NMF, LNMF, GNMF and SPNMF, the projection is computed as U
                        +
                        =(U
                        
                           T
                        
                        U)−1

                        , which is adopted to project data to the low dimensional space. The Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier is used to predict the class labels of data. The performance of classification is measured in terms of Precision (P), which is defined as

                           i
                         is the true class label.

Generally, the classification performance varies with the dimensionality of the embedding space. For each given dimensionality, we utilize the cross-validation approach to tune the parameters, which are set by the same grids as in Section 4.3. First, for each class of a data set, we randomly select about 20% of samples as a validation set, and randomly select t samples from the rest data as a training set to learn our model, while t
                        =5, 10, 20 for the PIE data set and t
                        =2, 3, 4 for the other five data set. Since the size of training data is small, to alleviate the instability introduced by the training data, we repeat the random generation of training data 10 times. Then we perform the model learning on the 10 training sets respectively and validate the learned model on the validation data. The average result over these 10 times experiments on the validation set is used for evaluation. For each possible parameter setting, we repeat the above evaluation once. At last, the parameters with the best average results on the validation sets are identified. With the chosen parameters and the dataset except the validation set, we randomly select t samples for each class as training data to learn our model, and the rest as testing data for performance evaluations. We repeat experiments 20 times and report the average results on the testing sets as well as the corresponding dimensionality. Note that for LDA, as in [3], we first employ PCA to reduce the dimensionality to n
                        −
                        C and then perform LDA. C is the number of classes in each data set. Note that in PIE data set with c
                        =20, we perform LDA directly without PCA because n
                        −
                        C is larger than d.

                         present the classification precisions of all the methods on the data sets of Coil20, PIE, Yale, ORL, UMIST and BA. The number in brackets in the tables is the corresponding dimensionality of the embedding space. We compare the performance of PCA, LDA, NMF, GNMF and our method with different embedding dimensionality. The results are presented in Fig. 3
                        . We can see that the performance changes with respect to the parameter p. There exists a value of p for each dataset to learn an optimal set of bases and achieve the best result. Lower or higher dimensionality may make the learned bases incomplete or overcomplete, which can degrade the performance.

From the results of classification, we observe some interesting points. First, the proposed SPNMF approach gets improvements compared with PCA and NPE, and SPNMF is competitive to LDA and KSDA. However, LDA and KSDA are supervised methods, which shows that SPNMF can find a better embedded space. Second, our proposed method and GNMF achieve superior performance on all the six data sets by considering the local affinity structure. Third, SPNMF outperforms the semi-supervised matrix decomposition method CNMF, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the structure preservation and basis compactness. In addition, with the geometric structure preserving, e.g., the local affinity structure and the distant repulsive structure, SPNMF uncovers better representations of data than LNMF. Finally, with the additional constraints of distant repulsion and basis compactness, the performance of SPNMF is better than GNMF. The above two points indicate the importance of local affinity and distant repulsion preservation and basis compactness in the learning of the embedding.

In this subsection, we study the sensitiveness of the parameters α, β, γ, k
                        1 and k
                        2 in the proposed objective function (9).

First, we conduct experiments on one toy example, i.e., the two rings dataset. The results are presented in Fig. 4
                        a–d when we set k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2
                        =2, k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2
                        =50, β
                        =0 and γ
                        =0, respectively. We can see that different embedding results are generated with different parameters setting. When k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2
                        =2 (a small number of neighbors are considered), the embedding results shown in Fig. 4a are satisfied. When k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2
                        =50 (too many neighbors are considered), this makes some points in different rings are identified as similar in W
                        
                           l
                         and some points in the same rings are identified as dissimilar in W
                        
                           r
                        , which degrades the performance as shown in Fig. 4b. The values of k
                        1 and k
                        2 are relevant to the data distribution, and we should set suitable values to them to achieve satisfied performance. The results of extreme cases with β
                        =0 and γ
                        =0 are presented in Fig. 4c and d separately. We observe that the importance of the parameters are quite different. Therefore, in our experiments we tune them and different values are used.

Furthermore, we validate the sensitiveness of parameters on the real-world datasets. First, we conduct experiments to study the sensitiveness of the parameter k
                        1 and k
                        2. We set k
                        1 and k
                        2 to s% of the total number of data points, where s is tuned in {0.5,1,2,3,4,5}. For brevity, let us denote K
                        =
                        k
                        1
                        =
                        k
                        2. The explicit values of K over these six datasets are presented in Table 10
                        . The corresponding clustering results (e.g., AC and NMI) are shown in Fig. 5
                        . It is observed that the suitable values of K for different datasets are different. When 5% (0.5%) of the total number of data points is used to identify k
                        1 and k
                        2, too many (few) points are selected for some data sets. These two cases both degrade the performance. Besides, we choose the Coil20 and UMIST datasets as examples to validate the sensitiveness of the parameters α, β and γ and present the results in Fig. 6
                        . To test the sensitiveness, we first fix γ and tune the parameters α and beta, and then tune the parameter γ with fixed α and β. From the results in Fig. 6, we can see that the performance of SPNMF is some sensitive to the parameter α and stable with respect to the parameters β and γ. For Coil20 data set, SPNMF achieves the best performance when α
                        =0.1, β
                        =1 and γ
                        =0.1. For UMIST data set, the best result is got when α
                        =1, β
                        =1 and γ
                        =0.1.

The effectiveness of the proposed SPNMF has been demonstrated by the above experiments. Here we evaluate the efficiency of SPNMF in comparison to NMF and GNMF. The objective function of SPNMF is solved by iteratively updating U and V according to the updating rules in Eqs. (15)–(17). The convergence of these rules has been proved in Section 3.3. Here we investigate how fast these rules can converge and discuss the computational cost.

The convergence is evaluated on all the data of these six data sets as utilized in the clustering task. Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         show the convergence curves of NMF, GNMF and SPNMF on all the six data sets. From the convergence curves, we can observe that the multiplicative updating rules for NMF, GNMF and SPNMF converge very fast, usually within 100 iterations. To better demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the comparisons of the computational cost for NMF, GNMF and SPNMF are reported in Table 11
                        . We implement these algorithms in Matlab and run the experiments on a Lenovo workstation with 2.33GHz Quad Core CPU. It can be observed that the proposed SPNMF achieves an acceptable cost on runtime. However, the proposed SPNMF is significantly better than GNMF and NMF.

In this work, our goal is to discover a better representation of data. Towards this end, we explore the data structure and basis compactness. Different constraints can be considered to achieve the expected goals. The reasons why the aforementioned constraints are utilized are discussed as follows.

To maintain the data structure, several regularization could be chosen, such as graph regularization [34], neighborhood preserving regularization [29], locality preserving regularization [31] and local learning regularization [30]. By jointly considering the performance and the computational complexity, the graph regularization is chosen in this work. First, from the results in Table 3, we can see that GNMF [34] outperforms NPNMF [29], which indicates that the graph regularization is better than the neighborhood preserving. Besides, the computational complexity of NPNMF is higher than GNMF since NPNMF needs to learn the reconstruction coefficients based on the k-nearest neighborhood. Second, from the statements in [34], we can see that the overall cost for GNMF with F-norm formulation (i.e., GNMF with graph regularization) is O(tdnp), and the overall cost for LPNMF is O(t(d
                        +
                        q(k
                        +4))np
                        +
                        n
                        2
                        d), where t, d, n, p, k and q are the numbers of iterations, features, samples, factors, nearest neighbors and iterations in conjugate gradient, respectively. Moreover, compared the results of GNMF with graph regularization in [34] with LPNMF in [31] on the TDT2 dataset, it is observed that GNMF with graph regularization (NMI: 94.2% (k
                        =5), 85.6% (k
                        =10)) is better than LPNMF (NMI: 93.9% (k
                        =5), 83.4% (k
                        =10)). Finally, the efficiency of the graph regularization is also superior to the local learning regularization [30]. For each sample, local learning regularization needs to calculate a local predictor with a matrix inversion operation on a k
                        ×
                        k matrix, whose cost is generally O(k
                        3). Considering the above factors, the graph regularization is utilized to preserve the local geometric structure in our work.

For the basis compactness constraint, it is expected that a basis vector should not be further decomposed into more components and different bases should be as orthogonal as possible to reduce redundancy. An alternative constraint is to straightly enforce bases to be orthogonal to each other, which is corresponding to SONMF in Section 4.3. Another alternative strategy is the sparseness constraint used by SNMF [28]. The corresponding results in terms of clustering are presented in Table 3. It is observed that SPNMF is better than SONMF due to the constraint that a basis vector should not be further decomposed into more components, and LNMF generally outperforms SNMF. As a consequence, we adopt the constraints that a basis vector should not be further decomposed into more components and different bases should be as orthogonal as possible.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have presented a new factorization model for dimensionality reduction, called Structure Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SPNMF). SPNMF performs the space embedding with the assumptions of local affinity, distant repulsion, and embedding basis compactness. As a result, the proposed model derives a compact and discriminative representation in the embedded space, and shows the best performance in the comparison to the state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data and six widely used benchmarks.

In future, we would like to extend our work to explore more reasonable constraints on the bases to generate better parts-based representation, such as the sparsity property and the label information.
