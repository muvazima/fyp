                  Remanufacturing has attracted growing attention in recent years because of its energy-saving and emission-reduction potential. Process planning and scheduling play important roles in the organization of remanufacturing activities and directly affect the overall performance of a remanufacturing system. However, the existing research on remanufacturing process planning and scheduling is very limited due to the difficulty and complexity brought about by various uncertainties in remanufacturing processes. We address the problem by adopting a simulation-based optimization framework. In the proposed genetic algorithm, a solution represents the selected process routes for the jobs to be remanufactured, and the quality of a solution is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation, in which a production schedule is generated following the specified process routes. The studied problem includes two objective functions to be optimized simultaneously (one concerned with process planning and the other concerned with scheduling), and therefore, Pareto-based optimization principles are applied. The proposed solution approach is comprehensively tested and is shown to outperform a standard multi-objective optimization algorithm.
