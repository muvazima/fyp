                  It is important, in practice, to find robust solutions to optimisation problems. This issue has been the subject of extensive research focusing on single-objective problems. Recently, researchers also acknowledged the need to find robust solutions to multi-objective problems and presented some first results on this topic. In this paper, we deal with bi-objective optimisation problems in which only one objective function is uncertain. The contribution of our paper is three-fold. Firstly, we introduce and analyse four different robustness concepts for bi-objective optimisation problems with one uncertain objective function, and we propose an approach for defining a meaningful robust
Pareto front for these types of problems. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for computing robust solutions with respect to these four concepts for the case of discrete optimisation problems. This algorithm works for finite and for polyhedral uncertainty sets using a transformation to a multi-objective (deterministic) optimisation problem and the recently published concept of Pareto robust optimal solutions (Iancu & Trichakis, 2014). Finally, we apply our algorithm to two real-world examples, namely aircraft route guidance and the shipping of hazardous materials, illustrating the four robustness concepts and their solutions in practical applications.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many real-world optimisation problems are modelled as bi- or multi-objective optimisation problems (MOP) acknowledging that many decisions are based on multiple conflicting objectives (Ehrgott, 2005). On the other hand, real-world optimisation problems often depend on uncertain parameters, such as weather conditions, uncertain processing times, or delays in public transportation systems. To deal with this uncertainty, different approaches such as stochastic optimisation (Birge & Louveaux, 1997) and robust optimisation (Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009) have been developed.

As much attention has been given to both MOPs and robust optimisation, a natural next step is the combination of the two concepts. In this paper we analyse such a combination for bi-objective optimisation problems with one uncertain objective:

for details.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The need to combine robust and multi-objective optimisation has been recognised in the literature and has led to the development of different concepts of efficiency under uncertainty. This issue has been described recently in the survey by Ide and Schöbel (2016). Also see the overview given by Goberna, Jeyakumar, Li, and Vicente-Prez (2015). We review the relevant parts.

There are two rather straightforward ways for defining robust efficient (RE) solutions for multi-objective optimisation. The first concept looks for solutions which are efficient in all scenarios. This concept is referred to as highly RE in this paper and was first used by Bitran (1980). The concept was applied in the context of vehicle design by Fadel, Haque, Blouin, and Wiecek (2005). Georgiev, Luc, and Pardalos (2013); Goberna et al. (2015) investigate highly RE solutions for uncertain multi-objective linear programs.

The second straightforward concept of finding solutions which are efficient in at least one scenario, called flimsily RE in this paper, was also introduced by Bitran (1980).

Recently, there have been several approaches based on using the concept of worst-case robustness, as described by Ben-Tal et al. (2009), to define RE solutions. Independently, the concept has been considered by Kuroiwa and Lee (2012), analysed by Doolittle, Kerivin, and Wiecek (2012) for column-wise, row-wise and banded uncertainty and applied for internet traffic, used by Fliege and Werner (2013) in the context of portfolio selection problems, by Yu and Liu (2013) for tackling an uncertain multi-objective game theory problem, and Chen et al. (2012) report the successful application of such a concept to proton therapy for cancer treatment. If the uncertainty is not independent for each objective function, the concept has been generalised by Ehrgott, Ide, and Schöbel (2014) and further analysed by Goberna et al. (2015); Ide, Köbis, Kuroiwa, Schöbel, and Tammer (2014).

Besides the three mentioned concepts of flimsily, highly, and strictly RE, we generalise the concept of light robustness introduced by Fischetti and Monaci (2009); Schöbel (2014) for single-objective problems to bi-objective optimisation problems with one uncertain objective function. For its extension to general multi-objective optimisation problems we refer to Ide and Schöbel (2016).

Furthermore, there exist some other approaches for combining multi-objective optimisation and uncertainty which optimise the stability of a solution. In this setting, one idea is to replace all objective functions by their mean functions as originally suggested by Branke (1998) for single-objective optimisation; see Deb and Gupta (2006); Deb and Gupta (2005). A second approach minimises the original objective functions, while additional constraints restrict the variation between the original objective functions and their mean functions, see Barrico and Antunes (2006); Gunawan and Azarm (2005); Witting (2012).

We also use ideas of Iancu and Trichakis (2014) who apply multi-objective optimisation techniques to refine single-objective robustness concepts.

In Section 4 we define a robust solution to an uncertain optimisation problem such as (1), i.e., we combine robust and multi-objective optimisation. Before doing so, we discuss basic concepts of both fields in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

problem which yields robust solutions. The best researched concept of strict (minmax, worst-case) robustness
(Ben-Tal et al., 2009; Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1998; Bertsimas & Sim, 2004; Soyster, 1973) asks for a solution x which minimises the objective function in the worst case.

When solving the robust counterpart of an optimisation problem, the choice of the uncertainty set, i.e., the set of scenarios 
                           U
                         a solution should hedge against, will have almost as much influence on the outcome as the robustness concept chosen. Robustness concepts can usually be defined generally, i.e., they are not restricted to a certain type of uncertainty set. However, most algorithms to find robust solutions rely strongly on the structure of the underlying uncertainty set. The algorithms we propose work on the following uncertainty sets:

                           
                              
                                 Finite uncertainty set. In this case we assume that the set of scenarios is finite, i.e.,

                                 Polyhedral uncertainty set. We assume that the uncertainty set is given as the convex hull of a finite set of scenarios, i.e., 
                                    
                                       U
                                       =

                                 . This is also known as scenario-generated uncertainty (Ben-Tal et al., 2009).

These two types of uncertainty sets have been used extensively in the literature. In particular, polyhedral uncertainty sets include the case of so-called interval uncertainty sets where the coefficients vary in intervals such that we obtain a par-axial box as the uncertainty set 
                           U
                         (i.e., a special polyhedron).

In the following subsections of this article, we introduce different concepts for robust efficiency (RE) in bi-objective optimisation problems with one uncertain objective (3). We illustrate the concepts by means of a small example, which is introduced in Section 4.2. We then introduce concepts for RE in Sections 4.3–4.6 and finish with a discussion of the relationships among our robustness concepts in Section 4.8.

Motivated by the robustness approaches of Ben-Tal et al. (2009); Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998); Soyster (1973) for the single-objective case, the strictly RE counterpart of (3) asks for an efficient solution of the bi-objective problem which is efficient in the worst-case. We denote the set of worst-case scenarios of solution

                        Note that our definition of strictly RE solutions is consistent with the robustness concepts published recently by Ehrgott et al. (2014); Kuroiwa and Lee (2012).

Our final robustness concept is inspired by light robustness for single-objective optimisation problems introduced by Fischetti and Monaci (2009) and generalised by Schöbel (2014). The concept of light robustness uses a nominal scenario
                        
                           
                              
                                 ξ
                                 ^
                              
                              ,
                           
                         which may be the undisturbed or the most likely scenario. From now on we assume that such a scenario 
                           
                              ξ
                              ^
                           
                         has been chosen and fixed. The idea of light robustness is the following: one only looks for solutions which are good enough in the nominal scenario, and chooses the most robust among them.

Transferred to the bi-objective case we hence want to have solutions which are close to efficient in the nominal scenario. Among such solutions we choose one minimising the worst-case value of the uncertain objective. In order to apply this idea, let

                        . Different choices for ε yield different ε-lightly and ε-representative lightly RE solutions.

The following observation shows that ε-representative lightly RE solutions can be regarded as a compromise between nominally efficient and worst-case optimal solutions with respect to z
                        2. The choice of ε determines whether they are closer to nominal efficiency or to worst-case optimal solutions.

A big advantage of ε-representative lightly RE solutions compared to highly, flimsily and strictly RE solutions is that we can generate one solution x in each of the sets

                         which provides a robust Pareto front. More precisely, we obtain a spread of solutions with objective vectors close to the vectors

                         and thus a good representation of the trade-offs available. At the same time the selected solutions are guaranteed to have a good worst-case performance.

In the following paragraphs, we discuss the choice of ε to obtain a representative robust Pareto front. A decision maker may be able to specify how much solution quality he or she is willing to sacrifice in order to obtain an ε-representative lightly RE solution that is better in the worst-case (see Lemma 1). The parameter vector ε can also be used to adjust the size of

                           Lemma 4
                           
                              Let x be a highly RE solution. Then x is flimsily, strictly and ε-lightly RE.
                           

Let x be highly RE.

                                 
                                    1.
                                    
                                       x is efficient for any scenario 
                                          
                                             ξ
                                             ∈
                                             U
                                             ,
                                          
                                        hence it is trivially flimsily RE.

Now suppose that x is not strictly RE. Then there exists a feasible solution x′ with z

Note that the set of ε-(representative) lightly RE solutions can be adjusted by the choice of ε. In the following text, we show that we can choose ε for any strictly RE solution in such a way that this solution is also ε-(representative) lightly RE.

                     Iancu and Trichakis (2014) deal with single-objective robust optimisation problems and use the concept of efficiency to refine the definition of (single-objective) strict robustness. Their idea is as follows. The ‘traditional’ set of strictly RE solutions

                      contains all solutions which minimise the objective value in the worst case; however, some of these solutions would not be considered reasonable in any practical setting. Consider a solution x which is not better than another solution y in every scenario, i.e., if z(x, ξ) ≥ z(y, ξ) for all

                     . We need not consider x even if it minimises the worst-case value of the uncertain objective. Iancu and Trichakis (2014) remove these solutions from the set of strictly robust solutions and consider only the strictly robust solutions which are non-dominated with respect to

In the next section, we use this property to solve robust bi-objective combinatorial optimisation problems with finite uncertainty sets. Furthermore, our algorithm makes use of the fact that we can determine the PRO RE sets by checking dominance within the RE sets only, analogously to Iancu and Trichakis (2014), as stated in the following observation.

We can use the insights gained in Observations 1 and 2 to compute the sets of flimsily, highly, strictly, and ε-representative lightly PRO RE solutions in two steps.

Filter among the efficient solutions found in Step 1 for flimsily/highly/strictly/ε-representative lightly PRO RE solutions.

The applicability and efficiency of this approach depends on the algorithms available for the two steps. For the first step, we can use any known algorithm for solving a deterministic combinatorial MOP. Despite known intractability results, many of these problems can be solved effectively in practice, in particular if the number of efficient solutions is reasonably small. Solution approaches include scalarization techniques, dynamic programming, branch and bound methods, or generic frameworks such as the two-phase method, see, for example, Ehrgott and Gandibleux (2002).

We now develop an algorithm for the second step, in which we efficiently filter the solution set of step 1 in order to obtain PRO RE solutions. To this end, we use the lexicographic order to sort vectors: for

Assume that until step j of the filtering procedure all elements have been filtered correctly, i.e., the elements until xj
                            that have been added to

                              X
                           . To show that xj
                            is filtered correctly, we have to show that z(xl
                           ) ≤ z(xj
                           ) for some xl

                           ) for k as chosen in step 3 of the filtering procedure. The ⟸ assertion is clear. For ⟹, due to the lexicographic ordering l < j, we have:

                              
                                 •

                                    ) ≤ z(xl
                                    )≦z(xj
                                    ) (otherwise, xl
                                     would have been added to

                                     and replaced xk
                                    ).

If l < k we have z
                                    1(xl
                                    )≦z

                                    1(xj
                                    ). It follows that z
                                    2(xl
                                    )≧z
                                    2(xk
                                    ) (otherwise xk
                                     would have been dominated). Hence z
                                    2(xj

                      is a polytope, i.e.,

                     Note that the assumption of a polyhedral uncertainty set is not unrealistic. As a special case it includes interval-based uncertainty which is (apart from finite uncertainty sets) probably the most considered case in uncertain single-objective optimisation (e.g. Bertsimas & Sim, 2004; Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 2000).

The goal of this section is to show the conditions under which bi-objective robust optimisation problems with polyhedral uncertainty sets can be translated into problems with finite uncertainty sets. This technique allows one — at least in the case of deterministic combinatorial MOPs — to apply methods developed in the previous section. In the following text we show that this can in fact be done (under mild conditions) for strictly, highly and ε-representative lightly RE solutions.

Summarising, we have shown that in many cases an uncertain bi-objective problem with polyhedral uncertainty can be solved by replacing the polyhedral set 
                        U
                      by its extreme points and applying the methods proposed in Section 6.

We present two real-world applications which are modelled as bi-objective robust optimisation problems with one uncertain objective.

In the aircraft route guidance problem, a pilot or a dispatcher at an airline operations centre must choose and file a flight plan which is an official and detailed description of the route the pilot will fly from origin to destination. When convective weather is present in an area, there may be turbulence, lightning and thunder, or hail. Aircraft must avoid the most dangerous weather conditions but planners still face a difficult decision when selecting a route. They must trade off efficiency and risk. Kuhn (2008) observes that individual pilots trade off risk and path efficiency differently. This leads to the formulation of an aircraft route guidance problem as a bi-objective shortest path problem over a network that represents discretised airspace (Kuhn & Raith, 2010). Consider a graph 
                           
                              G
                              =

                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              )
                           
                         with vertices V including a source s ∈ V and a sink t ∈ V and edges E. Let 
                           Q
                         denote the set of all s-t-paths in G. Furthermore, let two functions 
                           
                              l

                              :
                              E

                         be given. For any edge we call l(e) its length and w(e) its weather exposure. We would like to find a path Q from s to t with small length l(Q) ≔ ∑
                           e ∈ Q
                        
                        l(e) and small weather exposure measure w(Q) ≔ ∑
                           e ∈ Q
                        
                        w(e).

In our problem the distance between any pair of points in the airspace can be calculated, but the weather exposure associated with flying between the points depends upon weather conditions and is uncertain. Weather is notoriously difficult to predict. Recent advances in meteorology have focused on the production and use of ensemble methods, which involve a number (typically from 5 to 100) of forecasts of the future state of the weather (Gneiting & Raferty, 2005). Planners will then have to select routes maximising efficiency and safety given multiple possible future states of the weather. To model this, we denote by 
                           U
                         the set of possible weather scenarios. Let w(e, ξ) denote the weather exposure measure of edge e in scenario

                        Pilots can, of course, change the trajectory of their aircraft dynamically. However, they work with dispatchers at an airline operations centre to create and file a flight plan (or flight plan amendment) that describes their planned trajectory all the way to their destination airport and then follow this flight plan until a change in plans is necessary. Since pilots, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers are busy, particularly during convective weather events, it is of particular importance to find robust routes which are not likely to be changed (see, for example, McNally et al. (2013)).

For computational experiments, we consider a grid of airspace for which measures of precipitation intensity (“VIP” scores based on a commonly used index that scores areas between 0 and 6 where 6 indicates maximum liquid content) and cloud heights (radar echo-top data) are available, see left and centre of Fig. 4. According to Kuhn (2008), these two measures can be used to calculate airspace occupancy, a measure from which we obtain the weather exposure (risk) value, see right plot of Fig. 4.

When several weather forecasts are available, several sets of precipitation intensity and cloud height data make up scenarios of our uncertain problem (11). We consider three different weather forecasts leading to three different weather scenarios as illustrated in Fig. 5
                        . For the instance consisting of a 45 × 41 grid, a network is constructed with edges connecting each grid cell (vertex) to adjacent grid cells. We assume that planes fly at constant altitude. We also note that identified paths only give an approximation of an actual flight path , which must be smooth and cannot have 90 or 45 degree turns. The additive measures of weather exposure and flight path efficiency are again somewhat simplistic. Pilots do not necessarily aggregate weather exposure risk in this way, and also fuel burn is not taken into account. Follow-up research will increase the realism of model representations of airspace and of flight paths.

The problem of transporting hazardous materials (also known as hazmat transportation) has received much attention in the literature. An excellent overview is given by Erkut, Tjandra, and Verter (2007). Hazardous materials are transported by rail, road, ship or plane but also through pipelines. Here, we focus on road transport. The danger associated with transporting hazardous materials is that those materials may unintentionally be released into the environment due to some incident, such as a traffic accident. From the shipping company’s point of view, hazmat transports should follow routes with low travel time, distance, or fuel cost. It is also in the interest of the shipping company, the local population, and the government to limit exposure to hazardous materials in case of an incident. Erkut et al. (2007) discuss different approaches for measuring the risk associated with a vertex and edge in a network, and how this risk may be treated as an additive measure of risk along a path.

Here, we consider the problem where the shipping company aims to choose a route for a single hazmat shipment that minimises both travel time along the path and a measure of the risk associated with a possible incident along the path. Formally, we seek a path in a directed graph that represents the road network in the area. The travel time t(e, ξ) is usually uncertain, in particular in urban areas where travel time can vary greatly, due to unforeseen road works, accidents or variations in day-to-day traffic.

According to Bell (2006); Erkut et al. (2007), the risk of a path Q can be defined as

For our computational experiments we generate a problem instance based on the “Chicago Regional” traffic assignment instance (Bar-Gera, 2013). Traffic assignment models the simultaneous movement of network users between different sink and source vertices of a network and accounts for congestion using a nonlinear relationship between flow on an edge and travel time. It is assumed travellers follow their shortest path resulting in a user-equilibrium flow pattern, see Patriksson (1994).

We consider travel time to be our uncertain objective z
                        2. For our problem instance one travel time scenario is based on the traffic assignment equilibrium solution for this network, which represents a likely distribution of flow and thus travel time. We generate two other scenarios ξ
                        2 and ξ
                        3 by using flows (and thus travel times) from early stages of an iterative traffic assignment algorithm. Hence, these solutions are not user equilibrium solutions but are reasonably close to the equilibrium and represent slight variation in day-to-day traffic. In Fig. 6

                         is shown.

For the deterministic risk objective z
                        1, which is based on the product of accident probability and population affected by an accident on an edge, we assume all accident probabilities are equal due to a lack of more appropriate estimates of the probability. We randomly assign population, with a large agglomeration of population next to the shore of Lake Michigan representing Chicago. Other population centres representing smaller cities in the area around Chicago are randomly chosen. Fig. 6 shows this distribution of the population, where darker shading indicates higher population. While not entirely realistic, the instance allows us to demonstrate our RE concepts.

We now apply PRO RE to the applications from Sections 8.1 and 8.2. Using the algorithm of Section 6 we hence need to solve a deterministic multi-objective shortest path problem (MSP) in the first step. Although the MSP is NP-hard it has been demonstrated experimentally that even large problems can be solved in reasonable computation time (Guerriero & Musmanno, 2001; Machuca & Mandow, 2012; Raith & Ehrgott, 2009), and also that the number of efficient solutions in practice is not exponential (Müller-Hannemann & Weihe, 2006).

We solve the bi-objective robust shortest path problem for finite uncertainty sets and all concepts for PRO RE introduced in this paper by solving it as an MSP problem. We use a labelling method (Guerriero & Musmanno, 2001) to obtain a minimal complete set of efficient paths

                        . Characteristics of the two problem instances used to demonstrate the introduced robustness concepts are given in Table 1
                        . For both instances, three scenarios are considered hence the MSP problems have four objectives. The algorithm is implemented in C, compiled under Ubuntu 12.04 with gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3 compiler and run on a laptop with 2.67 GHz quad core processor and 7.8 GB of RAM.

The resulting MSP problem for the aircraft route guidance instance (Section 8.1) has 704 efficient paths when searching for paths with source vertex at the southern (lower) end of the airspace shown in Fig. 5 and sink vertex at the northern end. Subsequent filtering identifies the different types of PRO RE solutions (Table 1) shown in Figs. 7
                        –10
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         where paths are plotted on the VIP image of the nominal weather scenario ξ
                        2.

We observe in Fig. 7 that there are many flimsily PRO RE solutions, which is expected as this is the most permissive concept for PRO RE we introduced. However, the number of flimsily PRO RE paths is much lower than the number of efficient solutions found for the MSP problem. This is because relatively few paths are efficient for a bi-objective problem with respect to at least one pair of z
                        1 and z
                        2(·, ξ) compared to the multi-objective problem.

The concept of highly PRO RE solutions is very restrictive. In our instance there is only one highly PRO RE path, see Fig. 8. It is the unique shortest path (w.r.t the deterministic length) and hence cannot be dominated in any scenario. Fig. 9 shows strictly PRO RE solutions. There are two major groups of paths, those that travel fairly straight from the south to the north but circumvent some of the risky areas, and those that travel a lot further but avoid most of the risky weather. Finally, ε-representative lightly PRO RE solutions for

                                    (

                                    )
                                 
                                 ⊤
                              
                           
                         are shown in Fig. 10. The ε-representative lightly PRO RE paths present a range of solutions over the objective space that appear significantly different when compared to strictly PRO RE solutions in Fig. 9. They capture major trade-offs between alternatives available to a decision maker. Note that most of the almost-identical strictly PRO RE solutions are replaced by a single ε-representative lightly PRO RE one. Those paths also feature both acceptable nominal quality and low worst-case weather exposure.

The MSP problem of the hazmat routing instance (Section 8.2) has a total of 1632 efficient solutions (also see Table 1) from which RE solutions are filtered. Obtaining many flimsily PRO RE solutions (Fig. 11) is again an expected result due to the permissiveness of the concept, and there are again significantly fewer flimsily PRO RE solutions than there are solutions of MSP. No highly PRO RE path is found as there is no path that is efficient in all scenarios. We find fewer strictly PRO RE solutions (Fig. 12) than flimsily PRO RE ones, but there still are many of them. This is due to the almost grid-like network structure which allows for many similar paths that have slightly different population exposure and are efficient in the worst-case travel time. The obtained (150, 600)⊤-representative lightly PRO RE paths (Fig. 13) are of reasonable nominal quality and hence fairly short. No ε-representative lightly robust path follows the very long path that is obtained for flimsily and strictly PRO RE solutions. Again, a good set of alternatives is obtained for this robustness concept.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We compare four different robustness concepts for bi-objective optimisation with one uncertain objective function and propose an algorithm for the most common case of finite or polyhedral uncertainty sets. From our experience with two real-world applications we conclude that robust efficient solutions to such problems can be computed in a reasonable time, and that different types of robust solutions can be identified. Comparing the four concepts, representative light robustness turns out to be the most promising since it can be used to derive a robust Pareto front that represents a set of alternatives for a decision maker that are not too similar, that cover a range of available trade-offs, and that have good worst-case performance.

We plan to further investigate more efficient algorithms to solve the bi-objective problems. The filtering algorithms proposed in Section 6 are only applicable to problems with finite efficient sets. It would be worthwhile to consider cases involving infinite efficient sets or to investigate other types of network problems. Research into optimisation over the efficient set has helped analysts select one from the many efficient solutions that may be found for MOPs (Yamamoto, 2002). Extending these ideas to uncertain bi-objective optimisation would be another interesting avenue of future work.
