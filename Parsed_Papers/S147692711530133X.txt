                  Genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have identified a large number of genes and variants implicating a variety of disease etiological mechanisms. It is imperative for the study of human diseases to put these genetic findings into a coherent functional context. Here we use system biology tools to examine disease connections of five master genes for CD4+ T cell subtypes (TBX21, GATA3, RORC, BCL6, and FOXP3). We compiled a list of genes functionally interacting (protein–protein interaction, or by acting in the same pathway) with the master genes, then we surveyed the disease connections, either by experimental evidence or by genetic association. Embryonic lethal genes (also known as essential genes) are over-represented in master genes and their interacting genes (55% versus 40% in other genes). Transcription factors are significantly enriched among genes interacting with the master genes (63% versus 10% in other genes). Predicted haploinsufficiency is a feature of most these genes. Disease-connected genes are enriched in this list of genes: 42% of these genes have a disease connection according to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (versus 23% in other genes), and 74% are associated with some diseases or phenotype in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) (versus 43% in other genes). Seemingly, not all of the diseases connected to genes surveyed were immune related, which may indicate pleiotropic functions of the master regulator genes and associated genes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Master transcription factors (master regulators, master genes) are defined in the context of fetal development and cell type differentiation to start a chain of regulatory actions that eventually lead to a unique cell type (Ohno, 1979). This description of master genes in time is complemented by another description of master regulators in space as the top-level genes in a regulatory hierarchy (Chan and Kyba, 2013). Master genes in the transcriptional network are different to hub genes (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004), which have more connections with other genes. Since it is more likely that a transcription factor (TF) has a huge number of targets rather than a gene being regulated by a huge number of TFs, hub genes in transcription networks could be TFs that regulate many genes.

Intuitively, important genes should have phenotypic or disease implications. Hub genes, for example, due to their central role in connecting other genes in biological networks, are proposed as candidates for human disease genes (Lehner, 2007; Chavali et al., 2010; Barabási et al., 2011; Han et al., 2013; Gaiteri et al., 2014). From the temporal perspective, master regulators are important in that without their activation, there would be no cell differentiation or subtypes. The question we ask here is whether master regulators have strong phenotypic and/or disease implications. If so, the label of master genes provides an extra and an independent approach for prioritization of candidate disease genes.

Our question can also further expand to genes that are directly linked to the master genes, such as genes that are TF targets, TF cofactors, and genes that signal to TFs. Many systems biology programs provide information about protein–protein-interaction (PPI), co-expression, co-localization, pathway co-membership, and genes in signaling pathways upstream of TFs. Even though the biological implication of some PPI may not be clear, systems biology programs are efficient tools for generating biological hypotheses.

Initially, we became interested in potential connections between disease genes and master genes by noting that one of the 101 genes that are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease), GATA3, is a master gene (Okada et al., 2014; Freudenberg et al., 2015) (for the CD4+ T cell subtype Th2 (Zheng and Flavell, 1997)). T cells are white blood cells, which are crucial for cell-mediated immunity. In particular, CD4+ T cells recognize cells displaying foreign antigens on their cell surface, which triggers a sequence of immune responses including the release of cytokines. CD4+ T cells can differentiate into several subtypes depending on their function. The major CD4+ T cell subtypes are categorized as Th1 (T helper 1), Th2, Th17, Tfh (follicular helper T), and Treg (regulatory T) (Janeway et al., 2004; Nakayamada et al., 2012). The master regulators of these five CD4+ T cell subtypes, as described in the mouse and their human counterparts, are TBX21, GATA3, RORC, BCL6 and FOXP3. TBX21 is a member of the T-boxes gene family, also known as T-bet, TBLYM; GATA3 is a member of the GATA zinc finger domain containing gene family, also known as HDR; RORC is a member of the nuclear hormone receptors gene family, also known as NR1F3, RORG, RZRG, TOR; BCL6 is a member of the C2H2-type zinc fingers and BTB domain containing gene families, also known as BCL5, BCL6A, LAZ3, ZBTB27; and FOXP3 is a member of the forkhead boxes gene family, also known as AIID, DIETER, JM2, PIDX, SCURFIN, XPID (Evans and Jenner, 2013). According to a census of human transcription factors (Vaquerizas et al., 2009), all five master genes are transcription factors.

The literature contains multiple examples of master regulatory genes with phenotypic and disease implications. For example, the gene KLHL9 appears to activate master regulators for mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma (Chen et al., 2014); and the master regulators FOXE1, HOXA2, SP4, TPT1 are likely to play roles in cancers (Tovar et al., 2015). Nevertheless, using hub genes is still the most popular approach for gene prioritization, and addressing potential links between master genes and disease phenotype is an under-studied topic.

In this article, we use two disease gene databases, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (McKusick, 1998) and NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (Welter et al., 2014), to examine the disease connection of the five CD4+ T cell subtype master genes. These two genotype-disease association databases differ on several aspects (Rouillard et al., 2015). For example, OMIM (GWAS) focuses on genes (variants), and Mendelian trait genes (complex trait genes), and uses a set of inclusion criteria (such as statistical significance in genetic association studies). In OMIM, the term “disease genes” refer to “disease-connected genes” as the causal link in many studies is not conclusive. In GWAS, the disease-associated genes are well understood to be based on statistical association.

We then used five systems biology databases/programs to search other genes linked to our five master genes. The programs used are geneMANIA, STRING, innateDB, MetaCore, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The disease connection of genes linked to the master regulator genes was also assessed.

It is important to be mindful that potential bias may exist in the data used in our analysis. For example, the degree of confidence in a gene-disease connection may differ between different studies. Experimental studies and genetic studies offer different types of evidences, so do genetic association studies and family studies or cytogenetic observations. The concept of a “direct link” between gene products could refer to a protein–protein interaction, or could refer to proteins functioning in the same pathway.

All five of the master regulator genes are connected to diseases/phenotypes. According to information provided by OMIM, a variant in the promoter region of TBX21 is associated with asthma (Akahoshi et al., 2005). According to GWAS catalog, a variant in the KPNB1/TBKBP1/TBX21 locus is associated with multiple sclerosis (Patsopoulos et al., 2011), however the variant is actually closer to the other two genes than to TBX21.

From information in OMIM, variants in GATA3 are associated with hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal (HDR) syndrome (also known as Barakat syndrome) (Van Esch et al., 2000). According to GWAS catalog, an intronic SNP in GATA3 is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Migliorini et al., 2013), and a SNP upstream from GATA3 is associated with colorectal cancer (Figueiredo et al., 2014). Other associated diseases/phenotypes include calcium level (O'Seaghdha et al., 2013), Hodgkin's lymphoma (Enciso-Mora et al., 2010) and, as mentioned earlier, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Okada et al., 2014).

From GWAS catalog, the RORC locus is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Jostins et al., 2014). The full name of BCL6, B-cell lymphoma 6, implies its disease connection to B-cell lymphoma (Ye et al., 1993), through the mechanism of chromosomal translocation (Ohno, 2004). Besides lymphoma, a region near BCL6 is also associated with kidney function related traits (Okada et al., 2012). FOXP3 mutation causes the rare disease immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX) (Bennett et al., 2001), characterized by severe diarrhea, dermatitis and type-1 diabetes.

Genes that are embryonic-development lethal in knockout mice are called essential genes (Lu, 2015; Georgi et al., 2013). The human essential gene is just an ortholog of a mouse essential gene. By this definition, GATA3, BCL6, and FOXP3 are essential genes, whereas TBX21 and RORC are not (Georgi et al., 2013).

Another means by which to classify gene disease/phenotype associations is by dominant versus recessive inheritance. For the purposes of this study, we describe a dominant inheritance pattern (where one wild-type copy is insufficient to maintain a wild-type phenotype) as haploinsufficient (HI). Genes with a recessive inheritance pattern (whereby one wild-type copy is sufficient to maintain a wild-type phenotype) are termed haplosufficient (HS). BCL6
                     −/+ mice seem to be normal, thus it is HS in mice (Dent et al., 1997). Deleting one copy of the GATA3 gene in mice does not appear to affect health, fertility or lifespan (Pandolfi et al., 1995). However, in humans, GATA3 is haploinsufficient, because those with just one wild-type copy have HDR syndrome (Van Esch et al., 2000), indicating that results from an animal model do not always translate to humans. The TBX21 in mice is HI for airway hyperresponsiveness (Finotto et al., 2002), whereas its HI/HS status in human is unknown (Naiche et al., 2005).

Based on a computational human haploinsufficiency (HI) score derived from qualities such as human–macaque conservation in coding regions, promoter mutability, embryonic expression and closeness to other haploinsufficiency genes (Huang et al., 2010), we found that the predicted HI scores for the five master genes are 0.36 (TBX21), 0.71 (GATA3), 0.70 (RORC), 0.51 (BCL6), and 0.45 (FOXP3), where a score of 1 indicates the greatest chance of HI and a score of 0 indicates the lowest chance. Note that the FOXP3 gene is located on the X chromosome, thus the concept of haploinsufficiency and HI score should only apply to females. These predicted probabilities are all larger than the median (0.324), and, with the exception of TBX21, larger than the mean (0.39), which is consistent with the idea that the master genes are more likely to be observed as disease genes.

From the results in this section, we reach the following conclusions: (i) all five master regulators are disease-connected genes, (ii) the associated diseases are not exclusively immune-related, (iii) the two disease gene databases typically do not lead to the same set of diseases (probably reflective of the fact that disease associations discovered in cytogenetic or human family studies can be different from those discovered by population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), (iv) Four master genes have greater (than the median) chance to be haploinsufficient, and logically, a greater chance to manifest as a disease gene. The results from this section are summarized in Table 1
                     .

We use multiple interactome (Fung et al., 2012) databases and programs to find genes (gene products) that interact with the five master genes. The logic follows the familiar “guilt-by-association” idea (Ideker and Sharan, 2008; Lee et al., 2011). That is, if the master genes play a role in a disease/phenotype, gene products interacting with them may have a higher chance to be linked to the disease/phenotype also. The master genes and the linked genes may be considered to form a gene-set, i.e., a collection of genes that either interact or share a common label at a specific level (Li et al., 2015).

Instead of using a single net result from a summary of multiple networks (Khurana et al., 2013), we selected the type of connections which are more likely to be relevant to our study, for example, the protein–protein interaction. We also limited the number of linked genes so their disease connection could be examined manually. The protein–protein interaction information was obtained from STRING and geneMANIA; the neighboring genes in a pathway were obtained from MetaCore and IPA; genes in the same pathway, whether they are neighbors or not, were obtained from geneMANIA.

Forty-four genes/gene-products interact with TBX21 at either the protein-DNA or the protein–protein level, 65 interact with GATA3, 30 interact with RORC, 151 interact with BCL6, and 26 interact with FOXP3 (Supplemental Table S1).

                     Fig. 1
                     (A)–(E) illustrates that TBX21 is up-regulated in CD4+ samples (total CD4+ cells, see the figure caption of Fig. 1) and interacts with STAT1, STAT4, and LCK; GATA3 is up-regulated in CD4+ samples and interacts with IL4, STAT5, SPI1, and STAT6; RORC is up-regulated in CD4+ cells with interaction to NCOA1; BCL6 interacts with STAT3, FOXO3A; FOXP3 is up-regulated in CD4+ cells with interaction to 5′-nucleotidase (NT5E or CD73), RBPJ.

We used IPA to check whether the immune system master genes are implicated in cancer. The five T-cell subtype master genes usually do not pass the differential expression threshold in cancer expression data. However, GATA3 and FOXP3 are among the list of 623 genes which are differentially expressed in breast cancer data, and BCL6 is among 433 differentially expressed genes in thyroid cancer data (log2(fold-change)>1 and FDR<0.01). The resulting “upstream regulation analysis” from these three genes by IPA is shown in Fig. 2
                      (display setting: depth of three steps, breadth of five downstream regulators). IPA data indicates that GATA3 is linked to IFNG and AKT1 (Milo et al., 2009) (Fig. 2(A)), BCL6 is linked to MYC (Horn et al., 2013) (Fig. 2(B)), and FOXP3 linked to HDAC9 (Li et al., 2007) (Fig. 2(C)).

The genes that are linked to the five master genes by geneMANIA, STRING, MetaCore (Fig. 1), and IPA (Fig. 2), by the pipeline described above, are summarized in Table 2
                     . In most instances, linked genes differed according to the database used. Cytokine profiles are characteristic features of CD4+ T cell subtypes, therefore it is not surprising that some cytokines are among those interacting with the master regulator (e.g. INFG and IL4). Many cytokine genes are known to be associated with diseases (Hollegaard and Bidwell, 2006; Vandernbroeck, 2012), and their presence in Table 2 is evidence that master-gene-linked-set is enriched with disease genes. Similarly, HLA region genes are involved in antigen presentation, and consequently to T cell function. The disease association of HLA region genes is well studied (Svejgaard and Ryder, 2012; Thomson, 1995), and their presence is Table 2 is reassuring. It is interesting that one master gene GATA3 appears to be interacting with another master gene TBX21 (Kanhere et al., 2012). Mathematical models have been studied based on mutual inhibition of TBX21 and GATA3, as well as autoactivation of GATA3 (Mariani et al., 2014).

After excluding cytokines and HLA genes, and excluding master genes themselves, we relist genes from Table 2 that directly interact with the five master regulators in Table 3
                      (without the geneMANIA/pathway), and Table 4
                      (for those extra genes obtained from geneMANIA/pathway).

Sixty-two percent (29 out of 47) of the genes in Table 3 are essential (embryonic lethal after deletion in mouse), whereas 38% are non-essential. Comparing this with the ratio in the database, 2472 essential genes versus 3811 non-essential genes, represents a 2.5 odds-ratio enrichment of essential genes, with a χ
                     2 test p-value of 0.003 (Fisher test p-value=0.002). This ratio is consistent with the 3/5 essential genes among the five master genes (see Table 1). Thirty-six out of 52 genes in Table 3 are TFs or co-factors, based on two TF databases. This proportion (69%) is well above the genome-wide average of 10% ((1987+203)/20,000) TF genes (Li, 2011) (OR=18.6, χ
                     2 test p-value=4×10−40, Fisher test p-value=4×10−23).

There are 40 genes (of 52 total genes) in Table 3 (77%) with a disease or a phenotype association. It is unclear how many human genes are known to be disease-connected. In order to make a reasonable comparison, we split the disease-connected genes according to whether they have an OMIM entry or a GWAS catalog entry. From Table 3, 35% of genes have an OMIM entry (18 out of 52 total genes), compared to the 23% of OMIM entries with phenotype-causing mutations (3436 out of 14,981). There are roughly 8500 genes included in the GWAS catalog, or 43% of the approximately 20,000 human genes. In Table 3, the proportion of genes with a GWAS catalog entry is 73% (38 out of 52 total genes). For both databases, there is enrichment in the proportion of master regulator connected genes with a disease entry, compared to the total number observed in the genome.


                     Table 4 lists genes linked to the master genes only through geneMANIA pathways. The proportion of essential genes is 35% (6 of 17 total genes with the essential/nonessential information), which is lower than the overall proportion of essential genes, 39% (2466 of 6266 total genes, excluding the genes in Table 4), though the result is not statistically significant (OR=0.8, χ
                     2 test p-value=0.9, Fisher test p-value=0.8). The proportion of TFs is 37% (7 out of 19 total genes), which is higher than the overall proportion of 11% of genes which are TFs (2183 of 19,981 total genes, excluding the genes in Table 4) (OR=4.8, χ
                     2 test p-value=0.001, Fisher test p-value=0.002). Of genes in Table 4, 89% (17 out of 19) have disease/phenotype connection, even higher than the percentage in Table 3 (77%). Of these, 10 genes (representing 53%) have an entry in OMIM, and 14 genes (representing 79%) have an entry in GWAS catalog.

To have an average value, one can combine all genes in Tables 1, 3 and 4. The proportion of essential genes is then 55% (OR=1.9, χ
                     2 or Fisher test p-value=0.01), the proportion of TFs or co-factors is 63% (OR=14.2, χ
                     2 test p-value=4×10−47, Fisher test p-value=1×10−27) 82% of all genes have a known disease/phenotype connection. For database-specific connection, 42% of all genes in Tables 1, 3 and 4 have OMIM entries, and 74% have GWAS catalog entries (compared with 23% and 43% of all genes, excluding genes in these tables, respectively).

Of the 52 genes in Table 3, a predicted HI score is available for 41 genes Huang et al. (2010). For genes in Table 4, 14 out of 19 have HI scores. Fig. 3
                      shows the predicted HI score for genes in the entire genome (data from 12,218 genes (Huang et al., 2010)), as well as HI scores for genes in Tables 1, 3 and 4. There are only two genes (5%) with lower than whole-genome median (0.324) scores, representing a significant enrichment (χ
                     2 test p-value=2×10−8, Fisher test p-value=7×10−10). For the 14 genes from Table 4, five genes (35%) below the whole-genome median (0.324), with three of them being CD genes. The enrichment is however not significant (χ
                     2 or Fisher test p-value=0.4). For all genes in Tables 1, 3 and 4 with a HI score, 88% (53 of 60 total genes) are above the whole-genome median, a significant enrichment (χ
                     2 test p-value=6×10−9, Fisher test p-value=7×10−10).

From this section we can conclude: (i) genes that linked to the five master genes are highly enriched for transcription factors; (ii) these genes (when the CD genes are excluded) are somewhat enriched for essential genes; (iii) a very high proportion (more than 80%) of these genes have shown to be connected to a disease or phenotype; (iv) these genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

By incorporating genes that are linked to the master genes, we circumvent the debate of master genes versus lineage-specifying genes, (whether a single master gene is enough to govern CD4+ T cell differentiation) (Oestreich and Weinmann, 2015). For example, in addition to TBX21, STAT1 and STAT4 are also important in initiating the Th1 gene expression program (Oestreich and Weinmann, 2015; O'Shea et al., 2011). The concept of one-master-gene-one-subtype is complicated further by interplays between master genes themselves, such as TBX21 and GATA3 (Kanhere et al., 2012). As we learn more about the regulatory network in a cell subtype differentiation (Ciofani et al., 2012), the concept of master genes will be more clear.

The observed enrichment of TFs in genes linked to the master gene (Table 3) is consistent with the very definition of master genes, i.e., genes that initiate development or cell subtype differentiation. In order to have as large an impact as possible, it is more efficient for master genes to trigger other TFs, and subsequently these TFs trigger the third wave TFs. This avalanche in transcription regulation could be potentially modeled by a branching process (Rämö et al., 2006; Villani et al., 2011), with the master genes sitting at the root. The subtle differences between the proportion of essential genes, TFs, OMIM and GWAS genes in Tables 3 and 4 indicates that PPI and co-membership in a pathway may have a different degree of connectivity. Two proteins in the same regulatory pathway are not necessarily two TFs participating in a transcriptional cascade (Tovar et al., 2015). Attention to detail while performing high-throughput analysis of networks is required in order to avoid potential problems (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2012).

Here we also touch on a fundamental issue of essential genes, i.e., if removing the gene results in a lethal phenotype during embryonic development. Ideally, we would also like to know whether these genes are immune response lethal, in the sense that with the gene removed, one cannot survive a viral or bacterial infection, or will be overcome with autoimmunity. One caveat of the program we used to calculate haploinsufficiency is that in the event of genes on the X-chromosome, the haploinsufficiency score only applies to females. For example, mutations in the X-chromosome IL2RG and FOXP3 genes results in life threatening immune defects (severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Puck et al., 1997)) and autoimmunity (IPEX (Bennett et al., 2001)) in males, whilst female carriers are unaffected. Other measures of the importance of a gene have also been proposed (Petrovski et al., 2013).

To conclude, as hub genes are good candidates for disease genes because of their importance in biological networks, we show here that master genes for CD4+ T cell subtypes, as well as genes closely linked to them (most of them are transcription factors), tend to have disease implications. Note that master regulators are not necessarily essential genes, with the former more important in cell type differentiation and latter more crucial in embryonic-development. This points to the need for careful consideration in choosing a gene prioritization scheme that is appropriate to the phenotype or the disease.

The list of 2472 human orthologs of mouse essential genes was downloaded from the Database of Essential Genes (http://www.essentialgene.org/) (Gao et al., 2015), based on the publication of Georgi et al. (2013). Besides the essential genes, 3811 other genes are known to be non-essential, with the rest unknown.

The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (http://omim.org) (the version updated on March 28, 2015) is a catalog of human genes and genetic diseases. The information concerning the number of genes with phenotype-causing mutations is obtained from http://omim.org/statistics/geneMap (August 4, 2015). The information on the number of entries for gene description is obtained from http://omim.org/statistics/entry (August 4, 2015). GWAS Catalog, previously maintained at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), was moved to European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) on March 20, 2015 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). It is a list of published genome-wide association studies results.

We used five systems biology databases/packages to query genes interacting with master genes. (i) InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com/ (Breuer et al., 2013)) contains biological knowledge concerning the innate immune system as well as information on all mammalian cellular systems. The “experimentally validated interacting genes” option was used to find neighboring genes.

(ii) geneMANIA (http://www.genemania.org, (Zuberi et al., 2013)) can be used to generate hypotheses about gene functions and prioritize genes. In the geneMANIA database, the number of interacting genes with a given gene can be limited by an automatic weighting method, as well as by limiting to a maximum of 20 genes (the default setting). Once a set of linked genes are displayed, we further limit to only the “physical interactions”. We also selected the links by “pathway”, noting that resulting genes may not directly link to the target. We did not use the “co-expression” link because it may lead to a large number of genes with unclear causal relationships.

(iii) STRING (http://string-db.org/) is a database for known and predicted protein interactions, for a large number of organisms (Szklarczyk et al., 2015). In STRING, we excluded links due to co-expression. We also excluded links by text mining, and those by databases (because being in the same pathway may not indicate a direct connection). The maximum number of linked genes is limited to 50, with the higher confidence threshold (score>0.7).

(iv) MetaCore (https://portal.genego.com/) from Thomson Reuter (previously GeneGo (Ekins et al., 2007)) is a commercial database with high quality biological knowledge. In MetaCore, we used the “one click analysis”, where the user selects a target gene.

(v) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa), another commercial package, has both biological knowledge and inferred causal networks (Krämer et al., 2013).

The names of 1987 human transcription factors are obtained from Vaquerizas et al. (2009). For co-factors, we use a list of 302 genes from Animal Transcription Factor Database (animal TFDB) (http://www.bioguo.org/AnimalTFDB/) (Zhang et al., 2012).

Haploinsufficiency prediction data is obtained from the Support Information of Huang et al. (2010): column-5 in the dataset S1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001154.s001).

All calculation is done in R (https://www.r-project.org/), using the package chisq.test and fisher.test.
