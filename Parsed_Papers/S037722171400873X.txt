                  We consider the output processes of some elementary queueing models such as the M/M/1/K queue and the M/G/1 queue. An important performance measure for these counting processes is their variance curve v(t), which gives the variance of the number of customers in the time interval [0, t]. Recent work has revealed some non-trivial properties dealing with the asymptotic rate at which the variance curve grows. In this paper we add to these results by finding explicit expressions for the intercept term of the linear asymptote. For M/M/1/K queues our results are based on the deviation matrix of the generator. It turns out that by viewing output processes as Markovian Point Processes and considering the deviation matrix, one can obtain explicit expressions for the intercept term, together with some further insight regarding the BRAVO (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) effect. For M/G/1 queues our results are based on a classic transform of D. J. Daley. In this case we represent the intercept term of the variance curve in terms of the first three moments of the service time distribution. In addition we shed light on a conjecture of Daley, dealing with characterization of stationary M/M/1 queues within the class of stationary M/G/1 queues, based on the variance curve.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many models in applied probability and stochastic operations research involve counting processes. Such processes occur in supply chains, health care systems, communication networks as well as many other contexts involving service, logistics and/or technology. The canonical counting process example is the Poisson process. Generalizations include renewal processes, Markovian Point Processes (see for example Latouche and Ramaswami, 1999, Section 3.5 or Asmussen, 2003, Section XI.1), or general simple point processes on the line (see for example Daley and Vere-Jones, 2003).

Sometimes counting processes are used in their own right, while at other times they constitute components of more complicated models such as queues, population processes or risk models. In other instances, counting processes are implicitly defined and constructed through applied probability models. For example, a realization of a queue induces additional counting processes such as the departure process, {D(t), t ≥ 0}, counting the number of serviced customers in the queue until time t.

Departure counting processes of queues have been heavily studied in applied probability and operations research. Classic applied probability surveys are Daley (1976) and Disney and Konig (1985). More recent studies in operations research are Hendricks (1992),Tan (1999) and Tan (1997) where the authors consider departures in and within manufacturing production lines. Indeed, from an operational viewpoint, quantification of the variability of flows within a network is key. A similar comment applies to the flows of finished products at the end of the production process. From a theoretical perspective, there remain some open questions about the ability to characterize {D(t)} as a Markovian Point Process, as in Bean and Green (2000),Bean et al. (1998) and Olivier and Walrand (1994). Further, the discovery of the BRAVO effect (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) has motivated research on the variability of departure processes of queues, particularly in critically loaded regimes. Recent papers on this topic are Al Hanbali et al. (2011),Daley (2011),Daley et al. (2014),Nazarathy (2011) and Nazarathy and Weiss (2008).

                      an almost equally important performance measure of a counting processes is the variance curve, v(t) = Var(D(t)). For example, for a Poisson process with rate α, the variance curve

                     is the same as the mean curve. For more complicated counting processes, the variance curve is not as simple and is not the same as the mean curve.

                      We remind the reader that for exponential random variables (making the renewal process a Poisson process), c
                     2 = 1 and γ = 2, and the ordinary and equilibrium versions of a Poisson process are identical. See Asmussen (2003) and Daley and Vere-Jones (2003) for more background on renewal processes. Eq. (2) appears under a slightly different representation in Cox (1962) and was essentially first found in Smith (1959). Generalizations of renewal processes are in Brown and Solomon (1975),Daley and Mohan (1978) and Hunter (1969).

The above examples indicate that, for counting processes in general, it is likely to be fruitful to look for an asymptotic expression for the variance curve of the form

Moving on from renewal processes to implicitly defined counting processes, the variance curve is typically more complicated to describe and characterize. For example, while the output of a stationary M/M/1 queue with arrival rate λ and service rate μ is simply a Poisson process with rate λ (see Kelly, 1979), the variance curve when the system starts empty at time 0 is much more complicated than v(t) = λt. It can be represented in terms of integrals of expressions involving Bessel functions of the first kind, and requires several lines to be written out fully (as in Theorem 5.1 of Al Hanbali et al., 2011). Nevertheless (see Theorem 5.2 in Al Hanbali et al., 2011) the curve can be sensibly approximated as follows:

As observed from the formula above, it may be initially quite surprising that the asymptotic variance rate is reduced by a factor of 2(1 − 2/π) ≈ 0.73 when ρ changes from being approximately 1 to exactly 1. This is a manifestation of the BRAVO effect. BRAVO was first observed for M/M/1/K queues in Nazarathy and Weiss (2008) in which case, as K → ∞, the factor is 2/3, a fact that we confirm in this paper. It was later analyzed for M/M/1 queues and more generally GI/G/1 queues in Al Hanbali et al. (2011). BRAVO has been numerically conjectured for GI/G/1/K queues in Nazarathy (2011), and observed for multi-server M/M/s/K queues in the many-server scaling regime in Daley et al. (2014).

                     . For a stationary M/M/1 queue, {D(t)} is a Poisson process and thus

                     . As opposed to that, for an M/M/1 queue starting empty, it follows from (4) that

                      as long as ρ ≠ 1. When ρ = 1, we see from (4) that the variance curve does not have the asymptotic form (3). This can happen more generally. If, for example, there is sufficient long range dependence in the counting process, then the variance can grow super-linearly (see Daley and Vesilo, 1997 for some examples). This demonstrates that the asymptotic variance rate,

We are now faced with the challenge of finding the intercept term for other counting processes generated by queues. In this paper we carry out such an analysis for two models related to the M/M/1 queue: a finite capacity M/M/1/K queue, and an infinite capacity M/G/1 queue.

In this case the departure process is a Markovian Point Process. The linear asymptote is then given by formulas based on the matrix Λ
                        − = (1π
                         − Λ)−1, where Λ is the generator matrix of the (finite) birth-death process,

                         is its stationary distribution taken as a row vector, and 1 is a column vector of 1’s. In the case where ρ = 1, the distribution

                        ♯ is called the deviation matrix (also known as the Drazin inverse of − Λ), and we are able to provide explicit expressions for the entries of this matrix. Our contribution also includes some useful results regarding the asymptotic covariance between the count and phase in arbitrary Markovian Point Processes which, to the best of our knowledge, have not appeared elsewhere.

When the third moment of the service time distribution is finite, then it is known that the stationary queue length has a finite variance. When the service time distribution is not exponential, the form of

                         together with a discussion of the deviation matrix and its application to Markovian Point Processes. In Section 3 we present our M/G/1 queue results for

                         and discuss a related conjecture of Daley, dealing with a characterization of the M/M/1 queue within the class of stationary M/G/1 queues. We conclude in Section 4.

We begin our investigation with the M/M/1/K queue, where K denotes the total capacity of the system. In this case, it is well known that the departure process {D(t)} is a Markovian Point Process and is a renewal processes only when K = 1 or K = ∞. Some standard references on Markovian Point Processes are Asmussen (2003, Section XI.1) and Latouche and Ramaswami (1999, Section 3.5).

Denote the arrival rate by λ > 0, the service rate by μ > 0 and let ρ = λ/μ be the traffic intensity. The queue length process, {Q(t)}, is a continuous-time Markov chain on the state space {0, 1, …, K}, with generator matrix Λ and stationary distribution (row) vector

                     see Coolen-Schrijner and van Doorn (2002). Note that we take the indices of the matrices and vectors of size K + 1 used here to run on range {0, …, K}.

As will be evident below, we are particularly interested in the bottom left entry of the deviation matrix and that of its square,

We note that related results were found for a discrete time version of the queue in Koole (1998) and in Koole and Spieksma (2001).

When the queue length process {Q(t)} is stationary, the Markovian Point Process {D(t)} is a (time) stationary point process (see Asmussen, 2003). In this case, the asymptotic variance rate,

                         above is based on (9) and (10) respectively, or alternatively on their deviation matrix based forms, (11) and (12). On route to calculating additional performance measures for the M/M/1/K queue, we first derive some further results for Markovian Point Processes, which to the best of our knowledge have not appeared elsewhere. These results are of independent interest.

Consider an arbitrary Markovian Point Process with an n × n irreducible generator matrix Λ = Λ
                        0 + Λ
                        1, where Λ
                        1 is the event intensity matrix and Λ
                        0 is assumed to be non-singular. Such a process corresponds to a two-dimensional Markov chain {(N(t), φ(t)), t ≥ 0}, where N(t) denotes the number of events in the interval [0, t] and φ(t) denotes the phase at time t, taking values in {1, …, n}. We assume that N(0) = 0 almost surely and denote by 
                           θ
                         the distribution of φ(0). Further, we denote by 
                           π
                         the stationary distribution corresponding to Λ, or equivalently to the phase process {φ(t)}.

If 
                           θ
                         = 
                           π
                         then N(t) is a time-stationary point process. This implies that for any sequence of intervals (t
                        1, s
                        1), …, (t

Another interesting initial distribution is

                           π

                        1/(
                           π
                        
                        Λ
                        1
                        1). This is the invariant distribution of a discrete time jump chain, {Yk
                        } where Yk
                         is the value of φ(t) just after the kth arrival. The probability transition matrix of this Markov chain is 
                           
                              −
                              
                                 Λ

                        . As shown in Asmussen (2003, chap. XI, Proposition 1.4), setting 
                           θ
                         = 
                           α
                         makes {N(t)} an event-stationary point process. That is, if Tk
                         denotes the time interval between the (k − 1)st and the kth event in the Markovian Point Process, then the joint distribution of (Tk, T
                        
                           k + 1, …, T
                        
                           k + ℓ) is the same as the joint distribution of 
                           
                              (

Since 
                           θ
                         affects the point process in such a manner, it is natural to ask what is its effect on v(t) and related quantities. We now have the following:

                                 2 = [0, 1, 0] which have the same variance equal to zero; however it is easy to find an example of a Markovian Point Process for which the value of

In Fig. 3
                        , we consider the behavior of the intercept term

                         in the event-stationary case, that is, when 
                           θ
                         = 
                           α
                        . The four graphs show the correction term 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    b
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 θ

                         as a function of ρ (or, more precisely, as a function of λ for a fixed value of μ) for increasing values of K. We see that the curves have an interesting shape with two local minima centered around ρ = 1. As K increases, the dips become narrow and deep; the correction term converges to zero everywhere, except at ρ = 1 where further computation has shown that it decreases approximately linearly. As a consequence, the effect of event-stationarity on the intercept term becomes indistinguishable from the effect of time-stationarity as K → ∞ for all values of ρ except in the balanced case.

Making use of Proposition 4 and the particular structure of the vector

                         and the matrix Λ
                        1, in the stationary case, we can express the asymptotic covariance between the number of departures and the queue size explicitly.

In Fig. 4
                        , we illustrate the asymptotic covariance between D(t) and Q(t) in the stationary case, as a function of ρ and for increasing values of K. We see that the asymptotic covariance curves exhibit a similar behavior to (the negative of) those of the intercept term in the stationary case (see Fig. 1), but in the present case the curves are more skewed with respect to ρ = 1.

We now consider the departure process of the M/G/1 queue. In this case, the departure process {D(t)} is generally not a Markovian Point Process, and the analysis is more complicated. Nevertheless we are able to obtain some partial results about the linear asymptote of v(t). Our approach is to first assume the existence of a linear asymptote and then to find an elegant formula for the intercept term under this assumption, generalizing the expression for the M/M/1 queue in (4) for the stable case. Further we conjecture that our assumption holds when the third moment of the service time is finite.

                        We simulated 106 realizations of the queueing process, recording and estimating the variance of D(t) over the grid t = 0, 5, 10, …, 800. Prior to time t = 0 we simulated each realization for 3 × 104 units so as to begin in approximate steady-state. The simulation is coded in C to allow for efficient computation. During the simulation run, roughly 26 × 109 jobs were processed in the simulated M/G/1 queue.

                     2 and γ. As is attested by the figure and by further extensive numerical experiments, we believe that such a term exists for all M/G/1 queues with ρ ≠ 1 in which the service time distribution has a finite third moment, yet we have not been able to prove this.

                        For λ ≠ μ, consider an M/G/1 queue operating under any work-conserving non-pre-emptive policy, in which the service time distribution has a finite third moment. Assume furthermore that the variance of the queue length at time 0 is finite. Then there exists a finite

                      in Conjecture 1, consider first the case where λ > μ. In this case, after some time τ which is almost surely finite, the server never stops operating and thus for t > τ, {D(t)} is effectively a renewal process with asymptotic variance rate μc
                     2 (see Eq. (1)). To the best of our knowledge, this intuitive argument cannot easily be made rigorous.

For the case λ < μ, consider the relation D(t) = A(t) + Q(0) − Q(t), where D(t) is the number of service completions during [0, t], {A(t)} is the Poisson arrival process, counting arrivals during [0, t], and Q(t) is the number of customers in the system at time t. Taking the variance of both sides of the last equation, observing that A(t) is independent of Q(0), dividing by t, and letting t → ∞, we get

Now the first limit on the right hand side equals λ, the second limit vanishes by assumption, the third limit should vanish since the stationary variance is finite (due to a finite third moment – see Eq. (25)), the fourth limit should vanish since in fact Cov(Q(0), Q(t)) vanishes (this is not trivial to establish in general, yet was communicated to us for the FCFS case through personal communication with Brian Fralix), and finally, for the fifth limit observe that

                                 4 − 1)/2. This gives some insight into the form of the variance curve of heavy traffic systems, showing how the squared coefficient of variation of G plays a role when ρ ≈ 1: When c
                                 2 > 1 the intercept term is positive, and when c
                                 2 < 1 the intercept term is negative. Further, as typical for heavy traffic systems, only the first two moments of the service time play a role. The skewness coefficient γ does not matter when ρ ≈ 1.

In the M/M/1 queue case, v*(s) in (18) is equal to λ/s, which corresponds to the variance curve v(t) = λt. This is expected since, for the stationary M/M/1 queue, {D(t)} is a Poisson process.

                        Restated in terms of LSTs using (18), the conjecture is that a b*(s) of the form (19), where G*(s) is the LST of a probability distribution, can be equal to zero only if G*(s) = 1/(1 + sg

                        1 > 0. Proving Daley’s conjecture would strengthen a result by Finch (1959), stating that all stationary M/G/1 queues with an Poisson output process are M/M/1 queues.

                        e only depends on the first three moments of G and it is known that the exponential distribution is not characterized (within the class of non-negative distributions) by the first three moments.

                        Elementary calculation yields − G*′(0) = 1, G*′′(0) = 2, − G*′′′(0) = 6, as is the case for a unit mean exponential distribution, and thus L
                        e = 0. However, via numerical evaluation of b*(s) for the case where λ = 3/4 and μ = 1, we verified that b*(s) ≠ 0 and thus v(t) ≠ λt, but rather, v(t) = λt + o(1), where the o(1) term is not identically 0. Note that in this case, Γ(s) was found by iterating (21) for fixed s over a fine grid of s. Thus we conclude that the necessary condition (23) is not sufficient. Daley’s conjecture remains open.

We are now able to use the steady state intercept term to obtain the intercept term for a system with an arbitrary distribution of the initial state.

We use a coupling argument. Consider the following two systems 0 and θ under the same sample path of the arrival process and service times. System 0 starts empty and system θ starts with Q(0) customers in the system. Operate system θ by giving low priority to the initial Q(0) customers, that is, these customers are served only when there are no other customers in system and pre-empted if an arrival occurs during their service time. This implies that the first Q(0) customers of System θ are being served only at times that coincide with idle periods of System 0. After a finite time T, the trajectories of the queue lengths of the two systems coincide. Thus for t ≥ T, Dθ

                                 2 plays a similar role with respect to the sign of the intercept term as it did in the stationary case: In this case when c
                                 2 > 3 the intercept term is positive, and when c
                                 2 ≤ 3 the intercept term is negative. Compare with the remarks following Proposition 6.

In going through the detailed Markovian Point Process derivations for M/M/1/K queues, we have illustrated how asymptotic quantities such as 
                        
                           b
                           ¯
                        
                      may be obtained explicitly. The key is to have explicit expressions for mean hitting times in the underlying Markov chain. By using the deviation matrix we have gained some further insight into the BRAVO effect. In plotting the graphs of 
                        
                           
                              d
                              ¯
                           
                           v
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 d
                                 ¯
                              
                              b
                           
                           ,
                        
                      we observe that spikes occur when λ ≈ μ in a similar fashion to the BRAVO effect.

For the M/G/1 queue, the formal calculations are of a different flavor, but are also generally tedious. Nevertheless, in stating our results, we have had to resort to Assumption 1. We believe that this assumption holds whenever G has a finite third moment (as specified by Conjecture 1). Toward this end, it is worthwhile to refer the reader to Fralix (2012) and Fralix and Riaño (2010), where similar transient analysis of the M/G/1 queue is undertaken; see also Pakes (1971) for classic results in the stationary case.

Besides the “transient moment problems” associated with Assumption 1, our work has highlighted other open questions about M/G/1 queues: (i) Daley’s conjecture discussed in detail in Section 3.2 above, remains open. (ii) We have not been able to find

                              ¯
                           
                           θ
                        
                      when ρ > 1. (iii) In the case ρ = 1 we conjecture that the variance curve can be written in the form
