                  In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) has emerged as a potential alternative to traditional data compression techniques for resource-constrained telemonitoring applications. In the present work, a CS framework of data reduction is proposed for multi-channel electrocardiogram (MECG) signals in eigenspace. The sparsity of dimension-reduced eigenspace MECG signals is exploited to apply CS. First, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied over the MECG data to retain diagnostically important ECG features in a few principal eigenspace signals based on maximum variance. Then, the significant eigenspace signals are randomly projected over a sparse binary sensing matrix to obtain the reduced dimension compressive measurement vectors. The compressed measurements are quantized using a uniform quantizer and encoded by a lossless Huffman encoder. The signal recovery is carried out by an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on the MECG signals from PTB and CSE multilead measurement library databases. The average value of percentage root mean square difference (PRD) across the PTB database is found to be 5.24% at a compression ratio

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The process of depolarization and re-polarization of the atria and the ventricles leads to the generation of P-wave, QRS-complex, ST-segment and T-wave of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. These ECG components carry important diagnostic information about various cardiac activities and make ECG an important non-invasive diagnostic tool for heart abnormalities. The ECG data acquisition using standardized system of 12-channels is marked as Lead-I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and it is termed as multilead or multi-channel ECG (MECG). The MECG signals play an essential role in the detailed diagnosis of cardiac diseases [1]. The MECG signal acquisition in continuous telemonitoring applications generates large amounts of data. Since these are resource-constrained applications with limited power and bandwidth, wireless transmission of such a large amount of data to healthcare centers is very expensive. This necessitates efficient data reduction before transmission. Due to its simple and power-efficient data reduction ability, compressed sensing (CS) [2] has emerged as a potential alternative to traditional wavelet-based compression techniques [3–5], which suffer from high encoding costs [6]. CS enables the recovery of sparse signals from a small number of linear projections (called measurements). CS has found wide applications in many engineering fields like image and video processing [7], communication [8], etc. For biomedical signals, CS has been applied in a data compression framework for wireless tele-monitoring applications [6,9–14]. A detailed review on heart monitoring can be found in [15].

Earlier CS-based works have exploited the sparse behavior of ECG signals either in the time-domain or in transform domain with wavelets as the sparsifying bases [6,9,11,12,16]. Mamaghanian et al. [6] have proposed a CS-based data compression of ECG signals for wireless body sensor networks (WBSN). Zhang et al. [9] proposed a monitoring system for fetal-ECG signals employing a block sparse Bayesian learning approach. Recently, prior knowledge-based CS recovery algorithms have been reported for ECG signals [11,12]. However, all the above works are limited to single-channel ECG signals. This has motivated us to investigate the CS framework for MECG signals. The MECGs are preferred over single-channel ECG by cardiologists due to their detailed clinical information contents [1]. There exists shared information across different channels in MECG signals [17,18]. The source of this common information is the electrical heart vector whose projections in different directions lead to ECG signals in different channels. To exploit this, a joint sparsity-based CS approach in wavelet domain is proposed in [18]. Another similar approach is reported in [19], which exploits the joint sparsity among the highly correlated heart-beats of single-channel ECG signals to achieve data compression. But, joint sparsity-based approaches do not deliver favorable results and end up with high output distortions and low compression efficiency. This is because, each lead conveys some unique information about the heart and hence, ECG signals from all the channels cannot be accurately represented using the same set of wavelet bases.

Principal component analysis (PCA) has been previously used as a dimensionality reduction tool to achieve MECG data compression [20]. It has also been employed to synthesize 12-channel MECG system using reduced 3-lead system for remote health monitoring applications [21–23]. The data-adaptive transformation feature of PCA makes it a good sparsifying basis for CS-based applications [8,24]. It was used jointly with CS for distributed signals to learn optimal transformation through online estimation of the signal statistics [8]. For synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals, it has been used as a sparsifying transform to compressively measure the SAR raw data [24]. Joint PCA-CS feasibility in above applications motivated us to explore PCA in the CS framework for MECG signals. It helps capture the diagnostic information spread across 12-channels to few eigenspace signals (reduced leads) by exploiting the inter-channel correlation structure of the MECG signals. The retained PCA transformed eigenspace MECG signals can be compressively measured using CS exploiting their sparsity either in eigenspace itself or in any other transform domain. So, processing the ECG signals from different channels jointly through PCA helps exploit the spatial correlation across the channels and removes the redundant information while producing sparse eigenspace signals. This feature is generally ignored in other CS-based works that deal with each channel individually [6,11,12,19]. Power-efficient data reduction framework of CS is then applied over eigenspace signals to obtain improved joint compression of the MECG data. However, this framework requires covariance matrix of the data during the reconstruction. Noting the small size of covariance matrix (8×8, if 8 independent MECG channels are considered), it can be sent as the side information along with the data with a little effect on the resource cost of the system. After PCA transformation, the transformed eigenspace MECG signals retain a morphological similarity with the time-domain ECG signals (refer to Fig. 1
                     ), and thus, still contain intra-signal correlated structure. This correlation can be further exploited in addition to the inter-channel correlation by choosing a suitable sparsifying basis during CS reconstruction in the proposed eigenspace CS approach. It can sparsify eigenspace signals and the required number of compressed measurements can thus be further reduced. Reduced number of measurements directly translates into higher compression efficiency of the system without sacrificing the clinical quality of the reconstructed ECG signals. Different transforms, such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), and discrete Fourier transform (DFT), have been studied as the sparsifying bases for eigenspace signals, and CS performance is analyzed in each domain. CS reconstruction is performed by a greedy sparse recovery algorithm called orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [25]. Eigenspace as a sparsifying domain for compressive sensing of MECG signals has been investigated in some of our earlier works [26,27]. In [26], we have explored the retrievability of eigenspace MECG signals in the CS framework, while a multi-scale CS approach is studied in [27].

Following are the contributions of the present work:
                        
                           •
                           The data compression efficiency of the proposed joint PCA-CS approach is quantified with an additional entropy encoding module. Performance evaluations on different databases with a variety of ECG morphologies are carried out. Denoising ability of the algorithm is also analyzed.

The present work also investigates some practical issues in implementing the joint PCA-CS for MECG signals. This includes study of required feature length for learning optimal PCA transformation matrix and the corresponding reconstruction error variation. Also to be included in this work is the study regarding the frequency at which the transformation matrix needs to be updated in signal specific applications.

In addition to the PCA domain recovery, the current paper also investigates the CS recovery of eigenspace signals in other sparsifying domains, such as DWT, DCT, and DFT.

The diagnostic quality of the reconstructed MECG signals is validated using both diagnostic distortion measures [28,29] and the subjective quality measure (mean opinion score (MOS) rating [30]).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the proposed method is discussed in Section 2. Experimental results and discussions are presented in Section 3, followed by conclusions in Section 4.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

In this work, ECG signals from only eight independent channels have been considered in order to reduce the computational burden at the encoder. This includes six pre-cordial leads (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) and two limb leads (Leads I, II). The dependent leads (aVR, aVL aVF and II) can be derived at the decoder using the limb leads. The proposed method is suggested as follows. First, the algorithm extracts the principal components after eigenvalue decomposition of the MECG signals. Principal components are selected based on a suitable threshold to avoid loss of vital clinical information across the channels. Then by randomly projecting these sparse eigenspace signals using random sparse binary sensing matrix, compressed measurements are obtained that can be further quantized and encoded to get the compressed bit streams. The block diagram of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 2
                     . Details of each block are discussed in subsequent subsections.

Eigenspace transformation of ECG data is done using the principal components obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of the MECG data matrix. If the data matrix

                        . The eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are the principal components (PCs). They capture the directions of maximum variance present in the signals. The PC selection is done on the basis of energy captured by the eigenvalues which corresponds to the clinical information in ECG signals [31].

The threshold limit of 99.5% of total energy is heuristically chosen by a simulation-based analysis on a number of datasets from the PTB and CSE databases. The cumulative sum of energy variation of PCs is shown in Fig. 3
                         for a few datasets. It is observed that the selection of the number of PCs that captures 99.5% of the total energy, or more ensures retention of the vital clinical components of MECG in the reconstruction. The transformation matrix

                         are sparsely localized. This suggests that the compressed measurements can be directly taken over 
                           Z
                        . Furthermore, retained eigenspace signals 
                           Z
                         can be represented in a more sparse form using a suitable sparsifying transform as it still contains inter- and intra-beat redundancies analogous to time-domain ECG heart-beats (refer to Fig. 1). A sparser representation helps reduce the number of compressed measurements further without sacrificing the reconstruction quality.

Compressed sensing theory establishes that any signal 
                           x
                         sparse in a basis 
                           Ψ
                         can be exactly reconstructed from a few linear and incoherent random projections (measurements) of the signal onto another incoherent basis 
                           Φ
                        , called sensing matrix. The sensing paradigm can be stated as 
                           
                              y

                           y
                        , 
                           α
                         are the compressed measurement vector and sparse coefficient vector, respectively. In the proposed technique, if the eigenspace itself is taken as the sparsifying basis then 
                           
                              Ψ
                              =
                              I
                           
                         (unity matrix), and in case any other basis is chosen for further sparsification of eigenspace signals, 
                           Ψ
                         is chosen accordingly. Compressed measurements for all the eigenspace signals can be taken as

After linear measurement of the sparse ECG signal vectors, the compressed measurement vectors in 
                           Y
                         are quantized and further encoded in a lossless manner to produce the compressed signal that is to be stored or transmitted. A uniform quantizer is used for the quantization purpose. Any lossless encoding technique can be used for the encoding of the quantized coefficients. Huffman coding provides optimal codes without any loss of the data and hence, has been used here for the encoding purpose.

                         corresponding to p retained PCs are recovered using a sparse recovery algorithm which are then projected over the PCA transformation matrix P to get back the L channel MECG signals. It is to be noted that the covariance matrix/eigenspace transformation matrix

                         and the mean of the MECG data are required at the decoder. They need to be sent as the side information along with the compressed data. However, sending

                        where ε is the noise tolerance. This method gives a robust signal recovery with lesser error bound, provided the signal is sufficiently sparse in some transform domain 
                           Ψ
                        . This approach is also referred to as basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). Beyond the convex optimization solutions, there are other sparse recovery algorithms like greedy algorithms. Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [25] is one such algorithm. In the greedy algorithms, the columns of measurement matrix 
                           Θ
                         that have got the maximum correlation with the measurement vector are selected iteratively in a greedy fashion. This contribution of 
                           Θ
                         is then subtracted from 
                           Y
                         and the steps are further iterated on the residue. OMP is relatively faster with a low computational complexity and produces a better signal-to-noise ratio as compared to ℓ1 minimization, has therefore been used in this work. The sparse recovery directly gives eigenspace MECG signals

The performance evaluation of the proposed method is carried out using the publicly available PTB database [32,33] and commercially available CSE database [34]. The PTB database contains various diagnostic MECG datasets from 290 patients sampled at 1kHz and 16-bit resolution. The CSE database contains 125 data records of various cardiac arrhythmias with 500Hz sampling frequency and 10-bit resolution. Each data record of both databases contain 15-channels of ECG signals including 3 frank leads. Out of these, L=8 independent channels have been processed in this work and the remaining 4 derived channels have been synthesized later. Experiments are conducted batch-wise in the form of a data matrix

                      contains only d=35 [18] non-zero values equal to 1 at random positions. Results are averaged over 50 iterations with different realization of random matrix

The overall performance evaluation of the proposed method is carried out using the widely used state-of-the-art distortion measures. These measures are mainly used for evaluating the reconstruction fidelity in compression-based works, and includes compression ratio (CR), percentage root mean square difference (PRD) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) [18]. These are called global error measures. Diagnostic distortion measures such as wavelet energy-based diagnostic distortion (WEDD) [28] and wavelet weighted PRD (WWPRD) [29] are also used to assess clinical fidelity. CR is defined as:

Experiments are conducted to investigate the PCA transformation as a sparsifying domain for MECG signals in order to realize joint PCA-CS. The MECG signals transformed in PCA domain are shown in Fig. 1. From the plot it is clear that the first four eigenspace signals that capture most of the diagnostically relevant features (with

                        ) are sufficient to represent 12-channel's information. Measurements obtained after random projection are further quantized and entropy-encoded to obtain the compressed bit-streams. The performance of the proposed method can be further enhanced by finding a suitable transform that can represent eigenspace signals in a sparser form. Eigenspace MECG signals have relatively low sparsity in eigenspace itself (54.31%), which costs higher reconstruction error (
                           
                              APRD

                              =
                              5.96
                           
                        ). However, CS reconstruction is known to improve substantially in sparser domains [2]. Better sparse representation can be achieved for eigenspace MECG signals due to their redundant structure, analogous to the quasi periodical structure of time-domain MECG (Fig. 1). To exploit this sparsity, it is necessary to perform the CS reconstruction for eigenspace MECG signals in some other suitable transform/sparsifying domain. Transformations such as DWT, DCT, and DFT are experimented by changing the sparsifying basis 
                           Ψ
                         to the respective transformation matrix in the OMP recovery algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm in all the above three domains in terms of different metrics for same datasets is given in Table 1
                        . The DWT as the sparsifying basis outperforms DFT and DCT. It produces best sparse approximation for eigenspace signals, which is verified by the minimum overall recovery distortions (at approximately the same CR value). The sparsity is enhanced significantly (up to 80%) in the wavelet domain compared to sparsity in eigenspace (54.31%) itself. On the other hand, DCT and DFT have sinusoids as their basis functions that may not be suitable for better representation of eigenspace MECG signals, leading to their poor performance. From the above experiments, it can be concluded that the proposed framework of compressed sensing for eigenspace MECG signals results in better signal reconstruction in wavelet domain. Therefore, the CS recovery is performed exploiting the wavelet domain sparsity of eigenspace signals.

To study the variation of compression efficiency of the proposed encoder at different distortion levels, plots between CR and average PRD is shown in Fig. 4
                        (a) for the ECG signals associated with different pathological conditions. Here, average distortion values are calculated as the mean value per channel of a particular disease dataset. PRD values less than 9% and WEDD values less than 11.12% correspond to good quality signal reconstruction [30,6,28]. It is denoted by level ‘G’ in Fig. 4(a). It is evident that most of the signals fall in this category. Best performance is achieved for dataset s0443_rem having highest CR=25.15 at APRD=8.9. This dataset produces least distortion in terms of WEDD and SNR too. Variation of WEDD and SNR with CR is shown in Fig. 4(b) for dataset s0443_rem. Across all the MECG datasets from PTB database, lead V3 is found to have the least average value of 
                           
                              PRD
                              =
                              5.24
                              %
                           
                         at CR=17.76.

The variance of distortion i.e., APRD across individual datasets is shown in Fig. 5
                         in the form of box plot at different number of compressed measurements (M). The edges of the box plots denote the 25th and 75th percentiles with the central line as median. Extreme values in the individual box plot depict the minimum and maximum APRD values obtained at a particular value of M for different datasets. Low value of distortion is achieved at a higher number of measurements as the median value decreases with M, but at the cost of CR, which holds inverse relation with M. Average distortion per channel saturates at around M=1000 and APRD does not depreciate much after that, as can be seen in last two box plots. This situation occurs because in the presence of a sufficient number of measurements, additional measurements do not add any extra information, and reconstruction accuracy remains almost the same.

Apart from the above case studies, average performance results are also calculated across the two databases considered in this work, i.e., PTB and CSE. Reconstruction is performed at average CR=13.91 and 10.39 and quantitative values of corresponding distortion metrics are given in Table 2
                        . In an average sense too, the values of non-diagnostic distortion measures (PRD, SNR) as well as diagnostic distortion measures (WEDD, WWPRD) either fall in very good or good categories of reconstruction in all the channels. For CSE database, the error is relatively higher as compared to PTB. As a result, relatively low CR value is achieved for CSE database than that achieved for PTB at a given distortion level. This may be because the low sampling frequency (500Hz) of the CSE database as compared to PTB database (1kHz) makes the MECG signals in CSE database less compressible than signals in PTB database.

To analyze the data compression achieved in different stages of the proposed method, the compression achieved by different steps involved in the proposed encoding technique is calculated. Quantified values of CR at each step, i.e., PCA, CS, and entropy encoding, are given in Table 3
                         for 10 different datasets, 5 each from PTB and CSE databases. For total average

                         at APRD=9.46. So, both PCA and CS operations contribute almost equally in the compression efficiency of the proposed joint PCA-CS technique. Entropy encoding step enhances the CR further that is achieved by PCA and CS operations.

It is to be noted that the eigenspace MECG signals (Fig. 1) have varying information contents (decreasing from top to bottom), and hence, varying sparsity. Highly sparse and low-information signals can be acquired in very few CS measurements and hence could undergo through intensive compression. This flexibility in selecting the number of measurements can be used to control the data rates in telemedicine applications. Data rates can be increased or decreased according to the extent of accuracy required at the healthcare centers.

In a lossy compression technique, the loss of information is inevitable. Clinical feature assessment, therefore becomes important in order establish the compression efficiency of an encoding technique. The diagnostic quality of the reconstructed MECG signals is tested for several normal, pathological and noisy MECG signals. Open source OSET toolbox [35] is used to identify the QRS complex, an important ECG feature, in all the recovered signals to ensure the feature preservation.

In this section, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on clean MECG signals which belong to normal as well as pathological classes. Healthy control or normal ECG signals posses normal ECG rhythms (Fig. 6
                           ) and their diagnostic information lies only in PQRST morphology. Fig. 6 shows a Lead I plot from the dataset s0465_rem with its original and reconstructed signals; along with identified QRS complexes. The reconstruction is achieved from its compressed form at CR=13.18. The quality of the reconstruction clearly shows the retention of the important clinical features of a normal ECG with a little distortion in P wave and a slight loss in amplitude of QRS complex (shown by arrows in the reconstructed signal). In case of a pathology, the heart rhythms get altered and clinical information of the ECG signals may lie anywhere in the signal unlike the normal sinus rhythms. This reduces the sparsity of the signal both in the time-domain as well as in transformed domain. A pathological ECG signal exhibiting antero-septal myocardial infarction is shown in Fig. 7
                           (a). It is taken from Lead I of dataset s0410lrem from PTB database. Here, the diagnostic features are spanned across near the entire signal, temporally as well as spatially with no isoelectric line present. For these types of signals too, a satisfactory reconstruction with good clinical fidelity is obtained with a relatively low CR (=12.74 at 8-bit quantization). Fig. 7(b) shows a different pathological case taken from Lead III of dataset s0007rem with highly irregular heart-beats. When reconstructed at CR=13.1, it shows a good quality recovery with a slight loss in the amplitude that occur for a couple of notches present in the QRS complex (shown by arrows). In all the above CS reconstruction, sparsity constraint is taken as 
                              
                                 K

                            in the OMP algorithm.

The signal reconstruction ability of the proposed method is also assessed for cases of noisy MECG signals. As noise remains present in nearly all practical applications, this case study becomes important. Two types of noisy signals are analyzed in this experiment: ECG signals with naturally present noise, and ECG signals with artificially-added noise. Fig. 8
                         depicts both these reconstructions. A noisy dataset M01_014 from CSE database with mostly powerline noise, a very common noise present in the ECG during its acquisition, is compressed by the proposed encoder. Reconstruction is performed at CR=7.76 and waveforms are shown in Fig. 8(a). In the other experiment, clean pathological data-set s0154t_rem exhibiting palpitation has been corrupted by artificially adding 10dB additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Recovered signal at CR=9.1 and average PRD (APRD)=10.6 is shown in Fig. 8(b). As evident from the recovered signals in both the cases, important clinical features of ECG are almost preserved and noise level is significantly reduced. Nominal alterations are noted in the reconstructed waveforms (indicated by arrows). This experiment also establishes the denoising ability of the proposed algorithm in addition to good signal retrievability at high CR values. The denoising feature of the algorithm is attributed partly to the rejection of insignificant PCs, which are mainly noise-dominated [31] and partly to controlled selection of columns of 
                           Φ
                         (also called atoms or bases) during CS reconstruction. The number of atoms selection (sparsity constraint) is reduced to 
                           
                              K
                              _
                              target
                              =
                              35
                           
                         in the sparse reconstruction OMP algorithm so as to select only highly correlated atoms, leaving behind uncorrelated noisy atoms.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is applicable for all variants of MECG signals having different morphologies. The compression efficiency may vary with different signals, but diagnostic features are maintained in each case. This makes the reconstructed signals usable for clinical diagnosis. To quantify the visual quality of reconstructed MECG signals, we employed a subjective quality measure called mean opinion score (MOS). It is a qualitative-based distortion measure [20,30] that measures visual distortions in the recovered signal. Different evaluators who participated in this subjective study include two doctors, and ten research scholars and project engineers working in the area of biomedical signal processing. Different ECG diagnostic features such as P-wave, PR-segment, PR-interval, QRS-complex, ST-segment and T-wave are evaluated in a semi-blind test where the evaluators are provided with the originals and reconstructed versions of the ECG signal and are asked to find the similarities between them. The quality rating used for this evaluation is as follows: 1 (bad), 2 (almost tolerable), 3 (tolerable), 4 (good), and 5 (excellent) [20,30]. The average MOS error in percentage for the ECG signals from the Lead I, Lead aVL, and Lead V5 for dataset M01_014 is given in Table 4
                        . According to MOS rating [30], all the diagnostically important features of ECG fall into the category of very good signal reconstruction. MOS error for overall ECG signal is also calculated and Lead V5 was found with least MOS error of 6.66%.

A detailed performance comparison of the proposed technique is done with the existing CS-based ECG data compression techniques and results are quantified in Table 5
                        . The channel-wise distortion incurred during the entire encoding and the reconstruction process is compared in terms of same distortion measures as used in the respective works. One of the recent CS-based work reported for ECG signals is based on multi-scale CS for efficient MECG data encoding [13]. When compared with this method in terms of PRD, SNR, and WEDD at almost same CR level (
                           
                              ≈
                              10.26
                              :
                              1
                           
                        ), the proposed technique displays significant improvement (Table 5). The improvement in the distortion levels is achieved due to the removal of redundant information across the channels using PCA before applying CS on the resultant eigenspace signals. Additionally, [13] does not exploit the inter-channel correlation. It encoded and decoded all channels individual corresponding to high frequency wavelet subband matrices resulting in a poor compression efficiency, or equivalently, higher distortions at a given CR level. Another work reported in [18] presents a power-efficient data reduction technique based on joint CS (JCS) for MECG signals exploiting the idea of joint sparsity. On comparison of the proposed method with the JCS method, substantial gain in the compression performance is achieved with less output distortions. At 
                           
                              CR

                              1
                           
                        , approximately the same as reported in [18], significant gain in the reported reconstruction SNR is obtained in each channel's ECG signal. Each channel conveys some unique information about the heart and hence ECG signals from all channels cannot be accurately represented using the same set of wavelet bases as performed in [18]. A joint sparsity-based single-channel ECG compression work is presented in [19]. This is implemented here for MECG signals for comparison purpose with the help of the source code provided by the authors. We have used the same distributed CS (DCS) approach with simultaneous OMP technique as in [19]. However, the concept of DCS did not work well for MECG since it gives high PRD and WEDD values.

The present work is also compared with another multi-scale PCA (MSPCA)-based MECG compression technique proposed by Sharma et al. [20]. Significantly reduced distortions are achieved for all channels at same reported CR=5.98 for the same dataset. The improved performance gain was expected due to the exploitation of sparsity of eigenspace MECG signals using CS framework in the proposed work that, on the contrary, remained unexploited in [20]. CS framework of single-channel ECG compression works reported in earlier studies [6,12] show low compression efficiencies. Individual channel processing in these works does not allow us to exploit the inherent inter-channel correlation that exists among different channels. This leads to low CR, or high distortion at a particular CR as compared to the proposed work as shown in Table 5.

This section discusses the proposed method in the context of some of the practical issues. The sensing matrix responsible for data reduction in CS operation is taken to be a random sparse binary matrix having binary entries, i.e., 0s and 1s only. This replaces the multiplication operation with a simple addition operation reducing the computation burden at the encoder [46].

In order to analyze the computational cost of the proposed method, the average execution time (CPU time) required in each stage of the algorithm is calculated. The simulation is done on MATLAB R2010a using 3.20GHz Intel Core i5 system with 8GB RAM. Average time elapsed in each of the encoder and decoder module for one MECG data packet

                         is given in Table 6
                         for different numbers of measurements (M). It can be observed that PCA module adds only a marginal delay in encoding and decoding process while most of the CPU time is consumed by the CS module. CS decoding being a computationally intensive task takes the highest CPU time (0.3525s) for M=400. CS encoding that involves a simple matrix multiplication operation takes the least time (0.0035s). Encoding and decoding time increases when more number of measurements are used for CS recovery. This experiment helped us to infer that the use of PCA with traditional CS-based compression techniques can boost up the compression efficiency with little increase in the computational cost of the system.

For PCA implementation, certain statistical features of the data (mean and covariance) are required and hence they need to be estimated at the run time. To realize joint PCA-CS practically, a training and monitoring-based approach is usually adopted [8,24]. Here too, the joint PCA-CS framework is implemented in two phases: training and monitoring. Statistical features are calculated in the training phase to find mean 
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                         and transformation matrix 
                           P
                        , which are further used in the monitoring phase for compressive measurement. To find the optimum number of training samples for computation of signal statistics, the output reconstruction error in terms of PRD is simulated at a fixed number of CS measurements. Fig. 9
                        (a) shows the error variation with respect to varying number of training samples. It can be observed that the error trend decreases with an increase in number of samples. Hence, sufficient numbers of training samples should be included to compute signal statistics. Also, the error fluctuation minimizes and almost settles to a minimum at higher number of training samples.

Unlike other non-stationary signals, the training module may not be required to update quite frequently for ECG signals, thus minimizing the number of computations at the encoder. ECG signals, though considered non-stationary [17], are slowly varying in nature. Because of this, the statistical features of MECG do not change significantly over time for patient-specific applications, until a sudden arrhythmia is reported. Therefore, PCA transformation matrix 
                           P
                        , once calculated with sufficient number of training samples, may be used for subsequent incoming data blocks. Training module may need not to be updated at each instance of the data acquisition. A simulation study is conducted to support this statement. Simulation results for dataset s0443_rem are depicted in Fig. 9(b). Five successive data blocks of the dataset are reconstructed after joint PCS-CS operation with the same eigenspace transformation matrix 
                           P
                         for each block. It may be noted that the output reconstruction error in terms of PRD slightly fluctuates, but remains approximately the same for a number of incoming blocks. Significant change is only noticed after four to five blocks. Thus, in a scenario involving tolerable error, this observation remains valid. Matrix 
                           P
                         can be recalculated after some time to follow the statistical changes in the data, if any. This may help in lessening the computational burden at the encoder at a cost of marginal error. Hence, despite the computational cost incurred in the training phase, PCA can be successfully employed with CS to produce substantial improvement in terms of compression efficiency as compared to the existing CS-based MECG data compression techniques (Table 5).

To calculate the computational cost of the proposed method, the algorithmic complexity of PCA and CS needs to be calculated. The PCA operation consists of two steps: covariance matrix calculation and eigenvalue decomposition. So, the computational complexity of PCA will depend on these two operations. For a data matrix

We have also compared the computational complexity of the proposed method with the existing CS-based methods. The performances of these methods were already compared with the proposed method in the previous section. Complexity is calculated in terms of order of signal length (N) and execution time, and it is shown in Table 7
                           . A recent CS-based technique with a DWT-based preprocessing is reported in [13]. This follows a multi-scale CS (MCS) approach for MECG signal encoding. This method has computational complexities of DWT and CS together. The complexity of DWT is 
                              
                                 O
                                 (
                                 N
                                 
                                 log
                                 
                                 N
                                 )
                              
                            
                           [37] and for CS it is O(dNL) [18]. So, the total complexity of the method is 
                              
                                 O
                                 (
                                 N
                                 
                                 log
                                 
                                 N
                                 +
                                 
                                    MN
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           . There are two traditional CS-based methods: joint CS (JCS) [18] and distributed CS (DCS) [19], which are used for MECG data compression. The encoding steps are same in both cases, while the decoding algorithms are different. Both the JCS and DCS have the same data encoding complexity, i.e., O(dNL). A CS framework for single-channel ECG data compression was employed in [6,12]. Both the above techniques have ability to perform individual channel CS processing. Therefore, for L ECG channels, their complexity level is 
                              
                                 L
                                 ×
                                 O
                                 (
                                 dN
                                 )
                              
                           . The comparison is also done with a multi-scale PCA (MSPCA)-based work [20], which uses PCA at each wavelet scale to exploit inter-channel correlation for MECG data compression. It possesses algorithmic complexity of DWT and PCA together, i.e., 
                              
                                 O

                                 N
                                 +
                                 
                                    
                                       NL
                                    
                                    
                                       2
                                    
                                 
                                 +

                                       3
                                    
                                 
                                 )
                              
                            as given in Table 7.

Therefore, by observing the algorithmic complexity of different methods in terms of signal length N and number of channels L, it can be concluded that, though the performance of the proposed method is superior to the existing methods (Table 5), this performance gain comes at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational complexity. However, this additional theoretical complexity of the proposed joint PCA-CS approach is not significant enough to be noticeable in practical applications. This is because practically, the signal length 
                              
                                 N
                                 (
                                 =
                                 3000
                                 )
                              
                            and number of channels 
                              
                                 L
                                 (
                                 =
                                 8
                                 )
                              
                            may not be large enough to significantly affect the computational cost of the system. To support this statement, we compared the average execution time required by each of the aforementioned algorithms for encoding and decoding of same MECG data block 
                              
                                 X
                                 ∈
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       3000
                                       ×
                                       8
                                    
                                 
                              
                            using the same computing platform (Table 7). It is observed that the proposed method requires a slightly higher time for data compression as compared to the traditional CS-based methods, JCS and DCS. However, it requires lesser time than MSPCA and almost equal time as MCS. On the other hand, if we include the quantization and entropy encoding time with data compression time, then the proposed method performs better than the rest of the techniques. Overall, the MECG data can be encoded nearly twice as fast by the proposed method (
                              
                                 0.5242
                                 
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                              
                           ) in comparison with the other techniques (Table 7). Similarly, the proposed method requires less than half-time (2.4113s) to decode the same data block as compared to the fastest MSPCA technique (5.6679s). The DCS (0.0274) and the proposed technique (0.2879s) use greedy algorithms for sparse recovery. The greedy algorithms are relatively faster than the convex optimization-based CS recovery algorithms employed in the rest of the CS-based techniques. Additionally, in the quantization and entropy encoding phase, all the techniques have to process data corresponding to all 8-channels, whereas the proposed method needs to process only principal eigenspace signals, which decreases the overall encoding and decoding time.

In this section, analysis of power consumption by the proposed method and other existing methods is carried out by following a power model reported in [38]. This model was employed in several earlier studies [39,40] for comparative power consumption analysis in remote monitoring applications with CS-based compression systems. It is shown that the total power in such systems can be given as the sum of three different types of powers:

To get an idea of power cost of the proposed system, we followed the steps suggested in [38–40], where authors referred hard values of different types of powers involved in (11) from different studies for approximate power calculation. A hardware-based study done in [41] reported that a CMOS amplifier with gain 67.7dB consumes

                            power consumption when data is transmitted in compressed form using the proposed compression algorithm. So, a power saving of 33.95% can be achieved by the proposed method as compared to the case when data is transmitted in raw form (without compression).

Following the same power model (10), power consumption is also calculated for other existing methods [13,18–20]. Taking the same value of CR as reported in the above works, power in different studies is given by:

From this study, it can be concluded that the proposed method (
                              
                                 442.07

                           ) saves significant amount of power (65.18%) as compared to the DWT-based preprocessing methods (
                              
                                 1269.5

                                 W
                              
                           ) [20]. However, it consumes a little higher (12.13%) amount of power as compared to the CS-based techniques (
                              
                                 388.45
                                 
                                 μ
                                 W
                              
                           ) [12]. If we see the overall power to compression ration (PCR) i.e. power required for unit compression, then the proposed method is found to have lower PCR (23.44) than the CS-based techniques (48.01 for WLM). This is due to higher compression efficiency of the proposed method as compared to the CS-based techniques (Table 5).

It must be noted that the authors in [38–40] have used the power calculation formula (11) for theoretical power calculations only. Different values of power incurred in different processes are taken from other studies, e.g., the value of J is taken for a particular processor family. Its value may change for some other processor. We have also used the model (11) only for the comparative study, keeping same parameters in all the cases.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, a joint PCA-CS approach was proposed for MECG signal compression. PCA over MECG signals facilitates the application of CS framework in eigenspace. PCA was used to decorrelate the mutually-correlated 12-channel ECG signals, and capture their clinical features in reduced-dimension eigenspace signals. Sparse eigenspace signals were then randomly projected on to a sparse binary sensing matrix to obtain the compressed measurements. Using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and inverse PCA, original data was successfully recovered while preserving the important clinical features. The algorithm was evaluated on a data compression platform for a variety of pathological, noisy and normal MECG datasets. Higher data compression performance was achieved for the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art CS-based techniques. Higher compression efficiency at reduced signal distortion makes the proposed technique useful for resource-constrained MECG telemonitoring applications.

We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.
