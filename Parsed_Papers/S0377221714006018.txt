                  In multi-criteria group decision making, a key issue is aggregating individual preference into group one. In this study, we employ a bilateral agreement to conduct group evaluation of alternatives. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. To express the relationship between the bilateral agreement and individual evaluations, the quasi-arithmetic mean is used, which can ensure the consistency property of the pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirements are explored to obtain the group preference, which shows that n
                     −1 pairs of bilateral agreements are necessary. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Multi-criteria group decision making has been applied in many areas, such as consumer purchasing selection, biotechnology management, evaluating weapon systems, assessing low carbon supply chains, etc. For example, a supply chain is composed of a lot of enterprises, each of which can be considered as a decision maker. A supply chain can be evaluated by several criteria, such as cost, quality, lead time and carbon emission. To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, enterprises should coordinate with each other, this process can be considered as a multi-criteria group decision making. A key problem in multi-criteria group decision making is how to aggregate the individual preference into the group one. Suitable aggregation operators should be selected in specific situations. For example, as a widely used technique to express the decision makers’ preference about alternatives or criteria (Dong, Hong, Xu, & Yu, 2013; Durbach, Lahdelma, & Salminen, 2014; Jalao, Wu, & Shunk, 2014; Liu, Zhang, & Zhang, 2014; Rezaei & Ortt, 2013; Zhü, 2014; Zhu & Xu, 2014), the pairwise comparison matrices have some properties, such as the reciprocity and the consistency. However, we should ensure that the pairwise comparison matrix after aggregation still retains the original property. Numerous researchers (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jiménez, & Salvador, 2010; Bernasconi, Choirat, & Seri, 2014; Dong, Zhang, Hong, & Xu, 2010; Liu, Zhang, & Wang, 2012; Xu, 2000) have investigated how to aggregate the pairwise comparison matrices. But they cannot provide a unified form and they always assume the weight vector is known for convenience. However, estimating the parameters of the aggregation functions is a key problem in decision making (Keeney & Kirkwood, 1975). Information on interpersonal comparisons is critical in solving this problem (González-Pachón & Romero, 2006; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976).

Generally, there exist no aggregation operators, which do not violate some reasonable assumptions, such as the Arrow’s impossibility theorem (Arrow, 1963; Heil & Kuntz, 2005; Sen, 1970). One way to overcome this situation is to allow interpersonal comparisons of utility (Heil & Kuntz, 2005; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). Baucells and Shapley (2008) employed bilateral agreements between pairs of individuals to derive group utility. The process can be considered as preference disaggregation, which is based on the philosophy of assessing or inferring global preference models in accordance with the given preferential structures, as well as addressing decision-aiding activities (Ahn, 2010; Angilella, Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2014; Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013; Grigoroudis & Siskos, 2002; Huang, Chang, Li, & Lin, 2013; Huang, Liao, & Lin, 2009; Jacquet-Lagréze & Siskos, 2001; Srinivasan & Shocker, 1973). Baucells and Sarin (2003) extended the method proposed by Baucells and Shapley (2008) to multi-criteria decision making. However, their methods are only suitable for the weighted arithmetic mean, which does not ensure the consistency of the pariwise comparison matrix. Except for the weighted arithmetic mean, large families of other means exist (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Bullen, 2003), including weighted quasi-arithmetic mean, Gini mean, Bonferroni mean, Heronian mean, Generalized logarithmic mean, mean of Bajraktarevic, etc. However not all of them are monotone functions (e.g., some Gini means); thus, not all of them can be used as aggregation functions (Beliakov et al., 2007; Bullen, 2003).

Following the preceding analysis, this paper focuses on aggregating pairwise comparison matrices based on bilateral agreements. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 investigates the relationship between consistency of pairwise comparison matrices and the aggregation functions, based on which we can find that the arithmetic mean is not always valid to keep the consistency property. Section 3 studies group decision making based on bilateral agreements, in which the quasi-arithmetic mean is employed. The advantage is that it can preserve the original property when we deal with group decision making based on pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirement is derived to obtain the group utility. Section 4 extends the method developed in Section 3 to deal with multi-criteria group decision making, in which the bilateral agreements could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. A bilateral agreement on one of the criteria is sufficient to derive the final group preference. Section 5 presents conclusions. The structure of this paper is illustrated in Fig. 1

Pairwise comparison matrices are popular and powerful techniques to model experts’ preferences in group decision making, and it mainly includes the reciprocal judgment matrix and the complementary judgment matrix, which can be defined as follows.

                     where f(t) is a continuous strictly monotone function. Especially, if f(t)=log t, then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (2); if f(t)=
                     t
                     −0.5, then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (1); if f(t)=log(t/(1−
                     t)), then Eq. (4) reduces to Eq. (3). Therefore, the consistency of pairwise comparison matrix can be unified in a general framework expressed by Eq. (4).

In group decision making, if each provided pairwise comparison matrix is consistent, then we expect the final group matrix to be consistent as well; the aggregation operator that ensures such property is what we look for. Numerous aggregation operators have been employed to aggregate the pairwise comparison matrices; the weighted arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are the two most common operators (Altuzarra et al., 2010; Bernasconi et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Xu, 2000). Since the quasi-arithmetic mean (Dujmović, 1974; Fishburn, 1970) generalizes the weighted arithmetic mean and the weighted geometric mean, we expect it to provide a unified aggregation form as follows.

                        Theorem 1
                        
                           A is consistent if and only if A

                     −0.5 or f(t)=

                     which is the uninorms introduced by Yager and Rybalov (1996), and studied by Fodor, Yager, and Rybalov (1997). It is an associative aggregation function that presents conjunctive behavior when dealing with low input values, has disjunctive behavior for high values and is averaging otherwise. It plays an interesting and important role not only in theoretical investigations but also in practical applications, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy system modeling, fuzzy logic, etc. (DeBaets & Fodor, 1999; Golan, 1992; Hájek, Havránek, & Jiroušek, 1992; Yager & Rybalov, 1996). It is suitable for aggregating the multiplicative consistent complementary judgment matrices.

                     which is the weighted geometric mean (Aczél & Saaty, 1983). The inputs of the weighted geometric mean are not added but multiplied. For example, when the rates of investment return are averaged over several years, the use of the arithmetic mean is incorrect. The reason is that the rate of return (say 0%) signifies that in one year the investment was multiplied by a factor 1. If the return is 300% in the next year, then the total is multiplied by 4, which means that the original investment is multiplied by a factor of 1×4. The average return is calculated by using the geometric mean of 1 and 4, which gives 2, but not the arithmetic mean of 1 and 4, that is 2.5. It can be used to aggregate the consistent reciprocal judgment matrices.

Based on the above analysis, we can find that the quasi-arithmetic mean not only can provide a unified technique for aggregating pairwise comparison matrices, but can also preserve the consistency property of the aggregated pairwise comparison matrix. Therefore, quasi-arithmetic mean can be considered as a suitable aggregation function in aggregating pairwise comparison matrices.

In the problem discussed in Section 2, the individual information and the relative weights between them are known, based on which we can obtain the group information easily by using the linear aggregation function or non-linear aggregation function according to the specific situations. However, determining the values of the parameters of the aggregation function is a key problem in decision making (Keeney & Kirkwood, 1975). Information about interpersonal comparisons is crucial to answering this question (González-Pachón & Romero, 2006; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976). Baucells and Sarin (2003) assumed that individuals are willing to perform interpersonal comparisons, and bilateral agreements between pairs of individuals are sufficient to derive the parameters of the aggregate utility function. However, they used the weighted arithmetic mean to aggregate the individual preference, which does not ensure the consistency of the aggregated pairwise comparison matrix, as discussed in Section 2.

In this section, we use quasi-arithmetic means to discuss how to derive group utility when every decision maker provides his/her individual utility, and some pairs of individuals may provide their joint utilities (or their bilateral agreements). It should be noted that a complete preference for a pair is called a bilateral agreement (Baucells & Sarin, 2003; Baucells & Shapley, 2008). For example, two individuals who attach different importance weights to a criterion are asked to compromise and provide an agreement on their common weight for the criterion, then the bilateral agreement can be obtained.

In fact, to test the willingness to compromise, Heil and Kuntz (2005) studied large capital investment decisions of the executive team of 35 German hospitals, which suggests that it is sufficient to seek compromise among pairs in group decisions, i.e., it is not required for a rational group decision that all group members unanimously agree. This is important since unanimous agreement might hardly be reached in practice. Thus, their empirical findings support the theory presented by Baucells and Sarin (2003) and Baucells and Shapley (2008).

                      is called the “utility comparison ratio” between i and j with α
                     
                        ij
                     
                     ∈(0, 1), and f: (a, b)→(−∞, +∞) is a continuous strictly monotone function, that we call a generating function.

In addition, we can find that each bilateral agreement u
                     
                        ij
                      produces a comparison ratio δ
                     
                        ij
                     . The bilateral agreement between i and j is the same as that between j and i, that is u
                     
                        ij
                     
                     =
                     u
                     
                        ji
                     , from which, we can obtain δ
                     
                        ji
                     
                     =1/δ
                     
                        ij
                     .

Based on the preceding analysis, we can find that the bilateral agreement u
                     
                        ij
                      is actually the group utility of individuals i and j, which means that obtaining the group utility is easy when there are only two individuals in a group. But if three individuals exist and two pairs of them provide their bilateral agreements, how can the group utility be obtained? The following theorem provides the answer.

For a set of individuals N
                     ={1, 2, …, n} with their utilities {u
                     1, u
                     2, …, u
                     
                        n
                     }, for any three individuals {i, k, j}, the bilateral agreement between individuals i and k yields u
                     
                        ik
                     , and the individuals k and j yields u
                     
                        kj
                     . The corresponding comparison ratios are δ
                     
                        ik
                      and δ
                     
                        kj
                     , respectively.

The proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Appendix A.


                     Theorem 2 illustrates that to obtain the group utility of any three individuals {i, k, j}, we only need to know the utility of each individual, and the bilateral agreements of any two pairs of these three individuals. The condition δ
                     
                        ij

                     δ

                     , i, j, k
                     =1, 2, …, n should be satisfied.

By comparing Eqs. (7) and (8), we can find that their forms are similar. Is it extended to derive the group utility of n(n
                     >3) individuals? What is the minimum requirement under such situation? Before answering these questions, we first provide the following theorem.

The proof of Theorem 3 is provided in Appendix A.


                     Theorem 3 shows that to obtain the group utility of q
                     +1 individuals, we only need to know the individual utilities of these q
                     +1 individuals, and the bilateral agreements of q pairs of individuals.

Based on Theorem 3, the following corollary can be obtained:

In Appendix A, we provide Example 2 for another comparison.


                     Examples 1 and 2 show that assuming the bilateral agreement as the weight arithmetic mean of the individual preference values is not always valid. The preference values do not exist in isolation, but belongs to a team which has its own character. This means that the individual preference value has some relationship with other preference values in the team, such as the reciprocal and consistency properties in a comparison matrix. Therefore, when dealing with the relationship between the bilateral agreements and the individual preference values, we should also consider the characters of the team that the individual preference values belong to.

We now examine the case where the consequence of a decision is evaluated on multiple criteria. We assume that the members of the group have agreed on the criteria c
                     1, c
                     2, …, c
                     
                        m
                      and each individual can specify his/her own utility function for these criteria. An arbitrary multidimensional consequence is denoted by x
                     =(x
                     1, x
                     2, …, x
                     
                        m
                     ), and

Based on the quasi-arithmetic mean, the utility function of each individual over criteria can be written as:

The proof of Theorem 4 is provided in Appendix A.


                     Theorem 4 shows that if the values of some parameters are known, others can also be determined. Therefore, the minimum requirements can be derived to obtain the group utility. For example, we only need to know the comparison ratio δ
                     
                        ij,a
                      under criterion a to obtain the overall comparison ratio δ
                     
                        ij
                      between individuals i and j from Eq. (13).

In the following sections, three methods are presented to determine the values of these parameters, based on which the group utility can be further obtained.

For a given pair of individuals i and j, and some choice of a criterion a, let v
                        
                           i,a
                         and v
                        
                           j,a
                         be the corresponding criteria evaluation functions. Individuals i and j provide a bilateral agreement v
                        
                           ij,a
                        , which can be expressed as the quasi-arithmetic mean about v
                        
                           i,a
                         and v
                        
                           j,a

Method I shows that we only need to know the bilateral agreement of two individuals on evaluation about one criterion to obtain the comparison ratio of these two individuals.

To illustrate the proposed method, the following example is provided.
                           Example 3
                           (Baucells & Sarin, 2003). The three criteria x
                              =(x
                              1, x
                              2, x
                              3) of an alternative may represent a monetary outcome (a discounted cash flow, for instance) x
                              1, some indicator of environmental impact x
                              2, and some measure of health and safety x
                              3. Suppose (0.4, 0.35, 0.25) is the set of weights of criteria of individual 1, (0.5, 0.3, 0.2) is the set of weights of criteria of individual 2, and both individuals have the same utility functions on the last two criteria and slightly different on the first criterion. Let x
                              0 be the worst outcome and x
                              ∗ the best one.

Suppose that we use the quasi-arithmetic mean to aggregate the individual utilities. By Eq. (12), if f(t)=
                              t, then the proposed method reduces to the one proposed by Baucells and Sarin (2003); if f(t)=log t, then the individual utilities are separable in the following criteria evaluation functions:

Method II presents a way to derive the value of the comparison ratio from the bilateral agreement on one criterion weight.

In Example 3, individuals 1 and 2 could use Method II to compare the weights given to certain criteria, for example, a
                        =2. In this case, β
                        1,2
                        =0.35 and β
                        2,2
                        =0.3 are the weights given to criterion 2, and a bilateral agreement is β
                        12,2
                        ∈(0.3, 0.35). If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one in Method I obtained for f(t)=log t, then β
                        12,2
                        =0.3444. By Eq. (17), we obtain δ
                        12
                        =0.1267. If this bilateral agreement is to be consistent with the previous one in Method I obtained for f(t)=log(t/(1−
                        t)), then β
                        12,2
                        =0.3417. By Eq. (17), we have δ
                        12
                        =0.1598.

One interesting thing in the multi-criteria decision making is the willingness to pay, which means decreasing the performance of one criterion to increase the performance of another criterion. However, the overall value of the alternative should not be changed, which can be described as follows (Baucells & Sarin, 2003):

                              Actually, the proposed method is a generalization of the one proposed by 
                              Baucells and Sarin (2003)
                              . The former is based on the quasi-arithmetic mean, while the latter is based on the weighted arithmetic mean, which is a special case of the quasi-arithmetic mean. Next, an example is provided to compare the proposed method with the one provided by

The method proposed by Baucells and Sarin (2003) is firstly used to derive the group reciprocal judgment matrix. Let f(t)=
                              t, then by Method I, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement between 1/2 and 1/5 for the preference value that alternative y
                              1 is preferred to alternative y
                              2 under criterion c
                              1. Suppose the bilateral agreement is 1/3, then by Eqs. (15) and (16), we can obtain δ
                              12
                              =1.25.

If Method II is used, then individuals 1 and 2 provide a bilateral agreement between 0.1 and 0.2 for the weight of criterion c
                              2. If it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the bilateral agreement be 0.1556. By Eq. (17), we have δ

                              =1.25, and by Eq. (12), we can obtain the overall reciprocal judgment matrices of individuals d

                              we can find that A′ is not a reciprocal judgment matrix, because that a

Instead, the proposed method is employed to obtain the group reciprocal judgment matrix. By Method I, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement on the preference value that alternative y
                              1 is preferred to alternative y
                              2 under criterion c
                              1, that is 1/3. Let f(t)=log t, by Eqs. (15) and (16), we obtain δ
                              12
                              =0.7937.

Alternatively, if Method II is used, these two individuals give a bilateral agreement on the weight of criterion c
                              2. If it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the compromise weight of criterion c
                              2 be 0.1442. By Eq. (17), we have δ
                              12
                              =0.7937, and by Eq. (12), we obtain the overall reciprocal judgment matrices of individuals d

                              which is consistent.

In Appendix A, we provide Example 5 for another comparison.

Based on the preceding analysis, we can find that when the decision makers provide multiplicative consistent complementary judgment matrices and consistent reciprocal judgment matrices, and provide also their bilateral agreements, if we use Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method, or Baucells and Sarin (2003)’s method, the obtained group pairwise comparison matrix is not consistent. If the decision makers provide the consistent reciprocal judgment matrices, the group matrix obtained by using Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method, or Baucells and Shapley (2008)’s method is not a reciprocal judgment matrix. Such problems can be solved by using the proposed methods.

In this paper, the multi-criteria group decision making has been investigated based on bilateral agreements. To ensure the consistency of pairwise comparison matrices, qusi-arithmetic mean has been used to provide a unified aggregation function. To explore the group preference based on different pairwise comparison matrices, the bilateral agreement between each pair of them is employed. The minimum requirement has been investigated to obtain the group utility. The bilateral agreements among pairs of individuals on a single criterion were found to be sufficient to derive the multi-criteria group utility. The bilateral agreements between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of these three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. Several examples have also been presented to illustrate the proposed methods. In future research, the multi-criteria group decision making problem, in which the criteria are correlated with each other, will be investigated.

                        Proof of Theorem 1
                        
                           Proof. If A is consistent, then let λ
                           
                              k
                           
                           =1, λ
                           
                              l
                           
                           =0, l
                           ≠
                           k. Thus, we have A
                           =
                           A
                           (k) and A
                           (k) is consistent. Therefore, A
                           (l) are all consistent if l is assigned different values from 1 to m.

On the contrary, if A
                           (l) are all consistent, then we have

                           =2. Let us suppose that it is true for q
                           =
                           p
                           −1 and let us prove it for q
                           =
                           p. Then,

                           =(0.4, 0.4, 0.2)T, respectively. Given that A

                           =1, 2, 3 are all multiplicative consistent, then their collective one should also be multiplicative consistent.


                           Baucells and Sarin (2003)’s method is used to obtain the group complementary judgment matrix of these three alternatives. Let f(t)=
                           t, then by Method I, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement about the preference value that alternative y
                           1 is preferred to alternative y
                           2 under criterion c
                           2. Suppose that it is 0.15, by Eqs. (15) and (16), we have δ
                           12
                           =0.25.

If Method II is used, these two individuals provide a bilateral agreement on the weight of criterion c
                           2, and if it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the compromise weight of criterion c
                           2 be 0.3200. By Eq. (17), we have δ
                           12
                           =0.25, then by Eq. (12), we first obtain the overall complementary judgment matrices of individuals d

Alternatively, if Method II is used, these two individuals give a bilateral agreement on the weight of criterion c
                           2. If it is to be consistent with the previous one, then let the compromise weight of criterion c
                           2 be 0.3282. By Eq. (17), we obtain δ
