                  The quality of initial ideas is considered a critical determinant for successful new product development (NPD). This study presents an ideation method for generating new product ideas. The aims of the proposed method are (1) to clarify and identify potential problems involved in the knowledge domain of the product design through the Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram; (2) to abstract inventive problems and generate novel product ideas by means of the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) methodology; and, (3) to develop an effective decision aiding method for evaluating alternative ideas and determining promising product ideas using fuzzy linguistic evaluation techniques. The applicability of the ideation method is demonstrated through a case study of an air purifier design. The theoretical and practical implications of the ideation method are also discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

New product development (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. Since a new product cannot emerge without new product ideas, research on idea generation for new products has mainly been centered on the notion of creativity. How to effectively generate novel and useful product ideas continues to be a critical issue for both design scholars and practitioners. Ideation is the initial process of generating and identifying the core ideas of a concept. It encompasses all stages of a thought cycle, from creative formulation to innovative manifestation of ideas. Various ideation methods have been developed and employed in the literature, such as brainstorming, lateral thinking, and synectics. These techniques generally increase the idea productivity of participants by guiding the direction and quality of their thoughts; however, relatively little emphasis has been given to structuring the outcomes of these techniques. Structured methods used to generate ideas include attribute listing, forced relationships, and morphological analysis, all of which seek to restructure a problem to facilitate creative solutions. Pictorial methods for organizing knowledge and developing creative thinking include mind maps and concept maps. The former is based on radial hierarchies and tree structures denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas the latter is based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.

Previous research has indicated that the difficulty with idea generation techniques in general is that there is very little theoretical and empirical evidence that clearly points out direct benefits from their use [1,2]. Conventional ideation methods for generating new product ideas are sensitive to the demographic profiles and life style biases of respondent groups. Most of them involve intuitive belief systems with more or less arbitrary sources rather than empirically validated theory. Previous research has also suggested that a prerequisite for developing better idea generation procedures is to achieve a fundamental understanding of how ideas actually come into being through conceiving the characteristics of the cognitive processes and structures [3,4]. On the other hand, theory treats idea generation in design as a special type of problem solving activity, which is grounded on ill-defined problems [5,6]. Problem solving is a mental and cognitive process that includes problem finding and problem shaping. Problem definitions play a vital role in the problem solving and idea generation process since the quality of idea solutions depends highly on precise problem definitions. However, conventional ideation methods emphasize the importance of a contextual survey with respect to problem solving; most of them resolve problems based on paradigmatic problems (e.g., 5WH, SCAMPER, and Compass), and do not provide a conceptualized reflective manner for defining problems.

In addition to idea generation, a holistic ideation method requires an effective evaluation to identify promising ideas. Idea evaluation is a systematic determination of merit, worth, and significance within the alternative ideas using criteria against a set of rules or standards. It is a distinct process, in contrast to idea generation, and as such involves uniquely identifiable mental operations [7–9]. There are a variety of idea evaluation tools and techniques that are commonly employed in the literature, such as NAF (Novelty, Attractiveness, and Feasibility) study, PMI (Plus/positive, Minus/negative, and Interesting) analysis, force field analysis, and impact analysis. Although these techniques are simple to use, their weakness is that the evaluations are often based on the evaluators’ subjective opinions. AHP-based approach is a sophisticated technique for evaluating ideas; however, it involves complex procedures for deriving the weights of criteria and requires that evaluators remain consistent in making pairwise comparisons among numerous decision criteria [10–14]. Idea evaluation involves the human perceptual interpretation with some uncertainty and imprecision, and can be iterated a few times since the ideas derived during the idea generation process are often abstract, conceptual, non-quantifiable, and unpredictable. How to develop an effective method to assist designers in evaluating product ideas is a critical issue for both academic and industrial circles.

A holistic ideation method involves both the generation and evaluation of ideas. The former is focused on using insight to formulate an idea, while the latter is concerned primarily with the manifestation or implementation of the proposed idea. Conventional ideation methods mainly focus on the effectiveness of problem solving and idea generation but do not provide a structured conceptualization manner to formulate potential problems, avert trial-and-error iterations, and identify promising product ideas. Accordingly, this paper presents an ideation method for generating new product ideas, the purpose of which is to develop an effective idea generation and evaluation method that integrates TRIZ, concept mapping, and fuzzy linguistic evaluation techniques into a holistic methodology. This method can be used to assist designers in developing novel product ideas based on semantic technologies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical background of TRIZ, concept map, and fuzzy linguistic evaluation, respectively. Section 3 describes the proposed ideation method. An empirical study is conducted in Section 4 to verify the applicability of the proposed method. A discussion is given in Section 5 and conclusions and recommendations for further research are offered in Section 6.

TRIZ, a Russian acronym, translated into English as “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS)”, was introduced by Altshuller in the mid-1940s [15]. It is a scientific methodology for creative problem solving, which seeks to eliminate conflicting problems and provides a range of strategies for finding solutions in the NPD process [16]. The philosophy of TRIZ is based on five key elements, namely ideality, functionality, resources, contradiction, and evolution, which together make TRIZ distinct from other problem-solving strategies. TRIZ scholars recognize that many innovative solutions involve resolving contradictions and increasing ideality with useful resources. Moreover, the evolution of technical innovation is predictable, and can be used to guide further development of functionality of a system. As such, TRIZ provides a systematic way of thinking to identify problems and links between them, analytical tools for problem modeling, analysis, and transformation, and knowledge-based tools for system change and resolution development [17]. Over the past few decades, it has gained much commercial acceptance, and has proven to be useful and powerful in the development of innovative products [18–21].

The aim of TRIZ is to provide designers with a strategic problem-solving process to advance further in the direction of the specific inventive solution with a minimum number of trial-and-error iterations. The TRIZ problem solving process comprises the following four steps: (1) problem definition; (2) problem classification and tool selection; (3) solution generation; and, (4) evaluation. Problem definition is aimed at clarifying common design questions and involves analytical tasks that are conducted using TRIZ analytical tools such as project definition, functional modeling and functional analysis, technological evolution analysis, ideality and ideal final result (IFR) analysis, and S-curve analysis. After having finished problem definitions, designers have to classify the problems into categories and then select appropriate tools for the problems. For each problem category, there are some knowledge-based tools available to resolve the problems, such as 39 design parameters and the contradiction matrix, 11 separation principles for physical contradictions, 40 inventive principles for technical contradictions, 76 standard solutions for substance-field (Su-field) analysis, and 8 evolutionary patterns for forecasting technology trends [22]. By using the corresponding tools, many possible solutions can be generated and then evaluated to determine the best solution to the problem.

Contradiction problems often occur in a new product design process. In TRIZ, there are two main types of design contradictions, namely physical contradictions and technical contradictions. A physical contradiction is a situation in which a subject or an object has to be in two mutually exclusive physical states, whereas a technical contradiction is a situation in which efforts to improve some technical attributes of a system can lead to the deterioration of other technical attributes. Conventional design methods treat contradiction problems based on the philosophy of compromises and trade-offs. Contrary to these methods, TRIZ offers various tools to overcome design contradictions. Among these tools, the contradiction matrix and the 40 inventive principles are the most commonly used, and provide designers with guidelines to facilitate the development of useful concepts of solutions for innovative situations [23]. Substance-field (Su-field) analysis is another popular tool for functional modeling and functional analysis. In a Su-field model, the desired function represents the output from an object or a “substance” (S
                        1) caused by another object (S
                        2) with the action or means of a “field” (F). Any functional system can be modeled with a complete Su-field triangle, which can be used to identify potential problems through the analysis of undesired models. Taking advantage of the 76 standard solutions, the potential problems can be resolved.

TRIZ is a systematically structured approach based on the evidence emerging from the analysis of a large number of patented inventive solutions. It includes a well-established system of tools that provides designers with strategic and pattern-based guidelines to solve problems and generate ideas. Although the TRIZ methodology does not provide a strict sequence or specific procedure in the application of the tools, ways of structuring the system of tools are suggested to provide some clarity on how the corresponding tools should be applied to abstracting inventive problems and solving specific problems [24].

Cognitive structures refer to a set of concepts and the relationships among these concepts [25]. The presence of certain knowledge structures in individuals’ minds largely determines their ability to characterize a particular problem domain and their problem-solving performance [26,27]. The concept map technique, developed by Novak in the 1970s, is a graphical tool for organizing and representing knowledge [28]. It makes concepts, as well as propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the representation of knowledge structures and the construction of meanings [29]. A concept is defined as a perceived regularity in events, or patterns/records of objects, designated by a label, while propositions are statements about some object or event in the universe, either naturally occurring or purposely constructed. In general, propositions contain two or more concepts connected using linking phrases to form a meaningful statement. The concept map may pertain to some situation or event that one is trying to understand through the organization of knowledge in the form of a visual map, thus providing the context for the event or situation.

Many researchers have investigated the positive relationship between knowledge creation and idea generation [30–32]. Concept maps are not only a tool for capturing, representing, and archiving knowledge of individuals, but are also a powerful tool to create new knowledge. They can be used as a meaning-centered technique to clarify ideation processes through conceptualizing domain knowledge and revealing combinations and analogies with previous domain knowledge. In a concept map, concepts and propositions are the building semantics for knowledge in any conceptual domain. Knowledge graphs consist of nodes and links in which nodes represent concepts and links represent the relationships between the concepts [33]. Each node (concept) is usually represented as a box and is connected with labeled arrows (links) in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated by linking words or phrases such as “include”, “between”, “can result in”, or “should combine with”. With concept maps, key information can be presented in a condensed manner without the loss of completeness and meaning. The image of concepts, in any tangible form, can facilitate analogical association through a visual presentation that fosters an understanding of complex information at a glance compared to the dense presentation of words and verbal compositions.

Creative thinking refers to the ability to formulate new perspectives of problems and apply persistence to the exploration of new pathways to solve problems [34]. There are two features of concept maps that are important in the facilitation of creative thinking: the hierarchical structure that is represented in a good map, and the ability to search for and characterize new cross-links. The hierarchical structure for a particular domain of knowledge depends on the context in which that knowledge is being applied or considered. Cross-links help one see how a concept in one domain of knowledge represented on the map is related to a concept in another domain of the same map. In the creation of new knowledge, cross-links often represent “creative leaps” on the part of the knowledge producer [35]. The construction of concept maps provides the opportunity for designers to break new knowledge into small parts (concepts), arrange and order concepts to make sense, and make connections between concepts. It helps designers see how individual concepts form a larger whole and how those concepts are generated and connected in a reasonable and reflective manner. Through the integration of new or related concepts and the establishment of new links or the re-arrangement of existing links, potential problems involved in the knowledge domain can be clarified during the ideation process.

Fuzzy sets are a generalization of crisp sets for representing imprecision or vagueness in everyday life. The use of fuzzy sets is central to computing with words or labels as they provide a means of modeling the vagueness underlying most natural semantic terms [36,37]. Zadeh [38,39] first introduced the concept of linguistic variables as a model of how words or labels can represent vague concepts in natural language. The semantic elements of the term set are given by fuzzy numbers defined on the interval [0,1], which are described by membership functions. In this study, linguistic variables are described by piecewise continuous triangular membership functions shown in Fig. 1

Aggregation refers to the process of synthesizing a collection of numerical values into a unique representative or meaningful value in order to come to a conclusion or a decision. The fuzzy weighted average (FWA) is a linguistic aggregation operator used in situations where the arguments are inexact numerical variables. More specifically, it is a combination of extended algebraic operations to be used in the evaluation of alternatives when their corresponding ratings and importance (weights) of criteria are represented by fuzzy numbers. The operation of FWA is formularized as follows [40–42]:

                         represents the rating of the kth criterion of alternative j; and, wk
                         represents the importance (weight) of the kth criterion.

Variables rjk
                         and wk
                         are fuzzy numbers. Based on the extension principle, the fuzzy arithmetic operations have been defined to manipulate fuzzy numbers [38,39,43]. Any fuzzy number can be completely defined by its family of α-cuts, while extended algebraic operations can be defined based on arithmetic operations in intervals assuming that fuzzy numbers are represented by continuous membership functions. According to Klir and Yuan [44], the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on fuzzy numbers A and B on 
                           
                              R
                           
                         can be reduced to operations on intervals Aα
                        
                        =[a,
                        b] and Bα
                        
                        =[c,
                        d], respectively.

The result of the FWA operation is a crisp set (interval) that represents the α-cut of the fuzzy set obtained by operating on fuzzy numbers rjk
                         and wk
                        . Through the aggregation operation, the family of α-cuts defined as the resultant membership function of the evaluated alternative can be presented as a membership function curve and classified as a fuzzy number. In order to obtain a quantitative value of the resultant membership function, the center-of-gravity (COG) defuzzification method is used in this study. The formula of the COG method is expressed in Eq. (3). The higher the

Ideation methods are commonly used by designers as a means for generating original product ideas. Based on the integrated application of TRIZ, concept mapping, and fuzzy linguistic evaluation, the framework of the proposed ideation method is shown in Fig. 2
                     , the implementation steps of which are described below.
                        
                           
                              Step 1. Problem definition
                           

Problem definitions involve the formulation of real problem statements instead of the perceived problem for resolving the root cause of the problem. A Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram that combines TRIZ functional analysis diagrams with a concept map is used in this step to represent the interrelationships among concepts and clarify the emerging knowledge of the ideation task. It can be considered a semantics-based technology that helps designers understand the context of the knowledge domain concerning the aim of the product design and obtain a holistic and logical representation of problems broken down into a pictorial format.

The Su-field enhanced concept mapping process begins with the generation of a set of semantic statements/components which ideally represent the entire conceptual domain of the product design for the ideation topic. A very important aspect of constructing a Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram is to determine cross-links between concepts in different segments or conceptual domains that help to formulate how these concepts are related to one another. Based on the Su-field problem modeling, 5 types of interaction (useful, insufficiently useful, uncertainly useful, excessive, and harmful actions) are used in the diagram instead of the concept map’s link of labeled arrows to depict the relationships between concepts. Problems can be identified through analyzing the propositional situations with harmful, excessive, insufficiently useful, or uncertainly useful actions. The problem definition can be formulized as:
                        
                           (4)

                                    O

                                    p

                              }
                           
                        
                     where Pa and O represent patterns and objects in the Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram; Pa′ and O′ represent the mapping of Pa and O in the problem space; and, pi
                      represents the set of defined problems within the proposition Pa′O′, i

                              Step 2. Problem classification and tool selection
                           

After problems have been defined, they should be classified into categories according to their characteristics, such as physical contradictions, technical contradictions, and imperfect functional structures. However, a problem may induce some sub-problem(s). For each category, there are corresponding TRIZ tools that can be used to resolve the defined problems and sub-problems, for which designers must select appropriate tools. The formulation can be expressed as

                                    ′
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    p

                              Ts
                              }
                           
                        
                     where Ca represents the category of problems; Ca′ and pi
                     ′ represent the mapping of Ca and pi
                      in the TRIZ problem space; and, Ts represents the corresponding TRIZ tools.

Using the TRIZ tools, a number of ideas corresponding to the defined problems can be generated. These ideas must be preliminarily assessed to eliminate improper ideas or integrate some ideas into other similar ones. A generated idea may also induce some sub-problem(s) that must be redefined for resolution development. The idea generation is formulized as

Idea evaluation is a critical step for identifying promising ideas in the ideation process. It is a decision-making problem that consists of finding the most desirable ideas from a given set of alternative ideas. Dean et al. [45] indicated that quality ideas should comprise the following 3 fundamental characteristics: (1) the applicability of the idea to the problem; (2) effectiveness of a solution to the problem; and, (3) the degree to which the idea is implementable. Based on an exhaustive literature review, they proposed 4 major constructs for evaluating ideas, each construct of which includes 2–3 dimensions as shown in Table 1
                     .

Since the dimension of clarity, c43
                     , did not load on any of the constructs according to the factor analysis result conducted by Dean et al. [45], it is eliminated as a measure for the idea evaluation. The criteria are expressed below:

According to the 8 decision criteria, designers evaluate the alternative ideas and determine the weights of the criteria. The evaluation grades are a 7-point linguistic scale, ranging from VH (very high agreement/importance) to VL (very low agreement/importance). The ratings and weights are derived as the following two sets, where rjk
                      and wk
                      are linguistic variables as defined in Eq. (1).

By substituting the above two sets of linguistic variables into Eq. (2) to perform the FWA aggregation, the resultant membership functions of the evaluated ideas can be obtained. Eq. (3) is then used to defuzzify these fuzzy numbers and consequently rank the alternative ideas by the quantitative values.

After completing the idea evaluation step, the promising product ideas, {sj
                     
                     ′}, are identified. According to the product ideas, the functional specifications for the product design can be determined, which are used for physical embodiment and detailed engineering development.

Indoor air pollution is a serious environmental health issue in many countries. An air purifier is a useful and effective device used to remove airborne pollutants from indoor air. This section presents an empirical study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed ideation method. The present case was a teamwork that involves 3 graduate students who majored in Industrial/Product Design (one in PhD programs and the other two in master’s programs) and were familiar with TRIZ methodologies. The aim of the product design is to develop a potable air purifier for home or small office use.

According to the aim of the ideation topic for developing a potable air purifier, a Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram was constructed, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . By analyzing the diagram, the main problems of the product design case were defined as follows:
                           
                              
                                 Problem 1: Vibration occurring during fan operation can influence the satiability of the housing structure (p1
                                 ).


                                 Problem 2: Aerodynamically induced noise is produced when the fan generates a circulating airflow (p2
                                 ).


                                 Problem 3: Which secondary function is appropriate for integration into an air purifier (p3
                                 )?


                                 Problem 4: The filter absorbs moisture generated by the humidifier, making the filter suitable for the growth of germs and mold (p4
                                 ).


                                 Problem 5: What types of filtration can more effectively remove indoor air pollutants (p5
                                 )?


                                 Problem 6: Excluding the removal of air pollutants, are there any functions that can be integrated into an air purifier to produce fresher and healthier indoor air (p6
                                 )?

Problems 1, 5, and 6 are regarded as the imperfect functional structures, which occur when there are excessive, harmful, or inadequate useful functions, or lack of needed useful functions in the system. These problems can be resolved using functional improvement methods and TRIZ standard solutions. The Su-field models are shown in Fig. 4
                        . They are employed for solving the problems represented as unsatisfactory interactions between two or more of the system’s components.

The airflow rate is one of the most important factors for measuring the performance of an air purifier. A stronger airflow force typically offers a greater airflow rate; however, it generates more noise. Problem 2 is considered a technical contradiction that attempts to improve the feature of airflow force (Parameter 10) which can result in the harmful side effect of noise (Parameter 31). Problem 3 involves the system improvement to enhance competitive advantage in the air purifier market. In this problem, a proper secondary function should be determined between humidification and dehumidification to integrate into the main function of air purification.

Problem 4 is considered a physical contradiction elicited from Problem 3. In this problem, the moisture generated by the humidifier must be isolated from the filter if humidification is selected as the secondary function of the air purifier. According to TRIZ separation principles, the humidifier can be designed to be separable (separation in time); however, this generates a sub-problem defined as the humidifier requiring an independent power source. This sub-problem (Problem 4-1) is classified as a technical contradiction that focuses on improving the complexity of the power supply of the humidifier (Parameter 36) which can lead to deterioration in the convenience of use (Parameter 33).

Vibration stems from induced motion of mechanical components, which is also the source of noise during fan operation. In addition to the causes of defective fan design (e.g., unbalanced fan and inconsistency in blade tip angle settings) and improper assembly (e.g., misalignment of the drive shaft, unbalanced couplings, and loose mounting nuts/bolts), structural resonance is also a crucial factor. A complex Su-field can be formulated by introducing an easily controllable admixture, possessing desirable properties into the substance. As shown in Fig. 5
                        , Problem 1 can be resolved in two ways. One is increasing the weight of the housing structure (S
                        2′) to reduce the resonance effect (i.e., creating an internal complex Su-field) (solution s1-1
                        ); the other is adding rubber damping pads (S
                        3′) to support the drive motor (S
                        3) and absorb vibrational energy (i.e., creating an external complex Su-field) (solution s1-2
                        ).

According to the inventive principles (3, 13, 24, and 36) extracted from the contradiction matrix, Problem 2 can be resolved in five ways, as presented in Table 2
                        . In these solutions, s2-1
                         and s2-2
                         can be included in s2-5
                        .

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) are known as environmental comfort technologies which describe the process of treating air to control indoor temperature, humidity, cleanliness, and distribution. Humidification and dehumidification are two opposite physical functions for controlling indoor humidity. Technologically speaking, most home air conditioners and heaters function in tandem with the effect of dehumidifying indoor air. Hence, a humidifier is more appropriate than a dehumidifier for integration into a portable air purifier. An induced sub-problem then, is how to generate moisture (Problem 3-1). According to the evolution of humidifying technologies, the solutions to Problem 3-1 are presented in Table 3
                        . Solutions s3-1
                         and s3-2
                         are steam injection types, while solutions s3-3
                         and s3-4
                         are mechanical water spray injection types. Solution s3-5
                         uses electrical water spray injection technology to generate moisture.

Since the humidifier is designed to be separable, it requires an independent power source to provide electricity for the humidifying function. According to the inventive principles (9, 24, 26, and 27) extracted from the contradiction matrix, the solutions to Problem 4-1 are presented in Table 2. Of the four solutions, s4-1
                         is the improvement of s4-4
                        , while s4-2
                         is the improvement of s4-3
                        .

Problem 5 focuses on how to effectively remove airborne pollutants from indoor air. In a Su-field model, if the conditions contain limitations on the introduction of admixtures into the exiting substances, the problem can be solved by a transition (permanent or temporary) to an external complex Su-field, attaching an external substance to one of these substances which improves controllability or brings the required properties. As shown in Fig. 6
                        , four solutions were proposed according to the Su-field analysis models. Solutions s5-1
                         and s5-2
                         involve adding another substance (HEPA (S
                        1′) and Electrostatic filters (S
                        1″), respectively) to enhance the filtration function for eliminating air pollutants. In solutions s5-3
                         and s5-4
                        , an electrical field (E) is added to act on the substance of polarized-media technology (S
                        3) and plasma technology (S
                        4), respectively.

Problem 6 focuses on how to produce fresher and healthier indoor air. Six solutions were proposed according to the Su-field analysis models shown in Table 4
                        . Solution s6-1
                         adds another substance (Sensors (S
                        3)) to the system. Solutions s6-2
                         and s6-3
                         add a chemical field (C), while solutions s6-4
                        , s6-5
                        , and s6-6
                         add an electrical field (E) to act on their corresponding substances (S
                        4–S
                        8).

According to the 8 decision criteria given in Eq. (7), the team members determined the criteria weights and evaluated the alternative ideas. The linguistic judgments of weights (wk
                        ) and ratings (rjk
                        ) are shown in Table 5
                        .

By substituting these linguistic variables into Eq. (2) to perform the FWA aggregation, and then defuzzifying these resultant fuzzy numbers by using the COG method given in Eq. (3), 6 sets of membership functions and their corresponding quantitative values were derived, as shown in Fig. 7
                        . The rank of the alternative ideas is listed in Table 5.

According to the fuzzy linguistic evaluation results, some promising ideas were determined. The functional specifications for the product design are described as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              This product combines an air purifier and humidifier. It uses ultrasonic vibration technology to create a mist and evaporate moisture into the air (Idea s3-5
                                 ).

The humidifier is designed for separable use with built-in high-power batteries. It uses the air purifier body as the dock for fixing and charging (Idea s4-2
                                 ).

To reduce vibration during fan operation, the drive motor is supported by rubber damping pads (Idea s1-2
                                 ).

Under the requirement of an unchanged airflow rate, this design enlarges the fan size and reduces the fan speed in order to improve operating noise (Idea s2-5
                                 ).

This product design did not adopt complex and expensive purification systems such as polarized-media and plasma technologies. Instead, a multi-stage air filtration system is adopted which includes a micro-mesh pre-filter, TiO2 filter (Idea s6-3
                                 ), activated carbon filter (Idea s6-2
                                 ), and true HEPA filter (Idea s5-1
                                 ).

This air purifier also features an ionizer to release negative ions into the air (Idea s6-6
                                 ) and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) to oxidize and degrade organic contaminants (Idea s6-3
                                 ).

Air quality sensors are used in the air purifier to detect environmental dust, odors, and humidity (Idea s6-1
                                 ). The detected environmental information is displayed on the control panel and is used for automatic control of the air purification and humidification system.

According to the functional specifications 1 and 2, the product appearance is relevant to the functional elements of the housing and separable humidifier design. In the Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram (see Fig. 3), “Air purifier” was used as the starting point to conceptualize the knowledge domain of the product design. A key analogical association is that air purifiers function as plants in that both eliminate harmful pollutants and produce fresh air. One of the most important life processes in plants is photosynthesis, which helps plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen by using carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. As leaves play a vital role in the process of photosynthesis, the image of leaves is meaningful to the design and can be used to develop the appearance of the air purifier. The idea sketch is shown in Fig. 8
                        .

In order to validate the product design using the proposed ideation method, the design proposal was submitted to the Yen Sun Technology Corporation (Y.S. TECH) for production assessment. Y.S. TECH is a famous home appliance products manufacturer in Taiwan, and is also an original equipment/design manufacturer (OEM/ODM) with business customers around the world like 3M, Philips, Honeywell, OSIM, and Panasonic. Through a comprehensive assessment by the R&D department, most R&D managers and senior product engineers considered that the innovative air purifier design has distinct advantages over their previous OEM and ODM products. According to the functional specifications and idea sketches, the design was embodied using 3D digital mock-ups. After having determined the necessary engineering dimensions, the prototype of the air purifier was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 9
                        . The final result was approved by the Y.S. TECH for the following engineering and manufacturing procedures.

Witherell et al. [46] indicated that semantics can be exploited to simplify some of the intricacies associated with the management of complex systems by using information artifacts as representations of their physical counterpart. Although the proposed method is applicable to generating novel ideas and identifying promising ideas for innovative product designs based on semantic technologies, there are limitations and conditions for the effectiveness of the case study. The proposed method requires team members to integrate and convert the corresponding TRIZ solutions into concrete product ideas in the idea generation process. However, individuals vary in the quantity and quality of the relevant domain knowledge they possess, and also in the strength of their analogical reasoning abilities to seek ways to convert the TRIZ guidelines into concrete product ideas. Besides, when applying the linguistic approach to idea evaluation, field experimenters should pay attention to the selection of evaluators because of the limitations of the individuals’ expertise and experience for evaluating the alternative ideas and determining the weights of the decision criteria.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The implementation of ideation is regarded as the vital initial task in an NPD process. It involves generating novel ideas as well as identifying promising ideas to endow a product with optimal performance. In this study, an ideation method that integrates TRIZ, concept mapping, and fuzzy linguistic evaluation into a holistic methodology was proposed. A case study concerning an air purifier design was conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method. Compared to conventional ideation techniques, the proposed method has distinct advantages in clarifying potential problems, generating novel product ideas, and evaluating alternative product ideas. The theoretical and practical implications of the ideation method are discussed below.

Idea generation is considered a special type of problem solving activity, involving a complex cognitive process of resolving ill-structured problems. Most existing ideation methods for generating new product ideas emphasize the importance of a contextual survey with respect to problem solving but do not provide a structured conceptualization manner to formulate potential problems involved in the knowledge domain of the product design. For solving ill-defined problems, the formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution [47]. In the proposed method, problems are formulated using a Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram that combines TRIZ functional analysis diagrams with a concept map. Concept mapping has been heralded as a cognitive method to organize and represent the core ideas of a concept. It can be regarded as a transformative process to conceptualize and represent complex constructs in a clear and systematic manner [48]. Functional analysis and functional decomposition diagrams are widely used in TRIZ as problem definition tools. TRIZ-based functional analysis provides a concise representation to structure problems, identify a range of function-related problems within a system, and rank them according to their importance of interaction. It can be used not only for finding existing problems but for identifying resources to increase the degree of ideality of the system. The proposed Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagram is a meaning-centered analytical tool that enables designers to formulate design problems by clarifying cause–effect relationships, organizing and prioritizing concepts, and displaying meaningful patterns of ideas. Through analyzing the propositional concepts with harmful, excessive, insufficiently useful, or uncertainly useful actions, potential problems involved in the knowledge domain of the product design can be identified.

Idea generation requires not only being creative and systematic but also being knowledgeable. Although various sophisticated ideation methods can be used, most do not provide strategic and knowledge-based procedures to avert trial-and-error iterations, reduce ineffective solutions, and produce innovative product ideas. TRIZ is an innovative pattern-based technique that provides designers with guidelines to support and reflect design strategies and achieve the aims of creative problem solving and novel idea generation. In the proposed method, TRIZ tools are employed as a knowledge-based and function-centered support for generating innovative product ideas. They allow designers to transform a consolidated core bundle of desired functions into a reasonable range so that they can focus on the core items of analogical association for developing a target product. Although TRIZ has been successfully employed in industry and academia, some criticisms have been levied against the guidelines of the principles/solutions because they are too abstract and can sometimes confuse designers while finding possible solutions [49]. The generic principles/solutions can guide the directions where the most effective solutions could possibly exist; however, the success to find a practical solution mainly depends on the ability of the designers to abstract the inventive problems in the TRIZ problem space and interpret the suggested guidelines in the TRIZ solution space. How to integrate and convert the corresponding TRIZ solutions into concrete product ideas is a critical issue in the idea generation process.

Conventional ideation methods mainly focus on the effectiveness of problem solving and idea generation; however, they commonly neglect the importance of incorporating effective decisions for the idea evaluation procedure. Product ideas derived from the ideation process are often abstract and conceptual with varying levels of ambiguity and uncertainty. Using the qualitative paradigm of the idea evaluation criteria is also difficult for designers to objectively assess alternative ideas. In such a complex and uncertain decision-making environment, designers might be reluctant or unable to assign numerical values to the preference judgments. For decision situations in which the alternative ideas cannot be assessed precisely in a quantitative manner but may be in a qualitative one, the use of linguistic evaluation is very appropriate. The fuzzy linguistic approach has been widely used in the literature for evaluation purposes [50–52]. The proposed method uses fuzzy numbers as preference judgments to perform aggregation operations. Since the fuzzy numbers are interval scales derived from the evaluators’ linguistic judgments, they can feel more confident about giving their perceptual interpretations in the form of semantic terms. Moreover, preference judgments are aggregated by means of the FWA method, the use of which allows evaluators to incorporate unquantifiable information, incomplete information, non-obtainable information, and partially ignorant facts into a decision model. Hence, it is capable of capturing evaluators’ appraisals of ambiguity and is valid for dealing with complex evaluation problems involving abstract, conceptual, and qualitative attributes. The proposed method can be used to objectively rank alternative ideas as well as identify promising ideas for innovative product designs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The ideation quality is a very important determinant for a successful NPD task. It includes both the generation and evaluation of new product ideas conducted in the early stages of NPD. The generation of new product ideas requires both creativity and long-range forecasting abilities, whereas the evaluation of new product ideas inevitably encounters a high level of uncertainty. This study presented an ideation method for assisting designers in developing novel product ideas. In the proposed method, Su-field enhanced concept mapping diagrams are used as a meaning-centered technique to clarify and identify the potential problems involved in the knowledge domain of the product design. TRIZ methods are employed as knowledge-based guidelines to support design strategies as well as generate novel product ideas. Alternative ideas are evaluated using linguistic variables associated with the FWA aggregation operator. A case study showed that the proposed method is applicable to generating novel ideas and identifying promising ideas for innovative product designs based on semantic technologies.

Product design is a complex problem-solving activity used to provide descriptions of physical structures that perform specified functions. TRIZ empowers designers with constructive guidelines for developing innovative product ideas through the implementation of analogical association. However, as mentioned above, individuals vary in the quantity and quality of the relevant domain knowledge, and also in the strength of their analogical reasoning abilities to seek ways to convert the TRIZ guidelines into concrete product ideas. The core of analogical reasoning stresses the process of mapping, which is crucial in allowing the useful transfer of domain knowledge. The technique of analogical mapping can be used to find appropriate correspondences between sources and target analogs. Based on the proposed ideation method, further research could focus on developing an analogical mapping technique to assist designers in transferring their relevant domain knowledge and determining the best correspondence between objects and relations in TRIZ solution domains and those in product idea domains.
