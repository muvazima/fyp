                  In compressed sensing, sparse signal reconstruction is a required stage. To find sparse solutions of reconstruction problems, many methods have been proposed. It is time-consuming for some methods when the regularization parameter takes a small value. This paper proposes a decomposition algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction, which is almost insensitive to the regularization parameter. In each iteration, a subproblem or a small quadratic programming problem is solved in our decomposition algorithm. If the extended solution in the current iteration satisfies optimality conditions, an optimal solution to the reconstruction problem is found. On the contrary, a new working set must be selected for constructing the next subproblem. The convergence of the decomposition algorithm is also shown in this paper. Experimental results show that the decomposition method is able to achieve a fast convergence when the regularization parameter takes small values.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, compressed sensing (CS) has received a lot of attentions in signal processing, computer vision and machine learning. CS theory has shown that a sparse signal can be reconstructed with far fewer samples or measurements than that used by traditional methods [1–4]. It is well known that the number of measurements required by traditional methods must follow the Shannon-Nyquist Theorem: the sampling rate (or Nyquist rate) must be at least twice the bandwidth of a signal. However, the Nyquist rate would lead to a large number of measurements, which must be compressed before they can be transmitted. As a result, most of the measurements can be thrown away. Fortunately, CS goes against traditional methods. In CS, there are three basic tasks: how to sparsely represent a given signal, how to design a good sampling matrix, and how to recover the signal represented sparsely. Here, we only focus on the last task, or the problem of sparse signal reconstruction.

The problem of sparse signal reconstruction can be formulated as three different optimization formulations [5,6]: the ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 problem (called basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) in [7] or ℓ1-regularized least squares problem in [8,9]), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in [10], and the quadratically constrained linear problem (QCLP). Actually, the first two formulations are quadratic programming problems. A lot of methods have been presented for solving one of them. For example, matching pursuit (MP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) which are greedy methods have been applied to approximately solve QCLP [11–14]. In [15], NESTA (short for Nesterov’s algorithm) was also developed for solving QCLP. The methods in [16,17] were presented for solving the LASSO formulation. In [18], both LASSO and the sphere code algorithm have been applied to array signal processing.

It is known that solving an unconstrained problem is generally much easier than solving a constrained one. Since the ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 formulation is an unconstrained problem, many researchers have paid attention to it and done great work. Methods commonly used for solving the ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 problem include the gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) method [5], the ℓ1 regularized least squares (ℓ1-LS) method [8], the sparse reconstruction by separable approximation (SpaRSA) method [6], the fixed point continuation (or FPC) method and its improved version [19], the fixed point continuation active set (FPC-AS) method [9], and other iterative shrinkage/thresholding (IST) methods [20,21]. Figueiredo et al. proposed an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to recover a sparse signal in an iterative way [20] and described a new bound optimization algorithm (BOA) to reconstruct a sparse signal [21]. The FPC, FPC-AS and SpaRSA are also IST methods.

ℓ1-LS [8] is a specialized interior-point method, which uses the preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm to compute the search direction. This method can deal with large-scale sparse signal reconstruction problems. GPSR [5] is based on the well-known projected gradient step technique. In GPSR, the ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 problem is recast into a bound-constrained quadratic programming (BCQP), and scheme with different step sizes would lead to two algorithms which are GPSR-Basic and GPSR Barzilai-Borwein (GPSR-BB). The experimental comparison between GPSR and ℓ1-LS shows that GPSR is better. SpaRSA [6] is an algorithm to minimize composite functions composed of a smooth term and a separable non-smooth term. In general, the composite functions are used much wider than the ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 formulation is. Compared with other IST methods, SparRSA has a flexible selecting scheme for the step size, which improves practical performance. In [6], experimental results show that SpaRSA is faster than GPSR, FPC, and ℓ1-LS.

It has been observed that the performance of GPSR, SpaRSA and other methods degrades when the regularization parameter takes small values. Thus a continuation procedure is introduced into these methods. The ℓ2
                     −ℓ1 problem is solved for a decreasing sequence of values of the regularization parameter, using the computed solution for the current parameter value as the initial solution for the next smaller parameter value. We also observe that the reconstruction performance is good but the optimization speed is relatively slow when the continuation procedure is used in the case of small values of the regularization parameter.

In this paper, a method based on a decomposition algorithm is provided for sparse signal reconstruction, which is almost insensitive to the regularization parameter. This method is to decompose the original quadratic programming (QP) problem into a sequence of smaller QP ones. In each iteration, it is easy to solve such a subproblem. The optimal solution is found when the current solution satisfies the optimality conditions. Otherwise, we need to update the working set which consists of the indexes of variables violating the optimality conditions. The convergence of the decomposition algorithm is also proved here.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the problem of sparse signal reconstruction and some classical methods including GPSR, SpaRSA and FPC. In Section 3, we present the sparse signal reconstruction based on decomposition algorithm (DA-SSR) and prove its convergence. We compare DA-SSR with other classical methods in Section 4 and provide conclusions of this paper in Section 5.

                        ×1 vector of linear measurements, which means that we can only observe y instead of the sparse signal x. By combining (1) and (2), we have

Now, the sparse signal recovery problem is to recover x from the matrix A and the measurements y. There are three optimization formulations (QCLP, LASSO, and ℓ2
                        −ℓ1) that can deal with recovery problems. The QCLP problem has the form:

                        where τ is a non-negative regularization parameter. In the following, we introduce some classical methods for solving the problem (7), including GPSR, SpaRSA, and FPC.

In GPSR, the problem (7) is expressed as a bounded-constrained QP (BCQP) problem [5]. Let x

                        −, where both x
                        + and x
                        − are non-negative vectors. The BCQP problem can be described as:

As stated in [6], SpaRSA is an algorithmic framework for the general problem of (7). SpaRSA solves (7) by generating a sequence of iterates {x
                        
                           k

                        =0, 1, …} and the problem (7) is tailored to a sequence of subproblems in each iteration. The (k
                        +1) th subproblem can be expressed as:

The speed of GPSR, SpaRSa and FPC may degrade considerably for smaller values of the regularization parameter τ 
                     [5,6,19]. To remedy it, this section proposes a decomposition algorithm which is almost not influenced by values of the regularization parameter. This decomposition algorithm solves the bounded-constrained QP (BCQP) problem (9), which is a variant of (7) and could be solved by GPSR in [5].

Our decomposition method decomposes (9) into a sequence of subproblems. Each subproblem is a small QP problem. In each iteration, the index set of variables is divided into two sets, B and N, where B is the working set and N is the non-working set. Only the variables in the set B are optimized while the variables in the set N are fixed. Two key issues require to be considered in the decomposition algorithm. One is the optimality conditions or the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. It is well known that the optimal solution of a QP problem will be found only if all the KKT conditions of the QP problem are fulfilled. Thus, the optimality conditions are required to terminate an optimization process. The other is the selection of working set. If a particular solution is not optimal, the selection of working set defines a way to improve the value of the objective function (9) in each iteration.

When will the constrained optimization algorithm terminate? The KKT conditions play an important role in both the theory and practice of constrained optimization algorithm. For convex problems, the KKT conditions are necessary and sufficient for an optimal solution [22]. Obviously, the problem (9) is convex. To analysis the KKT conditions for (9), we introduce a positive Lagrange multiplier vector 
                           α
                        
                        =[α
                        1, …, α
                        2n
                        ] for each of the bounded constraints. Thus, we have the Lagrangian:

                         fixed in this subproblem. In each iteration, we only solve the subproblem (29) with the working set B which will be updated after the subproblem is solved. The decomposition algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction is sketched in Algorithm 3, where ∅ denotes the empty set. Algorithm 3 is subsequently discussed in detail. In addition, to debias the final solution to (9) may improve the performance of reconstruction. For the debiasing technique, please refer to [5,6].

                                 is a feasible solution to the QP problem (9).

The proof of Theorem 1 is shown in Appendix A. This theorem shows that the optimal solution to the subproblem can construct only one feasible solution for (9). In other words, the extended solution obtained from (29) may be not optimal for (9). In this case, we need to update the working set.

If the current solution is not optimal, there must exist some variables violating the KKT conditions. We define a violating set for (9) as follows:
                              Definition 1
                              The violating set V, a subset of N, is the index set of variables which violate the KKT conditions. Let V

                                 N}. Then the violating set is V

                                 2.

After each iteration, we need to update d
                           
                              k

                              k
                            and decide the violating set V. The update of d can be computed as follows:

The cardinality p of the working set is an important parameter which has an effect on the convergent speed. It is easy to solve subproblems when p is smaller. In order to get the optimal solution, the smaller p is, the more subproblems we need to solve. In this case, the number of iterations increases. Specially, we do not need any QP optimization algorithms when p
                           =1. The solution to (29) can be found analytically. The larger p is, the larger the scale of subproblems is. In this case, it’s not so easy to solve the subproblem quickly. Therefore, a proper selection about p is very important. We will set an empirical value for p in experiments.

Since subproblems are QP problems, we can use any QP optimization algorithm to solve them. Here, subproblems are first treated as unconstrained QP problems and then the constrained minimum is found by clipping the resulting solution. The solution to unconstrained QP problems in the kth iteration has the form:

The working set for the next iteration is selected from the violating set in the current iteration. As a result, it can guarantee the convergence of the decomposition algorithm, which is summarized in Theorem 2.
                              Theorem 2
                              
                                 The objective value of 
                                 
                                    (9)
                                  
                                 is strictly monotonically decreasing if and only if the working set B consists of components of the violating set in each iteration.
                              

The proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Appendix B. According to Theorem 2, the decomposition algorithm will strictly improve the objective (9) in each iteration so that it will not cycle. Since the objective function is convex quadratic, the decomposition algorithm is certain to converge to the global optimal solution of (9) in a finite number of iterations.

It is necessary to determine when the optimization algorithm is terminated. The optimal solution to (9) can be found when all variables satisfy the KKT conditions. Thus, we can terminate the decomposition algorithm when V
                           =∅. In fact, this termination criterion is not very efficient because of the slow convergent speed. The objective value would decrease slowly when extending iterations. In this case, it generates more non-zero components for 
                              β
                           . However, these non-zero values are very close to zero, which could be regarded as noises. Therefore, to ensure a fast convergence, we try to only find a good approximate solution to (9). This consideration motivates some possible termination criteria used in the decomposition algorithm. They are listed as follows:
                              
                                 1.
                                 The decomposition algorithm terminates when the number of iterations achieves the predefined maximum number of iterations.

In the first termination criterion, a maximum number of iterations is required to avoid redundant iteration. The second and the third termination criteria are associated with the sequence of objective values. If the change or relative change in the objective function follows below a threshold, then the decomposition algorithm terminates. Similarly, the last two termination criteria are associated with the sequence of solutions. If the change of the solution at the kth iteration is small, then we stop the optimization process.

When the decomposition algorithm terminates, an approximately optimal solution

The proof of Theorem 3 is shown in Appendix C. Theorem 3 shows that the smaller the number of iterations is, the sparser the solution is when p is given.

In order to validate the performance of the decomposition method (DA-SSR), we perform some experiments. All numerical experiments are performed on the personal computer with a 2.93GHz Intel (R) Core (T)2 Duo CPU and 2G bytes of memory. This computer runs on Windows 7, with MATLAB 7.1 and VC++ 6.0 compiler installed.

We compare DA-SSR with the following methods:
                           
                              •
                              Gradient projections for sparse reconstruction (GPSR): Code for GPSR is available at http://www.lx.it.pt/∼mtf/GPSR/. All parameters in GPSR are set to defaults.

Sparse reconstruction by separable approximation (SpaRSA): Code for SpaRSA may be obtained at http://www.lx.it.pt/∼mtf/SpaRSA/. All parameters in SpaRSA are set to defaults.

ℓ1 regularized least squares (ℓ1-LS): Code for ℓ1-LS is available at http://www.standford.edu/∼boyd/l1-ls/. All parameters in ℓ1-LS are set to defaults.

Fixed point continuation method (FPC): Code for FPC is available at http://www.caam.rice.edu/∼optimization/L1/fpc. All parameters in FPC are set to defaults.

In DA-SSR, we need to set some parameters, including the parameters required by termination criteria, the number of components in the working set and the regularization parameter. For termination criteria, let tolW
                        1
                        =10−2, tolW
                        2
                        =10−1, tolB
                        1
                        =10−1 and tolB
                        2
                        =10−2. The maximum iteration number for DA-SSR is set to 1000. Since the cardinality p of the working set has an effect on the convergent speed, the first experiment in the next subsection deals with the selection of p. Here, we take the CPU time as an approximate measure of convergence performance. GPSR, SpaRSA and DA-SSR require the value of τ. In FPC, the regularization parameter is set to 1/τ. For the ℓ1-regularized least squares, the unique minimum is the zero vector [5,8] when τ

We consider the effect of p on the performance of DA-SSR and try to pick a value for it. In this experiment, let n
                        =212 and m
                        =210. In [5], the equivalent dictionary 
                           
                              A

                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                         is generated by first filling it with independent samples of a standard Gaussian distribution and then orthonormalizing the rows. We follow the same way. The sparse signal x contains 160±1 spikes placed randomly, and the observation y is generated according to (4) with σ
                        =0.01. Let η
                        =0.1 in (40), then τ
                        =0.1
                           
                              ‖
                              
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                                 
                                    T

The cardinality p varies from 1 to 20. We generate 100 random data sets of (x, y, A) for each value of p and report the average results. In Fig. 1
                        , we plot the average CPU time on 100 runs vs. the cardinality p. We find a minimum point for CPU time with respect to p. When p
                        =6, the CPU time is 0.0858 seconds. In addition, the values of the average MSE on 100 runs vary from 0.0054 to 0.0062 when p varies. Therefore, the cardinality only has a little effect on the MSE performance. In the following experiment, we set p
                        =6.

Now, we compare the DA-SSR method with other four methods which are GPSR, SpaRSA, ℓ1-LS and FPC. We perform 100 trails, and report the average results in Table 1
                        . By observing on these results, we can see that DA-SSA has a fast reconstructive speed and comparative MSE. In addition, a better reconstruction performance can be obtained by using the debiasing technique for DA-SSR. Two-tailed t-tests with the significant level 0.05 are performed to determine whether there is a significant difference between DA-SSR and other methods. The t-test p-values on the CPU time between DA-SSR and other methods are shown in Table 2
                        . Since these t-test p-values in Table 2 are rather small, DA-SSR is significantly faster than other methods. Fig. 2
                         shows a reconstruction of sparse signal obtained by the DA-SSR method.

Since the computational cost of DA-SSR grows with the number of non-zero component in the sparse signal x, we consider a range of sparseness degrees: the number of non-zero components in x ranges from 5 to 250 instead of 160 in the first experiment. For each sparseness degree, we randomly generate 10 datasets.

Since the CPU time of ℓ1-LS and FPC are much larger than GPSR, SpaRSA and DA-SSR, we do not compare them with DA-SSR in this experiment. The average experimental results are shown in Fig. 3
                        . The CPU time of DA-SSR is almost a linear function of the number of non-zero components. Moreover, DA-SSR has a faster optimization speed than GPSR and SpaRSA in the range of sparseness degrees. The MSE obtained by DA-SSR has the same magnitude order as those obtained by GPSR and SpaRSA. Also, the debiased MSE of DA-SSR is much closer to those of GPSR and SpaRSA.

In the above experiment, τ takes a rather large value. Here, the parameter η of τ takes value from the set {10−6, 5×10−6, 10−5, …, 0.1, 0.5}. Both GPSR and SpaRSA use the continuation trick. For each value of η, we perform 10 runs.

The average CPU time, MSE and debiased MSE vs. η are shown in Fig. 4
                        . Observation on Fig. 4(a) implies that DA-SSR has a faster convergent speed even for small values of τ. The convergent speed of both GPSR and SpaRSA significantly depends on a good starting solution x
                        0 and a small regularization parameter. These two factors have a little effect on DA-SSR where a vector of all zeros is taken as the initial solution. From Fig. 4(a), we can see that τ has much smaller effect on DA-SSR.

Although the MSE performance obtained by DA-SSR is slightly worse than other two methods (note that the MSE performance obtained by three methods achieves the same magnitude order shown in Fig. 4(b)), the debiased MSE of DA-SSR is identical to those of GPSR and SpaRSA (shown in Fig. 4(c)).

This paper deals with a decomposition algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction. The main idea behind the decomposition algorithm is to divide the original QP optimization problem into a sequence of subproblems, which are much easier to solve than the original one. The optimality conditions and the selection of working set are two key issues in DA-SSR, which can guarantee its convergence. Experimental results on the sparse signal length of 212 and the observation length of 210 show that the DA-SSR method has a faster convergent speed than GPSR, SpaRSA, ℓ1-LS and FPC. Specially, DA-SSR can get a fast convergence for small values of the regularization parameter. In addition, DA-SSR has a compared reconstruction performance with these classical methods.

In summary, DA-SSR works well when dealing with small-scale or medial-scale sparse signal. In the case of large-scale signal, DA-SSR may encounter difficulty. It is necessary for DA-SSR to store the matrix A
                     
                        T
                     
                     A. In each iteration, we need submatrices of A
                     
                        T
                     
                     A to generate Q
                     
                        BB
                      and Q
                     
                        NB
                     . So, it is costly and impractical when n is much larger. When n is large, we may break the long signal into smaller segments. DA-SSR can fast reconstruct each small segment. Therefore, we will employ this idea to solve the problem of large-scale sparse signal reconstruction in the future.

                              ∗. In each iteration, we have at most p variables to be optimized. So, we can obtain at most p non-zero components in 
                                 β
                              
                              
                                 B
                              . If the decomposition algorithm terminates after iter iterations, then we have at most p
                              ×
                              iter non-zero components in 
                                 β
                              
                              ∗. Therefore, there are

                                       ⩽
                                       p
                                       ×
                                       iter
                                    
                                 
                              holds.

This completes the proof of Theorem 3.□
