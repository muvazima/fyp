                  This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, called Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), which mimics the social behavior of humpback whales. The algorithm is inspired by the bubble-net hunting strategy. WOA is tested with 29 mathematical optimization problems and 6 structural design problems. Optimization results prove that the WOA algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-art meta-heuristic algorithms as well as conventional methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are becoming more and more popular in engineering applications because they: (i) rely on rather simple concepts and are easy to implement; (ii) do not require gradient information; (iii) can bypass local optima; (iv) can be utilized in a wide range of problems covering different disciplines.

Nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms solve optimization problems by mimicking biological or physical phenomena. They can be grouped in three main categories (see Fig. 1
                     ): evolution-based, physics-based, and swarm-based methods. Evolution-based methods are inspired by the laws of natural evolution. The search process starts with a randomly generated population which is evolved over subsequent generations. The strength point of these methods is that the best individuals are always combined together to form the next generation of individuals. This allows the population to be optimized over the course of generations. The most popular evolution-inspired technique is Genetic Algorithms (GA) [1] that simulates the Darwinian evolution. Other popular algorithms are Evolution Strategy (ES) [110], Probability-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) [111], Genetic Programming (GP) [2], and Biogeography-Based Optimizer (BBO) [3].

Physics-based methods imitate the physical rules in the universe. The most popular algorithms are Simulated Annealing (SA) [4,5], Gravitational Local Search (GLSA) [6], Big-Bang Big-Crunch (BBBC) [7], Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [8], Charged System Search (CSS) [9], Central Force Optimization (CFO) [10], Artificial Chemical Reaction Optimization Algorithm (ACROA) [11], Black Hole (BH) [12] algorithm, Ray Optimization (RO) [13] algorithm, Small-World Optimization Algorithm (SWOA) [14], Galaxy-based Search Algorithm (GbSA) [15], and Curved Space Optimization (CSO) [16].

The third group of nature-inspired methods includes swarm-based techniques that mimic the social behavior of groups of animals. The most popular algorithm is Particle Swarm Optimization, originally developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [17]. PSO is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. It uses a number of particles (candidate solutions) which fly around in the search space to find the best solution (i.e. the optimal position). Meanwhile, they all trace the best location (best solution) in their paths. In other words, particles consider their own best solutions as well as the best solution the swarm has obtained so far. Another popular swarm-based algorithm is Ant Colony Optimization, first proposed by Dorigo et al. [18]. This algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of ants in an ant colony. In fact, the social intelligence of ants in finding the closest path from the nest and a source of food is the main inspiration of this algorithm. A pheromone matrix is evolved over the course of iteration by the candidate solutions.

Other swarm-based techniques are listed in Table 1
                     . This class of meta-heuristic methods started to be attractive since PSO was proven to be very competitive with evolution-based and physical-based algorithms. Generally speaking, swarm-based algorithms have some advantages over evolution-based algorithms. For example, swarm-based algorithms preserve search space information over subsequent iterations while evolution-based algorithms discard any information as soon as a new population is formed. They usually include less operators compared to evolutionary approaches (selection, crossover, mutation, elitism, etc.) and hence are easier to implement.

It is worth mentioning here that there are also other meta-heuristic methods inspired by human behaviors in the literature. Some of the most popular algorithms are Teaching Learning Based Optimization(TLBO) [36,37], Harmony Search (HS) [38], Tabu (Taboo) Search (TS) [39–41], Group Search Optimizer (GSO) [42,43], Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) [44], League Championship Algorithm (LCA) [45,46], Firework Algorithm [47], Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) [48,49], Interior Search Algorithm (ISA) [50], Mine Blast Algorithm (MBA) [51], Soccer League Competition (SLC) algorithm [52,53], Seeker Optimization Algorithm (SOA) [54], Social-Based Algorithm (SBA) [55], Exchange Market Algorithm (EMA) [56], and Group Counseling Optimization (GCO) algorithm [57,58].

Population-based meta-heuristic optimization algorithms share a common feature regardless of their nature. The search process is divided into two phases: exploration and exploitation [59–61]. The optimizer must include operators to globally explore the search space: in this phase, movements (i.e. perturbation of design variables) should be randomized as most as possible. The exploitation phase follows the exploration phase and can be defined as the process of investigating in detail the promising area(s) of the search space. Exploitation hence pertains to the local search capability in the promising regions of design space found in the exploration phase. Finding a proper balance between exploration and exploitation is the most challenging task in the development of any meta-heuristic algorithm due to the stochastic nature of the optimization process.

This study describes a new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm (namely, Whale Optimization Algorithm, WOA) mimicking the hunting behavior of humpback whales. To the knowledge of the present authors, there is no previous study on this subject in the optimization literature. The main difference between the current work and the recently published papers by the authors (particularly GWO [62]) is the simulated hunting behavior with random or the best search agent to chase the prey and the use of a spiral to simulate bubble-net attacking mechanism of humpback whales. The efficiency of the WOA algorithm developed in this research is evaluated by solving 29 mathematical optimization problems and six structural optimization problems. Optimization results demonstrate that WOA is very competitive compared to the state-of-the-art optimization methods.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the Whale Optimization Algorithm developed in this study. Test problems and optimization results are presented and discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively, for mathematical functions and structural optimization problems. Section 5 summarizes the main findings of this study and suggests directions for future research.

In this section the inspiration of the proposed method is first discussed. Then, the mathematical model is provided.

Whales are fancy creatures. They are considered as the biggest mammals in the world. An adult whale can grow up to 30m long and 180t weight. There are 7 different main species of this giant mammal such killer, Minke, Sei, humpback, right, finback, and blue. Whales are mostly considered as predators. They never sleep because they have to breathe from the surface of oceans. In fact, half of the brain only sleeps. The interesting thing about the whales is that they are considered as highly intelligent animals with emotion.

According to Hof and Van Der Gucht [63], whales have common cells in certain areas of their brains similar to those of human called spindle cells. These cells are responsible for judgment, emotions, and social behaviors in humans. In other words the spindle cells make us distinct from other creatures. Whales have twice number of these cells than an adult human which is the main cause of their smartness. It has been proven that whale can think, learn, judge, communicate, and become even emotional as a human does, but obviously with a much lower level of smartness. It has been observed that whales (mostly killer whales) are able to develop their own dialect as well.

Another interesting point is the social behavior of whales. They live alone or in groups. However, they are mostly observed in groups. Some of their species (killer whales for instance) can live in a family over their entire life period. One of the biggest baleen whales is humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). An adult humpback whale is almost as size of a school bus. Their favorite prey are krill and small fish herds. Fig. 2
                         shows this mammal.

The most interesting thing about the humpback whales is their special hunting method. This foraging behavior is called bubble-net feeding method [64]. Humpback whales prefer to hunt school of krill or small fishes close to the surface. It has been observed that this foraging is done by creating distinctive bubbles along a circle or ‘9’-shaped path as shown in Fig. 2. Before 2011, this behavior was only investigated based on the observation from surface. However, Goldbogen et al. [65] investigated this behavior utilizing tag sensors. They captured 300 tag-derived bubble-net feeding events of 9 individual humpback whales. They found two maneuvers associated with bubble and named them ‘upward-spirals’ and ‘double-loops’. In the former maneuver, humpback whales dive around 12m down and then start to create bubble in a spiral shape around the prey and swim up toward the surface. The later maneuver includes three different stages: coral loop, lobtail, and capture loop. Detailed information about these behaviors can be found in [65].

It is worth mentioning here that bubble-net feeding is a unique behavior that can only be observed in humpback whales. In this work the spiral bubble-net feeding maneuver is mathematically modeled in order to perform optimization.

In this section the mathematical model of encircling prey, spiral bubble-net feeding maneuver, and search for prey is first provided. The WOA algorithm is then proposed.

Humpback whales can recognize the location of prey and encircle them. Since the position of the optimal design in the search space is not known a priori, the WOA algorithm assumes that the current best candidate solution is the target prey or is close to the optimum. After the best search agent is defined, the other search agents will hence try to update their positions towards the best search agent. This behavior is represented by the following equations:

                           Fig. 3
                           (a) illustrates the rationale behind Eq. (2.2) for a 2D problem. The position (X,Y) of a search agent can be updated according to the position of the current best record (X
                           *,Y
                           *). Different places around the best agent can be achieved with respect to the current position by adjusting the value of 
                              
                                 A
                                 →
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 C
                                 →
                              
                            vectors. The possible updating position of a search agent in 3D space is also depicted in Fig. 3(b). It should be noted that by defining the random vector (
                              
                                 r
                                 →
                              
                           ) it is possible to reach any position in the search space located between the key-points shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, Eq. (2.2) allows any search agent to update its position in the neighborhood of the current best solution and simulates encircling the prey.

The same concept can be extended to a search space with n dimensions, and the search agents will move in hyper-cubes around the best solution obtained so far. As mentioned in the previous section, the humpback whales also attack the prey with the bubble-net strategy. This method is mathematically formulated as follows:

In order to mathematically model the bubble-net behavior of humpback whales, two approaches are designed as follows:

                              
                                 1
                                 
                                    Shrinking encircling mechanism: This behavior is achieved by decreasing the value of 
                                       
                                          a
                                          →
                                       
                                     in the Eq. (2.3). Note that the fluctuation range of 
                                       
                                          A
                                          →
                                       
                                     is also decreased by 
                                       
                                          a
                                          →
                                       
                                    . In other words 
                                       
                                          A
                                          →
                                       
                                     is a random value in the interval [−a,a] where a is decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iterations. Setting random values for 
                                       
                                          A
                                          →
                                       
                                     in [−1,1], the new position of a search agent can be defined anywhere in between the original position of the agent and the position of the current best agent. Fig. 4
                                    (a) shows the possible positions from (X,Y) towards (X
                                    *,Y
                                    *) that can be achieved by 0≤
                                    A
                                    ≤1 in a 2D space.


                                    Spiral updating position: As can be seen in Fig. 4(b), this approach first calculates the distance between the whale located at (X,Y) and prey located at (X
                                    *,Y
                                    *). A spiral equation is then created between the position of whale and prey to mimic the helix-shaped movement of humpback whales as follows:

                                     and indicates the distance of the ith whale to the prey (best solution obtained so far), b is a constant for defining the shape of the logarithmic spiral, l is a random number in [−1,1], and . is an element-by-element multiplication.

Note that humpback whales swim around the prey within a shrinking circle and along a spiral-shaped path simultaneously. To model this simultaneous behavior, we assume that there is a probability of 50% to choose between either the shrinking encircling mechanism or the spiral model to update the position of whales during optimization. The mathematical model is as follows:

The WOA algorithm starts with a set of random solutions. At each iteration, search agents update their positions with respect to either a randomly chosen search agent or the best solution obtained so far. The a parameter is decreased from 2 to 0 in order to provide exploration and exploitation, respectively. A random search agent is chosen when |
                              
                                 A

                           |<1 for updating the position of the search agents. Depending on the value of p, WOA is able to switch between either a spiral or circular movement. Finally, the WOA algorithm is terminated by the satisfaction of a termination criterion.

The pseudo code of the WOA algorithm is presented in Fig. 6.
                           
                        

From theoretical stand point, WOA can be considered a global optimizer because it includes exploration/exploitation ability. Furthermore, the proposed hyper-cube mechanism defines a search space in the neighborhood of the best solution and allows other search agents to exploit the current best record inside that domain. Adaptive variation of the search vector A allows the WOA algorithm to smoothly transit between exploration and exploitation: by decreasing A, some iterations are devoted to exploration (|A|≥1) and the the rest is dedicated to exploitation (|A|<1). Remarkably, WOA includes only two main internal parameters to be adjusted (A and C).

Although mutation and other evolutionary operations might have been included in the WOA formulation to fully reproduce the behavior of humpback whales, we decided to minimize the amount of heuristics and the number of internal parameters thus implementing a very basic version of the WOA algorithm. However, hybridization with evolutionary search schemes may be the subject of future studies

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The numerical efficiency of the WOA algorithm developed in this study was tested by solving 29 mathematical optimization problems. The first 23 problems are classical benchmark functions utilized in the optimization literature [66–69]. WOA was compared with state-of-the-art swarm-based optimization algorithms. Tables 2–4
                     
                     
                      summarize the test problems reporting the cost function, range of variation of optimization variables and the optimal value fmin
                      quoted in literature. The other 6 test problems considered in this study (see Table 5) regard composite benchmark functions considered in the CEC 2005 special session (see Ref. [70] for the detailed description of the composite functions). These benchmark functions are shifted, rotated, expanded, and combined variants of the most complicated mathematical optimization problems presented in literature [71]. Note that V_no indicates the number of design variables in Tables 2–5
                     . For all the algorithms, a population size and maximum iteration equal to 30 and 500 have been utilized.

Generally speaking, benchmark functions can be divided into four groups: unimodal, multimodal, fixed-dimension multimodal, and composite functions. Fig. 7
                      shows the typical 2D plots of the cost function for some test cases considered in this study. It should be noted that the difference between fixed-dimensional multi-modal functions in Table 4 and multi-modal functions in Table 3 is the ability of defining the desired number of design variables. The mathematical formulations of fixed-dimensional test functions do not allow us to tune the number of design variables, but they provide different search space compared to multi-modal test functions in Table 3. It is also worth mentioning here that the composite test functions provide challenging test functions by shifting the global optimum to random positions before each run, locating the global optimum on the boundaries of the search spaces occasionally, and rotating the functions using

As Table 5 shows, composite test functions also combine different search spaces of n other primitive test functions by stretching and manipulating their coverage range. It should be noted that σ defines the coverage range of the primitive test functions and λ indicates the stretch/compression level of each of the primitive test functions.

For each benchmark function, the WOA algorithm was run 30 times starting from different populations randomly generated. Statistical results (i.e. average cost function and corresponding standard deviation) are reported in Tables 6
                      and 7
                     . WOA was compared with PSO [17], GSA [8], DE [73], Fast Evolutionary Programing (FEP) [66], and Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) [74]. Note that most of the results of the comparative algorithms are taken from [62].

Functions F1–F7 are unimodal since they have only one global optimum. These functions allow to evaluate the exploitation capability of the investigated meta-heuristic algorithms. It can be seen from Table 6 that WOA is very competitive with other meta-heuristic algorithms. In particular, it was the most efficient optimizer for functions F1 and F2 and at least the second best optimizer in most test problems. The present algorithm can hence provide very good exploitation.

Unlike unimodal functions, multimodal functions include many local optima whose number increases exponentially with the problem size (number of design variables). Therefore, this kind of test problems turns very useful if the purpose is to evaluate the exploration capability of an optimization algorithm. The results reported in Table 6 for functions F8–F23 (i.e. multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions) indicate that WOA has also a very good exploration capability. In fact, the present algorithm always is the most efficient or the second best algorithm in the majority of test problems. This is due to integrated mechanisms of exploration in the WOA algorithm that leads this algorithm towards the global optimum.

Optimization of composite mathematical functions is a very challenging task because only a proper balance between exploration and exploitation allows local optima to be avoided. Optimization results reported in Table 7 show that the WOA algorithm was the best optimizer in three test problems and was very competitive in the other cases. This proves that WOA can well balance exploration and exploitation phases. Such ability derives from the adaptive strategy utilized to update the A vector: some iterations are devoted to exploration (|A|≥1) while the rest to exploitation (|A|<1).

It was observed that WOA's search agents tend to extensively search promising regions of design space and exploit the best one. Search agents change abruptly in the early stages of the optimization process and then gradually converge. According to Berg et al. [75], such a behavior can guarantee that a population-based algorithm eventually convergences to a point in a search space. Convergence curves of WOA, PSO and GSA are compared in Fig. 8
                         for some of the problems. It can be seen that WOA is enough competitive with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms.

The convergence curves of the WOA, PSO, and GSA are provided in Fig. 8 to see the convergence rate of the algorithms. Please note that average best-so-far indicates the average of the best solution obtained so far in each iteration over 30 runs. As may be seen in this figure, the WOA algorithm shows three different convergence behaviors when optimizing the test functions. Firstly, the convergence of the WOA algorithm tends to be accelerated as iteration increases. This is due to the adaptive mechanism proposed for WOA that assists it to look for the promising regions of the search space in the initial steps of iteration and more rapidly converge towards the optimum after passing almost half of the iterations. This behavior is evident in F1, F3, F4, and F9. The second behavior is the convergence towards the optimum only in final iterations as may be observed in F8 and F21. This is probably due to the failure of WOA in finding a good solution for exploitation in the initial steps of iteration when avoiding local optima, so this algorithm keep searching the search space to find good solutions to converge toward them. The last behavior is the rapid convergence from the initial steps of iterations as can be seen in F14, F26, F27, and F28. Since F26, F27, and F28 are the most challenging test beds of this section (composite test functions), these results show that the WOA algorithm benefits from a good balance of exploration and exploitation that assists this algorithm to find the global optima. Overall, it seems the success rate of the WOA algorithm is high in solving challenging problems.

As a summary, the results of this section revealed different characteristics of the proposed WOA algorithm. High exploration ability of WOA is due to the position updating mechanism of whales using Eq. (2.8). This equation requires whales to move randomly around each other during the initial steps of the iterations. In the rest of iterations, however, high exploitation and convergence are emphasized which originate from Eq. (2.6). This equation allows the whales to rapidly re-position themselves around or move in spiral-shaped path towards the best solution obtained so far. Since these two phases are done separately and in almost half of iterations each, the WOA shows high local optima avoidance and convergence speed simultaneously during the course of iterations. However, PSO and GSA do not have operators to devote specific iterations to exploration or exploitation. In other words, PSO and GSA (and any other similar algorithms) utilize one formula to update the position of search agents, which increase the likeliness of stagnation in local optima. In the following sections the performance of WOA is verified on more challenging real engineering problems.

In this section, WOA was tested also with six constrained engineering design problems: a tension/compression spring, a welded beam, a pressure vessel, a 15-bar truss, a 25-bar truss, and a 52-bar truss.

Since the problems of this section have different constraints, we need to employ a constraint handling method. There are different types of penalty functions in the literature [76]: static, dynamic, annealing, adaptive, co-evolutionary, and death penalty. The last penalty function, death penalty, is the simplest method, which assigns a big objective value (in case of minimization). This process automatically causes discarding the infeasible solutions by the heuristic algorithms during optimization. The advantages of this method are simplicity and low computational cost. However, this method does not utilize the information of infeasible solutions that might be helpful when solving problems with dominated infeasible regions. For the sake of simplicity, we equip the WOA algorithm with a death penalty function in this section to handle constraints.

The objective of this test problem is to minimize the weight of the tension/compression spring shown in Fig. 9
                         
                        [77–79]. Optimum design must satisfy constraints on shear stress, surge frequency and deflection. There are three design variables: wire diameter (d), mean coil diameter (D), and number of active coils (N). The optimization problem is formulated as follows:

This test case was solved using either mathematical techniques (for example, constraints correction at constant cost [77] and penalty functions [78]) or meta-heuristic techniques such as PSO [80], Evolution Strategy (ES) [81], GA [82], improved Harmony Search (HS) [83], and Differential Evolution (DE) [84], and Ray Optimization (RO) algorithm [13].

Optimization results of WOA are compared with literature in Table 8
                        
                        . A different penalty function constraint handling strategy was utilized in order to perform a fair comparison with literature [85]. It can be seen that WOA outperforms all other algorithms except HS and DE.


                        Table 9 also includes the average, standard deviation, and number of analysis by three of the algorithms over 30 runs. Note that we have utilized 10 search agents and a maximum number of 500 iterations to solve this problem. This table shows that the WOA algorithm outperforms PSO and GSA in average and requires less number of analyses (function evaluation).

The objective of this test problem is to minimize the fabrication cost of the welded beam shown in Fig. 10
                         
                        [82]. Optimization constraints are on shear stress (τ) and bending stress in the beam (θ), buckling load (Pc), end deflection of the beam (δ). There are four optimization variables: thickness of weld (h), length of the clamped bar (l), height of the bar (t), and thickness of the bar (b). The mathematical formulation of the optimization problem is as follows:

This optimization problem was solved by Coello [86] and Deb [87,88] with GA while Lee and Geem [89] utilized HS, Mahdavi et al. used an improved HS [83], RO was employed by Kaveh and Khayatzad [13], and Kaveh and Mahdavi solved this problem using CBO [49]. Richardson's random method, Simplex method, Davidon–Fletcher–Powell, Griffith and Stewart's successive linear approximation are the mathematical approaches adopted by Radgsdell and Philips [90]. Optimization results given in Table 10
                         indicate that WOA converged to third best design.


                        Table 11
                         contains the statistical results of some of the algorithms over 30 independent runs. We have utilized 20 search agents and a maximum number of 500 iterations to solve this problem. It may be observed in this table that WOA again shows better performance in average. In addition, this algorithm needs the least number of analyses to find the best optimal design.

In this problem the goal is to minimize the total cost (material, forming and welding) of the cylindrical pressure vessel shown in Fig. 11
                        . Both ends of the vessel are capped while the head has a hemi-spherical shape. There are four optimization variables: the thickness of the shell (Ts
                        ), the thickness of the head (Th
                        ), the inner radius (R), the length of the cylindrical section without considering the head (L). The problem includes four optimization constraints and is formulated as follows:

This test case was solved by many researchers with meta-heuristic methods (for example, PSO [80], GA [79,82,91], ES [81], DE [84], ACO [92], and improved HS [83]) or mathematical methods (for example, Lagrangian multiplier [93] and branch-and-bound [94]).

Optimization results are compared with literature in Table 12
                        . WOA was the third most efficient optimizer after ACO and DE. However, we found that the ACO violated one of the constraints. Therefore, it can be stated that the WOA is able to find the second best feasible optimal design for the pressure vessel design problem.

The statistical results of some of the algorithms when solving the pressure design problem are presented in Table 13
                        . We have used 20 search agents and a maximum number of 500 iterations to solve this problem. According to the results in this table, once more, the WOA outperforms the PSO and GSA algorithms. In addition Table 13 shows that the WOA finds the best optimal design with the least number of function evaluations.

This problem is a discrete problem, in which the objective is to minimize the weight of a 15-bar truss. The final optimal design for this problem should satisfy 46 constraints such as 15 tension, 15 compression, and 16 displacement constraints. There are also 8 nodes and 15 bars as shown in Fig. 12
                        , so there is the total number of 15 variables. It also may be seen in this figure that three loads are applied to the nodes P1, P2, and P3. Other assumptions for this problem are as follows:

We solve these three cases using 30 search agents over 500 iterations and present the results in Table 14
                        . Since this problem is a discrete problem, the search agents of WOA were simply rounded to the nearest integer number during optimization.


                        Table 14 shows that the WOA algorithm is able to find a similar structure compared to those of HPSO, SOS, and MBA. This shows that this algorithm is able to provide very competitive results in solving this problem as well. In addition, the number of function evaluations of WOA ranks second after the MBA algorithm.

This problem is another popular truss design problem in the literature. As may be seen in Fig. 13
                        , there are 10 nodes of which four are fixed. There are also 25 bars (cross-sectional areas members), which are classified in 8 groups as follows:

Member stress limitations for this truss are shown in Table 15
                        . The 25-bar truss is subject to two leading conditions as listed in Table 16.
                        
                     

This problem has been solved in the literature in both binary [95,96,99–102] and continuous [103–108] version. We solve the continuous version of this problem to have a different problem than that of the previous and next subsections. We solve this problem using 30 search agents over 500 iterations and present the results in Table 17.
                        
                     


                        Table 17 shows that the best optimal weight obtained by WOA is 544.608 which is better than other algorithms. The results of average and standard deviation also show that WOA outperforms all the other algorithms except CSP. However, WOA requires substantially less number of analyses than CSP to find the best optimal design.
                     

This problem is another popular truss design problem with discrete variables. As may be seen in Fig. 14
                        , there are 52 bars and 20 nodes of which four are fixed. The truss has 52 bars, which are classified in the following 12 groups:

We again employ 30 search agents over 500 iterations for solving this problem. Similarly to 15-bar truss design, the search agents of WOA were simply rounded to the nearest integer number during optimization since this problem is a discrete problem. The results are summarized and compared to several algorithms in the literature in Table 19.
                        
                        
                     

According to Table 19, inspecting the results in this table, the best optimal weight obtained by WOA is 1902.605 which is identical to the optimal weights found by SOS and MBA. Also, the WOA requires the least number of function evaluations when solving this problem. It is evident from the results that WOA, SOS, and MBA significantly outperformed PSO, PSOPC, HPSO, and DHPSACO.

Since the WOA algorithm is a novel optimization paradigm, the study of the main internal parameters of this algorithm such as number of search agents, maximum iteration number, and the vector a in Eq. (2.3) would be very helpful for the researchers who is going to apply this algorithm to different problems. Therefore, we solve the 52-bar truss design problem with varying these parameters as follows:

                           
                              •
                              Number of search agents (n): 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80, 100

Maximum iteration number (t): 50, 100, 500, or 1000

Vector a: linearly decreases from 1 to 0, 2 to 0, or 4 to 0

To be able to illustrate the effect of these parameters on the performance of the WOA algorithm, three independent experiments are done by simultaneously varying n and t, n and a, or t and a. The 52-bar truss problem is solved 54 (6*4+6*3+4*3) rounds by WOA with different values for n, t, and a. For every WOA with different parameters, we have run it 10 times on the problem to be able to calculate the average weight and reliably compare the results. After all, the results are illustrated in Fig. 15.
                     

This figure shows that that the best values for n and t are equal to 100 and 1000, respectively. These results are reasonable because the larger number of search agents and maximum iterations, the better approximation of the global optimum. For the parameter a, it seems that the linear decrement from 2 to 0 results in better results. Other values give worse results because they either merely/less emphasize exploitation or exploitation.

As summary, the results of the structural design problems revealed that the proposed WOA algorithm has the potential to be very effective in solving real problems with unknown search spaces as well.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study presented a new swarm-based optimization algorithm inspired by the hunting behavior of humpback whales. The proposed method (named as WOA, Whale Optimization Algorithm) included three operators to simulate the search for prey, encircling prey, and bubble-net foraging behavior of humpback whales. An extensive study was conducted on 29 mathematical benchmark functions to analyze exploration, exploitation, local optima avoidance, and convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. WOA was found to be enough competitive with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristic methods.

In order to gather further information, six structural engineering problems (i.e. design of a tension/compression spring, design of a welded beam, design of a pressure vessel, design of a 15-bar truss, design of a 25-bar truss, and design of a 52-bar truss design) were solved. WOA was very competitive with meta-heuristic optimizers and superior over conventional techniques.

Binary and multi-objective versions of the WOA algorithm called, respectively, Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm and Multi-Objective Whale Optimization Algorithm are currently under development.
