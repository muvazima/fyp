                  In this study, we discuss linear orders of intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs). Then we introduce an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic average operator. Some fundamental properties of this operator are investigated. Based on the introduced operator, we propose a new model for intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attributes decision making. The proposed model deals with the degree of membership and degree of nonmembership separately. It is resistant to extreme data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the theory of fuzzy sets was introduced by Zadeh (1965), there have been a number of studies carried out both in the theoretical as well as practical areas. An important generalization of the fuzzy sets in the sense of Zadeh are intuitionistic fuzzy sets(IFS) introduced by Atanassov (1986). Unlike “classical” fuzzy set, an IFS A does not require that the sum of the degrees of membership and nonmembership of an element to A equals one. In other words, an IFS allows for a degree of hesitation. Notice that the IFS was reintroduced by Gau and Buehrer (1993) under the name of vague sets. Bustince and Burillo (1996) pointed out that vague sets are in fact IFSs.

Fuzzy sets theory has been applied successfully to many fields including multi-attribute decision making (MADM) (Barrenechea, Fernandez, Pagola, Chiclana, & Bustince, 2014; Chakrabortty, Pal, & Nayak, 2013; Dubois & Prade, 1980; Huang, Zhuang, & Li, 2013; Pedrycz, 2014; Xu & Da, 2002; Yager, 1988). In some real-world situations, decision makers are faced with a facet of hesitation and as a result some evaluations can be conveniently realized with the use of IFSs. For example, in a voting process, we witness approvals, rejections and abstentions. To deal with these situations, some authors employed similar methods used in fuzzy MADM problems. For example, some well-known aggregation operators, such as the weighted arithmetic (geometric) average operators and the ordered weighted arithmetic (geometric) average operators, have been generalized to the intuitionistic fuzzy environment (Xu, 2007; Xu & Yager, 2006; Yang & Chen, 2012). However these operators exhibit a common drawback: they are easily affected by some extreme data.

The main objective of this paper is to develop a new model for MADM problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, which is not easily affected by extreme data. The organization of the paper is as follows. After summarization of some previous results about IFSs (in Section 2), in Section 3, we discuss the linear orders for IFVs. It introduces a linear order—we use Szmidt and Kacprzyk’s (Szmidt & Kacprzyk) order to distinguish two IFVs whenever Atanassov’s order does not work. It is proved in this section that the introduced order is equivalent to the lexicographical one. Section 4 introduces a weighted arithmetic average operators, and then develops a new model for intuitionistic fuzzy MADM problems. We apply the proposed model to a real-life problem in Section 5. Section Section 6 delivers some conclusions.

In this section, we briefly recall some essential ideas concerning intuitionistic fuzzy sets.

From the above observations, we conclude that the IFWA operator is easily affected by extremely large values of data, while the IFWG operator is easily affected by extremely low data. To overcome this shortage, Beliakov et al. (2011) (see also Xia, Xu, & Zhu (2012)) introduced averaging operators for IFVs by using a continuous Archimedean t-norm and its dual t-conorm.

                     Notice that this operator was discussed in Xu and Yager (2009), and also introduced in Chen and Tan (1994). This operator can be obtained by computing the weighted arithmetic means of the membership degree and the nonmembership degree, respectively. Similarly, we can introduce the following operator (although it is sensitive for extreme data), which we will call it the intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo weighted geometric average operator (IFPWG), by computing the weighted geometric means of the membership degree and the nonmembership degree, respectively. That is, we have

One of the crucial problems in the context of decision making (when the IFVs are used) is the ranking of IFVs. Atanassov (1999) proposed an order for IFVs:

                              〉
                           
                           ,
                           β
                           =
                           
                              〈

                                 v
                                 2
                              
                              〉
                           
                        
                      be two IFVs. We say that α ≤ 
                        A
                     
                     β if both u
                     1 ≤ u
                     2 and v
                     1 ≥ v
                     2.

Unfortunately, ≤ 
                        A
                      is just a partial order. In order to apply IFVs to decision making, a linear(total) order is desired. There are several total orders of IFVs available in the literature (see Liu & Wang, 2007, for example). Here we recall the orders proposed by Bustince, Fernandez, Kolesárová, and Mesiar (2013a), Chen and Tan (1994), Hong and Choi (2000) and Szmidt and Kacprzyk (2009).


                     Bustince et al. (2013a) introduced the admissible order of intervals, see also Bustince, Galar, Bedregal, Kolesárová, and Mesiar (2013b). By using L([0, 1]), we denote the set of all closed subinterval of [0, 1]. A binary relation ⪯ on L([0, 1]) is an admissible order if it is a linear order and [a, b]⪯[c, d] whenever a ≤ c and b ≤ d. It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Θ and L([0, 1]):

                        
                           
                              
                                 〈
                                 u
                                 ,
                                 v
                                 〉
                                 ↪
                                 [
                                 u
                                 ,
                                 1
                                 −
                                 v
                                 ]
                                 ,
                              
                           
                        
                     so we can translate corresponding results from L([0, 1]) to Θ. For example, a binary relation ⪯ on Θ is an admissible order if it is a linear order and 〈u
                     1, v
                     1〉⪯〈u
                     2, v

                           . If α, β cannot be distinguished by Atanassov’s order ≤ 
                              A
                           , then they can be distinguished by the above order R.
                        

Suppose ≤ 
                              A
                            cannot distinguish α, β. There are two cases: u
                           1 > u
                           2, v
                           1 > v
                           2 and u
                           1 < u
                           2, v
                           1 < v
                           2. From (3.2) we can see that if u
                           1 > u
                           2, v
                           1 > v
                           2 then R(α) < R(β) which means α is better. Similarly, for the other case, β is better.□

By Proposition 3.1, we know that the following order of Θ is an admissible one.

                        Definition 3.2
                        Let α, β ∈ Θ. We say that α ≤ β if one of the following two statements holds:

                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    α ≤ 
                                       A
                                    
                                    β;


                                    α, β is incomparable under ≤ 
                                       A
                                    , but R(α) ≥ R(β).

Interesting enough, we can prove the following result.

                        Proposition 3.3

                           is a lexicographical order.
                        

Let

                                 ,
                                 
                                    v

                                 〉
                              
                           . Without loss of generality, we can suppose that u
                           1 ≥ u
                           2.

If u
                           1 > u
                           2, there are two cases. Case (i): If v
                           1 ≤ v
                           2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α > β. Case (ii): If v
                           1 > v
                           2 then Atanassov’s order does not work. By (3.2), it holds that R(α) < R(β), again α > β.

If 
                              
                                 
                                    u

                                 =
                                 
                                    u
                                    2
                                 
                                 ,
                              
                            there are also two cases. Case (i): If v
                           1 ≤ v
                           2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α ≥ β. Case (ii): If v
                           1 > v
                           2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α < β.

From the above analysis we can see, if the first component can distinguish two IFVs then we use the first one to distinguish them, otherwise we use the second one to distinguish them. That is to say, the order is a lexicographical one.□

Although the above-mentioned orders are admissible ones, the following examples show that all of them are sensitive for small changes of the components in some cases.

                            then by the lexicographical order we have α
                           5 > α
                           4 > α
                           3 > α
                           2 > α
                           1. If we use the order based on the score and accuracy functions, then we have α
                           5 > α
                           4 > α
                           3 > α
                           2 > α
                           1 in both cases.

Let us analyze why these orders are sensitive for small changes of the component. Every IFV can be regarded as a point of the real plane R
                     2, thus Θ is a subset of R
                     2. Notice that the natural order of R
                     2 is only a partial one. For the subset Θ, the natural order is Atanassov’s order. In decision making problems we should build a linear order based on this partial one. Thus, no matter what kind of order we use, we will encounter the same situations.

To see both orders in a better perspective it is worth returning to the results presented in Examples 3.4 and 3.5. First, the stability of the results obtained in Example 3.4 is not the only advantage of the lexicographical order. Even more important is the result obtained. It is difficult just to agree for the ranking resulting from the order based on the score and accuracy, namely, that 
                        
                           
                              α

                      should be ranked higher than 
                        
                           
                              α

                           =

                     . Certainly, if we wish a decision with the highest risk then α
                     1 is better. In fact, neither α
                     1 nor α
                     5 are not good alternatives (the same concerns all the rest of alternatives considered in the Example 3.4). However, it is difficult to agree that alternative α
                     1 with lower membership value (equal to 0.1 whereas membership value of α
                     5 is higher and equal to 0.5) and with a higher hesitation margin π (where 
                        
                           π

                     1 whereas π for α
                     5 is lower and equal to 0.06) should be accepted as a better alternative.

The results (ranking) obtained in Example 3.4 speak in favor of the lexicographical order.

In the first part of Example 3.5 we have the same situation as in Example 3.4. The lexicographical order ranks 
                        
                           
                              α

                           =

                              ,
                              0.7
                              〉
                           
                        
                      as a better one than 
                        
                           
                              α
                              5
                           
                           =
                           
                              〈
                              0.2
                              ,
                              0.3
                              〉
                           
                        
                      because the membership value of alternative α
                     1 (equal to 0.24) is bigger than the membership value of alternative α
                     5 (equal to 0.2), and the hesitation margin of α
                     1 (equal to 0.06) is lower than the hesitation margin of α
                     5 (equal to 0.5). It is worth stressing here that Definition 3.2 (ii) was applied to obtain the result. However, if we use the order based on the score (accuracy is not taken here into account), the order is opposite - alternative with lower membership function and higher value of the lack of knowledge is ranked higher (less positive aspects and higher risk are ranked better which is not easy to accept).

In the second part of the Example 3.5 we have all the alternatives with the same membership values (equal to 0.2), and with different non-membership values. The same membership values mean that we consider the situation on the border of the subset of R
                     2 where Atanassov’s order is natural, and the set where the Atanassov’s order does not exist. As for the equal membership values we should make use of Definition 3.2. (i) (opposite to the first part of the Example 3.5 where part (ii) was applied), the order we obtain by the lexicographical order changes. However, if we assumed that on the border of both areas still Definition 3.2. (ii) should be applied, we would obtain the same order as previously, i.e. α
                     1 > · · · > α
                     5 ranking higher the alternatives with higher membership values and lower hesitation margins.

The advantage of the lexicographical order (in the absence of Atanassov’s order) is that the alternatives with the lower hesitation margin are pointed out as the better ones. There is not such a clear rule when using the order based on the score and accuracy functions. Next, for the order based on the score and accuracy often only score is taken into account which may produce counterintuitive results (alternatives with lower membership values and higher hesitation margin are pointed out as the better ones - see Example 3.4).

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

In the literature, the averaging operators are defined using a single weight vector. This means that the degree of membership is considered as important as the degree of nonmembership. But in some situations the importance of the degree of membership may differ from that of the degree of nonmembership.

Let us consider the following situation:

The UN Security Council votes on a certain resolution. The Security Council has five permanent members and ten non-permanent members. According to the rule, the resolution will be passed if two thirds of the members voted in favor and no permanent members voted against. A resolution would not be passed even 14 members voted in favor as long as a permanent member voted against. On the other hand, a resolution would be passed even six non-permanent members voted against, as long as the other members voted in favor. From this fact we know that, when voting in favor each permanent member as well as each non-permanent member has a weight of 
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 15
                              
                              ,
                           
                         but when voting against each permanent member has a weight of 
                           
                              1
                              5
                           
                         and each non-permanent member has a weight 0.

Let us describe this fact by using intuitionistic fuzzy sets. We use ⟨1, 0⟩, ⟨0, 1⟩ and ⟨0, 0⟩ to denote an affirmative vote , a dissenting vote and an abstention vote, respectively. We use

                           ). Moreover, A
                           1 performs not very well with regard to other criteria. So, it seems counterintuitive if we choose A
                           1 as the best one.

In this paper, we have proposed a new model for intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attributes decision making. This model is based on an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic average operator with respect to two weight vectors. This model is not easily affected by extreme data and can deal with the degree of membership and the degree of nonmembership separately. To compare the candidates, we use the lexicographical order and the one based on the score and accuracy functions. For further investigations we propose to consider the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted arithmetic average operator with respect to two weight vectors.
