                  In multi-agent systems, stereotypical trust models are widely used to bootstrap a priori trust in case historical trust evidences are unavailable. These models can work well if and only if malicious agents share some common features (i.e., stereotypes) in their profiles and these features can be detected. However, this condition may not hold for all the adversarial scenarios. Smart attackers can show different trustworthiness to different agents and services (i.e., launching context-correlated attacks). In this paper, we propose CAST, a novel Context-Aware Stereotypical Trust deep learning framework. CAST coins a comprehensive set of seven context-aware stereotypes, each of which can capture a unique type of context-correlated attacks, as well as a deep learning architecture to keep the trust stereotyping robust (i.e., resist training errors). The basic idea is to construct a multi-layer perceptive structure to learn the latent correlations between context-aware stereotypes and the trustworthiness, and thus can estimate the new trust by taking into account the context information. We have evaluated CAST using a rich set of experiments over a simulated multi-agent system. The experimental results have successfully confirmed that, our CAST can achieve approximately tens of times higher trust inference accuracy in average than the competing algorithms in the presence of context-correlated attacks, and more importantly can maintain a much better trust inference robustness against stereotyping errors.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In multi-agent systems, trust is a vital element and can be used to ensure the security and quality of service. Each agent (i.e., a trustor) can assign a trust value to another (i.e., trustees) based on the trustor’s direct experiences on the trustee in the past (i.e. direct historical trust evidences). The trust can be later used to evaluate the possibility whether the trustee will perform particular services as expected by the trustor in the future [1]. That is, trust is a subjective concept and is with respect to a trustor agent, a trustee agent and a particular service the trustor expects the trustee to perform. All of the three constitute a trust context. In general, the trust is established through historical evidences in one context and can only be reused to evaluate future behaviors within the same context [1–5].

When direct historical evidences are not available in a context, bootstrapping a priori trust for such context is quite challenging. In open and dynamic multi-agent systems, new agents and services may join at any time [5]. These newcomers are necessarily suffering from evidence unavailability. To address this issue, a typical solution is to respect trust recommendations from other trustor agents (i.e., advisors) [6], which is known as a reputation method. However, this method cannot work well in case the trustee is a newcomer (i.e., all the agents do not have experiences on the newcomer and thus cannot do any recommendations). To bridge this gap, stereotypical trust modelling has been proposed [7,5]. The idea is to “borrows” the trustworthiness from similar trustee agents through their visible features (i.e., stereotypes), such as the agents’ geographical location/timezone [7] or their organization and performance indices [5].

Although the stereotypical trust modelling can bootstrap a priori trust for the contexts with new trustees, they cannot cover all the initial cases (e.g., both the trustor and the trustee are newcomers or the service is new), and even worse cannot make an accurate and robust a priori trust inference in the presence of sophisticated adversarial scenarios. In particular, most of the existing stereotypical algorithms can only model stereotypes for the trustees [7,5,8–10]. They have not considered which services the trustees offer and which trustors the trustees serve, and thus fail to capture the malicious patterns when the attackers use different trustworthiness to serve different trustors with different services (i.e., performing context-correlated attacks). Moreover, existing stereotypical trust models have not well addressed the robustness problem (i.e., trust accuracy against stereotyping errors), hence being very difficult to be applied to practical scenarios (in practice, benign agents may set incorrect features due to ignorance or mistakes; adversarial agents may display false features for some malicious purpose, or attack the trust management system itself and thus mislead the system giving high level of trustworthiness to malicious agents [11]).

We list the main research problems we have to conquer in this paper as follows.

                              How to avoid context-correlated attacks when inferring trust using stereotypical models?

How to maintain the robustness of stereotypical trust modelling in the presence of stereotype errors?

To solve the two aforementioned problems, we propose CAST, a new Context-Aware Stereotypical Trust deep learning architecture to extend existing solutions to a complete framework. In contrast to existing stereotypical trust models which only consider stereotypes (visible features) for trustees, we consider stereotypes from context’s perspective. That is, given a target context, we generate context-aware stereotypes from other contexts where either the trustor or the trustee or the service or a group of them is different. We have seven this kind of stereotypes in total and list them in Fig. 1

                         has modelled for the same target (case ③) or a different service (case ⑤) or agent (case ⑥) or the pair (case ⑦), through the visible features from different agents and services.

CAST is novel in two aspects. First, CAST can be considered as a generalization and extension of previous research, and can cover a comprehensive set of initial cases. For example, existing trustee stereotype is just the case ②, while the reputation method could be covered by the case ③or ④(in case the stereotypical information is ignored). Second, each of the seven stereotypes in our CAST can capture a unique kind of malicious patterns that are correlated to the context. For example, if a malicious trustee treats different trustors differently (i.e., discrimination attack), such patterns can be recognized by the context-aware stereotype ③in Fig. 1. But if the malicious one provides different services with different qualities (i.e., service selection attack), the stereotype ①plays the key role. Moreover, if an attacker combines the two, we should rely on ⑤for detection.

In the design of CAST, we apply a deep learning architecture [12] for trust stereotyping. The deep model deploys a multi-layer perceptive structure [13,14] to mimic a human’s perception and decision making process [15]. It can be trained by learning context-aware stereotypes from the contexts with enough direct historical evidences (i.e., evidence-dense contexts or labelled samples), and later used to estimate a priori trust for the contexts without enough direct historical evidences (i.e., evidence-sparse contexts or test cases). We choose the deep model here since such model can maintain sufficient robustness against training errors. Even if some evidence-dense contexts involve inaccurate or incorrect stereotype information, the deep model can still work well for trust stereotyping.

We summarize the key research contributions we have made in this paper as follows.

We have applied a deep learning architecture to maintain robustness for stereotypical trust modelling.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first review related works and point out the novelty of our work in Section 2. We then design CAST with context-aware stereotypes in Section 3 and the deep model in Section 4. After evaluating CAST in Section 5, we conclude the paper in Section 6.

In this section, we review state-of-the-art a priori trust inference methods in the literature. We discuss the open problems of existing methods and thereby motivate the new design.

In general, a priori trust inference is required when direct historical trust evidences are lacking (here, we do not consider the trust from social relationships [16,17] and the pre-trusted third parties [18]). One of the most popular solutions is the reputation methods [19–23], by which the trustor agent will respect the recommendations from some trustworthy advisors to build up initial trust for the same trustee agent with the same service. Although these reputation methods may have some minor differences in their design (e.g., the works [19,21] may consider the trust is transitive and some others [22] may not), they share the basic idea: trustor agents can infer the trustworthiness for a given target by consulting some trustworthy advisors who have direct experiences to the target.

Although the reputation methods have dominated the research domain for more than two decades, they all cannot bootstrap the trust when the trustees are newcomers. This issue has not been resolved until stereotypical trust models [7,5,24,8–10] appeared. On the one hand, StereoTrust [7] is perhaps the first work that introduced stereotypical models for a priori trust inference (case ②in Fig. 1). It proposed a grouping method to build a membership function for trustees’ visible features and then used this function to calculate the trustworthiness for the new trustees. Fang et al. [8] generalized StereoTrust with fuzzy theory. On the other hand, Burnett et al. [5,9] applied a classification and regression tree (e.g., M5 tree) to learn from existing trustees through their visible features and then used the tree to infer a priori trust for the new ones (case ②in Fig. 1). Although Burnett et al. have realized that trustee stereotypical models cannot work if the trustors are newcomers, and have designed a stereotypical reputation method (partially case ⑥in Fig. 1)) to address this issue, they have still overlooked that the trustors and the advisors may be treated differently by the trustees even if the advisors are trustworthy enough. Moreover, the work [24] has discussed how to discover more stereotypical sources to model trust in multi-agent systems and pointed out the importance of stereotypes (i.e., visible features) from the trustors (case ③in Fig. 1). However, that work [24] has not designed any practical stereotyping algorithms for trustors. In the most recent research, Sensoy et al. [10] proposed a graph extraction algorithm to mine a rich set of available features for stereotypical trust modelling. But unfortunately, their mining method is still restricted to trustees’ profiles (case ②in Fig. 1).

In contrast to state-of-the-art stereotypical trust models [7,5,24,8–10], our CAST goes beyond in two aspects. One is the use of context-aware stereotypes, and the other is learning the context-aware stereotypes using a deep model. More precisely, CAST extends the available sources of stereotypes from trustees to trust contexts which consist of the trustors, the trustees and the services. With this extension, our CAST can naturally generalize existing reputation methods and stereotypical models to a complete framework and thereby is able to detect context-correlated attacks (e.g., discrimination attack, service selection attack or both). CAST also applies a deep architecture [14] for stereotypical trust modelling. As one of the most promising artificial intelligent techniques, the deep model has been proved effective in a broad set of application fields, including but not limited to image and video processing [25], speech recognition [26] and natural language processing [27] and so on. Following these successful experiences, we introduce the deep model, specifically the deep belief network [12], to solve the stereotypical trust inference problem for the first time.

The deep model is a good approximation of human’s neocortex [13,14], while the stereotypical trust inference is a typical human perception and decision making process [28,15]. The use of a deep model to solve the stereotypical trust inference problem is nature and meaningful. Moreover and more importantly, our deep model can outperform the grouping method [7] and the classification tree [5,9], because it can abstract the stereotypes in a perceptive manner layer by layer and thus can better represent the latent joint distribution between the stereotypes and trustworthiness, even if the training set (i.e., evidence-dense contexts) contain incorrect and/or inaccurate stereotypical trustworthiness samples. In another word, the deep model can achieve a more robust trust stereotyping than existing algorithms. Note that, we have confirmed this finding through carefully designed experiments in Section 5.4.

                         with the help of other evidence-dense contexts. The basic idea is to learn a supervised model from evidence-dense contexts to capture the latent correlations between the trustworthiness and visible features, and then use this model to infer a priori trust for the evidence-sparse contexts. Since visible features play the role as a mould to convey trust information, we also call them stereotypes. In this paper, our innovative design is to consider stereotypes with respect to the trust contexts. We let Fn and Fs be the set of visible features (i.e., stereotypes) for the agents and services, respectively.

We differentiate the seven context-aware stereotypes in our design, because they can preserve more precise discriminative information to correlate the visible profiles of agents and services with the potential trustworthiness. By this way, our solution can detect not only the malicious patterns shown in trustee’s profile but also the smart adversaries who hide their patterns among trustors, trustees and the services (i.e., context-correlated attacks).

It is worth noting that, if we infer a priori trust based on evidence-dense contexts from

                        . Many existing trust models, such as [20,23], can accurately model the trustworthiness of advisors from which R can be chosen.

To infer a priori trust for a given evidence-sparse context, we can train seven individual inference models based on the seven different kinds of evidence-dense contexts. In each training phase, the trustworthiness (from evidence-dense contexts) is the label and the value vector of context-aware stereotypes are the model inputs. We then use the seven models one by one to infer the trustworthiness of the target evidence-sparse context. We select the minimal value of outputs as the final result, because the lower value reported from the model on

As can be seen, the while loop (from line 3 to line 7) traversals all the seven kinds of evidence-dense contexts given a target evidence-sparse context. Inside the loop, the code in line 4 is used to train an inference model using one kind of context-aware stereotype samples, while the code in line 5 is to use the trained model to infer a new trust for the target, and meanwhile keep the smallest inferred trust as the final output. It is worth noting that, we implement the InferModel in the algorithm using a deep architecture [12] in this paper.

As a key step, a priori trust inference algorithm should implement a function (i.e., the InferModel in Algorithm 1) to map context-aware stereotypes to trustworthiness. In this paper, we choose the deep learning model, particularly the deep belief network (DBN) [12], for this task due to two reasons. First, DBN is a probability generative model without any a priori assumption. It can learn the empirical samples layer by layer and eventually can discover more latent informative probabilities which can hardly be achieved by other learning algorithms (such as the group methods and the classification tree). Second, despite the DBN requires the labelled samples to fine tune the whole model, it has a pre-training phase which is aimed to reconstruct layer-wise connections using restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). RBM is built with Gibbs sampling in order to utilize unlabeled samples for the training. The Gibbs sampling is a typical Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which can obtain a sequence of samples from a specified and practical sample set [29]. This algorithm is able to re-construct a target sample set (e.g., the training set) to approximate the real distribution, and can therefore lead the deep model to a much better robustness against sampling errors in the training set (i.e., the set of evidence-dense contexts).

In general, a deep belief network (DBN) consists of an input layer 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    H

                         in the bottom, several hidden layers 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    H
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                         in the middle and a label layer L on the top. Each of two adjacent layers are fully interconnected, while the units in the same layer are disconnected. By this design, the units in each layer can independently interact with the units in their adjacent layers. This architecture can well simulate the physical structure of the human’s neocortex.

In this paper, we design a new stereotypical DBN model to suit our trust inference problem. In particular, we build a meaningful deep architecture with three hidden layers, each of which aims to take a particular task from initial impressions to the final decision-making. We choose three hidden layers, because such design can well reason about the human’s brain and has many successful applications in solving real-world problems [12,30]. We present the overview of our architecture in Fig. 2
                        .

In this model, we use the first hidden layer

                         to simulate a human’s “initial impression” about the stereotypes. That is, given an object, a human will quickly skim all the visible features of this object in order to establish a first-hand impression. We deploy

                        , we use it to mimic a human selecting significant stereotypes for decision-making based on his/her logical thinking. Although there may exist a numerous stereotypes associated to a trust context, only a few are significant and effective to characterize the context. This phenomenon follows real-life scenarios, where humans can abstract significant features to make a rational decision. As a result, we set

For example, many online rating systems (such as Epinions and Amazon) restrict their users to rate products in 10 levels (from 1 star to 5 stars with each step in 0.5 star). Moreover, to mimic humans’ divergent thinking to some extent, we use 10 hidden nodes to represent each trust level and thus involve 100 hidden nodes in

In multi-agent systems, the agents’ and services’ features (i.e., stereotypes) may have diverse value ranges and types. In order to input the values from different stereotypes, we should normalize them at first. As the deep model is designed to accept quantitative data only, we consider two typical quantitative data value types: discrete values and continuous values [31]. To normalize discrete-valued stereotype, we can directly convert them to a binary vector, where the size of the vector is the logarithm (based on 2) of possible values of this feature. For example, if a feature has 10 candidate values, the length of the vector is 
                           
                              ⌈
                              
                                 
                                    log
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              10
                              ⌉
                              =
                              4
                           
                        . In case the stereotype takes the 2nd candidate value, we can convert it to 0010. For the continuous-valued stereotypes, we can discrete them using a segmentation method. The segmentation criterion can be set according to the value distribution of each continuous-valued stereotype. To sum up, we formalize the input normalization process as follows.

After the structure of the lower layer is determined, we reconstruct the upper layer and the layer-wise connections between the two adjacent layers using a restricted Boltzmann machines.

We repeat Step 2 until all the layer-wise connections are constructed.

We fine-tune the whole deep model using the labelled samples

To determine how long the Markov chain is deserved (i.e., determining the t), we refer to a contrastive divergence algorithm [34], which can take a small t (typically take 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              1
                           
                        ) to run the chain by referring a difference between two Kullback–Leibler divergences. The Kullback–Leibler divergence is a typical measure of the information loss when one probability distribution is used to approximate another [35]. The authors [34] chose the Kullback–Leibler divergence in their design in order to ensure the minimized information loss when the Markov chain is constructed. By doing so, we can calculate the derivative of

                         respectively. Our model uses the same values for the momentums and learning rates as the typical deep learning method [32] used.

As described in Section 4.2, the RBM reconstruction is an unsupervised learning progress and thus cannot utilize the labelled samples. To avoid this issue and make a full utilization of the labelled samples in our learning process, we implement a supervised mean-field posterior approximation algorithm through back-propagation [12]. This method can fine-tune the deep model with labelled samples (i.e., evidence-dense contexts). The tuning goal is to minimize the model error by further optimizing the parameter 
                           
                              θ
                              =
                              (
                              W
                              ,
                              o
                              ,
                              u
                              )
                           
                         from the label layer back to the input layer (down-pass). The model error can be measured in terms of a cross-entropy between the probability distribution of the true trustworthiness and that of the inferred trustworthiness. The cross-entropy is a typical measure that can be used to calculate the average number of error bits when one distribution is used to approximate another [36]. In our CAST, we can calculate the cross-entropy as

In particular, we first prove the effectiveness of context-aware stereotypes against context-correlated attacks. We then validate the effectiveness of our deep architecture in making our stereotypical trust model robust. We also evaluate the performance overheads of CAST at the end.

In our experiments, we simulate a multi-agent system with

                         agents from N as trustworthy advisors, and consider that each agent can trust the recommendations from these advisors with an equal belief. We set 100 visible features (i.e., stereotypes) in each agent’s profile and 20 features in each service’s profile. Each feature contains a binary value (the same value setting is used in [5]).

Moreover, we simulate context-correlated attacks and investigate whether CAST can make an accurate a priori trust inference against this kind of attacks. Since all the stereotypical trust inference models share a common assumption that they can work if and only if malicious patterns can be expressed in visible features [7,5,8–10], we follow this assumption in our experiments but classify the malicious patterns induced by the context-correlated attacks into seven types (we list them in Table 1
                        ). By this classification, our seven kinds of context-aware stereotypes can capture each type of the malicious patterns one to one. In this paper, we use the malicious pattern to describe the attacking behaviors depending on the contexts. For example, the malicious pattern ①in Table 1 indicates that the attack will happen if and only if the targeted service contains some specific stereotypes (i.e., visible features), while the malicious pattern ②means the attack should be launched according to the trustee’s stereotypes. Further, we sample the posterior trustworthiness

When we have established the ground truth trustworthiness for every trust context, we will simulate one context as a evidence-sparse context and meanwhile assume all the others are evidence-dense. We repeat this simulation by traversing all the contexts as evidence-sparse one time, and measure a priori trust inference accuracy in reverse of a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) [37]. The RMSD is a very popular measure of the differences between the true values and the values predicted by a model. A lower RMSD means a higher trust inference accuracy. In our simulation, we calculate RMSD as

                         could include all the trust contexts in our experiments. In the following of the evaluations, we will run each experiment 100 rounds and show the average RMSD. Without specified explanation, we will simply use RMSD to represent the average RMSD in Figs. 3–5

We acknowledge that there exist another famous error measure, the mean absolute error (MAE) in the literature [37]. Compared with MAE which calculates the average error of a set using the same weight to each sample error in this set, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) can assign a higher weight to a larger sample error when computing the set error [37]. In our problem, we target to infer the trustworthiness through context-aware stereotypes for the agents without enough trust evidences. A higher trust inference error necessarily leads to a higher negative impact when the others relying on the inferred trustworthiness to make a security-related decision. For example, given an agent with the true trustworthiness 0.9, if we incorrectly infer the trustworthiness as 0.89, this 0.01 error could be tolerable. But if we mistakenly infer it as 0.1, such 0.8 error may make a significant security risk with a very high probability. To take into account this weighting requirement, we choose RMSD as the accuracy/robustness measurer in this paper.

As discussed in Section 3, we need to choose a parameter 
                           
                              σ
                              ∈
                              (
                              0
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                         in order to determine the number of hidden units in the second hidden layer, which is designed to model the significant feature selection process. To achieve this goal, we investigate how accurate the trust inference we can make when σ is increased from 0.1 to 1 with 0.1 as the step. In particular, we calculate the RMSD for each tested σ value by considering the seven types of context-correlated malicious patterns one by one and report its mean value in Fig. 4. As can be seen, from case

                        . We thus use this value in the following experiments.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of context-aware stereotypes, we compare our CAST with two state-of-the-art trustee stereotypical trust models [5,7]. In [5], the authors proposed to establish a classification and regression tree, known as M5 tree, to learn from evidence-dense contexts and then use the tree to infer a priori trust for the evidence-sparse contexts. We refer it as M5-tree in our comparison. While in [7], the authors designed a group-based method for trust stereotyping as well as a dichotomy based enhancement. We choose the dichotomy enhancement (referred as D-StereoTrust) in our comparison because this one has better inference performance than its original version. As described in [7], the authors claimed that the D-StereoTrust’s effectiveness mainly relies on how accurate the membership functions can be approximated when grouping stereotypes, but they do not give the details on how to generate an appropriate membership function in their design. Instead, we simply assume the optimal membership function can be obtained in advance and thus can show the best inference performance (i.e., theoretical upper bound) of D-StereoTrust. Note that, we do not need to compare our method with [8,10]. The former one [8] suggested a fuzzy model as the membership functions to approximate the D-StereoTrust’s upper bound performance for trust inference, but we have already assumed the best membership function to show the upper bound. The latter one [10] discussed how to extract more available features from trustees for the trust inference. In our design, we just consider that the set of visible features is readily prepared.

In Fig. 3, we compare CAST with M5-tree and D-StereoTrust against the seven types of context-correlated malicious patterns (listed in Table 1) as well as a mixed malicious pattern which involves the seven kinds of patterns with an equal probability. We append (RP) to M5-tree and D-StereoTrust in Fig. 3(c) and (e)–(h), because these malicious patterns, which indicate the malicious trustee agents launch attacks according to different trustors stereotypes, can only make effects when consulting advisors for trust inference. In these cases, we need to use the stereotypical reputation method [5] in our comparison. The (RP) represents the trustworthy advisors run stereotypical methods such as M5-tree and D-StereoTrust for the target trustees on behalf of the trustors, and finally recommend the results to the trustors. The error rate is the percentage of mis-classified labelled samples in the training set and will be elaborated on in Section 5.4.

As shown in Fig. 3, CAST demonstrates a much higher accuracy (the RMSD keeps in around 1 for all the sub figures) than both the M5-tree and D-StereoTrust (the RMSD is about 45 and 30 respectively, except in the sub Fig. 3(b)). Due to the overlook of context-aware stereotypes, the trustee stereotypical methods (including M5-tree and D-StereoTrust) cannot discover the malicious patterns in Fig. 3(a) and (c)–(h), hence getting a more than 30 times accuracy reduction compared with our design. While for the sub Fig. 3(b), the malicious pattern only appears in trustee’s features and thus can be captured by the trustee stereotypical methods. In this case, our CAST can still make a trust inference with a slightly higher accuracy but the level is much lower than other cases. We will further investigate this case with more details in Section 5.4.

Although Section 5.3 has proved that our CAST can do a much better job to infer a priori trust compared with the state-of-the-art techniques [5,7] which do not take into account context-aware stereotypes, it is still unclear how much benefit we can obtain due to the use of the deep model. We fill this gap in this section. In particular, we purposely introduce modify existing trustee stereotypical models to accept context-aware stereotypes and then compare our deep model with these modified versions using the same set of context-aware stereotypes. In another word, we can use the M5 tree [5] and dichotomy based group method (D-group method in short) [7] to implement the InferModel function in Algorithm 1, and then use these models to compare with CAST which implements the InferModel function using a deep model.

Our comparison is mainly against an error rate which is the percentage of mis-classified labelled samples in the training set. This rate can well reflect a common practical phenomenon where some contexts with malicious patterns may be regarded with a high trustworthiness due to the attacks that are targeted trust management system itself. A stereotypical trust inference model that maintains sufficient accuracy against a higher error rate can be considered with a sound robustness.

We show our results in Fig. 5. As can be seen, in the presence of all the seven types of context-correlated malicious patterns as well as the mixed pattern, our deep model remains in a high accuracy (the RMSD is at around 1 for all the cases), while the accuracy of M5 tree and D-group method decreases sharply (the RMSD grows up at least three times) when the error rate is increasing from 0 to 0.1, despite the M5 tree and D-group method can sometimes have a slightly better result when the error rate is 0. Therefore, we have successfully confirmed that our deep model can achieve a better trust inference robustness than previous solutions.

We analyze the time complexity of CAST (specifically the deep model) as well as evaluate its practical performance overheads in this section. In general, CAST’s time complexity largely depends on the structure of the deep model, such as the number of layers and the number of units in each layer. As described in Section 4, our stereotypical deep model includes five layers: one input layer, three hidden layers and an output layer. As the input layer is for the value vector of context-aware stereotypes, it has

In the training phase, the RBM should run two times of Gibbs sampling for each layer pair and the supervised fine-tuning should run from the output layer back to the input layer one time, each layer-wise connection should be calculated three times. Therefore, we can compute the time complexity of training phase as

                         becomes larger. Moreover, the overheads induced by the training phase is about 3000 times bigger in average than those induced by the inference phase. This is in accordance with our time complexity analysis: the training phase has a

                         times larger complexity than the inference phase.

These performance evaluation results indicate that, our CAST is more appropriate to be run in powerful agents, since the training phase will induce a large delay (around 160s when

                        ). For the lightweight agents, a better solution is to out source the training phase to another powerful third parties (such as a public cloud services) and only run the inference phase in the lightweight agents themselves. We leave a future work for this study.

In this paper, we have proposed CAST, a novel context-aware stereotypical trust model, to address the challenging a priori trust inference problem in the literature. CAST has successfully extended the malicious pattern detection from a trustee’s profiles to a trust context perspective, hence being able to capture context-correlated attacks. This kind of attacks could cause seriously negative effects to a priori trust inference but cannot be well addressed by previous solutions. Moreover, CAST has been designed with a new stereotypical deep model. The use of deep model to solve trust problems is promising, because the deep model can well approximate how a human is reasoning and making decisions with trust. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt that models trust using deep representations. At the end, we have conducted a rich set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of CAST in practical settings. Our design and the experimental results have successfully confirmed that, (1) CAST is the first trust inference solution that can be resist context-correlated attacks and (2) CAST can make a more accurate and robust trust inference with a moderate performance overhead than the state-of-the-art.

In the future, we will attempt to remove the assumptions we have made in our current work. For example, we will design new methods to extend CAST to suit the conditions where trustworthy advisors are not presented. We will also design some stereotype (i.e., feature) authentication mechanism to avoid noise and unreliable profile features. Moreover, we will investigate how to apply CAST to some real multi-agent applications, especially these whose posteriori trust is too expensive to obtain, such as the wireless sensor networks [38] and the Internet of things [39].
