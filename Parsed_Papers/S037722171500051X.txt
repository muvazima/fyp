                  Utility functions have been used widely to support multi-objective decision-making. Expansion of a general additive utility function around the ideal results in a composite linear-quadratic metric of a compromise programming problem. Determining the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric requires substantial interaction with the decision maker who might not always be available or capable to participate in such a process. We propose a non-interactive method that uses information on observed attribute levels to obtain the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric and enables forecasting and scenario analysis. The method is illustrated with a small scale numerical example.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Utility optimization has been used widely in economic literature to support managerial decisions when multiple conflicting objectives are involved (André and Riesgo, 2007; Wallenius et al., 2008). The utility function can be used to articulate the preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) and provide insights in scenario studies and forecasting. In practice, it is difficult if not impossible to obtain the utility’s functional form that represents the actual decision-making process adequately (Ballestero and Romero, 1991). Substantial interaction with the DM is required and often arbitrary assumptions on the utility’s structure are imposed.

Compromise Programming (CP) is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method that focuses on finding the efficient alternative that is closest to an infeasible, ideal solution (Yu, 1973; Zeleny, 1974). Ballestero (2007) showed that Taylor expansion of a general additive utility function around the ideal results in a composite linear-quadratic metric of a CP problem. The proposed composite linear-quadratic metric is independent of the utility’s functional form and equals the weighted sum of linear and quadratic distances to the ideal. The linear component represents the preferences of the DM and is biased towards extreme solutions while the quadratic component represents aversion to imbalance. By adjusting the coefficients of the linear and quadratic components of the composite linear-quadratic metric, the preferential structure (utility) of the DM is articulated. The resulting CP model can be a valuable tool for simulating the behaviour of the DM and for analysing future scenarios.

However, determining the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric might be a challenging process that involves substantial interaction with the DM. The DM might not always be available or capable of participating in such interactive processes (Amador, Sumpsi, and Romero, 1998). To facilitate the interaction with the DM, MCDM methods, which are based on pairwise comparisons, penalty structures and techniques of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), have been used. However, in applications of these interactive methods the exact involvement of the DM is not adequately reported, which makes them (to a certain degree), random and ad-hoc (Jones, 2011). Moreover, in many cases, for simplification, these interactive methods focus only on obtaining the unknown coefficients of the metric h = 1, which corresponds to a linear additive utility structure (André and Riesgo, 2007). This can be a strong assumption far from the actual decision making process because it imposes a constant marginal utility independent of the level of achievement and the distance from the ideal (Romero, 2004). A poor representation or oversimplification of the utility function might result in poor forecasting performance and a CP model incapable of assessing future scenarios.

The objective of this article is to propose a method that uses information on observed attribute levels to determine the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric proposed by Ballestero (2007). The proposed method does not require any interaction with the DM and guarantees exact calibration to the observed attribute levels. The resulting calibrated CP model can be used for forecasting future decisions and scenario analysis.

In Section 2, we summarize how Ballestero (2007) derived a composite linear-quadratic metric from a general utility function and we describe the proposed non-interactive calibration method. In Section 3, the method is illustrated with a small scale example. Section 4 is the discussion and conclusions.

@&#METHODS@&#

The method proposed in this manuscript focuses on calibrating the composite linear-quadratic CP metric proposed by Ballestero (2007) and described in Eq. (4). Before the description of the calibration method we summarize briefly how Ballestero (2007) derived the composite linear quadratic CP metric from a general utility function. To maintain consistency, we use the same notation as Ballestero (2007) throughout this manuscript.

According to Ballestero (2007), the objective function of an extended CP model is given by:

The linear-quadratic composite metric of Eq. (4) has been developed entirely in a general utility framework i.e. no particular type of utility is required (Ballestero, 2007). However, for the practical elicitation of the unknown coefficients aj
                         and bj
                         involvement of the DM and assumptions on a specific type of utility are needed. Moreover, in Ballestero (2007) for simplicity, and to facilitate the parameter elicitation procedure, an equal b value was assumed for all second derivatives. Since there is a relationship between the first and the second derivative of the utility function, different first derivatives (aj
                         parameters) for the different attributes would be expected to result in different second derivatives (bj
                         parameters).

We propose a two-step calibration method that aims to facilitate the elicitation of the unknown parameters (aj
                         and bj
                        ) of objective function (4) without the involvement of the DM and based on a single observation of historical decisions on attribute levels. The proposed method does not require assumptions on the utility’s functional form and guarantees exact calibration to the observed attribute levels.

In the first step of the proposed method, we use temporary calibration constraints to calibrate a linear additive CP model. The dual main variables (shadow prices) of the calibration constraints are used in the second step to quantify the unknown parameters (aj
                         and bj
                        ) of the composite linear-quadratic CP metric (4). The objective function of the linear additive CP model of the first step of the proposed method is:

In model (6)–(9) the preferential weights are decision variables that are determined by minimizing the distance to the observed attribute levels (

The linear additive CP model with objective function (5) results in vertices (corner point solutions) in the decision space and consequently it is often biased towards extreme solutions. As a consequence, results of the linear additive model can be far from the observed attribute levels, especially when aversion to imbalance is important and observed attribute levels correspond to a balanced (non-corner point) solution. The proposed calibration method focuses on determining the unknown coefficients (aj
                         and bj
                        ) of objective function (4) in such a way that exact calibration to observed attribute levels is achieved.

The first step of the proposed calibration method involves the addition of a set of calibration constraints in the linear additive CP model with objective function (5) to fix the optimal solution to the observed attribute levels.

                        where ε is a small positive perturbation that is used to ensure that any binding constraint before adding the calibration constraints remains binding also after the addition of the calibration constraints. The calibration constraints (10) are temporary and they are used to calculate the dual main variables (shadow prices) at the observed attribute levels. Not all calibration constraints are necessarily binding and consequently not all dual main variables are positive.

In the second step of the proposed method, the dual main variables of the calibration constraints (λj
                        ) are used to calculate the unknown parameters (aj
                         and bj
                        ) of objective function (4). From the Kuhn Tucker first order conditions of the two CP problems, with objective function (4) and (5) respectively, follows that if relationship (11) is satisfied the two CP problems result in the same solution and consequently exact calibration is achieved:

For all values of μ ∈ (0...1], exact calibration to the observed attribute levels is guaranteed. Values of μ close to 1 imply aversion to imbalance while values of μ close to 0 imply preference for extreme solutions (additive CP model). The value of μ can affect the sensitivity of the model to changes (i.e. the smaller the value of μ the more sensitive the model becomes) and consequently different values of μ can affect the forecasts of the model.

The non-interactive calibration method is illustrated based on a simple two dimensional multi-objective problem that is solved graphically. The simple multi-objective problem (MOP) has the following algebraic structure:

                     1 and q
                     2 denote the decision variables corresponding to the quantity of two different products. The two attributes involved in the decision-making (x
                     1 , x
                     2) correspond to total profit (more is better) and total energy use (less is better), respectively. In the MOP, the total energy use attribute has been converted to a ”more is better” attribute by multiplying corresponding coefficients with − 1. The ideal and anti-ideal values of each attribute are calculated by optimizing each objective separately:

                     2 = 3). The ideal and anti-ideal values are used to normalize the objective space of the MOP based on Eq. (3). The following additive, linear CP model (LCP) with objective function (5) is created:

                     1 and w
                     2 are the preferential weights corresponding to attributes 1 and 2 respectively. The objective space of the LCP is presented in Fig. 1b. The quantities of the two products (q
                     1, q
                     2), the attribute levels (x
                     1, x
                     2), and the normalized attribute levels (1 − y
                     1, 1 − y
                     2) that correspond to the corner points O, A, B, C and non-corner point D (i.e. observed attribute levels) of Fig. 1b are presented in Table 1
                     .

Because of the linear additive utility structure, and independent of the set of weights w
                     1 and w
                     2, the LCP problem will always result in a corner point solution. Consequently exact calibration to the non-corner point D is not possible. To calculate a set of weights that ensures that LCP results in the corner point solution that is the closest to the observed attribute levels, we solve the following weighted GP problem which refers to models (6)–(9):

The optimal values of the weights w
                     1 and w
                     2 calculated by GP are 0.632 and 0.368 respectively. Optimizing LCP with the estimated weights results in point A of Fig. 1b, which is indeed the corner point closest to the observed attribute levels (point D). The first step of the proposed method is to add temporary calibration constraints (10) in LCP that restrict the normalized objective space and impose exact reproduction of the observed attribute levels (Fig. 1c):

                     where ε is a very small positive number. Based on Fig. 1c the optimal solution is the intersection of the calibration constraint for y
                     1 (i.e. profit) and the line segment OA of the objective space. The calibration constraint for y
                     2 (i.e. energy use) is not binding. The dual main variables which correspond to the calibration constraints of profit and energy use are equal to 0.290 and 0, respectively.

In the second step, the calibration constraints of step 1 are removed and the unknown parameters of the composite linear-quadratic metric (4) are estimated based on the dual main variables of the calibration constraints of step 1 and conditions (12) and (13).

Different values for μ ∈ (0...1] result in different values for parameters aj
                      and bj
                      of the composite linear-quadratic metric. Lower values for μ result in more extreme solutions while higher values for μ result in more balanced solutions. Independently of the value of μ and because of calibration conditions (15) and (16), exact calibration to the observed attribute level is achieved (see Table 2
                     ). Smaller values of μ imply larger values for calibrated parameters a
                     1 and a
                     2 and smaller values for parameters b
                     1 and b
                     2. Implicitly, it is assumed that aversion to extreme solutions has a minor effect in decision-making. The contours of the calibrated composite linear-quadratic metric with μ = 0.1, μ = 0.5 and μ = 1 are presented in Fig. 1d.

The calibrated models were used to forecast a scenario of 20 percent price increase for product 2 (i.e. the total profit attribute becomes x
                     1 = 2q
                     1 + 6q
                     2). Results of the optimizations are presented in Table 3
                     . The response of the model to changes depends on the value of μ. The most extreme solution is calculated with value of μ = 0.01, the quantity of product 2 increases from 3 to 4 units and profit increases by 60 percent but energy use also increases substantially. The optimal solution of the calibrated model with μ = 0.01 is the same as the optimal solution of the linear additive CP model (metric h = 1). By increasing the value of μ, aversion to extreme solutions becomes more important. For values of μ ≥ 0.5, balanced solutions where both objectives are improved simultaneously are preferred. Because of the price increase of product 2, the total profit increases even when the quantity of product 2 (i.e. q
                     2) decreases. Decreasing quantity of product 2, decreases the total energy use.

The proposed method enables non-interactive calibration of linear-quadratic composite metrics for CP that can be used for scenario assessments. This allows applications of CP even in cases where the DM is not available or capable for participating in interactive weight elicitation processes. The method is a direct contribution to the call for tools that can be used to predict decision-making of actors and enables the systematic predictive quantification of economic and environmental systems (Pla, Sandars, and Higgins, 2014). Moreover, it enables behavioural simulation of systems that involve multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives (e.g. supply chains). It provides an objective measurement of the multi-attribute utility of individuals and consequently it can be used to solve problems of coordination and fairness in resource allocation (Hooker and Williams, 2012).

Independently of the level of aversion to extreme solutions, which is related to the value of μ used in calibration conditions (12)–(13), the calibration method guarantees exact reproduction of observed decisions. Forecasting future scenarios results in a limited set of alternative efficient solutions (one for each value of μ). To restrict the set of alternative solutions to a single forecast, a second observation on attribute levels could be used. In that case, the calibrated composite linear-quadratic CP metric is used to forecast this second observation and calculate a set of alternative solutions for different values of μ. The parameters of the composite metric that result in the alternative solution that is closest to the attribute levels of the second observation are used for future scenario assessments. The “closeness” of a solution to the observed attribute levels can be measured with the consistency index (i.e. the average of the ratio: |observed level − forecasted level|/observed level) (Amador et al., 1998). Moreover, the “closeness” of optimal and observed attribute levels can be used in back-testing exercises (where the calibrated model is used to reproduce changes occurred at the past) to provide evidence of the model’s predictive capacity.

In the proposed calibration method, the unknown parameters of the composite metric are recovered based on a single observation of attribute levels which are treated as deterministic information. Uncertainty around the observed attribute levels is not taken into account. In highly uncertain conditions, the proposed deterministic approach might result in parameters of the utility-based linear quadratic composite metric that do not represent adequately the preferences of the decision maker. For such cases, the principles of stochastic goal programming (Aouni, Abdelaziz, and Martel, 2005) can be explored to attach probability distributions on the observed historical decisions that are used for calibration.

In the illustrative example, we assumed that observed decisions that correspond to solutions of the theoretical efficient set are available (or can be calculated). In practice, the observed decisions may not be close to the theoretical efficient set. The reason for this is related either to inefficiency of the DM, or misspecification of the theoretical model (e.g. missing important constraints or objectives), or most probable a combination of both. In applications where large deviations between the observed decisions and the theoretical efficient set occur, the possibility of model misspecification increases. Interaction with the DM might be unavoidable to improve the model to better represent the system and the decision-making process.

Indirect elicitation of non-linear utility functions has been proposed by André and Riesgo (2007) within a Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) framework. The comparative advantage of using non-linear, instead of additive linear, specifications of the utility function for reproducing observed decisions, was clearly demonstrated. However, indirect elicitation of non-linear utility functions requires assumptions on the functional form and good approximation of the efficient set of solutions. The choice of a specific utility structure that represents the actual decision-making is not a trivial process and it can affect the forecasting capacity of the model. A poor approximation of the efficient set influences the capacity of the model to reproduce observed decisions (André, 2009; André and Riesgo, 2007).

The composite linear-quadratic CP metric proposed by Ballestero (2007) is developed based on a general utility framework, without assumptions on the utility’s specific functional form. We propose an objective and reproducible method for eliciting the unknown parameters of this general composite linear-quadratic metric for CP models. The method guarantees exact calibration, which improves user’s confidence in the results of the model. However, the capacity of the utility based linear-quadratic metric to approximate the actual utility of the DM, and the predictive capacity of the model should be evaluated in future applications, back-testing exercises and scenario studies.
