                  Route diversity improves the security of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) against adversaries attempting to obtain sensitive sensor data. By limiting the fraction of data relayed over each link and/or routed through each relay node, route diversity can be achieved, thus, extracting useful information from the network is rendered more challenging for adversaries. Sensor nodes operate with limited energy resources, therefore, energy consumption of security mechanisms is a central concern for WSNs. In this paper we evaluate the energy cost of route diversity for security in WSNs through a novel Linear Programming framework. We characterize energy dissipation and data relaying behaviors of three route diversity techniques to mitigate node capture only, eavesdropping only, and node capture and eavesdropping attacks. Effects of node density, network area, level of resilience, and network topology on energy cost are investigated.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of small form factor devices (nodes) that are instrumented with different types of sensors to carry out certain sensing tasks within a designated operation area. With limited computation and energy resources, nodes are capable of sensing physical phenomena, processing the sensed data, and transmitting the information. Being densely deployed, nodes cooperate with each other to achieve the assigned tasks. For example, cooperation in conveying sensed data towards the base station is achieved using other nodes as relays. Self organization and infrastructureless characteristics of WSNs make them promising solutions for surveillance and control tasks [1,2]. Since WSN characteristics are suitable for utilization in hostile environments, they are invaluable assets for tactical communication and networking in military applications.

Security is a critical issue for WSNs because nodes usually operate unattended and communication takes place in a broadcast medium. A common and successful technique used against eavesdropping is cryptographic encryption. With encryption, sensor data is scrambled using a key to make eavesdropped data unintelligible to anyone who does not possess the key. However there is always a possibility that a single technique may be flawed or cracked (e.g., IEEE 802.11 WEP protocol). Moreover, in WSN sensor nodes can be captured (i.e., node capture attacks) and vital cryptography information such as keys can be extracted from them. If keys are captured, this would render the encryption useless. Eavesdropping attacks are usually unnoticed (i.e., it is challenging to detect a passive attack), thus, these attacks can succeed without encountering any active defense [3]. Layered approach to security and “defense-in-depth” strategy mandate that alternative or complementary techniques be used.

Security can be enhanced by using route diversity (i.e., multi-path routing) which exploits multi-hop characteristics of WSNs by providing multiple paths between the source node and the base station to split data on these paths. Route diversity can be used as a standalone security countermeasure or in conjunction with encryption. While encryption is a good defense against attackers who are already eavesdropping wireless transmission, route diversity makes eavesdropping more difficult in the first place
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        While route diversity can also be useful against denial of service attacks [4], our main motivation in this paper is to study it in the context of data confidentiality.
                      
                     [3]. By splitting data along different paths, an adversary has to capture portions routed through different paths to construct one node's data which requires more effort than extracting information in a single path case. In other words, an adversary needs to spend more resources to collect data from the network if route diversity is implemented.

Lifetime optimization of WSNs is one of the most important functional design objectives because WSNs are envisioned to be operating in hostile and harsh environments where human intervention is risky or costly. In such environments, battery replenishment is not possible or highly challenging. Adding security capabilities to a WSN without considering energy efficiency can lead to inefficient energy dissipation characteristics in the whole network and network lifetime can decrease dramatically. Thus, while enhancing WSN security, energy requirements should not be overlooked.

Our goal in this paper is to investigate the energy impact of route diversity countermeasures in WSNs. There are at least two types of energy overhead route diversity brings. First of these is due to the need to discover, establish, and maintain multiple routes instead of a single route between sensor nodes and the base station. In WSNs consisting of stationary nodes, this is a one-time operation for a substantial amount of time [5], hence, can be ignored. There is a second factor which makes the energy cost of route diversity more than the energy cost of single route paradigm. When data is split into multiple parts and forwarded via multiple routes, it is no longer possible to carry all data in energy-optimal paths. Some portion of the data should be transmitted towards the base station via less efficient paths. In fact, all routes can be sub-optimal from an energy efficiency perspective when compared to a single energy-efficient route. Broadly speaking, we can say that the second factor is more significant than the first one because it is applicable not only for a limited period of network operation but during the entire network lifetime. In other words, since WSNs generally exhibit stationary topology and connectivity behavior, route updates are infrequent. On the other hand, data transport by using multiple paths is a continuous operation spanning the entire network lifetime.

While it is tempting to state that the energy cost of route diversity is high, we are not aware of any clear scientific evidence or convincing analysis to support such a claim. It can also be argued that (with equal lack of convincing scientific evidence) the energy cost associated with route diversity is small and can easily be neglected. Given the fact that without a proper analysis it is not possible to quantify or even give a rough estimate on the energy cost of route diversity, in this paper we make the first attempt to carry out an analysis on this subject by building a framework using Linear Programming (LP). LP is a technique to solve the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function whose variables are required to satisfy a finite set of constraints that are expressed either as linear equalities or linear inequalities. In the context of WSNs, LP approach has previously been applied in many studies to model the unique characteristics of WSNs and to determine the optimal solutions to problems that are specific to WSNs (e.g., [6–15]).

Choosing an LP based analysis method has a number of advantages. One of them is the abstraction from a specific protocol which enables us to investigate energy cost in ideal conditions with optimal routing decisions. Secondly, due to global knowledge in the optimization problem solver, the results can be obtained in an efficient and consistent manner.

In this study, we consider a WSN where nodes have sensitive data to be conveyed to the base station. Data is spread out on multiple paths to mitigate both active and passive attacks. Data flows on these paths are optimized to minimize the overall energy consumption throughout the network. Furthermore, to avoid premature death of any node within the network energy dissipation is evenly balanced throughout the network, hence, the network lifetime is optimized. Within an LP framework, we model the energy dissipation characteristics of route diversity countermeasures against node capture (NCO), eavesdropping (EAO), and both node capture and eavesdropping (NCE) attacks. Using the developed LP models, we evaluate the energy cost of these countermeasures by benchmarking against the energy requirements of unconstrained optimal case.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is presented in Section 2. Security assumptions, threat model, system model, and LP formulations are presented in Section 3. Results of analysis based on LP models are presented in Section 4. The discussion of models, assumptions, analysis and implications of the results, and promising future directions are presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks are made in Section 6.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The literature on multi-path routing is extensive and has grown rapidly in recent years. Providing a comprehensive overview of the published research on multi-path routing is beyond the scope of our work. We refer interested readers to the recent surveys on this topic [16,17]. Nevertheless, we present a brief overview of the literature on multi-path routing by summarizing the studies most related to our work.

We first note that multi-path routing provides several attractive properties other than security such as load balancing, reliability, and quality of service support [16]. Multi-path routing can be used to improve the lifetime of WSNs by enabling balanced energy dissipation throughout the network. Consider the case where each node has a single path to the base station, which leads to energy imbalances throughout the networks (i.e., relay nodes on heavily utilized paths dissipate more energy than the other nodes). Sending data in multiple paths can be used to balance energy dissipation and prevents premature deaths of nodes on certain paths (e.g., minimum-energy path, minimum-hop path). There are several studies which address the problem of imbalanced energy dissipation by designing protocols that use multiple paths (e.g., [18–20]).

As a second note, we state that there are several related concepts in this area which can also be named as multi-path routing and may be confused with the meaning of multi-path routing as it is used in this paper. In this paper, we use the terms multi-path routing and route diversity interchangeably
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        We prefer to use the term “route diversity” in the title because we think it better reflects our focus on security in this paper. For a general discussion on the role of diversity in security, see [21].
                      and refer to splitting the data into parts without employing data redundancy and sending each part via a different path towards the base station. Alternate path routing is different than multi-path routing in the sense that a single path is used in normal operation but alternative paths are kept ready to be used in case the primary path becomes unavailable [22]. Redundant multi-path routing is another related term that means the data to be conveyed to the base station is transported via multiple paths with added redundancy (e.g., multiple replicas of the data is sent on different paths). From security point of view, adding redundancy is useful for enhancing resilience against denial of service attacks [4].

Important problems in multi-path routing research include discovering multiple paths, selecting a number of paths among them, and distributing load across these selected paths [17]. In the following paragraphs, we provide brief summaries of some exemplary protocols which focus on one or more of these problems in the context of security and by considering attack resistance property.

In [23], the problem of data distribution across multiple paths is studied with the aim of minimizing the maximum damage when a single link attack occurs in the network. The solution is formulated as a maximum-flow problem that can be solved in a distributed fashion.

In [24], a secure method for choosing multiple paths and distributing data among these paths is presented. The design objective is to minimize the percentage of captured data by an adversary. Each path is assigned with a security parameter that identifies the past performance on reliable data delivery. According to these parameters, multiple paths are constructed and data is distributed among these paths using min–max optimization and game theory.

In [25], an on-demand secure multi-path routing protocol is proposed to protect communication against collaborating malicious nodes. The protocol includes two phases. The first phase achieves neighbor node authentication by Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In the second phase, node-disjoint paths are found between source and destination nodes.

In [26], data is divided into parts and encrypted combinations of these are sent on different paths. Two of the paths are used for signaling and key sharing, thus, at least three paths between source and destination nodes are required. For dividing the message, a channel coding technique is used.

A protocol named H-SPREAD is presented in [27], which is built on SPREAD protocol [28]. H-SPREAD provides security and reliability by using redundant path routing together with secret sharing schemes. Secret sharing is adopted for splitting data over multiple paths so that even if a certain number of paths are eavesdropped, secrecy of data is not compromised.

Up to now, we review the literature on multi-path routing in WSNs. We complete this section by presenting a brief overview of the literature on the application of LP in WSNs. There are many problems in WSNs studied within a mathematical programming framework hence in the following paragraphs we limit ourselves to the most relevant prior work.

In [6], the maximum lifetime routing problem is formulated as an LP problem and it is shown that minimum energy routing is not suitable for optimum utilization of energy. In [29], a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework is proposed to investigate the optimal number of routing paths in multi-path routing to minimize energy consumption in WSNs. In [7], a general LP model for evaluating and maximizing the lifetime of WSNs is proposed. By using the observation that mostly many-to-one traffic pattern occurs in WSNs, it is shown that nodes close to the base station consume more energy compared to other nodes and this creates hot spots near the base station. Mitigating the problem of hot spots using different deployment strategies is investigated. In [8], a comparison of two multi-hop routing schemes (the first maximizes the minimum lifetime of the nodes and the second minimizes total energy dissipation) through an LP framework is presented. In [9,10], both topology insensitive lifetime bounds and topology sensitive lifetime bounds with specified topologies are derived. The formalism of feasible role assignments is a key concept utilized in the derivations. It is shown that a class of role assignment problems can be transformed into LP models. In [11], the impact of limiting the numbers of incoming and outgoing links on network lifetime is investigated through a Mixed Binary LP framework. The results of this study show that if there are at least three incoming and outgoing links then the decrease in network lifetime is negligible. In [12], the problem of coverage optimization through scheduling for WSNs used to control and monitor industrial and manufacturing processes under energy dissipation constraints is considered. A MIP formulation is constructed and techniques to decompose the problem into separate subproblems to reduce the complexity are proposed. In [13], lifetime limits of WSNs improving contextual privacy by transmit range control are analyzed using LP. In [15], the network restoration problem in multi-hop multi-channel wireless networks under jamming attacks is investigated. An LP based formulation is developed to model restoration schemes under jamming attack.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study that investigates the energy cost of route diversity for security in WSNs within an LP framework.

Our main goal in this paper is to investigate the minimum energy requirements for transferring data via multiple paths in WSNs purported as security enhancement strategies against node capture and eavesdropping attacks. In this section we formulate the system model with the objective function (minimization of energy dissipation) and three sets of problem constraints leading to route diversity for resistance against node capture and/or eavesdropping attacks. The threat model we use in this study is presented first in the following subsection.

In our model, we consider a WSN consisting of a base station and a number of sensor nodes distributed over an operation area. Sensor nodes generate data that must be sent to the base station possibly by using other nodes as relays. The goal of the attacker is to capture the sensitive data (e.g., surveillance images) collected by some specific target node(s). The attacker aims at obtaining the complete data or a high portion of it.
                           3
                        
                        
                           3
                           If, under other assumptions, an attacker only needs to get a small portion of data, then route diversity could be a weakness as it spreads data throughout the network.
                         He is not in a physically close location to the target sensor node(s). However he is in proximity to the WSN so that he can attempt to obtain the data either by passively eavesdropping the links and/or by actively capturing the relaying nodes. We assume the base station is physically well-protected. Attacker's physical location and which sensor nodes are specifically targeted by him are not known. We further assume that the attacker is not capable of compromising all of the nodes and cannot listen to the whole network.

Protecting the confidentiality of the sensor data against such a threat is conventionally achieved by encryption. For WSNs, encryption can be implemented either in link layer (i.e., hop-by-hop encryption) or in upper layers (i.e., end-to-end encryption).

Link layer encryption when applied to WSNs has the following problem. Sensor nodes are deployed in an unattended environment and do not include strong tamper resistance hardware, hence, they are vulnerable to node compromise [30]. Once nodes are compromised, vital cryptography information such as keys can be extracted from them. If nodes convey all their data by using a single path then the attacker can capture the complete data coming from a particular sensor node by compromising any single node used as a relay.

Data encryption in general has other implementation difficulties when applied to WSNs. Firstly, key establishment, an essential service for all cryptographic schemes, has scalability problems [30]. Secondly, sensor nodes have limited computation and energy resources, thus, especially public key encryption which could ease the key management problem may not always be a viable option.

Regardless of whether or which encryption approach is adopted, multi-path routing proves itself as an effective countermeasure [3]. As shown in Fig. 1
                        , an attacker can capture the complete data by eavesdropping on a single link or by compromising a single node when all data is routed through the same path. On the other hand, multi-path routing enables the flow of data from a sensor node to the base station through multiple paths between them (see Fig. 2
                        ). Each sensor node spreads its data out to multiple paths so that the attacker needs to spend more resources to collect the data (i.e., he has to listen to more links or he has to capture more nodes). Within this threat model, the security goal is to make it more difficult to obtain the sensitive data. We assume that attack costs are additive as in [3] (i.e., capturing R nodes and eavesdropping K links are R times and K times more difficult than capturing a node and eavesdropping a link, respectively). We defer discussion of alternative attack cost models to Section 5.

Based on this threat model, our goal is to assess the energy cost of different multi-path routing countermeasures. Previously, a number of studies investigated the energy cost of data encryption in WSNs [31–33].

In our system model, energy consumption of sensor nodes is dominated by communication energy rather than sensing and processing energy dissipations.

                           4
                           For example, communication energy dissipation constitutes 91% of the total energy dissipation in Telos sensor nodes [34].
                         We adopt a widely accepted energy model used in many studies
                           5
                        
                        
                           5
                           We emphasize that LP formulations we present in this paper can easily be tailored to any other energy model.
                         
                        [6,7,9,10,5]. In this model, the amount of energy to transmit one bit of data is E
                        
                           tr,ij

                         and to receive one bit of data is E
                        
                           rc
                        
                        
                           B
                        
                        =
                        ρ, where ρ represents the energy dissipated in the electronic circuitry, ε denotes the transmitter efficiency, α represents the path loss exponent, and d
                        
                           ij
                         is the distance between node-i (transmitting node) and node-j (receiving node).

In our framework, there is a single base station. We assume that time is organized into rounds. Each sensor node-i creates the same amount of data (s
                        
                           i
                        ) at each round to be conveyed to the base station.

Data generated at each node terminates at the base station either by being transferred directly (single hop) or through other nodes acting as relays (multi-hop). The network topology is represented by a multiple edge directed graph G
                        =(V,
                        A). V is the set of all nodes, including the base station as node-0. We also define set W which includes all nodes except node-0. A

                        i,
                        j):

                        ∈
                        W,

                        i} is the set of edges. Note that there are multiple directed edges between nodes.

The definition of a set of edges in a graph representing a network, usually, is a subset of V
                        2 (flows are represented as f
                        
                           ij
                         instead of f
                        
                           ij
                        
                        
                           k
                        ). We explain the reason of our uncommon edge definition as follows. In our LP model, the flows originated at different source nodes should be identifiable at each relay node in order to be able to assert constraints working separately on each source's data. Hence, the set of edges used in our framework is a subset of V
                        3 (data generated at node-k flowing from node-i to node-j is represented as f

We define a node-limit variable (L
                        
                           node

                           k
                         must be satisfied for each k independently). We assume link and node-limits are effective throughout the whole network. All system variables with their acronyms and descriptions are presented in Table 1
                        .

In this subsection we present a novel LP model which forms the base for the rest of our formulations. In the subsequent subsections, extensions of the base model by adding other constraints are presented. The optimization problem for minimizing the maximum energy requirement of the sensor nodes (battery) is presented in Fig. 3
                        .

Eq. (1) states that all flows are non-negative. Eq. (2) is used to eliminate infinite loops — there cannot be a flow from a node to itself. Eq. (3) states that all data originated at node-i is routed out to the rest of the network including the base station. Eq. (4) states that when a node (node-i) is relaying data of another node (node-k) the sum of all node-k's data flowing into node-i (either directly from node-k or via other relay nodes) equals to the sum of all node-k's data flowing out of node-i (either directly to the base station or to other relay nodes). Note that Eq. (4) must be satisfied at each node for all other nodes excluding the base station (in total there are N
                        −2 constraints to be satisfied at each node excluding node-0). Eq. (5) is used to determine the number of packets required to convey the flow on edge (k,
                        i,
                        j). Eq. (6) and (7) give the total energy dissipation of node-i for reception and transmission, respectively. Note that energy dissipation for packet overhead is also accounted for transmission and reception. Packet retransmissions due to packet errors are modeled with λ parameter which is related to the packet error rate (χ) by λ
                        =1/(1−
                        χ). Eqs. (8) and (9) are used to compute the total amount of time spent for reception and transmission at node-i, respectively, by diving the total amount of bits (payload and overhead) transmitted and received by node-i to the channel bandwidth (ξ). By subtracting the sum of reception time and transmission time from the duration of a round (t
                        
                           rn
                        ), total sleep time (t
                        
                           sl,i
                        ) is obtained (Eq. (10)) and the total sleep energy is obtained by multiplying sleep power (P
                        
                           sl
                        ) and total sleep time (Eq. (11)). Eq. (12) states that for all nodes except the base station energy consumed for transmission, reception and sleep is equal to or less than the energy stored in batteries. Energy dissipation for idle listening or overhearing in promiscuous mode is considered negligible. There are many intelligently designed MAC protocols for WSNs that avoid the energy waste in these modes [35]. We assume such a MAC layer is used.

Eq. (13) is used to assign equal energy to each sensor node. Since the objective is to minimize battery, our problem is the minimization of the maximum battery requirement of the nodes in the network by finding the values of f
                        
                           ij
                        
                        
                           k
                        's that satisfy the constraints and minimize the energy consumption. To minimize the maximum energy dissipation, all nodes dissipate their energies in a balanced fashion in this model.

To take channel bandwidth limitations into consideration in a broadcast medium, we need to determine interfering flows for each node. Total interference time for node-i (t
                        
                           if,i
                        ) due to the transmissions of other nodes is computed by using Eq. (14). Interference function (I
                        
                           jl
                        
                        
                           i
                        ) is presented in Eq. (16). If node-i is in the interference region of the transmission from node-j to node-l, then the value of interference function for node-i (I
                        
                           jl
                        
                        
                           i
                        ) takes the value of total amount of bits carried from node-j to node-l, otherwise it is zero. Generally speaking, interference range is equal to or greater than transmission range (i.e., γ
                        ≥1). This means depending on the value of γ, node-j's transmission to node-l can interfere with node-i even if the distance between node-j and node-l is less than the distance between node-j and node-i.

Eq. (15) states that the total time for transmission, reception, and interference at node-i cannot be larger than the duration of a round. In other words, for all nodes including the base station the aggregate rate of incoming flows, outgoing flows, and interfering flows is upper bounded by the channel bandwidth. This constraint is a modified version of the sufficient condition given in [36].

In this subsection, we extend the base LP model described above by introducing an additional constraint that limits the amount of flow passing through each node so that Node Capture Only (NCO) attacks are mitigated. When deployed in hostile environments, sensor nodes are vulnerable to node capture attacks. If captured node is used as a relay then data coming from other nodes can be obtained. Even if the data is encrypted, an adversary can use cryptographic keys in the captured node to decrypt it back if encryption is implemented in the link layer.

If all sensor nodes only relay at most a fraction of the data of other nodes, then without capturing multiple nodes it is not possible to construct data pertaining to other sensor nodes. To model such a limitation for each node we introduce a node limit variable (L
                        
                           node
                        ), which is a fraction of s

                        . The amount of data originated at any node-i and flowing into any relay node cannot be more than L
                        
                           node
                        . We call L
                        
                           node
                        
                        =
                        s

                        /R limit as R-degree-node-resilience (i.e., at least R nodes need to be captured to construct any sensor node's data). Note that the total amount of data relayed by any sensor node can be larger than L
                        
                           node
                         because the limit works for separate sources' data independently. In this model, only the node capture attacks are considered. The optimization problem for minimizing the maximum energy requirement of the sensor nodes (battery) is constructed by augmenting Eq. (17) to the base LP framework presented in Fig. 3.

                           node
                        . We point out the impossibility to put a node-limit constraint on a node for its own data. In other words, an attacker who captures a node always obtains all data generated by that node. However, in most cases such an attack would not be meaningful because if the attacker is capable of capturing the node he can also collect the node's sensitive data directly from the environment (e.g., with his own camera).

In this subsection, we extend the base LP model described earlier by introducing an additional constraint that limits the amount of flow passing over each link so that Eavesdropping Only (EAO) attacks are mitigated. If encryption is infeasible or broken, or there is a leak of the key, an eavesdropper may try to capture as much sensitive data as possible by passively listening to the links without any active attempt to capture nodes. Since sensor nodes relay data of other nodes, an eavesdropper can capture data coming from targeted sensor node(s) by listening only to a single link if necessary countermeasures are not in effect. If each node splits its data into multiple parts routed through different paths so that on any link only a fraction of the data is sent, then an effective countermeasure against an eavesdropper is implemented.

In our second LP formulation we restrict the amount of data on each link by setting a limit (L
                        
                           link
                        ). This formulation is most appropriate for the case when the cost of eavesdropping multiple links is equal to the sum of listening to each of these links. If attack costs are not additive, then alternative link limit formulations should be preferred (see Section 5).

Our objective is again minimization of required energy for each node (battery), now subject to the constraints presented in Fig. 3 plus Eq. (18).

                                 A
                              
                           
                        
                     

Eq. (18) states that the maximum amount of node-k's data that can be sent over a link between any two nodes is limited by L
                        
                           link
                        . Thus, even if an eavesdropper can listen to a link between two nodes, he can capture at most a limited (L
                        
                           link
                        ) amount of node-k's data. Unlike the NCO case, since eavesdropping attacks can be conducted without being physically close to the attacked node, we put L
                        
                           link
                         constraint for all links without any exception (links of source nodes are also constrained).

The link limit value (L
                        
                           link
                        ) is a fraction of s
                        
                           i
                        . If L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /K, then by eavesdropping to a single link an adversary can capture at most 1/Kth of any source node's data. Therefore, we call L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /K limit as K-degree-link-resilience due to the fact that any adversary needs to capture data from at least K links to construct any node's complete data.

The toy example used earlier for NCO is also useful to grasp the basic idea behind the EAO framework (see Fig. 5
                        ). The optimal flow distribution without any L
                        
                           link
                         or L
                        
                           node
                         restriction is presented again in Fig. 5(a). If L
                        
                           link
                         constraint is not in effect (L
                        
                           link
                        
                        →∞), an attacker can capture all of node-2's data and more than half of node-3's data by listening only to the link between node-1 and node-2.

None of the links carry more than 50.0% and 33.3% of the data generated at any node for L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /2 and L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =

                           i
                        /3, respectively. As link-limit becomes more stringent, maximum energy requirement increases (e.g., normalized energy requirements for L
                        
                           link

                        /2, and L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /3 are 1.00, 1.88, and 3.96, respectively). In contrast to NCO, the link constraint in EAO applies to the data generated and directly transmitted to the base station, leading to reverse flows (data flowing away from the base station). This is the main reason for the significantly higher energy overhead of EAO in comparison to the overhead of NCO.

As our third and last model, we extend the base LP model by considering a stronger notion of security in the presence of both Node Capture and Eavesdropping (NCE) attacks. We call L
                        
                           node

                        s

                        /R,
                        L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /K limit as R

                        K-degree-joint-resilience (an attacker can get at most L

                         amount of s

                         of other sensor nodes by capturing any one of the sensor nodes). Our objective in the NCE case is also to minimize the maximum energy requirement of sensor nodes (battery), now subject to the constraints presented in Fig. 3 combined with both Eqs. (17) and (18). To restrict the amount of data on any link and on any node Eqs. (17) and (18) are used together.

In our toy example if both L
                        
                           node
                         and L
                        
                           link
                         constraints are in effect, all flows and maximum energy requirements are identical with the EAO case shown in Fig. 5 due to the fact that link-limit completely dominates energy-efficient optimal routing behavior in this topology. Observe that the optimal flows for EAO satisfying L
                        
                           link

We use GAMS [37] for numerical analysis of LP models.

                        The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a language compiler and integrated high-performance solvers. GAMS is used widely for complex, large scale modeling applications.
                      Two topologies are used in our analysis: 1-Dimensional (1-D) line topology and 2-Dimensional (2-D) square topology. In line topology, nodes are placed equidistantly over a line with an inter-node distance of 10m and the base station is placed at one end of the line. In square topology, nodes are randomly placed within a square shaped area of predetermined size and the base station is located at the center. The number of deployed nodes is varied between 10 and 125 nodes. We investigate the square topology further by varying the network size. Different values of L
                     
                        link
                      and L
                     
                        node
                      are used to characterize different route diversity behaviors. The parameters used in the analysis are presented in Table 2. The communication parameters are the same as the ones used in [7]. For random deployment scenarios, each problem is solved for 100 times (i.e., 100 independent random topologies are generated for the same parameter set) and the results are averaged. Rather than presenting the absolute energy dissipation values, we opt to present the percentage increase in the energy dissipation when compared to a network with the same parameters (network size, number of nodes, topology, etc.) without any restriction defined by link-limit or node-limit (L
                     
                        link
                     
                     →∞,
                     L
                     
                        node
                     
                     →∞).

In this subsection we analyze the energy overhead of route diversity countermeasures against NCO attacks as a function of the number of nodes, network size, and node-limit in line and square network topologies. In Fig. 6
                         the variation of energy overhead for different L
                        
                           node
                         values is presented as a function of the number of nodes in a line network. Limiting the amount of data that can be relayed through a node (limit imposed by L
                        
                           node
                        ) does not put any restriction on nodes sending all their data directly to the base station. Therefore, the increase in energy overhead is mainly due to the nodes which are farther away from the base station and convey their data by multi-hop relaying. Hence for all L
                        
                           node
                         values the energy overhead increases as network size gets larger.


                        Fig. 7
                         shows the variation of energy overhead as a function of number of nodes for different L
                        
                           node
                         values in a 400m×400m square network. As the number of nodes increases (leading to higher node density), the energy overhead decreases (except the increase from 10-node to 20-node when L
                        
                           node
                        
                        ≤
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /4).

The optimal operation of low density networks when L
                        
                           node
                         constraint applies results in sending most of the data directly to the base station. As the node density increases, the adverse effects of L
                        
                           node
                         constraint on energy dissipation reduce because of the availability of increased number of links in the network. To put it into more precise terms, L
                        
                           node
                         constraint prevents the network from taking full advantage of the optimal energy efficient routes, thus, it leads to extra energy dissipation. When more energy balancing routes are available in higher density networks, satisfying the L
                        
                           node
                         constraint with less energy overhead becomes possible.

In the 20-node network, the trade-off between sending data directly to the base station and sending data cooperatively towards the base station to reduce the effects of L
                        
                           node
                         constraint is more visible. It is a better choice to send data cooperatively towards the base station for L
                        
                           node
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /2 and L
                        
                           node

                           i
                        /3. In these cases, the energy overhead of the 20-node networks is less than the energy overhead of the 10-node network. On the other hand, for L

                           node
                         constraints. As a result, for these cases the energy overheads in the 20-node network are higher than the energy overheads in the 10-node network.


                        Fig. 8
                         presents the energy overhead as a function of L

                         in a 400m×400m square network with 75, 100, and 125 nodes. Energy overhead decreases as the level of resilience decreases. As the number of nodes increases while the network area is kept constant the energy overhead decreases because the network with higher number of nodes has more routing options to balance the energy dissipation and mitigate the effects of L
                        
                           node
                         constraint. Hence, higher node density networks organize flows more efficiently (i.e., with less energy overhead) against the pressure induced by node-limit constraints. For example, the energy overheads of 75-, 100-, and 125-node deployments for 2-degree-node-resilience (i.e., L
                        
                           node
                        
                        =

                           i
                        /2) are 0.78%, 0.45%, and 0.34%, respectively, whereas for 32-degree-node-resilience, the energy overheads of 75-, 100-, and 125-node deployments are 120.00%, 87.00%, and 54.61%, respectively.


                        Fig. 9
                         shows the energy overhead as a function of the network area for different L
                        
                           node
                         values. The number of nodes in the network is kept constant as 100. For L
                        
                           node
                        
                        →∞, the percentage of data sent directly to the base station decreases as the area increases. Since in the NCO case there is no limit on the amount of data directly sent to the base station (i.e., L
                        
                           link
                         constraint is not in effect), for smaller network areas deviation from the optimal flows is less. For example, in the 100m×100m network L
                        
                           node
                         restriction does not apply for approximately 70% of the generated data which is sent directly to the base station. For larger networks, the percentage of direct transmissions to the base station is lower and more deviation from the optimal flows (because of L
                        
                           node
                         limit) results in higher energy overheads.

In this subsection we explore energy overhead characteristics of route diversity countermeasures against EAO attacks. In Fig. 10
                         the variation of energy overhead for different L
                        
                           link
                         values is presented as a function of number of nodes in a line network. The maximum energy overhead is observed for L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /6 in the 10-node network. As the network size increases the energy overhead decreases. The reason for this behavior is that for small networks a significant portion of the nodes (e.g., 4 out of 10) sends their data directly to the base station if L
                        
                           link
                        
                        →∞, hence, limiting the amount of data on these links results in large deviations from the optimal flows. On the other hand, in larger networks only a few nodes do not use multi-hop forwarding when L
                        
                           link
                        
                        →∞ (e.g., 2 out of 100), therefore, flows created due to the link-limit constraints exhibit relatively less deviation from unrestricted cases.

As L
                        
                           link
                         decreases (the degree of resilience increases), energy overhead of the network increases. By decreasing the maximum allowed amount of data on the links, the network is forced to use less energy efficient (suboptimal) routes. For example, if a node is very close to the base station it sends all of its data directly to the base station if L
                        
                           link
                        
                        →∞, however, with L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /K, the node needs to split its data at least into K parts and forward them towards the base station by using multiple routes. As K increases the deviation from the optimal flows also increases.

For the maximum network lifetime all nodes should cooperate and dissipate their energies in a balanced fashion (i.e., the energy burden of data forwarding is evenly shared among all nodes and none of the nodes dies prematurely). However, when we put limitations on the links, we observe that some sensor nodes are left with residual energy. For example, in the 10-node network with L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /4, node-1 (the node closest to the base station) does not spend 17.50% of its initial energy while all other sensor nodes use all their energies. When L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /5 and L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /6 in the 10-node network, not only the first node but also the second node is also left with some residual energy (i.e., for L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /5 residual energy is 30.42% in the first node and 3.21% in the second node). In the 100-node network with L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /5 residual energy is 58.38% in the first node and 10.05% in the second node and all other nodes completely deplete their energies. Nevertheless, nodes cooperate to share the energy burden of multi-hop routing evenly except possibly one or two nodes. These nodes are left with residual energies because using up the residual part does not help to decrease the energy dissipation of other nodes.

We present the energy overhead as a function of the number of nodes in a square network of size 400m×400m in Fig. 11
                         for various L
                        
                           link
                         values. Despite the fact that network size is kept constant while the number of nodes increases (unlike linear deployment), the network characteristics in 2-D case are similar to the 1-D case which is in contrast to the NCO case. As the number of nodes increases the energy overhead decreases. The reason for such a behavior is that denser networks are more tolerant to link-limit constraint as there are more routes available. Lower L
                        
                           link
                         values result in higher energy overhead.

In Fig. 12
                        , the energy overhead as a function of link-limit in a 400m×400m square network with 75, 100, and 125 nodes is presented. The energy cost of route diversity increases substantially with the increasing degree of link resilience.

In Fig. 13
                        , the energy overhead is presented as a function of the network area for different L
                        
                           link
                         values. The number of nodes in the network is kept constant as 100. The curves in Fig. 13 are bimodal (i.e., not monotonically increasing or decreasing) due to two mechanisms working in opposite directions. When link-limit is not in effect, most of the nodes in the 100m×100m network send most of their data directly to the base station. The amount of data that can be sent through the direct link between a sensor node and the base station is limited by the value of L
                        
                           link
                        . On the other hand, in the 3200m×3200m network nodes (especially the ones farther away from the base station) tend to send most of their data to a limited number of relay nodes to be conveyed to the base station. Hence, for both small and large sized networks enforcing link-limit results in larger deviations from the optimal energy balancing flows. In the 200m×200m and 400m×400m networks the energy overheads are lower than the other networks due to the reduced impact of two mechanisms dominating the opposite ends of the network size.

In this subsection we investigate the energy overhead trends for countermeasures against NCE attacks. In Fig. 14
                        , the variation of energy overheads for different L
                        
                           link
                         and L
                        
                           node
                         values as a function of number of nodes in a line network is presented. The similarity between Figs. 14 and 10 and the dissimilarity between Figs. 14 and 6 show that link-limit is dominant over node-limit. Yet, node-limit also manifests its impact by increasing the energy overhead. For example, the overheads for EAO and NCE in the 10-node line network are 45.36% (L
                        
                           link

                        /6) and 50.92% (L
                        
                           node
                        
                        =
                        L
                        
                           link
                        
                        =
                        s
                        
                           i
                        /6), respectively, and the difference is due to the impact of node-limit. NCE has a bi-modal energy overhead behavior. The energy overhead decreases as the network gets larger up to a certain level thereafter the energy overhead starts increasing slowly. Such behavior is due to the combination of monotonic behaviors of EAO and NCO (i.e., EAO overhead is monotonically decreasing while NCO overhead is monotonically increasing as the number of nodes increases).


                        Fig. 15
                         shows the variation of energy overhead as a function of the number of nodes for different L

In the LP models, the link-limit constraint (Eq. (18)) puts a limitation on all links including direct links to the base station. On the other hand, the node-limit constraint (Eq. (17)) does not apply to the base station hence the flows generated and sent directly to the base station are not restricted. Limiting the amount of data sent to the base station without using a relay has a more significant impact on energy overhead than limiting the amount of data passing over relay nodes. Because in the former case alternate multi-hop paths lead to higher energy inefficiency than using alternate relay nodes in the latter case (as an example for the inefficiency, consider the reverse flows from node-1 in Fig. 5(c)). This the main reason of the difference between the energy overheads of EAO and NCO (i.e., EAO energy overheads are, generally, larger than NCO overheads for the same network settings). By the same token, NCE energy overhead characteristics are dominated by EAO with minor impact from NCO.

In this paper we investigate the energy dissipation characteristics of several strategies to enhance data confidentiality in WSNs against passive and active adversaries. To protect the data prone to node capture and eavesdropping attacks, in previous studies many multi-path routing protocols were proposed [16,17]. Unlike the previous studies we do not propose a new network protocol for enabling route diversity in this paper. Instead, we analyze the concept of route diversity from energy efficiency perspective within a general framework and without going into the details of specific protocols or algorithms. The results we report in this study represent optimistic performance bounds because we do not include any protocol specific control message exchange.

Generally speaking, WSNs are assumed to be consisting of stationary sensor nodes and unlike mobile ad hoc networks topology changes are not frequent. Thus, topology discovery and route creation are one-time operations and for a substantial amount of time (rounds/epochs) these functions are not repeated [5]. If the epoch durations (network reorganization cycle time) are long enough then the energy costs of these operations constitute a small fraction (less than 1%) of the total network energy dissipation [31]. On the other hand, in highly dynamic topologies network organization energy costs can be as high as 60% of the total energy dissipation [38]. Considering that routing overhead can be neglected in stationary WSNs without leading to significant underestimation of total energy dissipation, our characterization of energy overhead due to route diversity is based on realistic assumptions.

In our model route diversity is enforced by restricting the amount of flow on each link and the amount of flow passing through each node. Thus, we indirectly cause the network to split the data generated at each node and route the data through multiple paths. In other words, by selecting L
                     
                        link
                     
                     =
                     s
                     
                        i
                     /K the network is forced to route the data of each node via at least K different links. However, routing data through more links can be a better alternative for energy balancing and certain nodes can split their data into more parts and route it through more links. A similar argument holds for node-limit (L
                     
                        node
                     
                     =
                     s
                     
                        i
                     /R). More concisely, we can say that L
                     
                        link
                      and L
                     
                        node
                      determine the “minimum” level of route diversity.

It is straightforward to extend our LP framework to investigate the energy dissipation characteristics of redundant multi-path routing. As a simple example, consider the case when (X
                     −1) redundant copies of the data
                        7
                     
                     
                        7
                        Alternatively, an (X,Y) secret sharing scheme can be implemented so that an attacker cannot learn anything about the message even if he obtains up to Y
                           −1 shares out of [27,28].
                      are also transmitted towards the base station over multiple paths. If our analysis presented in this paper indicates that the overhead percentage due to multi-path routing (X-path routing) is k
                     %, then the overhead of multi-path routing combined with redundant data transfer will be (X
                     ×
                     k)%+((X
                     −1)×100)% (the overhead of multi-path routing is multiplied by X since it is defined as a ratio of the cost for unconstrained data flow which is X times more due to carrying redundant copies).

The rationale behind limiting the amount of data flow on each link through the use of L
                     
                        link
                      is to prevent an eavesdropper from capturing the data of any sensor node by listening to a single link. An eavesdropper has to capture data from at least K links to assemble any source node's complete data in a network with L
                     
                        link
                     
                     =
                     s
                     
                        i
                     /K. However the cost of eavesdropping is not always additive. We distinguish the following three cases:
                        
                           1.
                           Additive cost: Eavesdropping K links is K times more difficult than eavesdropping a single link. This is a realistic assumption for instance when communication on each link is encrypted with a separate key which can be broken with a time-consuming brute force attack. As another example, consider a single commodity hardware which can listen to only one link at a time.

Sub-additive cost: Eavesdropping K links is less than K times difficult than eavesdropping a single link. A typical example of it can be seen when there is no encryption and eavesdropping all of the incoming links of a particular node is achieved by using a single receiver. An interesting special case is the one in which eavesdropper can listen to all incoming links of a node at the same time except the incoming links of the base station. From key management's point of view, nodes can secure their direct links with the base station more easily because this can be achieved using encryption with a single secret key shared with the base station. The constraint for NCO (Eq. (17)) can be used to model this kind of limit since for our purposes eavesdropping all incoming links of a node (except the base station) is equivalent to a capture attack conducted on that node. To cover other cases, as the link constraint Eq. (18) should be replaced by Eq. (19). The set E
                              
                                 i
                               includes all the nodes whose communication to node-i can be eavesdropped simultaneously.

Super-additive cost: Eavesdropping K links is more than K times difficult than eavesdropping a single link (e.g., when the coordination for reconstructing the data crossing several links poses additional costs [3]).

On the other hand, costs of node capture attacks can be assumed as additive if such attacks are performed by physically compromising the nodes and remote attacks exploiting software vulnerabilities of sensor nodes are not viable. As long as L
                     
                        node

                        i
                     /R is in effect, an adversary has to capture at least R nodes to construct data of other sensor nodes which can be assumed as R times more difficult than capturing a single node.

The framework we present in this paper is for modeling proactive security countermeasures. Additional knowledge about the attacker (e.g., location information) may facilitate more efficient reactive type multi-path routing strategies. Considering these methods in an LP framework is left as future work.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study we investigated the energy overhead characteristics of route diversity countermeasures for resilience against node capture only (NCO), eavesdropping only (EAO), and node capture and eavesdropping (NCE) attacks. We developed an LP framework that is capable of jointly modeling energy dissipation and route diversity in WSNs. Through the developed framework we conducted a comprehensive analysis by exploring the design space in a systematic fashion. Characterization of the energy overhead of route diversity countermeasures in WSNs is important for understanding the feasibility of utilization of such security techniques. A brief summary of our results are itemized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           Energy overhead of route diversity increases with the level of resilience. If the level of resilience is low, then the energy overhead is also low. On the other hand, for high degrees of resilience energy overhead can be prohibitive (i.e., higher than the energy dissipation of unconstrained networks).

For maximal network lifetime all nodes should cooperate and use their energies in a way that prevents premature death of any node. Route diversity imposed on the network results in energy imbalances among the nodes (i.e., some nodes do not deplete their initial energies). However the extent of the imbalance is limited. We observed that only a few nodes exhibit such a behavior.

In line networks: (a) for EAO case the energy overhead decreases as the number of nodes in the network increases due to the fact that in larger networks nodes can adapt to link-limit with less deviation from the optimal energy-efficient routes; (b) for NCO case direct transmission to the base station eliminates data splitting to satisfy L
                              
                                 node
                               constraint, however, in larger networks direct transmission to the base station results in higher energy inefficiency, therefore, the energy overhead increases with the number of nodes in the network; (c) for the NCE case similar to the EAO case as the network size increases the energy overhead decreases.

In square networks: (a) the EAO and NCE cases reach their minimum energy overhead values for specific network area values where the composite impact of direct transmission and multi-hop relaying behaviors (arising due to the effects of L
                              
                                 link
                               and L
                              
                                 node
                              ) reaches a relative minimum; (b) for the NCO case energy overhead is a monotonically increasing function of the network area because there is less deviation from the optimal flows in smaller size networks where direct transmission to the base station is the dominant mode of operation not affected by node-limit; (c) for all three countermeasures as the number of nodes increases while the area is kept constant energy overhead decreases because when there are more nodes in the network, there are more links and paths in the network which enable the network to satisfy the constraints with less energy overhead.

NCE energy overhead behavior is mainly shaped by link-limit, yet, the impact of node-limit is also observable as a minor factor. It is interesting to observe that mitigation of a passive attack (i.e., eavesdropping) yields more energy overhead than mitigation of an active attack (i.e., node-capture) under the assumption of additive attack costs.

LP problems are solvable in polynomial time [6]. Hence, from a computational point of view it is preferable to model a problem using LP rather than with a non-polynomial time formulation which makes a comprehensive analysis infeasible. Thus, the novel LP framework presented in this paper can be used with minor modifications for future analysis on different aspects of route diversity.
