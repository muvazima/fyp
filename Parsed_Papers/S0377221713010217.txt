                  Most developed countries support farming activities through policies that are tailored to meet their specific social, economic and environmental objectives. Economic and environmental efficiency have recently become relevant targets of most of these policies, whose sound implementation can be enhanced by monitoring farm performance from a multidimensional perspective. This paper proposes farm-level technical and environmental efficiency measures that recognize the stochastic conditions in which production takes place. A state-contingent framework is used to model production uncertainty. An implementable representation of the technology is developed using data envelopment analysis. The application focuses on a sample of Catalan arable crop farms. Results suggest that technical efficiency is slightly lower in bad than in good growing conditions. Nitrogen pollution can decrease substantially more under good than bad growing conditions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since its inception, the European Union’s (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been continuously reshaped. While its initial objectives were focused on farm income support, its policy scope has widened to embrace environmental preservation. Increasingly, CAP reform proposals have tried to align the CAP with environmental sustainability, higher efficiency, effectiveness, and equitability. Especially noteworthy is the proposal to redistribute CAP direct payments on the basis of both economic and environmental criteria. Implementing such a redistribution scheme requires empirically-based tools to measure farms’ success in achieving these goals. To measure farms’ success, one could use the firm performance tools available in the efficiency and productivity measurement literatures.

These tools have been employed in a variety of contexts to evaluate firm and industry performance, as well as to provide quantitative guidelines for benchmarking firm performance. It seems apparent, therefore, that conceptually sound farm-level technical and environmental efficiency indices could be relevant in assisting any redistribution scheme. While maintenance of technical efficiency and technical growth are pre-requisites for economic sustainability, maintaining environmental efficiency is equally important for ensuring the environmental sustainability of agricultural activities.

Traditional performance measures typically focus on the efficient use of conventional inputs and outputs. However, as the environmental sustainability of economic activities has become of increasing interest, firm-performance studies have evolved to include environmental concerns, and conventional efficiency measures have been extended to include both technical and environmental dimensions (Chung, Färe, & Grosskopf, 1997; Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, & Pasurka, 1989; Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, & Yaisawarng, 1993; Färe, Grosskopf, Noh, & Weber, 2005; Oude Lansink, 2003; Oude Lansink & Silva, 2003; Oude Lansink & van der Vlist, 2008; Reinhard, Lovell, & Thijssen, 1999; Wossink & Denaux, 2007).

There has been considerable debate in the technical literature on the proper modeling of pollution in productive technologies. One standard approach assumes that pollution and production are complementary outputs so that pollution can be treated as though it were an input (De Koeijer, Wossink, Struik, & Renkema, 2002; Reinhard, Lovell, & Thijssen, 2000; Reinhard et al., 1999). This modeling assumption is based on the empirical observation that pollution and intended output are frequently positively correlated. While analytically convenient, it is a reduced-form specification that ignores both physical reality and the requirements of material balance (Pethig, 2006). A competing approach treats pollution as a weakly disposable or unintended output subject to null jointness (Färe et al., 1989; Piot-Lepetit & Vermersch, 1998; Wossink & Denaux, 2007). Førsund (2008) and Murty, Russell, and Levkoff (2012) have shown that this specification also suffers from a number of weaknesses including a failure to address material-balance concerns. Two recent path breaking proposals include Coelli, Lauwers, and Van Huylenbroeck (2007) and Murty et al. (2012). Coelli et al. (2007) propose to include pollution into conventional productive efficiency measures by using the materials balance concept. Murty et al. (2012) model polluting technologies as a composition of two technologies, an intended-output and a residual-generation technology.

While the proper specification of technologies involving production of both intended and unintended outputs has been heavily debated, the incorporation of the fundamentally stochastic nature of production technologies into efficiency and performance analysis has received much less attention. As O’Donnell et al. (2010) have shown, both conceptually and through simulation analyses, efficiency studies rooted in the assumption of non-stochastic technology can be seriously biased.

A well-recognized problem affecting the efficiency measurement of a sample of firms is to confound heterogeneity arising from incomplete or missing information with true inefficiency (Kumbhakar & Lovell, 2000). Missing or incomplete observations on ex-ante production are important sources of heterogeneity. An efficiency analysis that completely relies on ex-post realized output can confound poor outcomes arising from the stochastic nature of technology with truly inefficient outcomes that arise under more favorable conditions. Hence, deterministic DEA techniques applied to data from stochastic technologies could exhibit a downward bias.

Given the relevance of uncertainty in many production activities, it is important to characterize intended and unintended output production technologies in the presence of production uncertainty. This is one of the main objectives of this research. Hence, this paper offers a new and relevant step in the construction of sustainability indicators at the firm level. Chambers and Quiggin (1998, 2000) propose a characterization of production uncertainty by representing the stochastic technology in terms of state-contingent input and output correspondences. This approach is based on the recognition that production under uncertainty can be represented by differentiating outputs and potentially inputs according to the state of nature in which they are realized. It, thus, has its foundations in Debreu (1959) and Arrow (1965). The state-contingent approach offers two main advantages over more traditional methods. First, it does not require a probabilistic assessment of output, and second, it is applicable independently of the risk preferences of the decision maker. To date, the state-contingent approach has seen relatively few empirical applications in production and efficiency analyses.


                     O’Donnell and Griffiths (2006) estimate a state-contingent production function by identifying the different states of Nature in terms of rainfall. Chambers (2007) uses the state-contingent approach to estimate a farmer’s stochastic discount factor, derived from his or her production cost structure, that is appropriate to calculate a farmer’s willingness to pay for insurance. Chavas (2008) empirically estimates cost functions for stochastic technologies defined over two-dimensional state spaces. Shankar, O’Donnell, and Quiggin (2011) offer an alternative two-dimensional approach that relies on the estimation of risk-neutral probabilities to produce estimates of the underlying cost function. Chambers, Serra, and Stefanou (2013) use survey-elicited ex-ante outputs to develop an empirical representation of a state-contingent technology in an activity-analysis framework, and develop an empirical test of output-cubicality.

Efficiency measurement requires comparing actual performance with optimal performance embedded in the production frontier. Since the production frontier is unknown, an empirical approximation is required. Empirically implementable representations of state-contingent production frontiers can be based either on the stochastic frontier or the data envelopment analysis (SFA, DEA, respectively).
                        3
                        We discard productivity indices as they do not measure efficiency, which is the objective of this research work.
                     
                     
                        3
                      The way that each approach accommodates for statistical noise and for flexibility in the production technology constitutes the main difference between the two methods and centers the debate on their relative merits (Fried, Lovell, & Schmidt, 2008). Efficiency measurement in SFA relies on the choice of a specific parametric functional form for the production frontier, as well as on specific distributional assumptions of the random noise and inefficiency error components. Since SFA empirical results are usually very sensitive to parametric assumptions, modeling biases and erroneous inferences are likely to appear.

DEA techniques allow overcoming many of the SFA limitations. Their largely non-parametric nature involves relatively mild assumptions on the underlying production technology. The use of techniques robust to misspecification issues is especially important when underlying functional forms are unknown. While the production economics literature has provided a wide array of alternate functional forms characterizing production of intended outputs, standard forms adequate to characterize the environmental impacts of agriculture are not yet widely known or available. More traditional DEA methods are generally less well suited for separating the stochastic component of production from inefficiency from stochastic factors, despite substantial progress with stochastic DEA approaches (e.g. Fried, Lovell, Schmidt, & Yaisawarng, 2002; Simar & Wilson, 2007). But the stochastic frontier approach to efficiency measurement is also typically grounded on the assumption that the underlying technology is non-stochastic. In reality, however, many technologies are in fact stochastic, and agriculture is an important case in point. Even though it is well understood that bad production outcomes due to stochastic factors can be mistakenly construed as production inefficiencies, until recently relatively little attention has been devoted to incorporating the fundamentally stochastic nature of agricultural production into farm-level efficiency analyses.

The state-contingent approach (Chambers & Quiggin, 1998, 2000) helps circumvent the main limitation of DEA by representing the stochastic technology in terms of state-contingent input and output correspondences that can be implemented using DEA methods. While the state-contingent techniques can also be implemented within the SFA framework (see, for example, Chavas, 2008; O’Donnell & Griffiths, 2006), the high correlation between outputs in different states of nature creates important collinearity issues (specially when the number of states of nature considered is above 2). To avoid both multicollinearity issues and specification biases related to SFA, a DEA approach is used in this article.

This article develops and implements technical and environmental efficiency measures in a framework that recognizes the stochastic environment in which production takes place. The paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses technical and environmental efficiency measurement in a state-contingent framework and develops an empirically implementable representation of the technology using methods adapted from activity analysis and data envelopment analysis (DEA). We then discuss our data set. A particularly unique characteristic of the data set is that it was derived from a sample designed to elicit measures of both ex-ante (stochastic) intended outputs and unintended outputs (pollution and damage to human health). Once the data set is discussed, our empirical model is applied to it to develop efficiency measures in terms of ex-ante intended outputs and pollution control. The paper concludes with a discussion and analysis of the results and method.

@&#METHODS@&#

Following Frisch (1965), Førsund (2008), and Murty et al. (2012), we view the firm’s technology as resulting from the interaction of several separate sub-technologies. The original conceptualization is due to Frisch (1965) and can be briefly described (in his terms) as follows. Production among multiple products is governed by distinct production relations (represented by Frisch as implicit equations), each of which is independent of the other. Although independent, each of these product relations can involve both multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Førsund (2008) shows how such a system could be extended to modeling the interaction between both multiple intended outputs and unintended by products in Frisch’s framework. Murty et al. (2012) extend the approach further by introducing the notion of by production.

Our specification follows the path blazed by these earlier works. However, we modify it to accommodate the stochastic nature of agricultural production by specifying it in state-contingent terms (Chambers & Quiggin, 2000). We also slightly modify the by-production specification of Murty et al. (2012) to accommodate more fully material-balance concerns specific to our application to agricultural technologies.

As a result of unpredictable weather conditions, pest infestations, market instability among other sources, the influence of uncertainty on agricultural production decisions has been widely assessed in the literature through theoretical modeling and empirical studies. As noted, the state-contingent approach represents uncertainty by differentiating outputs according to the state of nature in which they are realized. Uncertainty is thus represented by a state space Ω. Random variables are represented as vectors in

                        More formally, random variables are (measurable) real-valued functions defined on the state space.

                      To clarify the discussion, we distinguish random variables from their ex-post outcomes by tildes so that, for example,

                                 Ω
                              
                           
                        
                      represents the random variable while zs
                      represents the ex-post or realized value that would occur if nature chooses state s.

There are several distinct sub-technologies. One governs the production of intended or good outputs. Another governs the production of runoff by products, and the third governs damage to human health. There are M intended, but stochastic outputs denoted

                     ) and hazards to human health h (generated by cd
                     ). Our data set treats hazard to human health as non-stochastic, and thus our theoretical model is developed under that assumption, but it is easy to extend our ideas to incorporate stochastic health effects.

Standard methods can be used to construct empirical approximations to T without further elaborating the manner in which inputs and outputs interact. The practitioner’s challenge is to incorporate prior information on these interactions into the specification of T to permit a closer approximation to the underlying technology.

The first step that we take in developing that more detailed representation of T is to ensure that it meets the requirements of material balance. For our technology, the primary material-balance requirement is that the runoff by products produced by the runoff-producing inputs and the runoff inputs that are absorbed in the production of the intended outputs, which we denote by

Non-polluting inputs and polluting inputs interact in determining the stochastic level of the intended outputs. We assume that only the portion of the runoff inputs that remains on the plant or that is absorbed by the plant has a direct impact on production. Our specification treats absorption and runoff as state-contingent because of the possibility that environmental factors, beyond the producer’s control (for example, rainfall), can play a role in determining which component of the input applied is fixed on the plant and which component migrates to the environment.

Both productive inputs and runoff-producing input applications are assumed to affect the actual stochastic production of runoff levels. Our specification, therefore, differs slightly from that in Murty et al. (2012) by the inclusion of productive inputs into this component of the technology. The reasoning is simple. The vector of productive inputs will include labor and capital inputs, each of which may have differential impacts on runoff emitted. For example, a lower quality or poorly maintained applicator used to apply a runoff-input can affect eventual runoff. Thus,

The last component of our specification involves incorporating contaminant input health risk into the technology. Because we lack direct observations on health risk, we follow other studies and construct the risk factor using predetermined weights (discussed in more detail in our data section). We assume that human-health risk is determined by weighting each contaminant by a risk factor according to the human health risk

As noted above, two main approaches have been used in the efficiency literature namely, parametric (Stochastic Frontier Analysis – SFA) and nonparametric approaches (Data Envelopment Analysis – DEA) (Lohr & Park, 2006; Oude Lansink, Pietola, & Bäckman, 2002; Sipiläinen & Oude Lansink, 2005; Tzouvelekas, Pantzios, & Fotopoulos, 2001, 2002). The answer to the question of whether the two different techniques tell consistent stories when applied to the same dataset, is entirely of an empirical type and has been shown to depend closely on the nature of the data used (Fried et al., 2008). While a general assertion cannot be made, several studies have proven the existence of positive rank correlations of efficiency point estimates obtained from econometric and mathematical programming methods (Bauwer, Berger, Ferrier, & Humphrey, 1998; Cummins & Zi, 1998). The technology in (5) is approximated empirically for a given data set by using a combination of activity analysis and DEA methods. As noted and as shown by Chavas (2008), application of state-contingent techniques jointly with parametric efficiency estimation methods can be problematic. This is due to the fact that elements in

                      tend to be highly correlated in the sample, which leads to collinearity problems that become particularly relevant when the number of state-dependent variables is larger than 2. As will be explained in Section 3, our empirical analysis considers three states of nature s

Following Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000), multicollineartiy among regressors will lead to imprecise parameter estimates, including the parameters representing the SFA error components. Multicollinearity issues are further aggravated with the use of flexible specifications of the production technology, such as the translog function. This makes SFA use inadequate for our data.
                        5
                        Multicollinearity is also likely to cause convergence estimation problems. While we tried to fit our model using econometric techniques, parameter estimates failed to converge making estimation unsuccessful.

Our approximation for TY
                      maintains constant returns to scale and consists of the free disposal
                        6
                        An input is freely disposable if holding all other inputs and outputs fixed increasing that input without bound always results in technically feasible input combinations. An output is freely disposable if its production can be lowered holding all other outputs and inputs constant.

                     Following Murty et al. (2012), the efficiency index that we use is an extension of the Russell Index originally proposed in input space by Färe and Lovell (1978) and later extended by Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1985). We construct an overall efficiency index that is derivable from efficiency indexes for each of the subtechnologies:

The presence of outliers in the dataset may bias efficiency estimates. Banker and Chang (2006) show that the super-efficiency procedure in DEA analysis is useful in identifying and removing outliers in the data, which leads to more accurate efficiency estimates than those derived from conventional DEA.
                        7
                        
                           Bellini (2012) has recently merged the super-efficiency DEA with the forward-search method as an alternative to tackle outlier detection.

                      While conventional DEA analyses evaluate the efficiency of an observation relative to all sample observations, super-efficiency estimates exclude each observation from its reference set, which makes it possible to derive efficiency scores above 1. The screen level of 1.2

                      (Banker & Chang, 2006) was considered for outlier identification and removal. The process consists of a two-stage approach. First, the DEA representation of the technology is implemented by excluding each observation from each reference set. Those observations with overall efficiency scores above 1.2 are eliminated from the sample. In a second stage, Expressions (6)–(8) are recalculated with the trimmed sample data to derive the super-efficiency DEA estimates.

Our analysis focuses on a sample of Catalan arable crop farms. The data were collected using a questionnaire that was distributed among 190 agricultural holdings specialized in the production of cereals, oilseeds and protein (COP) crops. A farm was considered as specialized in COP production when COP revenue represented at least 80% of its total revenues coming from animal and vegetable production. The survey was conducted in 2011, prior to the growing season.
                        9
                        The survey took place from September to November 2011.
                     
                     
                        9
                      At the end of the season, sample farms were contacted again in order to gather ex-post production data. The latter were collected to compare results derived from both non-stochastic and stochastic modeling.

Data were also obtained on farms’ planned input use. These included details on COP land use (in hectares), crop-specific inputs (seeds, fertilizers and crop protection products in physical and monetary units), farming overheads (water, energy, fuels, lubricants and contract work in physical and monetary units), paid labor (both in hours and monetary units) and unpaid labor (in hours) and capital (in replacement values). Furthermore, we collected data on ex-ante outputs for three different states of nature, bad, normal and ideal growing conditions (y
                     =(y
                     1,
                     y

                     y
                     3)) that are measured in euros.

Eliciting ex-ante output information is not straightforward and responses can be subject to subjective beliefs regarding crop yield distribution. Technicians from Unió de Pagesos, the largest farmer association in Catalonia that was in charge of administering the survey, recommended obtaining point estimates of yield under bad, normal and ideal growing conditions as the most practical approach to eliciting information on ex-ante yields.
                        10
                        We also considered eliciting ex-ante yield and runoff measures using specific scenarios that differ in terms of temperature, sunlight, rainfall, and other indicators of the state of Nature. However, this alternative was abandoned because the details, specifications, exceptions that should be presented to obtain reasonable responses would make the survey too costly. For example, providing only a number of frost days during the growing season would not be much relevant if not accompanied by information on the distribution of these days over time. Without this detail, scenarios would be highly incomplete and responses highly subjective.
                     
                     
                        10
                      Yields under normal conditions areusually a reference (representing average yields over a sufficiently long period of time) and their identification is key for respondents. Once these are identified, it is relatively easy for farmers to provide yield data under bad and ideal conditions. Realized output data were obtained by contacting farms at the end of the season.

In the next section we discuss our research results. Our empirical conclusions, naturally, are restricted to the specific geographic context of Catalonia. Ideally, it would be desirable to compare our results with those derived from alternative datasets. Unfortunately, this is not possible because our data set is almost unique in its elicitation of information on ex-ante (state-contingent) outputs. Historically, data collection efforts have focused exclusively on gathering observations on ex-post outputs, rather than on ex-ante (state-contingent) outputs. There are simply no truly comparable data sets. The central challenge faced in constructing empirical representations of stochastic technologies that do not impose output cubicality in the sense of Chambers and Quiggin (2000) is lack of information on ex-ante values of random variables. A central thrust of this study and the data collection effort associated with it is an attempt to rectify that shortcoming.

Descriptive statistics, including robust estimates of scale and location, of the variables used in the analysis are presented in Table 1
                     . The table shows that the output standard deviation and robust estimates of scale increase as we move from bad to ideal states of nature, suggesting higher variability in output across farms as growing conditions improve. Ex-post output measures of location are close to output under normal growing conditions. Robust measures of location involve lower output, as well as lower input levels than the mean.

A scatter plot matrix of the intended outputs with unintended outputs, polluting and non-polluting inputs is presented in Figs. 1–5
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     . In the matrix diagonal, the histogram plot of each variable is offered. Different general conclusions can be drawn from these plots. First, the non-normal shape of the distribution of the variables studied is apparent. This is supported statistically by the results of the Jarque–Bera test in Table 1. As expected, scatter plot matrices suggest the existence of a positive correlation between intended and unintended outputs, as well as with polluting and non-polluting inputs. Intended outputs in different states of nature are also highly correlated. The same holds for nitrogen pollution. The presence of a few outliers is also observed.


                        OECD and Eurostat (2007) identify two main methods to estimate nutrient balances in agriculture: the farm-gate balance and the soil surface balance. The farm-gate balance treats the farm as an entity and considers the nutrients imported (through inputs such as fertilizers, seeds and feedstuffs) and the nutrients exported (crop nitrogen removal, meat nitrogen content, etc.). Studies adopting the farm-gate balance approach usually ignore atmospheric deposition and biological fixation, as these sources “do not pass through the farm gate” (Aarts, 2003; Treacy, Humphreys, McNamara, Browne, & Watson, 2008). The soil surface balance is a more extensive concept that also treats the farm as a unit, but that allows for all possible nitrogen flows (atmospheric depositions, biological fixation, etc.). Under the latter approach, grazing, for example, has to be accounted as a source of nutrient removal (through grazing), as well as a nutrient input source (through manure).

Because our available data cannot support the soil-surface-balance approach, the farm-gate balance technique has been adopted. Under this method, two input sources are considered: nitrogen applied through organic and chemical fertilizers and through seeds. The nitrogen output source is crop-nitrogen removal. Details on how these input and output sources have been estimated are offered below.

The survey gathered information on both organic and chemical fertilizers applied. As for chemical fertilizers, information on the nitrogen content was collected. As a result, computing total nitrogen applied through chemical fertilizers was straightforward. For organic fertilizers, details on the source of the fertilizer (pig slurry, bovine manure, sewage sludge, etc.) were collected. A table with the average nitrogen content of the different types of organic fertilizers, as well as their densities (allowing to express them in the same units of measurement) can be found in Mercadé, Delgado, and Gil (2012). Coefficients in this table were used to compute nitrogen input from organic fertilizers. The nitrogen content in seeds was also estimated based on coefficients facilitated by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (2005).

Nitrogen input sources (organic and chemical fertilizers and seeds) were added to derive total nitrogen input. Nitrogen input per hectare estimates were compared with nitrogen application recommendations (unpublished document elaborated jointly by the Catalan Government and the Research and Technology Food and Agriculture Institute, IRTA
                           11

                        ) and they match quite well, with an average deviation in the order of 6%. Further, results were compared with Mercadé et al. (2012) estimates of actual nitrogen application on different crops in Catalonia and results were also very close (the average deviation here was around 16%).

                              Mercadé et al.’s (2012) data, however do not provide detail on fertilizer applied per crop, but per crop type, being thus necessary to make the comparison at the aggregate level.

                         The crop nitrogen removal was estimated based on a very detailed study produced by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (2005) on estimating this quantity in different Spanish regions and for different crops. Since nitrogen removal depends on yields, three possible nitrogen outputs were estimated: one for each state of nature (bad, normal and ideal growing conditions). The difference between nitrogen application and removal estimates yielded three possible nitrogen balances, z
                        1,
                        z
                        2 and z
                        3 representing the nitrogen balance in kilos under bad, normal and ideal growing conditions, respectively.

Nutrient balances represent an overall indicator of the use and management of nutrients by the agricultural sector. While a persistent surplus in the balance leads to environmental problems, a repeated deficit entails sustainability risks for agriculture. In being cross-sectional, our analysis does not observe nutrient balances over time. Therefore, a surplus or deficit in the short-run should not be taken as an unambiguous indicator of environmental damage or soil nutrient depletion.


                        Table 1 shows that average nitrogen balances per farm in our sample fluctuate from 7.6 to 4.5tonnes per year; this variation is explained by the increase in nitrogen removal with improvement of crop growth conditions. As is the case with output, ex-post nitrogen balance measures of location are close to those under ex-ante normal conditions. Note that the heterogeneity across farms regarding the nitrogen balance increases as crop growing conditions improve (the coefficient of variation of the balance is 1.3 for the bad state of nature and 1.7 for the ideal state). On a per hectare basis, mean nitrogen balances decline from 99.6kilograms per hectare for bad growing conditions, to 58.8kilograms per hectare for ideal growing conditions. Brouwer, Hellegers, Hoogeveen, and Luesink (1999) and OECD (2001) estimate average agriculture nitrogen balance to be on the order of 60kilograms per hectare in the EU in the late 1990s, with substantial variation from 262 in the Netherlands to 27 in Austria. More recent estimates place this value around 56kilograms per hectare (Eurostat, 2012). Variation in nutrient balances across space and time have been shown to be relevant due to different cropping systems and technological advances, changes in weather and biophysical conditions.

The questionnaire also contained very detailed questions on the application of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, including the chemical formula. These were used to derive an estimate of the quantity of active ingredients used (densities were used to express all active ingredients in the same units of measurement). The total quantity of active ingredients (expressed in liters) was considered as an input.

Since the different active ingredients do not have the same environmental effects, a weighting procedure was used to approximate contamination caused by pesticides. The only weighting dataset available that covers all active ingredients that appear in our sample is the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) obtained from the Footprint dataset (http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/footprint/en/index.htm). The ADIs measure the quantity of active ingredients that can be ingested in the diet on a daily basis and over a lifetime, without significant health risk for humans. They are usually expressed in mg/kgbw/day, where kgbw represents kilos of body weight. The weighting was carried out as follows. Assume the vector of ADIs associated to the active ingredients identified in our sample is

                         represents the quantity of active ingredient i applied. We acknowledge limitations associated to this measure that considers the impacts of pesticides on human health, but ignores the impacts on other living organisms.


                        Table 1 shows that our sample farms annually apply on average 85liters (less if robust measures of location are used) of active ingredients, i.e. slightly above 1liter per hectare. PAN Germany (2003) places this value around 3.88kilograms per hectare in the EU-15 and 1.84 in Spain. These aggregate figures, however, mask significant dosage differences across crops.

As noted above, Fig. 1 suggests the presence of outliers. A cluster analysis is conducted in order to draw preliminary conclusions on the impact of outliers on efficiency measurement. Farms are classified into groups using input and output variables in Table 1. Based on the pseudo F, pseudo t
                     2 and cubic clustering criterion, the optimal number of clusters chosen is 2. While the first cluster contains almost all farms (155 out of 190), 35 farms are classified in the second cluster and are characterized for being, on average, substantially larger than the first group. In Table 2
                     , descriptive statistics of each cluster are presented. The first cluster average overall efficiency ratio is 0.85, being the average for the second group on the order of 0.89. The mean difference between the two groups turns out to be statistically significant.
                        14
                        Both the independent samples t-test and the non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test support statistically significant differences between the two efficiency means.
                     
                     
                        14
                      This suggests the possibility that the presence of outliers has an influence on efficiency scores. As a result, the Banker and Chang (2006) method addressing this issue is implemented.

Around 10% of the observations were found to be outliers according to the Banker and Chang (2006) criterion. Table 3
                      presents descriptive statistics for computed overall technical efficiency and its decomposition into: technical, runoff by-product, and health contaminant (pesticide-pollution) components. Both DEA and super-efficient DEA estimates are presented. As expected, super-efficient DEA scores are above conventional DEA efficiency ratings. This is due to the higher homogeneity of the outlier-trimmed sample. Fig. 6
                      presents nonparametric kernel density functions fit to the overall DEA and super-efficient DEA scores. This figure shows that outlier removal alters the shape of the overall efficiency density function. While conventional DEA scores have a bimodal distribution, super-efficient DEA scores have a unimodal density. The latter has a more pronounced concentration of scores at or close to one, causing the reported increase in average efficiency levels (Table 3). Similar changes affect the intended output efficiency scores density (Fig. 7
                     ). As for nitrogen pollution efficiencies (Fig. 8
                     ), trimming the sample reduces the concentration of efficiency scores in the 0.5–0.85 range, to increase values above 0.85. While the density fit to super-efficient DEA nitrogen pollution scores is mainly convex, the super-efficient intended output efficiency density is mostly concave. As a result, the density of the expected nitrogen (intended output) efficiency lies below (above) the expected density.

By the manner in which our estimate of h is constructed, all firms are automatically efficient in the last component, i.e., our model imposes efficiency in the health contaminant. Overall efficiency averages around 89% (86%) under the super-efficient (conventional) DEA method (see Table 3). This is larger than efficiency levels for state-contingent outputs and state-contingent nitrogen pollution which average around 87% (80%) and 80% (77%), for super-efficient (conventional) DEA measures. The upward bias in the overall efficiency average is a direct consequence of the fact that our model imposes efficiency in the health contaminant by the manner in which the data are constructed. Thus, it is reasonable to interpret our results as suggesting that the average firm is slightly less than 90% efficient overall.

Efficiency across states of nature is only measured using the super-efficient measures, due to their higher reliability. Our results suggest that there is significant room for efficiency improvements, both in terms of COP production and in control of nitrogen runoff. Looking at the results across states of nature, one must notice that the differences in output efficiency across states are relatively marginal, with average efficiency ranging from 84% in the bad state of nature to around 88% in the ideal and normal states of nature. Nitrogen pollution efficiency, on the other hand, differs significantly across states of nature. In particular, our results suggest that the average farm’s efficiency in controlling pollution drops dramatically as growing conditions improve. The nitrogen efficiency score in the ideal state of nature is particularly low at approximately 70%, and the least efficient farms for this state have efficiency levels below 20%.

Such results are open to alternative interpretations. Because average efficiency in the bad state of nature is around 86%, it suggests that the average farm is overfertilizing (from all sources) relative to the most efficient farm even in the worst production scenario. As the state of nature improves, this pattern of excess nitrogen application becomes more problematic and difficult to control. Consequently, efficiency in controlling nitrogen runoff declines dramatically under ideal conditions.

To assess the role of incorporating material-balance concerns in determining efficiency scores, we have calculated all efficiency scores for a specification of the model that replaces stochastic nitrogen absorption

                      with nitrogen applications. This mimics what would be done in standard efficiency calculations. Table 4
                      reports the associated descriptive statistics. One notes immediately that the average effects are marginal at best. Output efficiency increases slightly, while nitrogen efficiency remains unchanged. Although incorporating material-balance appears to make little difference for the average farm’s efficiency, it turns out that it can make significant differences at the farm level. In the most extreme case, a farm that was judged output efficient in each state of nature when material-balance concerns were ignored, drops to 50% efficiency in the bad state, 72% efficiency in the normal state, and 95% efficiency in the ideal state of nature. Such results are indicative of the type of efficiency changes one expects to emerge at the farm level when technically efficient operation experiencing unfavorable operating conditions are compared with inefficient operations experiencing favorable operation conditions.

In order to show the extent to which efficiency estimates might be biased as a result of ignoring the stochastic production conditions, ex-post super-efficient and conventional DEA estimates are presented in Table 5
                     . Results confirm O’Donnell et al.’s (2010) conclusion that ex-post output observations do not soundly represent the stochastic production environment in which production occurs, yielding downward biased technical efficiency measures.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

This paper makes a first step towards constructing firm-level sustainability indicators. Our specification follows Frisch (1965), Førsund (2008) and Murty et al. (2012) in modeling the firm’s technology as the interaction of different sub-technologies. We extend this approach by incorporating the stochastic nature of production using a state-contingent framework. That is, we differentiate outputs according to the states of nature in which they are realized. Further, the Murty et al. (2012) specification of the unintended output technology is modified to accommodate better the characteristics of our sample farms’ technology.

These resulting efficiency measures are applied to a sample of Catalan farms specialized in COP production. Though compatible with previous literature findings and theories, empirical results cannot be extended beyond this geographical context. Data were obtained from a farm-level survey conducted in 2011 prior to the growing season that has the unique characteristic that it directly elicited information on ex-ante outputs. That information, in turn, was used along with data on nitrogen applications to develop information on ex-ante nitrogen runoff levels.

Our environmental performance measures focus on pesticide and nitrogen pollution. Output technical efficiencies are on average approximately 87%. Nitrogen pollution efficiency indices show considerable scope for reduction of nitrogen pollution, with an efficiency of 80%. Nitrogen inefficiencies are especially large for good states of nature, when plant growth involves higher nitrogen removal rates, than during poor growing conditions. Results further confirm that ignoring the stochastic conditions under which production occurs, tends to confound poor production outcomes resulting from unfavorable production conditions with inefficiency.
