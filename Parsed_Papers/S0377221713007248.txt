                  Increased rates of mortgage foreclosures in the U.S. have had devastating social and economic impacts during and after the 2008 financial crisis. As part of the response to this problem, nonprofit organizations such as community development corporations (CDCs) have been trying to mitigate the negative impacts of mortgage foreclosures by acquiring and redeveloping foreclosed properties. We consider the strategic resource allocation decisions for these organizations which involve budget allocations to different neighborhoods under cost and return uncertainty. Based on interactions with a CDC, we develop stochastic integer programming based frameworks for this decision problem, and assess the practical value of the models by using real-world data. Both policy-related and computational analyses are performed, and several insights such as the trade-offs between different objectives, and the efficiency of different solution approaches are presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A dramatic increase in mortgage foreclosures has had adverse effects in all sectors of the economy but especially in the housing sector in the United States. Home foreclosures have resulted in massive losses of consumer wealth. U.S. households lost around $1.1 trillion per year on average in home value between 2007 and 2011 (Daily Finance, 2011; Zillow, 2010), and the fraction of mortgages that are more than 90days delinquent has been over 8% (Norman, 2010). The foreclosure crisis in Europe has not had as severe of an impact, but the European mortgage market also saw a 1.2% decline in 2008 due to the same economic crisis (European Mortgage Federation, 2010), while rates of severe mortgage delinquency are generally about a third of U.S. rates (European Commission, 2011).

Several efforts by governments, companies and social organizations have been in place to reduce the losses realized due to the foreclosure problem. In the United States, such social organizations involve non-governmental/nonprofit entities referred to as community development corporations (CDCs). Among other community development projects, these organizations try to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of foreclosures by purchasing, redeveloping and selling foreclosed properties. While CDCs are more common in the United States than elsewhere in the developed world (Anheier, 2005), our research is applicable to non-US government actors at the local and regional levels as well.

While actions of CDCs help maintain social and economic stability in neighborhoods, the resources typically available to these entities are limited, and thus efficient resource allocation strategies are needed to maximize the effectiveness of their investments. Considering these resource limitations and the uncertain nature of the social returns to be realized from property acquisitions, CDCs face several complex decision problems, which can be categorized as being strategic or tactical.

The strategic decision problems for CDCs involve setting priorities for residential real estate investments and developing specific resource allocation plans for different geographical regions that comprise a given service area. These decisions typically consider a timeline of 1–3years into the future. The tactical decision problems, on the other hand, are short-term and are primarily related to the selection of particular foreclosed units for acquisition and redevelopment.

In this paper, we focus on the strategic resource allocation problem faced by CDCs, which, however, cannot be addressed independently from tactical decision problems. Strategic resource allocations need to consider potential availability and acquisitions of individual foreclosed units in the future, as well as the social impacts associated with these acquisitions which are all redeveloped and placed on market for sale. Given that all acquired properties are redeveloped, by acquisition we imply both the acquisition and redevelopment activities on a property unless noted otherwise in the paper. Another key issue is that all these decisions are made under uncertainty, as several relevant inputs for the decision making process are determined by the state of the local and national economy, which is inherently uncertain. For example, the number of foreclosures to occur in a given region over the planning horizon, the purchase price of a foreclosed property, as well as the value generated by an acquired property are directly related to the economic conditions, and thus are not known in advance. Our decision framework is intended to capture these complexities in determining optimal resource allocations to different geographical regions by considering the specific acquisition decisions to be made in response to different realizations of future uncertainty. To address these issues, we develop strategic resource allocation models under uncertainty, apply these multi-period stochastic models to a case study of a community-based organization, and discuss the solutions with respect to their policy implications and effectiveness.

Contributions of this research involve multiple dimensions. First, we note that we address an important decision problem that directly deals with effective management of public resources to improve social welfare, a central concern of public-sector operations research (Gass, 1994). Moreover, this policy-relevant application of decision modeling contributes to the scholarly body of work in community-focused operations research for housing and community development (Johnson, 2011). Second, the stochastic foreclosed housing acquisition models we develop are novel variants of stochastic resource allocation problems. These stochastic decision models are, to the best of our knowledge, the first in the area of private- or public-sector housing investment, for which we demonstrate that certain rule-based heuristics can perform quite well. As a third dimension, we note that we use data derived from CDC practice to rigorously apply and assess realistic problem instances. We demonstrate that our models, and the results derived from them, are generalizable to similar investment or resource allocation problems where the objectives may involve only financial returns.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In this section, we discuss the relevant literature separately for the methodological and practical components of our analysis.

The problem we study falls into the general category of strategic stochastic resource allocation problems. The literature on this broad theme is substantial with several applications and problem types. We summarize some relevant stochastic and dynamic models for resource allocation, and discuss their applicability to the problem we study. Mild (2004) provides a review on strategic resource allocation models specifically with a multicriteria structure, but no stochastic optimization model is presented. Some relevant stochastic models to our research include Loch and Kavadias (2002), where the authors develop a dynamic model for allocating resources to different new product development projects and identify analytical solutions by considering different types of return functions. Solak, Clarke, Johnson, and Barnes (2010) describe a stochastic programming approach to project portfolio management in the presence of endogenous uncertainty, which considers a single objective consisting of maximization of expected returns. In addition to these studies, Chalabi, Epsten, McKenna, and Claxton (2008) propose a two-stage stochastic mathematical programming formulation to optimally allocate resources within and between healthcare programs when there is an exogenous budget and the parameters of the healthcare models are uncertain. The analysis of Loch and Kavadias (2002) assumes theoretical distributions and is not applicable to our problem due to the existence of complex relationships modeling multiple objectives in our framework. Chalabi et al. (2008) limit their analysis to a small-scale two stage formulation without any algorithmic discussion or numerical analysis. In contrast to Solak et al. (2010), our study addresses multiple objectives, including a measure of social utility, and uses novel return functions.

As a stochastic resource allocation model with a multi-objective structure, Medaglia, Graves, and Ringuest (2007) describe allocating limited resources to R&D projects by considering multi-criteria under uncertainty. Cheng, Subrahmanian, and Westerberg (2003) propose an investment strategy model for firms based on two-stage multi-objective optimization framework. The problem formulation leads to a multi-objective Markov decision problem representation, which is used to define Pareto optimal design strategies. Our work extends the relatively limited scope of Medaglia et al. (2007), which is static and simulation based, and extends that of Cheng et al. (2003) through the use of multi-stage stochastic programming. While many other studies on stochastic resource allocation with different applications and modeling structures exist in the literature, complementary to these existing models, we develop a multi-stage stochastic programming approach to a strategic resource allocation problem involving multiple social objectives.

While foreclosures have many negative impacts on neighborhoods (Kingsley, Smith, & Price, 2009), data limitations generally result in analyses of property value impacts of foreclosures. Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak (2009) use regression analyses of house prices and extend their analysis to estimate the total lost value from properties proximate to a foreclosed unit. Harding, Rosenblatt, and Yao (2009) estimate different effects on sales of non-distressed properties also by using regression analysis and present findings related to specific features of neighborhoods, foreclosed units, or the surrounding market conditions. Harding et al. (2009), along with Schuetz, Been, and Ellen (2008), also assess the impact of multiple foreclosures in an area, where the authors conclude that the number of proximate foreclosures generally multiplies the effects on neighboring house prices. In contrast to these descriptive and exploratory studies, our prescriptive decision models are intended to mitigate these negative impacts.

There also exist some related works on CDCs and their involvement in housing markets through property acquisitions. Swanstrom, Chapple, and Immergluck (2009) describe acquisition strategies that CDCs employ to acquire and redevelop foreclosed housing, and NeighborWorks (2009) describes the difference of these strategies from those used for traditional community development. Key challenges encountered by CDCs during implementation of foreclosure acquisition and redevelopment strategies are investigated by Bratt (2009). Based on the observations from those studies, Simon (2009) describes some suggestions for CDCs and policy makers to implement. We add to this qualitative literature through a quantitative rigorous approach aimed to help CDCs in their long term strategic decision processes.

A relevant stream of research for the traditional housing market that focuses on purchasing strategies also exists. Such an analysis is performed by Drew, Skitmore, and Lo (2001), where the authors use regression analysis to measure competitiveness and offer a purchasing strategy model in selecting which properties to bid for. In another related paper, Yao and Zhang (2005) develop optimal dynamic portfolio decisions on housing investments for individual investors over a lifetime. Unlike these papers, we explicitly consider stochasticity in a portfolio model involving both near and long term decisions, as well as multiple objectives. Moreover, we specifically address both the budget allocation and foreclosed property acquisition decisions for CDCs with social objectives, which differs significantly from the decisions of an individual investor.

There are a few recent papers that directly address problems similar to those we study in this paper. These involve Johnson (2010), where the author describes the formulation and solution of a deterministic and static multi-objective integer program for foreclosed housing acquisition and redevelopment, applied to multifamily foreclosed housing in a small city. Bayram, Solak, Johnson, and Turcotte (2011a, 2011b) investigate optimal policies for resource allocation and foreclosed property acquisition under some restrictive assumptions such as dominancy, in which the social utility values of different property categories are assumed to follow a dominancy based relationship throughout the planning period. By building on the framework discussed in these papers, we model and analyze the dynamic stochastic decision process for nonprofit housing investments over multiple periods.

Consider a CDC making strategic decisions in advance of a planning horizon for their property acquisition investments. These decisions may involve prioritization and resource allocation to individual geographically distinct service areas, which we refer to as ‘neighborhoods’. It is assumed that the strategic resource allocation decisions will be made at the beginning of the planning horizon and certain information will become available over subsequent planning periods. Tactical acquisition decisions, i.e. those involving specific purchasing decisions for available properties, will be made based on this information as well as the probabilistic information on social and economic impacts of each acquisition. The resource in our problem refers to an available budget, while the planning periods are typically defined in years. Hence, such terms are used interchangeably throughout the paper.

A more specific representation of this general decision process is depicted visually in Fig. 1
                     , which can be described as follows. The decision maker, i.e. the CDC, initially decides on a tentative budget allocation to each neighborhood. Subsequently, properties become available for acquisition, i.e. foreclosures occur over time, and their acquisition costs become known to the CDC. Once this information is available, individual acquisition decisions are made under uncertain return characteristics. The process can continue for multiple periods where resource reallocations can take place based on any new information that becomes available. Hence, depending on the planning horizon considered, this process can be represented through a two-stage or multi-stage decision structure. The models we develop capture these different levels of complexity in the problem.

A key assumption in this strategic planning framework is that information on all foreclosed properties, particularly acquisition costs, in a particular planning period is available immediately after the resource allocation decision is made, and tactical acquisition decisions are made based on such information. In reality, however, real estate development is a dynamic process, and tactical acquisitions are performed over time as properties become available. Given the strategic planning nature of the problem and the relatively small gap in dynamic and static tactical decision making in this setting, we believe that this assumption does not detract significantly from the validity of the model.

The goal in the foreclosed housing acquisition problem (FHAP) is to decide on an initial strategic resource allocation plan such that an expected value function based on multiple potentially conflicting criteria is optimized. In other words, the problem is:

This vector of random parameters corresponds to costs, availabilities and returns of properties in the service area of a CDC. To allow for a tractable stochastic programming approach, we assume discrete distributions of these random parameters, and refer to each possible realization ψ
                     ∈
                     Ψ as a scenario with a corresponding probability p
                     
                        ψ
                     . Using this framework, we develop two stochastic programming approaches to the problem with different levels of complexity, which we describe in detail below. We note here that our models are based on interactions with CDCs, and are thus informed by an inclusive and cross-disciplinary view of community-oriented decision modeling.

First, we consider a basic strategic resource allocation framework that is typically applicable for annual planning. While an annual timeline may be short for most strategic planning problems, the CDC operations and specifically fund availabilities are strictly dependent on the condition of the economy and government policies. Hence, a very long strategic planning framework is not typical for these organizations. On the other hand, our general modeling framework is flexible enough to handle longer planning periods, and indeed the more advanced models in Section 5 are typically applicable to a multi-year planning structure. In FHAP with simple resource allocation, which we refer to as FHAP-S, we consider a planning horizon consisting of two decision periods where initially a budget allocation decision is made, followed by acquisition decisions determined according to realizations of foreclosed property availability, costs and expected returns.

We assume that a CDC can acquire units from a set of foreclosed properties 
                        
                           N
                        
                     . Each property is associated with a neighborhood 
                        
                           i
                           ∈
                           I
                        
                     , based on its geographic location, and a category 
                        
                           l
                           ∈

                     , based on a pre-defined categorization scheme such that properties in each category have similar characteristics some of which are stochastic and dependent on external market environments. The CDC wants to determine the optimal amount of budget x
                     
                        i

Model formulations for our decision framework involve several probabilistic and deterministic parameters. While we describe them in detail in this section, a summary list of these parameters is also provided in Online Supplement 2. In the following paragraphs, we discuss these model inputs, and based on analysis of numerical data obtained from a CDC, we note for each parameter as to why that parameter is treated in a deterministic or stochastic manner.

The uncertainty in the modeling framework is represented through the attributes of the property categories 
                              
                                 l

                           , which are defined by three stochastic parameters, corresponding to costs, returns and availabilities of foreclosed properties.

We let

                                          il
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               denote the acquisition and redevelopment cost for a category l property in neighborhood i under scenario ψ. Note that for clarity in notation, the scenario index ψ in the stochastic parameters is denoted as a subscript, while a superscript is used for decision variables.

The cost parameter 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          c
                                       
                                       
                                          ψ
                                       
                                       
                                          il
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               refers to the sum of the purchasing costs and estimated redevelopment costs for a property, and is defined by a probability distribution based on historical data. We justify the stochastic treatment of this parameter based on the variation in such costs, as experienced by the CDC we have obtained data from. A histogram analysis indicates that the variation is significant, and that the parameter values appear to follow a standard probability distribution. We demonstrate this for a specific category of properties within the service area of the CDC through a histogram included in Online Supplement 2. More specifically, we note for the given cost data that the acquisition and redevelopment costs lie approximately between $300,000 and $600,000 with some significant variance. Hence, a deterministic approximation is unlikely to be accurate, and a probability distribution, i.e. the triangular distribution, is likely to provide a quite accurate representation of these costs.

While the numerical analyses performed in Section 7 are based on data from 2011 where the economy was consistently in a poor state, dynamics based on the state of the economy and the markets are important in estimating the probability distribution of future acquisition and redevelopment costs. Clearly, an improving trend in the economy would imply a higher likelihood of higher costs, while a slowing economy would result in the opposite. The dynamic nature of residential property prices, which can be used as a proxy for the acquisition and redevelopment costs of foreclosed properties, is demonstrated in Online Supplement 2 through a plot of U.S. house prices over time. These dynamics can be captured in our modeling framework by defining scenario probabilities such that they reflect potential trending effects due to market factors.

The second stochastic parameter 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          μ
                                       
                                       
                                          ψ
                                       
                                       
                                          il
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               denotes the social return from the acquisition of a category l property in neighborhood i under scenario ψ. Estimating the social return from the acquisition and redevelopment of a foreclosed property is clearly difficult. Johnson, Solak, Drew, and Keisler (2013) highlight this challenge, and develop a measure validated by some CDCs, which is based on the impact of the acquisition of a foreclosed property on the appreciation of the value of nearby properties. More formally, the property value impact (PVI) measure is defined as the expected impact on proximate property values from a given foreclosure. This measure is directly related to the geographical location of a property, and can easily be calculated for each foreclosed property through a procedure described by Johnson et al. (2013). While any social return measure can be used when implementing the decision models, we utilize the PVI values to represent the social returns from the acquisition of a foreclosed property in our empirical analysis.

Similar to the acquisition and redevelopment costs, the probability distribution of PVI values is defined based on an analysis of historical data obtained from the CDC we worked with. First, we note that a statistical analysis of costs and PVI values has shown almost no correlation between the two within the same category of properties, hence the stochastic process for social returns is assumed to be independent of the costs in the numerical study discussed later in the paper. This is demonstrated through a plot in Online Supplement 2. We then analyze how PVI values vary for a set of properties considered for potential acquisition by the partner CDC, which is also demonstrated through a histogram included in Online Supplement 2, justifying a stochastic treatment of this parameter. As it is shown in the figure, the standardized PVI values in analyzed CDC data vary between values of 0.86 and 1.0 following a standard probability distribution. This was assessed to be a significant difference by the CDC staff, especially given the relevance of the social return objective.

As the final stochastic parameter, we let

                                          ψ
                                       
                                       
                                          il
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               refer to the total required budget to acquire all properties of category l available for acquisition in neighborhood i under scenario ψ.

The stochasticity in this parameter is due to the inherent uncertainty in the housing market and the overall economy. Note that the definition of 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          θ
                                       
                                       
                                          ψ
                                       
                                       
                                          il
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               implicitly represents the number of foreclosed properties of category l available for acquisition in neighborhood i, as the cost of each property in a given category is assumed to have the same probability distribution. Hence, a high realization of this parameter would correspond to a high rate of foreclosures occurring for the corresponding category of properties in a given neighborhood. The stochastic treatment of this parameter is also based on CDC data involving the transitions of properties in different pre-foreclosure stages to foreclosed status over a given period. These transition probabilities, derived from historical property data, are described in detail in Johnson et al. (2013). Given the current pre-foreclosure stage information for the properties and using the transition probability structures, a probability distribution defining the number of properties in a neighborhood that will be in foreclosed status in the next period can be derived. Such a probability distribution for a given category and neighborhood is included in Online Supplement 2, which indicates an exponential distribution for the parameter.

                              , which correspond to the acquisition and redevelopment costs and the total required budget to acquire all properties of category l in neighborhood i. When the housing market or the economy worsens, property values are expected to decrease, which should normally imply that the total required budget to acquire all foreclosed properties would also decrease. At the same time, however, there is a negative correlation between number of foreclosures and property prices as shown through an empirical analysis by McDonald and Stokes (2012). Thus, the reduced property prices due to a worsening economy would also imply an increase in the number of foreclosed properties. This could result in an increase in the total required budget to acquire all properties. Given this interplay between the costs and the number of foreclosures, the correlation between

                               can be either negative or positive. We capture such correlation in our modeling framework by considering scenarios that reflect both types of correlation, and assigning appropriate probabilities to each scenario based on the likelihood of each type of correlation. The positive correlation case corresponds to the situations where the property prices are high and at the same time there is a high number of foreclosures, or vice versa, i.e. low costs and low number of foreclosures. Based on an analysis by Chen (2009), we assume that the total likelihood of these cases is 0.2. Hence, the negative correlation cases of low cost-high required budget and high cost-low required budget outcomes have a total probability of 0.8. The numerical analyses described in Section 7 have been implemented under these assumptions on the correlation between the two parameters.

In addition to the stochastic parameters described above, several deterministic inputs representing neighborhood and category properties are used as part of the modeling framework.

One deterministic parameter is ϕ

                              , which corresponds to the expected financial return from the sale of an acquired category l property in neighborhood i. In other words, this is the expected revenue in excess of costs associated with the eventual sale of a foreclosed property that has been acquired and redeveloped to a defined community standard.

We assume for modeling purposes that the financial returns ϕ
                              
                                 il
                               from an acquired property are deterministic. This is mostly a reasonable assumption as financial returns from acquired properties are typically better estimated than social returns, especially considering the 1–2year timeline used in the problem definition. In addition, these profit amounts are typically constant for each category of properties. More specifically, the profit amount is determined by adding a specific dollar amount on the total acquisition and redevelopment cost of a property before its sale, as opposed to a percentage. The specific planned profit amounts are determined by CDC management. Hence, financial returns in general are independent of the costs incurred for a property, and they only vary over different neighborhoods or categories of properties. To demonstrate the mostly constant structure of the financial returns, in Online Supplement 2 we provide a plot of the financial returns realized through a set of historical acquisitions by the CDC from which we obtained historical acquisition data.

Another important measure assumed to be deterministic in the model is the collective efficacy measure for a given neighborhood i, which is denoted as e
                              
                                 i
                              . The collective efficacy e
                              
                                 i
                               is defined by Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls (1997) as the social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good. While this measure is hard to quantify and typically based on expert opinions, we include it in the model as a strategic value measure through which we attempt to capture the benefits from a property’s location that relate to the CDC’s mission and objectives for property redevelopment. Network relationships mediated by the collective efficacy of residents are important for neighborhoods, as Morenoff, Sampson, and Raudenbush (2001) state that violent activities involving crime is related to the collective efficacy of a neighborhood. More specifically, the authors note that criminal activities can be ecologically concentrated because of the absence of guardianship defined by the collective efficacy level of a neighborhood. Based on this analysis, we construct an approximation to collective efficacy using neighborhood-level crime data. Given that crime statistics for a neighborhood are fixed and known, we naturally assume this measure to be a deterministic parameter.

The modeling framework utilizes some additional deterministic inputs which are mostly based on fixed quantitative information describing neighborhood attributes. We describe these parameters below.

In order to model the fact that not all acquired properties might be redeveloped and sold within the planning horizon, we introduce the parameter r
                              
                                 il
                               denoting the probability that a category l property in neighborhood i will be sold within a given time frame. While it is assumed that all acquired properties will be redeveloped and sold over time, it may be that the CDC will consider a shorter planning horizon for some return related parameters, during which not all properties might be sold. Such dynamics play a more significant role in the more complex models we study later in the paper. This probability is estimated based on historical sales data, and used to reflect the projected impact of acquisitions on home ownership in a neighborhood, as redeveloped properties are typically sold to owner occupants only. Given that the period length used to determine this probability, and thus the probability r
                              
                                 il
                              , can vary based on the return type, we append the notation for r
                              
                                 il
                               with a superscript corresponding to the return type. To this end, we let 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          r

                               denote the probability used for owner occupancy modeling purposes, and also define o
                              
                                 i

                               as the current number of owner occupied and total number of properties in a given neighborhood i, respectively. Similarly, we define

                               are obtained through past property sales ratios, and are fixed and known by definition.

Finally, d
                              
                                 ij
                               is used to denote the distance between two neighborhoods i and j, which will be utilized as part of an objective involving the allocation of the budget in a way that would take advantage of synergistic effects of investing in proximate neighborhoods. We note here that the distance between neighborhoods is an ambiguous notion, which in this paper is approximated as the straight-line distance between centroids of two neighborhoods. Thus, by definition it is a deterministic parameter. In addition, by synergistic effects we mean a social value arising between certain number of properties that produce a value greater than the sum of their individual PVI values, which we discuss further as part of objective descriptions in Section 4.2.

In addition to the budget allocation decisions x
                        
                           i
                         and the tactical acquisition decisions 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                                 
                                    il
                                 
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                              
                           
                         which were defined above, a set of additional decision variables are also utilized in the model formulation. To this end, we first define 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    z
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                              
                           
                         as the unused budget allocated to neighborhood i in scenario ψ. This variable will be used as part of an objective to maximize expected budget utilization, noting that having any unused funds would imply that the resources are not being utilized.

All other variables used in the formulation are auxiliary variables that help define different objectives and constraints. Of these, y
                        
                           ij
                         relates the investments in neighborhoods i and j with respect to the distance between the neighborhoods. R
                        
                           ψ
                         and S
                        
                           ψ
                        , on the other hand, define the minimum expected home ownership rate and minimum allocation rate over all neighborhoods for scenario ψ. The allocation rate in the definition of S
                        
                           ψ
                         refers to the ratio of the budget allocated to a given neighborhood over the observed value of available housing units for acquisition in that neighborhood.

Using the notation described above, we model FHAP-S as a two stage stochastic integer programming problem. In this recourse model, the first-stage decisions involve x
                        
                           i
                        , i.e. the allocation of budgets to each neighborhood, and the auxiliary variables y
                        
                           ij
                        . Once the components of the random vector Ψ corresponding to costs and availability of properties are realized, the tactical acquisition decisions are made as defined by the second stage variables 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    h
                                 
                                 
                                    il

                         and

                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                              
                           
                        . While it is assumed that the returns

                                    ψ
                                 
                                 
                                    il
                                 
                              
                           
                         from the acquired properties will be realized further into the future, no decisions are assumed to be made after the return realizations. Hence, we incorporate the stochasticity in the returns by considering the expected returns for each scenario. The corresponding scenario tree for FHAP-S is illustrated in Fig. 2
                        , where the dark rectangles represent the decision nodes. This assumption is relaxed in the more comprehensive models described in the later sections. Based on this framework, the multi-objective two-stage stochastic integer programming formulation for FHAP-S is as follows:

                        =1,…,7, which we describe in detail below. Note that our solution methods for FHAP-S, as well as its variants and extensions, are applied to a single-objective version of this model using a weighted representation of the objectives with weights where the weights are determined by the decision maker. On the other hand, other multi-objective frameworks can be considered for the optimization as well.

As noted above, our optimization model includes seven types of objectives, which reflect different goals involving maximization of overall socio-economic utility and equity through the decisions made. These objectives were developed based on consultations with CDCs. Modeling of the objectives requires introduction of various constraints, which we also describe below.

The first and second objectives shown in (2) constitute the first stage objective function, which implies that they are only a function of the first stage variables, i.e. the resource allocation decisions. Objective 1 is an equity related objective defined according to neighborhood-level collective efficacy measures introduced in Section 4.1. This objective, similar to those of Leclerc, McLay, and Mayorga (2011), maximizes total collective efficacy of a budget allocation strategy over all neighborhoods by allocating higher budgets to neighborhoods with relatively lower efficacy values. This is ensured by the ratio 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          x
                                       
                                       
                                          i
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          e
                                       
                                       
                                          i
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         in the objective definition. Given the efficacy measures e
                        
                           i
                         for each neighborhood, the ratio will be maximized if larger x
                        
                           i
                         values are assigned to neighborhoods with lower e
                        
                           i
                         levels.

Objective 2 is a utility objective related to the economies of scale and aims to maximize efficiencies associated with proximity of acquired units. The objective is modeled through the variable y
                        
                           ij
                         and the constraint (4). The structure of the objective involves the minimization of a function of the total distance between neighborhoods to which resources are allocated. This is achieved by the maximization of the y
                        
                           ij
                         values, for which larger x
                        
                           i
                         and x
                        
                           j
                         values need to be assigned for neighborhoods i and j that are geographically closer, i.e. where d
                        
                           ij
                         is small. The utility of having more acquisitions in proximate neighborhoods is mainly due to ease of managing redevelopment activities in nearby regions. In addition, if the acquired properties are closer to each other, then it also becomes more convenient to locate municipal services.

The remaining five objectives correspond to the second stage objective function as shown in (5), as their values depend on the realization of the uncertain parameters. Objective 3 is another equity related objective and involves the maximization of the minimum allocation rate, i.e. the ratio of the budget allocated to a given neighborhood and realized value of available housing units for acquisition to provide equitable service to different neighborhoods. This is modeled through constraint (6), the structure of which implies that S
                        
                           ψ
                         will be maximized if the ratio on the left hand side is as high and close as possible for all neighborhoods.

Objective 4 is a utility objective and considers the financial returns from the resource allocation strategy by maximizing the total expected profit based on the financial return structures for each category of housing. This is a relevant objective for CDC operations, despite the fact that CDCs are nonprofit organizations. This is because any financial profits made in the current planning period will enable more acquisitions in the future.

Objective 5 ensures the social utility maximization of a foreclosed housing acquisition strategy, where social utility is based on the social return measure 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    μ
                                 
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                                 
                                    il
                                 
                              
                           
                         defined for each category of housing in each neighborhood. As noted previously, we adapt a social return measure based on the impact of the acquisitions on the values of nearby properties.

Objective 6 represents an equity related goal based on owner occupation rates in neighborhoods. Maximization of owner occupied housing units in each neighborhood is one of the missions of CDCs (Galster, Levy, Sawyer, Temkin, & Walker, 2005), and this objective tries to achieve it in an equitable way by maximizing the minimum owner occupation rate among neighborhoods. The objective structure is modeled through constraint (7), where expected increase in the number of owner occupied properties in a neighborhood is defined in the numerator on the left hand side of the constraint. The increase is based on the probability 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    r
                                 
                                 
                                    il
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                           
                         that a property in a specific category will be sold to an owner occupant within a pre-defined period, where the length of this period is dependent on a CDC’s overall goals with regard to owner occupancy. Maximizing R
                        
                           ψ
                         would imply a more evenly distributed owner occupancy rates among neighborhoods after the acquisitions.

Finally, Objective 7 ensures that the available budget is utilized in the most efficient manner across different scenarios. To this end, constraint (8) defines the variable 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    z
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 
                                    ψ
                                 
                              
                           
                        , which corresponds to any unused portion of the allocated budget to a neighborhood. Hence, the expression 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          ∑

                         in (5) is the ratio of unused budget to the total value of available properties for a given scenario.

In addition to the constraints described above, the optimization model involves constraints (3) and (9), which are the budget and availability constraints, respectively. Note that the formulation also involves the nonnegativity and integrality requirements for the corresponding decision variables as shown in objective functions (2) and (5).

This model reflects fundamental policy-analytic concerns with tradeoffs between efficiency, effectiveness and equity (Bardach, 2005), as well as an understanding of policy and practice in foreclosure mitigation activity derived from observations of specific CDCs. In addition, observing that the expectation in (2) can be represented through the scenario probabilities p
                        
                           ψ

                        k′, we may analyze the corner points of the Pareto frontier associated with a solution to FHAP-S. In addition to such an implementation, we also generate estimates of the Pareto frontier associated with aggregations of various FHAP-S objectives through an application of the constraint method (Collette & Siarry, 2003) later in the paper.

The second model we consider for FHAP has an improved representation of the resource allocation decision process. While this representation is more realistic as it considers potential reallocation of budget depending on gradual realization of information on the economy and its impacts on neighborhoods, the resulting model is a more complex multi-stage stochastic integer programming problem.

The multi-stage decision process that involves gradual resolution of uncertainty is depicted in Fig. 3
                     . We assume a longer strategic planning timeline consisting of two budgeting periods, e.g. two years, with a pooled budget to be allocated over the two periods. Such a strategic decision timeline has been observed to be used by CDCs (Frisch & Servon, 2006). Given the longer planning horizon of two years, a CDC can perform better planning by taking into account the learning effects that will take place over time. More specifically, the state of the economy and market conditions two years into the future will be better estimated in the next year based on realized conditions in the first year. Hence, a model that captures such dynamics is likely to be more valuable when deciding on optimal budget allocations. We further describe gradual uncertainty realization through a demonstration of the concept in Online Supplement 3. At the beginning of the planning horizon, i.e. in the first decision epoch, initial resource allocation decisions for each neighborhood are made separately for each of the next two years. Foreclosed properties then become available for potential acquisition along with the associated costs, and acquisition decisions are made in the second decision epoch based on the social return distribution information available at that time. It is assumed that additional new information on returns will be revealed after the second decision epoch based on the state of the economy, which will be followed by a potential reallocation of second year resource allocations, as well as new allocations of any unused budgets and realized returns from any sales in the first year. These represent the decisions in the third decision epoch, while in the fourth epoch acquisitions for the second budgeting period will be performed after new availability and cost information becomes known. We note here that the realizations of the cost parameters in the second period are dependent on the social return, i.e. PVI realizations in the first period. More specifically, a high PVI value in the first period would imply a higher appreciation of house prices which is then reflected in the acquisition costs of foreclosed properties in the same area in the second period. Hence, scenarios for the stochastic programming formulation are defined according to this dependent structure.

In the current formulation structure, it is assumed that budget allocation and reallocations are made annually over a two year planning period. A relevant issue involves the impacts of a more dynamic setting in which these decisions are made at more epochs, potentially associated with the acquisition/sale of a property or the fluctuation in market. First, we note with respect to the problem formulation that the model is amenable to the introduction of additional fixed decision epochs involving budget allocation and reallocation decisions, albeit with significant additional computational complexity. On the other hand, any such epochs would need to be exogenous and at fixed time periods. This is due to the challenges associated with having either endogenous or random decision epochs in stochastic programming frameworks. From a practical perspective, we note that budget allocations/reallocations are assumed to be dependent on social return realizations from acquisitions, and the realization of returns typically requires a considerable time delay after the acquisition of a property. In the current model setup, this time delay is assumed to be on average 6months. If more budget allocation/reallocation epochs are introduced, there may not be much value added due to no new information becoming available in between such epochs.

Based on the description above, we expand the notation used in Section 4 by referring to the first stage allocation variables as x
                     
                        iρ
                      where ρ
                     ∈{1,2} refers to the planning period. Note that x
                     
                        i2 represents the tentative allocations for period two made at the first decision epoch. This tentative allocation can be changed in the third decision epoch, as represented through variables

                        i
                      is introduced for the costs associated with budget reallocation to/from a given neighborhood i. This reallocation cost corresponds to variable overhead and other expenses due to changes in the initial allocated budgets to neighborhoods. We include the minimization of the expected value of this cost as a new objective and associate it with the weighting parameter λ

The constraints in the above formulation have a similar structure as FHAP-S except that they are defined both for the first and second planning periods, where the first period involves decision epochs I and II, and the second period involves decision epochs III and IV. The constraints also reflect the relationships between the two planning periods. More specifically, constraint (16) is the revised budget constraint which ensures that the sum of resource allocations to neighborhoods do not exceed the initially available budget B. Constraint (17) defines the variables y in relation to Objective 2 in the second period, where the numerator

                      represents the final second period allocation to neighborhood i at decision epoch III. Through the same allocation representation, constraint (18) is used to define Objective 3 for the second period, which involves maximization of the minimum allocation rate over neighborhoods. Note that constraint (18) involves an approximation where previous allocation decisions are only implicitly considered and not endogenously modeled in the denominator of the left hand side of the constraint. This is because second stage property availability should also take into account any remaining properties from the first period, i.e. the denominator in (18) should be

                     . However, this gives rise to a nonlinear and nonconvex structure, which we approximate by assuming that the second period availability will be exogenously determined, taking into account any potential remaining properties. In Section 6 we remove this assumption and reformulate the original model through a piecewise linear approximation approach.

The objective related to home ownership for the second period is modeled by constraint (19), which involves an endogenous structure as it captures the impact of previous period sales and new foreclosures in defining the owner occupancy rate. This is done by updating the number of owner occupied units in the numerator through the addition of number of sold properties as defined by the probability

                     , and the subtraction of the number of new foreclosures. Similar to its first period counterpart, constraint (20) represents the amount of unused budget in period two. More specifically, the amount of unused budget in neighborhood i is the difference between the final second period allocation of

                     . The inequality (21) is the availability constraint for the second period, modeling the fact that the number of acquisitions is limited by the available number of foreclosed properties. As a new constraint, (22) ensures that reallocations in the second period are feasible given the tentative allocations. The right hand side of this constraint represents the newly available funds for the second period, which corresponds to the sum of any unused budget in the first period and the financial returns from any property sales that might have occurred before the budget reallocation time, while the variables on the left hand side correspond to the reallocation decisions.

Constraints (23) are the nonanticipativity constraints for this multi-stage problem, which impose the condition that scenarios that share the same history at a decision epoch also make the same decisions during that history. Note that nonanticipativity is implied for the first decision epoch as the same variable definitions are used for all scenarios. Moreover, the fourth stage decisions are independent for each scenario, so no nonanticipativity requirements exist at that stage. Hence, explicit nonanticipativity representation is required for the second and third decision epochs only. Since these two epochs correspond to the first and second periods respectively, we utilize the period index in defining these constraints.

In this section we present two extensions to the core FHAP models presented. These variations of the model are used to capture some additional complexities that may exist in different practical settings.

In this section we consider a different and more complex return structure for the two FHAP models by including synergistic effects that can be realized based on the number of acquisitions or the amount of investment in a given neighborhood. Such synergistic effects, specifically in social returns, have been discussed in the literature and also have been typically observed in practice (Bhide, 1993; Damodaran, 2005). Moreover, Harding et al. (2009) show that the contagion effect is a nonincreasing convex function of the number of foreclosures. This result implies that social returns can be considered as nondecreasing concave functions of the acquired foreclosed units. Hence, we expand our models to include this aspect by modeling the effect of acquisition decisions on social return characterizations. However, due to the introduction of new constraints and binary variables, the complexity of the resulting problem is increased.

To model this investment dependent return structure, we assume that the social returns

                        . The corresponding return structure has the following pattern: as the acquisition ratio in a property category and neighborhood increases, the return also increases up to a threshold level τ
                        1 and then remains constant in the range (τ
                        1, τ
                        2). If the acquisition ratio exceeds τ

                         is realized for each scenario. We note here that while the structure of these return functions has been justified through practical discussions in the literature, there is no empirical evidence as to what the typical values for τ
                        1 and τ
                        2 should be for PVI based return functions. These parameters need to be subjectively defined by CDC practitioners, similar to what was done for our numerical implementations. On the other hand, we have also performed a sensitivity analysis around these parameter values as described in Online Supplement 4.

Using this notation, it is possible to incorporate the investment dependent return structure into the two models as follows. For a more general representation, we show the modifications required for FHAP-G and describe how they would differ for FHAP-S. The first modification involves the changes in the social return objective corresponding to the weighting parameter λ

Constraints (25) and (26) ensure the realization of the joint return for the two periods if the acquisition ratio is greater than the threshold level τ
                        2. The piecewise structure of the return is modeled through constraints (27) and (28) due to the maximization objective involving the social returns. Constraint (29) represents the nonanticipativity constraints for the newly introduced variables as discussed above.

The second extension we introduce applies to FHAP-G only, and deals with the reformulation of constraint (18) which corresponds to one of the equity objectives in the model. Although this new extension adds to the complexity of the formulation, it is a more accurate representation of the equity objective as described in Section 5.

As noted previously, when remaining property information from the first planning period is included in the denominator on the left hand side of constraint (18), i.e. if the denominator is

                        , the resulting constraint is nonlinear and nonconvex. We deal with this issue by convexifying the model through a piecewise linear approximation of the nonlinear terms as follows. The nonlinear constraint can be rewritten as

While different versions of FHAP can potentially be solved using direct solutions of the deterministic equivalents for small number of scenarios, this becomes intractable for slight increases in the number of scenarios, especially for the enhanced formulations described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. To this end, we introduce two heuristic approaches that simplify the solution process for the FHAP models, with the aim of establishing practical and efficient solution structures for CDCs that they can use more easily during potential implementations. We discuss the computational implications of these simplifications in the numerical analyses performed in Section 7.

In the first heuristic approach (Heuristic-1), we assume that given a budget allocation to a neighborhood, the property acquisitions from each category will be proportionally based on the availability in that category. In other words, acquisition levels are likely to be high for categories with high availability levels. This is reasonable from a practical perspective since CDCs would typically desire to acquire more housing units from categories and neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates.

The heuristic involves the solution of the corresponding FHAP models with these fixed relationships among the variable values. On the other hand, due to the integrality of the acquisition variables

                        , it is not possible to fix the acquisition variable values directly as a function of resource allocations x
                        
                           i
                        . Hence, we represent these conditions through inequality constraints, rather than using equalities, which is further described below. For presentation purposes, we describe the steps of the heuristic approaches by referring to FHAP-S and then state how they would differ for FHAP-G:

In the second heuristic simplification (Heuristic-2), we assume that property acquisitions in each scenario will be made proportionally among categories based on the ratios of expected social return over cost, which we refer to as ‘marginal social return’. Hence, more acquisitions will be performed from categories with larger marginal social return values. This approach is intuitively and practically reasonable due to the nonprofit nature of CDCs and the role of social returns in their decision making. Note that we implicitly assume the availability in each category will be such that the allocation scheme is feasible. The implementation of Heuristic-2 is very similar to the first heuristic, except that the constraints (38) to be added are replaced with the following set of constraints:

As part of the adaptation of the above modifications into FHAP-G, first the same constraints are defined for period one. In addition, similar constraints are also included for period two by updating the notation of the acquisition and allocation variables, as well as the uncertain parameter realizations, with their corresponding second period counterparts.

In this section, we implement and assess the value of our models in a real-life decision making situation using data obtained from a CDC located in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. This CDC has expressed an interest in decision aids to help them improve their capacity for longer-term strategy design related to foreclosed housing acquisition and redevelopment. To test the value of our models in practice we first formally establish a benchmark case based on the current implementations used by the CDC that we have worked with. We then demonstrate how our models would add value to the strategic resource allocation decisions of this CDC and potentially other CDCs operating in similar environments. Our analyses involve both policy implications for the results obtained from the solutions of the models, especially as compared to the currently used benchmark case, as well as some computational issues related to the optimization models.

As part of our description of the benchmark case, we specify the neighborhood and property categorization schemes used by the CDC, data collection process, and the model parameter settings as obtained directly from the CDC. We discuss each of these areas separately below. The details of the current decision process used by the CDC is described later in Section 7.2.

For their current decision making processes, the CDC considers two distinct geographical regions within their service area, which are shown in Fig. 5
                           a. These regions are established based on the poverty rates in the two areas, which also coincides with a geographical split based on a major road extending from north to south. An alternative poverty based split, which is not currently utilized but previously thought of by the CDC, considers another major road extending from east to west within the service area. This alternative split results in four distinct neighborhoods as shown in Fig. 5b, and it has been noted that poverty rates in each of these neighborhoods show similar characteristics as well. We note that the service area of the CDC is relatively small, i.e. approximately 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles, and thus any larger number of categories of neighborhoods (e.g. 5 or more) was not deemed practical by the CDC staff.

The second dimension of categorization involves grouping of properties based on their common characteristics. While no such formal categorization is being used by the CDC due to the ad hoc process they use in acquiring properties, it has been noted by the CDC staff that a valid acquisition and categorization measure for them is the property value impact. As noted previously, PVI corresponds to the expected impacts on proximate property values from a given foreclosure. Hence, PVI reflects a relative measure over the properties available for potential acquisition, where it is natural to assume that the closer the PVI values for given properties, the likelier it is for them to have similar attribute values. The categorizations of properties in the numerical study have been determined by considering their PVI values. In consultations with the CDC staff, we assume two alternative categorizations for the types of properties to be acquired. In one case, the potential properties are categorized into two groups, i.e. low and high PVI properties, while four distinct categories of properties are defined in the other alternative, i.e. low, medium, high, very high PVI properties. While any number of levels can be used for PVI based categorization, the limited number of properties from each category in the service area precludes the consideration of a larger number of classes (e.g. 5 or more).

Overall, based on the current practical setup, we define two alternative decision frameworks for the CDC by letting i
                           =1, 2 and l
                           =1, 2 in one implementation, and i
                           =1, 2, 3, 4 and l
                           =1, 2, 3, 4 in another implementation. We refer to these as “Case 2×2” and “Case 4×4”, respectively. The geographical representations of the two cases, along with sample foreclosed property availability counts, are shown in Fig. 5. We note that from a modeling perspective, any number of categories can be used, e.g. 2×3, 3×5, etc., without any impact on the model parameters or the formulation structure. However, with small service areas of CDCs, most practical instances are not likely to have categorization schemes larger than 4 levels in either dimension.

For both Case 2×2 and Case 4×4, empirical data was gathered to generate the specific problem instances based on available information and expert opinions. Two main data sets were used for this purpose. The first data set, obtained directly from the CDC, consisted of information on properties being considered for potential acquisition by the CDC in 2011. This information involved estimates of acquisition and redevelopment costs for the properties, and estimated financial returns from property sales. The second data set was obtained from the authors of Johnson et al. (2013) and involved property value impact calculations for all the properties available for acquisition in the CDC’s service area. Model inputs for the numerical study were then created based on information extracted from these data sets. For each parameter considered, histograms and other data displays were plotted as shown in Online Supplement 2 to study the variation and correlation structures in the data sets. Based on these, acquisition and redevelopment costs, total required budget to acquire all properties of a given category in a neighborhood, and social returns (represented by standardizing the PVI values to vary between 0 and 1), were taken as stochastic parameters, while financial returns were treated in a deterministic manner.

To characterize the uncertainty in the random parameters of cost, availability, i.e. total required budget to acquire all properties, and social return for each property category in each neighborhood, two-point probability distributions were used. To this end, low and high realizations were computed as the values of the first and third quartiles for each parameter under consideration. Given their exogenous dependence on the economy, we assume in the implementations that the realizations of a parameter for the same category are at the same level across all neighborhoods. For example, if the cost value of a category l in a given neighborhood i is realized as ‘low’, then the cost of category l in another neighborhood j is also realized as ‘low’. The set of data showing possible cost, availability and return values for Case 2×2 of FHAP-S is included in Online Supplement 5. The scenarios for the stochastic program were then generated by considering all possible combinations of the different levels of the stochastic parameters in the model. The probability for each scenario was calculated by taking into account the correlation between 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       c
                                    
                                    
                                       ψ
                                    
                                    
                                       il
                                    
                                 
                              
                            and 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       θ
                                    
                                    
                                       ψ
                                    
                                    
                                       il
                                    
                                 
                              
                            values as described in Section 4.1, and by assuming that the social return realizations are independent from the realizations of these two parameters, where the low and high values for the latter were assigned an equal probability of occurring. Given that the number of stochastic parameters in each model configuration is different, the number of scenarios and thus the complexity of models varies as well. We describe the number of scenarios in each problem configuration in Section 7.4.

A total budget value of $5 million was used in the implementations, which is representative of the resources accessible by the particular CDC considered, while values for community efficacy were generated by normalizing relative crime rate information in each neighborhood so that the values have a range between 0 and 1. Distances between neighborhoods were estimated through existing Geographic Information System (GIS) data. Finally, social return function thresholds for FHAP-G were defined based on expert opinions resulting from consultations with CDC staff. The specific values of the deterministic parameters used in the study are summarized in Online Supplement 5 for Case 2×2.

In this section we study the potential value that can be added to CDC operations by applying the optimization models presented in the paper. This is done by comparing the results from the optimization models with the objective levels to be achieved when a resource allocation structure as in the current practice is assumed. To this end, we first discuss the current situation and define the benchmark decision process, and then describe the estimated value and implementability of the proposed optimization based solutions:

Resource allocations to different neighborhoods for our CDC partner did not follow a systematic procedure, and involved an ad hoc process, which typically meant equal resource allocations to different parts of their service area. The allocated amounts were then used to acquire foreclosed properties again through an ad hoc process. Hence, we assess the differences from an optimal strategy by representing the current situation through a setup such that the available budget is split equally among different neighborhoods. The current ad hoc property acquisition process after resource allocations is represented through three alternative configurations, given that there is no specific system that the CDC utilizes for this purpose. We refer to these representations as: (1) equal allocation-highest return, (2) equal allocation-lowest cost, and (3) equal allocation-optimal acquisition.

In equal allocation-highest return, we assume that after the budget is allocated equally among neighborhoods, CDC prioritizes properties with the higher return values in their acquisitions. In other words, first the highest return properties are aimed for acquisition, followed by the next highest if budget still remains, etc. The equal allocation-lowest cost strategy assumes that the prioritization is based on costs of properties, and lower cost properties are acquired first. Finally, equal allocation-optimal acquisition configuration assumes that the acquisition decisions are determined optimally based on the objective structure in the models. Note that the equal allocation-optimal acquisition strategy would result in the best possible value for the CDC given an equally split budget during the allocation phase. Hence, the difference between the corresponding objective values in this case and the optimal solutions constitutes a lower bound for the value of application of optimization models developed.

Given the representation of the current situation above, we calculated the corresponding utility in each benchmark case for our test instances which are defined by the data obtained from the CDC. We then compare these benchmark utility values with those obtained through the proposed optimization procedures. In Table 1
                            we show these comparisons under FHAP-S and FHAP-G implementations. The objective values have been standardized so that the optimal solutions correspond to an objective value of 1.0, reflecting the ideal case. As highlighted above, the equal allocation cases represent the current practice. For FHAP-S, entries of which are in regular font in Table 1, optimization through our modeling framework can be observed to result in an increase of between 10% and 20% in the overall value of foreclosed housing acquisition policies. Of the specific objectives, the most significant impact is on Objectives 4 and 5, which correspond to maximization of financial returns and social utility, respectively.

The value of proposed optimal solutions over the current practice increases for the FHAP-G model, as shown through the entries in bold font in Table 1. This is expected, as the uncertainty is captured in a more accurate fashion in this implementation. For FHAP-G, a difference of between 20% and 30% is observed between the current practice and optimal policies. Again, the most significant value is added through the financial and social utility objectives, implying that equity is achieved at a somewhat high level under the current practical implementations. In Table 2
                            we show the differences in financial and social returns under different implementations in terms of dollar values. Each data column in the table displays the difference between the expected return of a given policy and the lowest expected return among all policies. For example, in the last column we see that equal allocation-lowest cost policy would create the lowest social return as measured through the PVI values. By using the optimal policy that we propose, the CDC can create an additional value of around $600,000 in property value impacts in their service area when compared with the equal allocation-optimal acquisition policy. By the nature of the restricted financial return structure, the gains in financial returns are lower. Overall, however, the gains through optimization can be consistently observed for all cases, especially in terms of social returns. In Online Supplement 4 we describe the implications of the optimal resource allocation decisions and how changes in different problem parameters impact these decisions.

Our modeling and solutions are aimed to serve as a decision aid for the CDC in making strategic budget allocations to different neighborhoods in their service area – while maximizing total utility as defined by the multiple objectives highlighted to be important for the CDC. The implementation requirements for this decision aid involve the availability of a mathematical modeling and solution platform, as well as the specification of the input data. The models will be run each time the strategic budget allocation process is initiated, and solutions will provide a guideline for these allocations by considering the uncertainty in future cost and return realizations. Hence, any generated budget allocation guideline will be feasible and practically implementable. On the other hand, it is possible that additional qualitative information such as political factors might need to be considered before a final strategic resource allocation decision is made. In such cases, the model results would still be valuable as a benchmark on the best budget allocation strategy. In addition, it can be noted that while the focus of the model is not the tactical acquisitions, the simple heuristic acquisition strategies proposed as part of the modeling framework are also implementable and potentially valuable from the CDCs perspective.

As part of our analysis of the impact of using different objectives, which was observed to be of interest to the CDC studied, we consider two trade-off situations in FHAP. These situations deal with financial versus nonfinancial goals, and equity versus utility objectives. These issues are especially relevant and unique to our analysis due to the social dimensions involved in the optimization. We emphasize here that our analyses are numerical and experimental. Hence, any conclusions are based on the real-world data obtained from the CDC we interacted with. On the other hand, it can potentially be assumed that similar conclusions are likely to be reached for organizations operating in scales similar to this CDC, as there is anecdotal evidence that the CDC studied can be representative of typical CDC operations in other major cities (NeighborWorks, 2009).

We first analyze how financial objective optimization in FHAP relates to nonfinancial objective optimization. In this analysis, the profit objective, i.e. Objective 4, is categorized as financial, while all other objectives are categorized as nonfinancial measures. We apply the constraint method of Collette and Siarry (2003) to these two aggregate objectives, and the result of this analysis is Pareto curves representing the trade-offs between the two categories. Fig. 6
                         contains Pareto curves for the base cases of FHAP-S and FHAP-G.

Our main observation is that the trade-off is not so significant and thus inclusion of financial objectives in FHAP do not detract much from the social and equity based objectives. This is especially the case for FHAP-S, where only two decision epochs are involved in the optimization. While we do not show Pareto plots for alternative configurations of financial and nonfinancial objectives, the trade-offs in those configurations are also observed to be similar to the base case analysis described above. Overall, our analysis shows that even if the CDC makes its acquisition decisions purely based on financial returns, it would still imply around 90% fulfillment of social objectives. The trade-off between financial profit and nonfinancial objectives is not so significant and thus inclusion of financial objectives in decision making does not take away much from the social and equity based objectives. In other words, for the service area considered financial and social values of the properties are mostly positively correlated.

An important issue for most nonprofit organizations is how to ensure equity in their services as they try to maximize socio-economic utility. We analyze this issue by categorizing the multiple objectives considered in FHAP as equity versus utility objectives. To this end, we assume that equity related to collective efficacy, allocation rate and owner occupancy, i.e. Objectives 1, 3, and 6, represent the equity related objectives; while the economies of scale, financial return, social utility and efficient use of budget, i.e. Objectives 2, 4, 5, and 6, are utility based objectives. We then perform a Pareto analysis similar to the financial versus nonfinancial objective case above. In Fig. 7
                         we display the trade-off curves for equity versus utility objectives for the base cases of the two model types.

We observe that the two models behave somewhat differently with respect to the corresponding values of the two objective types. Overall, utility maximization will achieve around 80% equity, while equity maximization would achieve around 95% of utility in FHAP-S. These rates are around 74% for both cases in FHAP-G. Thus, the two objective types have more of a trade-off when compared with the previous analysis, specifically for FHAP-G. This suggests that, although the magnitude of the trade-offs between the two classes of objectives is not large, for a socially focused organization in this framework, the optimization of equity is likely to imply a somewhat less efficient strategic allocation and vice versa. The results for other configurations are also similar, and organizations can choose to balance the emphasis on equity versus utility based on the Pareto representations. For example, it is possible to achieve around 85% equity and same levels of utility through an optimal solution on the Pareto curve for FHAP-G. Overall, we observe that if equity is not considered in CDC acquisition selections, it is expected that these acquisitions will be approximately 20–25% less equitable between different regions than an ideal equitable selection decision. Such a conclusion can be useful in discussions with community representatives of neighborhoods. We note that we also consider selected trade-offs between individual model objectives, and discuss the resulting conclusions in Online Supplement 6.

Another analysis that we perform involves the computational aspects of different formulations, specifically to identify lost value if acquisition decisions were to be made according to rule-based heuristics. To this end, we consider the complete stochastic integer programming (SIP) solutions of the given formulations, as well as the two simplifying heuristic approaches. We note here that while the problem is a strategic one, where computational times are typically not a significant concern, the proposed decision models are aimed at serving as guides to CDCs in their decision making process. As a result, during the planning stage multiple alternative parameter values can be used and tested from a sensitivity analysis perspective, which would require multiple solutions for the problem. Hence, relatively quick solution generation is likely to have some relevance for practical implementation of the proposed models as well.

The computational results for different instances and versions of FHAP are shown through the tables in Online Supplement 7 for this paper. Computations were performed on a PC with Intel i5 Core processor with 2.3gigahertz speed and 4gigabytes memory. All solutions were obtained using the CPLEX 12 solver, where implementations were performed in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS).

On the lost value under heuristic approximations, we first note that the two heuristics proposed are more efficient from a computational perspective, allowing for solutions in reasonably short run times, i.e. much less than 1hour. Moreover, the quality of the solutions appear to be quite high for all cases. The overall average computational improvement is around 60% for the two heuristics for FHAP-S, while the corresponding values are even higher, i.e. around 68%, for FHAP-G. Indeed, improvements are much higher for the more complex Case 4×4 configurations. The observed difference in terms of objective function values is around 4% for FHAP-S when averaged over all instances, while this gap is around 2% for FHAP-G. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed rule-based heuristic approaches can be chosen as reasonable alternatives to the complete SIP optimization as the expected difference from optimality is around 4%. It can also be noted that the computational challenges associated with the inclusion of investment dependent returns should be considered for the complete SIP models. On the other hand, this issue is not the case for heuristic approaches.

As another comparative analysis, we consider the value of the reformulation of constraint (18) for FHAP-G based on the information in computational result tables provided as Online Supplement 7. The base and investment dependent return configurations for this model are based on an approximation of this constraint, which is a more restrictive formulation. Hence, the reformulation allows for potential improvement in the expected utility of the investments. For both the complete SIP and heuristic formulations, the utility increases about 10% when the reformulation is used. The only trade off involves the computational complexity added due to the piecewise approximation used as part of the reformulation of (18). The results show that the reformulated model performs worse computationally, especially for the complete SIP approach. In those cases, a deterioration of around 20% is observed in the computational times for FHAP-G, since additional complexity through the SOS2 variables is added to the model.

The policy implications of our paper arise from our use of real-world based data that represent the strategic decision framework of a particular CDC. While our conclusions specifically apply to this data set, it is possible that the operating environments for many other CDCs are similar in nature, for which some anecdotal evidence exists as noted previously. Hence, we believe that our general findings can be helpful for such organizations in devising strategic investment plans.

CDCs can benefit from the results of this study in two ways. First, as a direct utilization, the optimization models can potentially be implemented to identify a benchmark resource allocation strategy as defined by the model assumptions and inputs. This benchmark strategy can be adjusted based on any other qualitative inputs that may exist, and the adjusted strategy can be used directly to allocate resources to different neighborhoods. As an alternative, the model results can be used to assess or justify the existing resource allocation policy of a given CDC, or to guide other routine activities. Second, as an indirect utilization, the policy related conclusions we reach through our numerical analysis, which is based on a typical CDC operation, can be used for general guidance in strategic resource allocation or property acquisition by CDCs. We specify these general policy implications in the following paragraphs.

For general policy guidelines, first we note that the optimal resource allocation strategy, which involves splitting of the budget among different neighborhoods, is quite robust for different budget levels and return function parameters. Hence, CDCs can adjust the resource allocations proportionally if fund availabilities change during the planning period.

Second set of policy implications deals with the emphasis on different optimization objectives. The results suggest that there is no significant conflict between financial and nonfinancial objectives. While this conclusion is based on the numerical data used for this specific case study, it is likely that if a CDC makes its acquisition decisions solely based on financial returns, it would still imply around 90% fulfillment of social objectives. Hence, CDCs can simply consider only financial objectives in their acquisition policies and this would not result in huge loss of social value.

While still not very significant, the trade-offs are a bit more apparent when equity objectives are considered with respect to utility. Thus, it is important for CDCs to consider equity in their resource allocation and property acquisition processes, as otherwise the resulting social value may be high but unbalanced among different parts of their service area. Optimizing investments based on only social returns may imply some inequity between neighborhoods, corresponding to an observed loss of equity around 20–25%. This conclusion is of course dependent on the distribution of different category properties across the service area. For the case study presented, this distribution is not significantly biased towards a specific subset of neighborhoods. This relatively even distribution of neighborhood parameters can be expected to be observed in other CDC service areas as well given their typically focused geography. Hence, the results are likely to be applicable to other CDC operations, too.

A third category of policy implications relate to the use of rule-based heuristics. Given the objective structure presented and assuming that budget allocations to different neighborhoods are done as efficiently as possible, selecting property acquisitions based on relative marginal returns or availabilities over different categories does not result in significant loss of overall utility for CDCs. For most cases, this loss is expected to be less than 4% with respect to an optimal strategy. Hence, in the absence of any optimization implementations, CDCs can consider using such general rule-based acquisition strategies.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we study stochastic dynamic models for resource allocation and foreclosed property acquisition to provide some general evidence-based guidance to a specific CDC, with potentially broader implications. To this end we first develop a two-stage stochastic programming formulation, and then expand this model through a multi-stage structure involving gradual uncertainty resolution. We also study two variations in these models in order to capture some additional complexities. Finally, an empirical analysis is performed based on real-world data for practical and computational evaluations.

While our conclusions are based on the specific numerical data used, we demonstrate through our analyses that CDCs can benefit from the utilization of the proposed models either through direct implementation for specific strategic guidance, or through the indirect use of several policy results obtained. We further show that two simplistic heuristic improvements result in increased efficiency without a significant optimality gap, indicating the potential practical value of these approaches.

A specific characteristic of our analysis is that we build our models through interactions with a CDC, and use real-world data to test them. As a first stochastic model of its type in this application area, our study is aimed to provide strategic resource allocation guidelines for practitioners through explicit consideration of uncertainty. On the other hand, as in any model, accurate quantification of relevant measures is crucial for the validity of implementations involving the presented approach. Hence, in addition to the consideration of the variances of objectives and priorities between different CDCs, future work may involve assessments of the accuracy of expert opinions used in quantitative measurements with respect to their impacts on the optimization models.
