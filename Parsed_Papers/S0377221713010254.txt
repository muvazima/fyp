                  This paper considers line search optimization methods using a mathematical framework based on the simple concept of a v-pattern and its properties. This framework provides theoretical guarantees on preserving, in the localizing interval, a local optimum no worse than the starting point. Notably, the framework can be applied to arbitrary unidimensional functions, including multimodal and infinitely valued ones. Enhanced versions of the golden section, bisection and Brent’s methods are proposed and analyzed within this framework: they inherit the improving local optimality guarantee. Under mild assumptions the enhanced algorithms are proved to converge to a point in the solution set in a finite number of steps or that all their accumulation points belong to the solution set.

In fact, there is a vast range of exact and inexact methods to solve (1). The simplest approximate solution to the line search problem used inside a search direction algorithm is a constant step size 
                        
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 ★
                              
                           
                        
                     . If this constant step is set too small, a slow convergence rate will take place. If it is too large, the search direction algorithm may diverge. This procedure does not guarantee convergence, even when F is assumed to be strictly convex. To overcome these drawbacks, reducing stepsize rules may be employed (Bertsekas, 2008), which guarantee global optimality and termination if F is convex.

Another popular technique is the Armijo’s rule, also known as successive stepsize reduction (Armijo, 1966; Shi & Shen, 2005). The Goldstein’s test (Goldstein, 1965) adds the condition that the step size is not too small if the Goldstein’s rule is verified. If the cost to evaluate the derivative of F is small, the Wolf’s test (Wolfe, 1969) can be considered. Some algorithms derived from these tests can be found in the work of Yuan (2010). Non-monotone variations of these techniques are presented in Hu, Huang, and Lu (2010) and Yu and Pu (2008).

Based on interval reductions, the bisection line search (Bertsekas, 2008; Luenberger & Ye, 2010; Bazaraa & Shetty, 2006) removes half of the search interval at each iteration. However, it relies on the gradient of f and, hence, on the differentiability of f. Based on two points information, the golden section algorithm reduces the confidence interval to achieve convergence (Kiefer, 1953; Avriel & Wilde, 1966). Section techniques based on curve fitting have also been addressed, like the Brent’s algorithm (Brent, 1973).

This work is mainly interested in section like algorithms. The concept of a v-pattern is explored in this paper to derive some novel line search strategies. Moreover, it is proven that the golden section algorithm converges to a local minimum for any line search problem (1), without the need of function unimodality. However, as it is well known by practitioners, the algorithm output can be worse than the starting point.

Based on these considerations, this work presents a framework to derive line search section methods for arbitrary functions f, with the guarantee of always keeping a local minimum of (1) whose function value is no greater than 
                        
                           f
                           (
                           0
                           )
                        
                     . These ideas are applied to the Golden Section, bisection and Brent’s algorithms. The enhanced algorithms are used as a block in a general algorithm, and the converge of this algorithm is proved under mild conditions.

In order to contextualize the improvements proposed in this paper, a brief overview of line search methods is given in the next section.

There is no line search method that is the best for all classes of problems, since each one was developed to best explore some conditions. Therefore, the art of matching problems and solvers is a fundamental step in practical optimization. This section describes the most notable line search methods, emphasizing advantages and shortcomings of each one.

This result can be intriguingly stated: taking a sequence of constant non null steps decreasing the objective function, towards shrinking-length directions that are null only at optimal points, does not imply convergence to a finite optimal point, even for continuously differentiable strictly convex problems.

                        . However, a small step implies slow convergence rate of the search direction algorithm. Conversely, a large step can make the algorithm diverge or converge to a non-local minimum, as previously seen. The backtracking strategy fundamentally reduces a large step size until some conditions which guarantee convergence are met. Just like a constant step size, this strategy does not actually solve the line search problem (1).

Furthermore, the convergence rate is problem independent:

                         is a necessary but not a sufficient optimality condition.

In many cases, derivatives are only available through numerical evaluations, which can be computationally expensive and contain numerical errors in practice. Moreover, in this case, for any iteration of the bisection method, at least two function evaluations are necessary.

The most important drawback of the classical bisection method is that the best point found so far can be discarded throughout iterations. An extreme example is shown in Fig. 2
                        , where the objective function increases after each iteration.

This is a notable feature: golden section always converges to a local minimum at a constant rate, no matter if the function is discontinuous, multimodal or evaluated to infinite at some points. Optimality of golden section has been proven before only for unimodal or quasiconvex functions (Bazaraa & Shetty, 2006; Luenberger & Ye, 2010).

                         is preserved. This algorithm is known to always converge and it has a proven optimality for unimodal or quasiconvex function f (Brent, 1973; Luenberger & Ye, 2010).

Brent’s algorithm tries to predict function behavior in order to speed up convergence, i.e. its convergence rate depends on the function f, unlike bisection and golden section methods. Since any smooth function behaves locally like a low order polynomial, it is intuitive that Brent’s quadratic fitting implies a higher convergence rate than other section methods when f is smooth. Although this may be true for a vast range of functions, there are cases where the localizing interval of Brent’s algorithm asymptotically shrinks to a non-null interval, even for smooth functions f as shown in Fig. 4

                     The analysis introduced in this paper is based on special relative function values of an ordered sequence of three points, defined next as v-pattern. The key idea behind this pattern is that it always contains a local minimum (see Fig. 5
                     ), as stated in Theorem 1. Note that, by definition, a local minimum can be surrounded by points with the same function value. The v-pattern theorem is very simple indeed, but it is also very powerful to analyze optimization algorithms based only on local relative function values information.

                     , so that, in each iteration, one subinterval is eliminated and another one is split into two. All patterns for a sequence of four points are given in Table 1
                     . It will be used next to analyze the algorithms.

The local optimality of the golden section algorithm can be proved with the help of Lemma 1: once a v-pattern is found, it is always possible to insert a point and eliminate one subinterval to get another v-pattern (see Fig. 6
                     ).

This section explores the properties of the golden section algorithm (Kiefer, 1953; Avriel & Wilde, 1966) which is described in Algorithm 1. This method enjoys a convergence rate independent on the function, as stated in Theorem 3. Theorem 4 shows that the classical golden section algorithm always keeps a local minimum for an arbitrary function f. Another good guarantee is that

                            presents one pattern (see Table 1) that will be transformed into one of three other patterns according to the function value at the split point relative to its neighbors. The resulting sequence of patterns is graphically represented by a directed graph in Fig. 7
                           , where each node has outdegree 3. The patterns ii, iii, iv and vi always lead to patterns in the same group, as Lemma 1 stated to be the case. Furthermore, they contain a v-pattern and, hence, a local minimum according to the v-pattern theorem. The patterns i and v can only lead to patterns in the previous group ii, iii, iv, vi (from where there is no way out) or to i. Furthermore, they contain a half-v-pattern and, hence, a local minimum according to the half-v-pattern theorem. The same holds for viii and vii. □

Even though classical golden section method owns guarantees on termination and local optimality, there is still an unsolved question. Because of the patterns v and vi, the classical golden section method can exclude the whole subinterval where lies points whose function values are smaller than 
                        
                           f

                           0
                           )
                        
                     , as shown in Fig. 3. This is not desired in optimization, since 
                        
                           α
                           =
                           0
                        
                      usually corresponds to the point where the problem oracle is queried and which must be improved upon. Furthermore, most of the search directions guarantee the existence of better points in the vicinity of 
                        
                           α

                     . This algorithm differs from the classical golden section only in the line 11 and guarantees to keep a local minimum no worse than

                     , as stated in Theorem 6. This improvement comes with no additional oracle queries, considering that

                      is where the oracle is queried to define the search direction d. Moreover, the convergence rate of the classical golden section is preserved.

The same previously seen fundamental ideas to preserve an improving local minimum can be applied to null derivatives in bisection method: find and keep a v-pattern. For

                     . Both cases can be treated like the bisection method deals with a null derivative.

Also the enhanced golden section algorithm can be used to find a v-pattern. As stated by 7, if d is a descent direction, after an adequate number of iterations one v-pattern will be found.

Any infinite function value prevents the quadratic approximation from being obtained. When it appears, the function value can be upper bounded by the highest finite value found so far plus a positive constant, so that the relative values guarantee a proper subinterval cut. If the function is evaluated to infinite at all three points, the degenerate case

                         is properly treated. A minus infinite function value is clearly the best possible solution.

Even though finding a local minimum is not the central concept of the Armijo’s rule and similar techniques, it can also be analyzed in the light of the v-pattern. Since

As previously seen in theory, no line search method presented in this paper is the best in every aspect. There is a clear trade-off involving shrinking rate, function continuity dependency and robustness. Table 2
                      presents a comparison among them.

Note that this number would typically double if numerical derivatives were used, which makes using derivatives in practice even more arguable. The enhanced Brent’s algorithm confirmed its expected good performance in practice, reaching the specified shrink after about 23 function evaluations in average for

                      of the instances, although its worst case performance is known to be as worse as shown in Fig. 4. The small step at 29 evaluations is due to a few instances where the bisection search for a v-pattern is not accomplished. The greater step in the end accumulates the cases that took more than 49 function evaluations, which are similar to the one shown in Fig. 4. All enhanced algorithms returned, for every instance, a point no worse than the starting point.

                     . The enhanced bisection algorithm and the enhanced golden section algorithm spent the same number of function evaluations as before: 29 and 41, respectively. The enhanced Brent’s algorithm is not as efficient as it was before and, with the exception of a few instances, it typically spent more than 100 function evaluations to meet the specified overall shrink.


                     Vieira (2012) presented a comparison between the golden section and Armijo’ rule in several contexts. Especially when numerical derivatives are needed, using the golden section can be more effective in the algorithm overall performance. This effect increases as the problem dimension grows, since the number of objective function evaluations become negligible compared to the gradient cost. Therefore, both type of techniques have their place and should be chosen given the problem settings.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the simple definition of a v-pattern and a half-v-pattern, this paper has derived new line search methods that converge to a local minimum which is better than its starting point or, at most, equally good to it. Indeed, in case the search direction is descent, the algorithms converge to a strict better point.

The v-pattern related definition and theorems do not rely on any function property. In fact, given

                     , the function domain can even be discrete, and the main results still hold.

The proposed enhanced line search algorithms can be helpful to append theoretical guarantees to search direction algorithms, while also providing good features for real world optimization problems. Given some mild conditions, the enhanced methods were proven to converge to the solution set given a non-null descent direction.

Among the enhanced methods introduced in this paper, the golden section line search is the most robust, followed by bisection line search, which is faster but relies on derivatives. Brent’s algorithm has a really bad worst case, but it is the fastest in practice most of times and it only depends on function values. For better or for worse, matching line search problems to methods is still an art where knowledge of capabilities is fundamental.
