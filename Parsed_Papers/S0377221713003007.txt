                  We analyze a duopoly where capacity-constrained firms offer an established product and have the option to offer an additional new and differentiated product. We show that the firm with the smaller capacity on the established market has a higher incentive to innovate and reaches a larger market share on the market for the new product. An increase in capacity of the larger firm can prevent its competitor from innovating, whereas an increase in capacity of the smaller firm cannot prevent innovation of its larger competitor. In equilibrium the firm with smaller capacity on the established market might outperform the larger firm with respect to total payoffs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper we study the impact of the size of an oligopolistic firm’s production capacity for an established product on its incentive to open up a new connected market segment. Two real-world examples serve as an illustration of our focus.

In 2007 PC maker Asus introduced the EEE PC, a low-priced mini-notebook (so-called netbook) with reduced weight and performance. At this point Asus had a market share of only about 4% on the notebook market. Other PC makers followed suit, and in 2008 almost all major players in the notebook market were offering netbooks. However, Asus still had a market share of about 30% on the netbook market, whereas the leaders on the notebook markets were rather minor players in this innovative market segment.
                        1
                        For example, in 2008 HP had 20% on the notebook market and 6% on the netbook market. For Dell these figures are 15% and 3% respectively. The mentioned market share numbers can be found at http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/dec/10/acer-asus-netbooks (netbooks) and http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2008/06/14/notebook-computer-market-share-q1-2008.aspx (notebooks).
                     
                     
                        1
                     
                  

In the TV industry major producers of standard CRT television sets have started the production of flatscreens around the year 2000. Although the production processes for these two variants are based on very different technologies, for many years firms offered both products simultaneously. For example Philips produced “standard” CRT television sets for decades, when in 1999 it started to produce LCD (flatscreen) television sets. A decade later it still produced both products.

The common features of these examples are that (i) new product variants are added to an established oligopolistic market, (ii) the new product is offered by incumbents, and (iii) the new product is not replacing the old product, but is offered in addition. In many cases market leaders on the new market have minor market shares on the established market, as illustrated with the notebook/netbook example. The observation that on many occasions new products are introduced by incumbents is reinforced by empirical studies like Chandy and Tellis (2000). Their article also highlights the negative relationship between firm size and the propensity to introduce (radically) new products. Similar to other influential contributions (see e.g. Christensen, 1997) the authors explain this by the bureaucratic inertia and organizational structure in large firms. Although these aspects are certainly valid, this article points out that in markets characterized by the three features described above, pure strategic considerations induce a similar relationship between firm size, innovativeness and new capacity investments. In that respect we address the following research questions:
                        
                           1.
                           What is the effect of the size of a firm’s production capacity on the established market on its incentive to enter the new market?

What is the effect of the size of the competitors’ production capacity on the established market on the firm’s incentive to enter the new market?

If a firm enters the new market, how is the optimal production capacity on the new market influenced by capacity levels of the firm and its competitors on the established market?

Does a higher capacity on the established market always lead to relative advantages with respect to profit?

In order to address these questions we consider a stylized duopolistic setup. Both firms are operating on an established homogenous product market on which an ‘old’ product is sold. For this market, firms have given production capacities, which are assumed to differ between firms. Therefore, we can distinguish between a small and a large firm. Our approach to take existing capacities on the established market as proxies for firm size, allows us to explicitly focus on the role of differences in firm size rather than on related issues, like incumbent-entrant interactions or differences in production technology, that have been addressed in most of the related literature. We implictly assume that differences in old market capacities have been caused by path-depencies or past interactions that are outside the scope of our analysis.

Both firms have the opportunity to introduce a differentiated ’new’ product, which competes with the old product. A firm that enters the new market does not only provide extra competition for the rival but also cannibalizes its own sales of the old product.

The considered sequence of actions is that first, both firms have to decide whether or not to launch the new product, which would require incurring sunk costs. In case either one of them has decided to introduce the new product, a heterogenous product market arises. The firms that enter the new market then have to determine the production capacity of the new product. Finally, firms have to fix the prices of all products they are offering. They maximize the sum of profits on both markets net of possible sunk costs.

It turns out that the interplay of four mechanisms drives the effects of old capacities on the behavior of rational firms in such a setting: the cannibalization effect, the size effect, the strategic effect and the indirect effect. The cannibalization effect results from the observation that a firm with a larger capacity on the old market is more reluctant to reduce the price of the old product. This lowers the incentive to introduce the new product and to increase capacity on the new market. Furthermore, the size effect refers to the fact that if the capacity of a firm on the established market becomes larger, the price level for the new product becomes smaller. Therefore, the marginal returns of building capacity on the new market decreases which makes the new market less attractive for the firm. The strategic effect captures the following link: if a firm’s capacity for the old product increases and this firm does not enter the new market, then this induces the competitor to select a smaller capacity level for the new product. This negative effect on the competitor’s capacity on the new market does not arise if the firm actually enters the new market. In such a case the increase in old market capacity is counterbalanced by the induced reduction of the new market capacity of the same firm in such a way that the capacity investment incentives of the competitor stay unchanged. Finally, the impact of an increase of the competitor’s old market capacity on the incentives of a firm to enter the new market is also influenced by the indirect effect. If the old market capacity of the competitor goes up, this reduces its investment in capacity on the new market, which positively affects the incentives of the focal firm to innovate.

Considering the interplay of these effects we demonstrate that incumbents with a high capacity on the established market have lower incentives to introduce a new product. And, if they decide to enter the new market, they invest less in corresponding production capacities compared to smaller competitors. Consequently, profits from producing the new product will be higher for the smaller firm, and this could even result in higher overall profits. Furthermore, if the capacity of the smaller firm on the established market changes, this has a qualitatively different impact on payoffs and innovation incentives than a change of the capacity of the larger firm. Overall, total payoffs depend non-monotonously on the capacities on the established market.

From our results we can derive that for the larger firm on the old market it might be optimal not to serve all new markets into which the smaller competitors (and new competitors) enter. According to our analysis, equilibrium constellations where only the small firm innovates occur in many scenarios. In such cases the lack of innovativeness of the large firm is a consequence of strategic considerations rather than an implication of the organizational structure. Our analysis also shows that in industries where frequently new product designs are added to the existing range of designs, having a relatively small capacity for production of the existing designs might be a good starting point to attain profit leadership. The advantage of the small firm results from the fact that even if it is optimal for the large firm to refrain from innovating, the small firm can still gain substantial additional profits with the new design. Thus, our analysis also provides a new explanation for the phenomenon of leapfrogging in markets as illustrated by our real-world examples. Finally, we obtain that an increase of capacity of the larger firm can prevent its competitor from innovating, whereas an increase in capacity of the smaller firm never prevents innovation of its larger competitor. Preventing the competitor from innovating can be seen as a strategy closely related to entry deterrence. Straightforward intuition derived from the entry deterrence literature suggests that expanding capacity can be used as an instrument to keep the competitor out of the new market. A new insight gained in this article is that relative firm size determines whether such a strategy can be successfully applied.

The article is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the related literature, Section 3 presents the model, while the results of our analysis are presented in Section 4. Section 5 provides an extensive economic analysis, and Section 6 concludes. Some additional model details are given in Appendix A and all proofs in the Online Appendix B.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The main building blocks of our analysis are the consideration of product introduction decisions and capacity choice under oligopolistic competition. In that respect the following two streams of literature are relevant. The first related stream of literature deals with optimal design of product lines in oligopolistic markets. Moorthy and Png (1992) are among the first to address the issue of cannibalization by analyzing the effects of sequential or simultaneous introduction of vertically differentiated products to market segments with different valuations. In a setting close to ours Tang and Yin (2010) analyze the optimal selection of products to sell as well as the price and quantity of the selected products. Their main focus lies on the effect of production costs on these decisions, however they also separately address implications of capacity constraints and competition. Our approach differs from these contributions by considering a product line selection problem under competition taking into account capacity constraints. In particular, our work focuses on the effects of old market capacities on product selection and resulting capacity choices for the new product. These issues have not been addressed in this literature.

The effect of capacity constraints in multi-product oligopolies has been studied in the second related stream of literature. This stream originates from the seminal work on selections of production capacity and price in single-product oligopolistic markets by Levitan and Shubik (1972) and Kreps and Scheinkman (1983). Still in a single-product setting Anupindi and Jiang (2008) study the value of postponing price and quantity decisions under demand uncertainty and capacity contraints. Several recent contributions have studied the effect of capacity constraints in multi-product settings. see e.g. Goyal and Netessine (2007), Lus and Muriel (2009), Huang and Sosic (2010), Bish and Suwandechochai (2010) and Yayla-Küllü et al. (2012). Like the present article, these papers consider competition on several related markets under capacity constraints. An important difference between our setup and the multi-product capacity choice models mentioned above is that although we let the firms select their capacities and prices for the new product, the capacity for the old product is fixed. In this way we can capture the effect of firm size on the incentive to introduce new products.
                        2
                        There are three reasons for assuming exogenously given capacities for the established product and not considering adjustments of these capacities. First, we want to consider the impact of firm size, but nevertheless keep the analysis as simple as possible. Second, we want to capture intertemporal considerations in reduced form, in the sense that the firm expects that old market capacities will become obsolete earlier and therefore rather invests in the new market capacities. Third, there is empirical evidence that in many industries firms are reluctant to reduce production capacities, see Goyal and Netessine (2007, p. 204).

                      In addition, an innovative contribution to oligopoly theory is that we establish existence and properties of price-setting equilibria in a setting where multi-product firms compete on linked product markets under capacity constraints.

                     Innovation stage:

                        i
                     
                     =
                     Y), it incurs set-up costs equal to I. If firm i does not enter the new market, we denote this by D
                     
                        i
                     
                     =
                     N.


                     Capacity investment stage:
                  

All firms that have decided to launch the new product have to decide on their corresponding production capacity level

                     Pricing stage:
                  

Both firms select their prices for the old product

                      and, in case they have decided to enter the new market, also their new product’s price

If at least one of the firms introduces the new product, the homogenous product market from before is turned into a heterogenous product market. The new product is, as in Dawid et al. (2010a), vertically and horizontally differentiated from the old one. The degree of vertical and horizontal differentiation is parametrized in a way that the inverse demand system reads

                     This type of inverse demand system can be derived from a representative consumer model with a quality augmented version of the standard quadratic utility function (see Symeonidis, 2003; Breton et al., 2004 and Appendix A.1). For the parameter γ we impose that 0<
                     γ
                     ⩽1. If the latter inequality holds in a strict sense, it indicates that the new product is vertically differentiated from the old product,
                        3
                        To realize that γ
                           <1 indeed corresponds to a higher quality of the new product, note that in a situation where demand quantities for both goods are identical, the new product has a higher price than the old one.
                     
                     
                        3
                      however our analysis also includes the case γ
                     =1, which corresponds to purely horizontal differentiation. The parameter η determines the degree of horizontal differentiation. Markets for the two products are separated for η
                     =0, whereas the products are homogenous for γ
                     =
                     η
                     =1. In what follows we impose that
                        
                           (3)

                              <
                              γ
                              ⩽
                              1

                     The fact that γ
                     >
                     η indicates that the quantity of a product always has more effect on its own price than on the price of the other product. It should be noted that our formulation of the demand with and without the new product implies that the overall market size is extended if the new product is introduced.
                        Remark 1
                        To keep the notation in the main text as simple as possible, we make the assumption that the established products of the two firms are homogenous and the same holds for the new products offered by the two firms. Alternatively, one could assume that all four products are differentiated from each other, where the degree of horizontal differentiation between the two goods on the same market is much smaller compared to the degree of differentiation between the established and the new products. Combining such a demand structure with the assumption that capacities function as an imperfect commitment device allows to build on the analysis provided by Maggi (1996) for a setting with two horizontally differentiated products. His results suggest that the findings of this article will carry over to this setting if the degree of differentiation within each market is sufficiently small.

Obviously, the demand system (1) and (2) implies that the price of the new product cannot exceed the reservation price of 1 and therefore we only consider unit capacity costs in the range

                     The range of parameters γ, η and c for which (3) and (4) are satisfied, will be referred to as the admissible set of parameters.

Based on this demand system and the efficient rationing rule, actual quantities of both firms in both markets are functions of all capacities and all prices. In particular, if capacities on one market are binding for at least one firm, the determination of market clearing quantities is not completely straightforward.

Our economic analysis is based on the characterization of subgame-perfect equilibria (SPE) of our three-stage game. In what follows we concentrate on the most interesting case, where capacities on the old market are sufficiently small such that in equilibrium positive prices on both markets emerge. Precise upper bounds on these capacities that guarantee equilibria with positive prices are derived below. We refer to Appendix A.3 for a discussion of scenarios where capacities on the old market are large.

To characterize SPE we treat the game in reverse order, implying that we start analyzing the pricing stage where the prices are determined for given capacity levels. This is followed by the analysis of the capacity investment stage where each innovating firm has to fix its capacity for the innovative product. Then we study the innovation stage in which the firms have to decide whether to innovate or not. The proofs of all propositions are given in the Online Appendix B.

At this stage both firms have to fix output prices for the old product, and for the new product once they have entered the new market. In case a firm did not enter, the firm’s capacity for the new product is zero, implying that the firm does not have to take any actual pricing decision for the new product. For notational convenience we set this price equal to the price for the new product chosen by the competitor. The next proposition shows that in equilibrium firms set identical prices for each separate product, while the corresponding capacities are always binding in case these prices are positive.

                              the following three statements hold:

                                       In any subgame-perfect equilibrium in pure strategies both firms set an identical price for each separate product.
                                    


                                       In any subgame where both firms have positive capacities for a product, the equilibrium prices are such that the demand for that product is strictly positive.
                                    


                                       In any subgame where both firms have positive capacities for a product, the equilibrium price for that product can only be positive if capacities of both producers are binding.
                                    

In addition to this proposition it holds that a profile that induces a price of zero on the old market can only be an equilibrium profile if each of the two competitors has sufficient capacity to serve the entire market demand at a price of zero.

                           In Appendix A.3 we state the reason why no pure strategy equilibrium with a price of zero exists if capacity of one of the firms is not sufficient to serve the whole market.
                        
                        
                           4
                         Furthermore, it is easy to understand that building up capacities on the new market that allow to serve the entire market demand arising with p
                        
                           n
                        
                        =0 is never rational. Therefore, we can conclude that there are two different types of equilibria: one where the price on the old market equals zero, which occurs when both firms have enough capacity to serve the whole market, and one where the price on the old market is positive. In what follows we assume that capacities for the old product are sufficiently small such that the price on that market stays positive, even if capacities are fully employed. This ensures existence of a pure strategy equilibrium at the pricing stage where all prices are positive.

The following proposition provides the conditions that the capacity levels have to fulfill in order for such an equilibrium to exist.

A subgame at the capacity investment stage is characterized by the capacities on the old market and the entry decision at the first stage. Here the firms that have entered the new market have to choose the capacity levels necessary to produce the new product. First, consider the case where both firms have entered. The following proposition gives the equilibrium levels of capacities on the new market, the resulting equilibrium payoffs, and an existence condition depending on capacities on the old market.

Calculations based on the analysis of Maggi (1996) that are not reported here, suggest that in the variant of the model where products on the same market are weakly differentiated and capacities are imperfect commitment devices (see Remark 1 in the model section), no such restriction for the range of new product capacities is necessary to ensure the existence of a (unique) pure strategy pricing equilibrium in all subgames.

                        Propositions 4–6 show that under conditions 6, 7 and 13 each subgame at the capacity investment stage has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium. Therefore, the strategic interaction at the innovation stage, where firms have to choose whether to innovate or not, can be represented by a 2×2 normal form game with the following payoff matrix. Firm 1 is the row player and firm 2 is the column player:

An important result (see (8), (10)) is that capacity investment on the new market is decreasing in the firm’s capacity on the old market. The explanation is as follows. From (5) and the facts that both firms fully use their capacities and charge identical prices for both products, we obtain that profit excluding the set-up costs (which are sunk at the capacity investment stage) can be expressed as

                     . Obviously, for firm j there is no cannibalization effect, but the size effect is still at work. Hence, the (negatively sloped) reaction functions of both firms in the capacity investment stage shift inwards if

                      goes up, where the shift is more pronounced for firm i. As shown in Proposition 4, if both firms are active on the new market, the capacity choice of firm j in equilibrium is unchanged. Put differently, the negative size effect for firm j is counterbalanced by the positive effect of the decrease of

This discussion allows us to answer one of our main research questions: The larger the capacity of a firm on the old market the smaller is ceteris paribus the investment in capacity on the new market. The effects of a capacity increase of the competitor on the old market depend on whether the competitor also enters the new market. In case both firms enter the new market, the competitor’s capacity on the old market does not influence the investment decision of a firm on the new market. In case the competitor stays out, a higher capacity of this firm on the old market negatively affects the capacity investments of the considered firm on the new market.

The incentives to introduce the new product depend on whether the rival enters the new market or not and are given by

                         goes up, which reduces the attractiveness of that market. Finally, the incentive to enter for firm i is also influenced by an effect which so far has not been introduced:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Strategic effect: If firm i does not enter the new market, according to expression (10) the capacity of its competitor on the new market is inversely related to the capacity of firm i on the old market, whereas, as explained in the previous section, no such influence occurs if firm i enters the new market. Since ceteris paribus a large capacity of the competitor on the new market negatively affects the profits of firm i, this implies that the incentives for firm i to stay out of the new market increases if

                                             i
                                          
                                          
                                             o
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  goes up.

Each of these effects implies that the incentive to enter the new market decreases if the capacity on the old market becomes larger and therefore the same holds for the total effect.

The situation is less clear cut if we consider the effect of an increase of the opponent’s capacity

                                  goes up, then this has a decreasing effect on the capacity of this firm on the new market. The marginal effect on the new market capacity of firm j is always at least as large in absolute terms if firm i enters the new market compared to when it stays out. Furthermore, the positive effect on firm i’s profit of a decrease of the new market capacity of firm j is larger if firm i is active on both markets rather than only on the old one.

                                  has a positive effect on firm i’s profits and this positive effect is stronger if firm i enters the new market.

The intuition for the positive sign of the indirect effect is that the prices in the old and the new market are positively affected by a decrease of

                        , and firm i benefits only from the price increase on the old market if it is not active on the new market. Hence, the indirect effect suggests that entering the new market becomes more attractive if the competitor’s capacity on the old market goes up. Generally speaking it is not clear whether the size effect or the indirect effect dominates, and thus how the incentive to enter the new market depends on the opponent’s capacity on the old market. In our linear specification it turns out that the indirect effect exactly balances the size effect such that the total effect disappears. This is proven in Proposition 8.

Similar considerations can be made under the assumption that firm j does not innovate. Table 1
                         summarizes which of the different effects we described above emerge in the different settings and the impact they have on the incentive for firm i to enter the market. Proposition 8 formalizes the above discussion and also establishes that the incentive to innovate is larger for the smaller firm.

Part (iii) of this proposition answers one of our main research questions. The explanation why a larger capacity on the old market reduces the incentives to innovate rests on the different effects summarized in Table 1. If old market capacities of both firms are identical, it is obvious that both have identical incentives to innovate. Now consider a situation where the old market capacity of firm 1 is increased implying 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    K
                                 
                                 
                                    1
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                              >
                              
                                 
                                    K
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                           
                        . If both firms expect the other firm to innovate then such a change of old market capacity decreases the innovation incentives of firm 1. According to the first line of Table 1, this is due to the combination of the cannibalization effect, the size effect and the strategic effect. However, due to the fact that the indirect effect compensates for the size effect, innovation incentives of firm 2 are not affected (see second line of Table 1). Therefore, the incentive is larger for firm 2 than for firm 1. If both firms expect that the opponent does not innovate, then lines 3 and 4 of Table 1 show that the incentives to innovate for both firms decline. However, whereas firm 2 is only affected by the size effect, firm 1 also has to take the cannibalization effect into account. Accordingly, also in this case the innovation incentive of the smaller firm is larger. It should be noted however, that no statement about the relative size of the innovation incentive can be made if the two firms have different expectations about the innovation decision of the opponent. Therefore, these arguments do not rule out the existence of a subgame-perfect equilibrium of the game where the larger firm 1 innovates but the smaller firm 2 does not. However, the following proposition shows that for any parameter constellation where such an equilibrium exists, there must also exist an equilibrium where the smaller firm does innovate.
                           Proposition 9
                           
                              For any parameter constellation where a subgame perfect equilibrium exists in which (the large) firm 1 carries out the innovation project, there also exists a subgame perfect equilibrium in which (the small) firm 2 innovates. The reverse statement need not be true.

                         under the assumption that this change of capacities does not alter the innovation decisions of any firm. In that benchmark case in general the effect of an increase of the old market capacity of a firm on its profit is non-monotonous. This comes from the facts that any available capacities are fully used in equilibrium and that there is an interplay of the several effects discussed in the previous section.

However, monotonicity of payoffs with respect to the capacity of the competitor can be established.

Interpreting this finding in light of the different effects identified in the previous section, we observe that in case the competitor is not active on the new market an increase of the competitor’s capacity on the old market just results in a downward pressure on both prices and therefore has a negative effect on the firm’s profit (size effect). If the competitor is active on the new market, in addition to the size effects also the indirect effect becomes relevant. An increase in the old market capacity then results in a decrease of the capacity the competitor builds on the new market, which reduces the downward pressure on prices. However, as is shown in the proposition, as far as the dependence of payoffs on capacities is concerned, the indirect effect is dominated by the size effect. Hence the focal firm is negatively affected if the competitor increases its old market capacity.

The negative dependence of profits on the competitor’s old market capacity, although very intuitive, hinges on the assumption that the innovation decisions of both firms stay unaffected by the change in old market capacity. As we show in the remainder of this section, a change in the capacities on the old market might however lead to modifications of the innovation decisions of the firm. We show that such modifications result in drastic effects on profits. In particular, profits might exhibit jumps and such jumps might induce additional non-monotonicities which are in stark contrast to the claims of Proposition 10. It turns out that the innovation decisions of the larger and the smaller firm are asymmetrically affected by changes in the old market capacities.

Switches of the innovation strategy of the small firm induce jumps of the profit of the large firm. The following proposition shows that either an increase in the capacity of firm 1 or an increase in the capacity of firm 2 can induce a transition from an equilibrium where firm 2 innovates to one where it does not. Such a transition always results in an upward jump of the profit of the large firm.

To illustrate this proposition, Fig. 1

                                  space exist. For instance, in case that both η and I are sufficiently close to zero both firms innovate in equilibrium regardless of the size of capacities on the old market.

                            It is optimal for a firm to innovate when the introduction of the new product increases its profit. Related to the figure this means that, given that firm 2 innovates, to the left of the line Δπ
                           1,Y
                           
                           =0 it is optimal for firm 1 to innovate, whereas to the right of this line it is not optimal to do so. Analogously it holds that, given that firm 2 does not innovate, to the left of the line Δπ
                           1,N
                           
                           =0 it is optimal for firm 1 to innovate, whereas to the right of the line firm 1 refrains from innovating. In the same way the optimal innovation policy of firm 2 can be directly derived from the lines Δπ
                           2,Y
                           
                           =0 and Δπ
                           2,N
                           
                           =0, with the only difference that for firm 2 innovating is optimal below the corresponding line, whereas firm 2 should not innovate above this line.

To see the transitions described in Proposition 11 consider the combination of capacities indicated by label ‘A’. For such capacities the small firm innovates but the large firm does not. As indicated by the dashed arrows, it follows from lines 3 and 4 in Table 1 that an increase in

                            implies a transition to the region where no firm innovates. The effects of such transitions on the payoffs are illustrated in Fig. 2
                           , where

                            denotes the equilibrium payoff of firm i. In both cases the profit of firm 1 jumps upwards, whereas the profit of firm 2 changes continuously. The upward jump of the payoff of the large firm is caused by the upward jump of the price for the old product resulting from the absence of the new product. This price jump also positively affects the profits of the small firm on the old market, but for that firm this positive effect is counterbalanced by the loss of profit resulting from the loss of sales of the new product.

This discussion shows that if the large firm does not innovate, an increase in old market capacity might stop the small firm from innovating. As becomes obvious from Fig. 1,
                              7
                              More formally, the statement follows from Lemma 13 in Online Appendix B.

                            in situations where the large firm innovates a capacity extension never prevents the small firm from innovation. Put differently, a transition from a YY-equilibrium to a YN-equilibrium cannot be triggered by either the increase in

                           . This is an implication of the fact that the innovation incentive of the smaller firm is larger and therefore any capacity increase first deters the large firm from innovation.

Based on the insight that innovation incentives are smaller for the larger firm, it is intuitive that a capacity increase of the large firm in a YY-equilibrium situation eventually leads to a transition to a NY-equilibrium where the large firm no longer innovates. The following proposition confirms this intuition and shows that the induced strategy switch of firm 1 results in an upward profit jump of firm 2.

The transition described in this proposition is illustrated in Fig. 1 by the dashed arrow originating at the capacity combination labeled by ‘B’. It should be noted that contrary to the switch from innovating to not innovating of the small firm, which was induced by capacity increases of any firm, the large firm only switches to not innovating if the own capacity increases. Such a switch can never be triggered by an increase of the old market capacity of the small firm, because given that the competitor innovates, the innovation incentives of firm 1 are not affected if firm 2 increases its capacity (see line 2 of Table 1).

The profit effects of a capacity change that induces switches of the innovation strategy of the large firm is illustrated in Fig. 3

                            makes the profit of firm 1 larger and also leads to an upward jump of the profit of firm 2 as firm 1 switches from innovating to not innovating. This switch reduces firm 1’s quantity of the new product to zero, which raises prices of the old and the new product. This in turn causes the upward profit jump of firm 2. Except from the upward jump, the profit of firm 2 is decreasing in

                            as established in Proposition 10. The overall result is that the dependence of firm 2’s profits on firm 1’s old market production capacity is non-monotonic.

Finally, it should be noted that in all three panels of Figs. 2 and 3 there is a range of capacities where the total profit of firm 2 is larger than the profit of firm 1. Due to the opportunity of product innovation, an advantage with respect to capacities on the old market does not necessarily translate into a relative profit advantage. A straightforward conclusion from this observation seems to be that firm 1 should scrap some of its old market capacity. However, as can be easily inferred from Fig. 3, such a conclusion would be false. If firm 1 reduces its capacity to the level of its smaller competitor (this capacity corresponds to the lower bound of the range of

                                       0

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The set-up considered in this paper, where firms innovate in a situation where they are active producers of some standard product, is highly relevant in today’s economy, as the examples listed in the Introduction exemplify. Nevertheless, the model of this article leaves room for various extensions. First, whereas in the current set-up the capacity for the original product is exogenous, we could also think of making it endogenous. Then the problem is to determine the capacity level of the original product while taking into account competition as well as future product innovations that require a different kind of capital stock.

Second, the current framework focuses on strategic uncertainty, but leaves out other types of uncertainties like market or technical uncertainty. The effect of such types of uncertainties on investment is studied in real option theory (see, e.g., Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). Employing this theory may generate results concerning the effect of uncertainty on the options to innovate of the two competing firms.

Third, building up capacity is a dynamic process. Therefore, an interesting but mathematically complex project is to develop and analyze a dynamic model with the aim to determine the strategic effects within a framework of two firms being active in building up capacity for both the standard and the innovative product. In Caulkins et al. (2011) capital accumulation for both a standard and an innovative product is considered, but in that article this is done in a non-strategic framework, i.e. there is only one firm being a monopolist in both the standard and the innovative product market. A first step towards a dynamic strategic analysis of this issue has been made in Dawid et al. (2010b), where capacity dynamics in a duopoly is analyzed under the assumption that one of the two competiors is offering the innovative product in addition to the standard product.

The market model is in the spirit of the Stackelberg-Spence-Dixit model, as it has been denoted in Tirole (1988). Before the eventual innovation phase a homogenous product market exists on which the established product is traded. Consumers are identical and as long as the innovative product does not exist, they all have the utility function

                        . In the cases where no capacities on a market are binding it is assumed that firms sell identical quantities if they charge identical prices. It is straightforward but cumbersome to list the entire demand system, while taking into account unequal prices and all possible capacity constraint constellations. Therefore, we refrain from presenting the complete demand system. It will turn out that in the equilibria considered here prices are always identical and capacity constraints for a given product bind either for none or both firms.

Here we first review existence and properties of equilibria in the pricing and capacity choice stage if the capacities of the firms in the old market are large.

We first consider the case where each of the two firms has sufficient capacity to serve the entire old market demand at a price of zero, i.e.

                        =0 regardless of capacities chosen on the new market. To see this note that under the assumption that the opponent charges a price of zero on the old market and has a capacity large enough to serve that entire market, a firm can neither sell on the old market nor influence the price on the new market by setting a positive price. In addition, it follows from Proposition 1 (iii) that there can be no equilibrium with non-binding capacities and a positive price on the old market. Therefore, for the new market we are left with a standard model of capacity choice and price competition (Kreps and Scheinkman, 1983). Equilibrium capacities correspond to Cournot quantities based on the residual demand (see (24) with p

In cases where the sum of the capacities on the old market is sufficiently large to drive the price to zero, but at least firm 2 does not have sufficient capacity to serve the whole demand on the old market at a price of zero by itself, there exists no pure strategy equilibrium at the pricing stage. To argue why, we exploit a result of Proposition 1 (see Section 4) that states that in a pure strategy equilibrium both firms set an identical price for each separate product. Assume that a pure strategy equilibrium exists. Then the equilibrium price on the old market must either be zero or positive. However, a price of zero is not an equilibrium for the following reason. As firm 2’s capacity falls short of serving the whole market, firm 1 can profitably deviate by marginally increasing its price. But also a positive price is not an equilibrium, because the firm that is not capacity-constrained can gain by undercutting.

                           In a symmetric product differentiation market in which each firm offers one different product, Vives (1999, pp.165-166) shows that a symmetric pure strategy equilibrum need not exist in a similar situation, i.e. where at equilibrium excess aggregate capacity of the competitors of any firm is smaller than individual firm production.
