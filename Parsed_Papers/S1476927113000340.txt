                  Genome-wide association studies, as a powerful approach for detecting common variants associated with diseases, have revealed many disease-associated loci. However, the traditional association analysis methods do not have enough power for detecting the effects of rare variants with limited sample size. As a solution to this problem, pooling rare variants by their functions into a composite variant provides an alternative way for identifying susceptible genes. In this paper, we propose a new pooling method to test the variant–disease association and to identify the functional rare variants related with the disease. Variants with smaller and larger risk measures defined as the ratio of allele frequencies between cases and controls are pooled and a chi-square test of the resultant pooled table is calculated. We vary the threshold of pooling over all possible values and use the maximal chi-square as test statistic. The maximal chi-square is in fact the global maximum over all possible poolings. Our approach is similar to the existing variable-threshold method, but we threshold on the risk measure instead of allele frequencies of controls. Simulation results show that our method performs better in both association testing and variant selection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Genome-wide association analysis is a powerful tool for investigating the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Many genetic variants have been identified to be associated with complex diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, bipolar, Crohn's disease and others (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Barrett et al., 2008; Zeggini et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2008; Willer et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2009). However these variants explain at most 5–10% of the heritable components of diseases and the majority of the genetic components are still unexplained. In recent years hypothesis that rare variants may associate with common diseases (CDRV) have been proposed as an addition to the common disease common variant (CDCV) theory. Rare variants are referred to as those that have minor allele frequencies (MAF) less than or equal to 1% and have modest effect within a same functional unit, such as genes, pathways, or ultra conserved regions. Recent studies have shown that rare variants play an important role in dissecting complex diseases (Cohen et al., 2004, 2006; Romeo et al., 2007, 2009; Ahituv et al., 2007; Azzopardi et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2008; Buxbaum, 2009; Knight et al., 2009; Morris et al., 2009; Nejentsev et al., 2009).

Because a single rare variant contains little variation information, the traditional single-locus association analysis methods may not have enough power to detect the variant–disease association. Therefore methods to search for accumulative effects of a group of rare variants have been explored, including the simple-sum method (Morris and Zeggini, 2010), the cohort allelic sums test (CAST) (Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007), the combined multivariate and collapsing method (CMC) (Li and Leal, 2008), the variable-threshold method (Price et al., 2010) and the weighted-sum method (Madsen and Browning, 2009). The simple-sum method pools all rare variants into a super variant and then compares the super variant between cases and controls. The CMC pools variants with MAF less than a given threshold into a single variant and uses this pooled variant with other common variants in multivariate analysis. The weighted-sum method scales the importance of variants by weights calculated from mutant alleles in unaffected individuals and pools the weighted variants together as a super variant. The variable-threshold approach is similar to the CMC method but searches the optimal threshold to overcome the difficulty in selecting a biologically meaningful threshold value.

In this paper we propose a risk-based pooling method for rare variants analysis. Our method is similar to the variable-threshold method but uses a different thresholding method. It partitions the rare variants by the magnitudes of risk measures defined as the ratios of allele counts between cases and controls, instead of the allele frequencies in controls as used in the variable-threshold method of Price et al. (2010). We postulate that pooling variants with similar risks may be beneficial in power than pooling those with similar allele frequencies. Partitioning risk factors by ratios between cases and controls had been used in multi-factorial dimensionality reduction method and its various modifications (MDR, Ritchie et al., 2001, 2003; Hua et al., 2010). Hua et al. (2010) proved that the maximal chi-square test statistics obtained by variably thresholding on the risk ratios is in fact the global maximal chi-squares among all possible ways of pooling. Therefore our method provides a global optimal solution to the grouping test. We will show by simulation studies that our approach gains power over existing methods in some situations and has similar power performance in other situations.

This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the risk-based variable-threshold method in the next section. Section 3 compares our method with the variable-threshold of Price et al. (2010) and the weighted-sum methods (Madsen and Browning, 2009). Simulation results to illustrate the test efficacy of our method are presented in Section 3.2. Discussion and comparison of our method with other methods are presented in Section 4.

@&#METHODS@&#

In this section, we present our method for testing variant–disease association. Assume that within a gene locus there are M binary variants V
                        1, V
                        2, …, V
                        
                           M
                         that are in linkage equilibrium in the population. We assume that both common and rare variants under study are included in the M variants. Suppose that there are N
                        1 cases and N
                        2 controls. Let n
                        
                           j
                         and m
                        
                           j
                         be the observed counts of the reference allele of variant j in cases and in controls respectively, j
                        =1, …, M. Data are summarized as follows:

Variants in Table 1
                         are not ordered. To order the variants we first compute the ratio r
                        
                           j
                        
                        =
                        n
                        
                           j
                        /m
                        
                           j
                        
                        +1 for each column. Then we rearrange the columns (the variants) by the decreasing order of the ratios. Ties are ordered arbitrarily. From now on we assume that the table is already in this order. Let s
                        
                           k
                         be the set of variants from the first left k columns. A z-score z(s

We remark that our approach is related to but different from the CMC (Li and Leal, 2008), variable-threshold (Price et al., 2010) and the weighted-sum methods (Madsen and Browning, 2009). The CMC method is a fixed-threshold approach. It picks an allele-frequency threshold and performs association test on the set of variants which MAFs are below that threshold. The variable-threshold approach varies the threshold among the allele frequencies of actual SNPs and computes a z-score with each threshold. Then the maximum of the z-scores are obtained. It is easy to see that the variable-threshold approach reorder the columns of Table 1 according to the increasing order of mutation-frequency in the unaffected individuals. After the table is reordered, z-scores z(s
                        
                           k
                        ), k
                        =1, …, M are calculated for set of the first left k columns. The maximum of the z-scores selects a set of variants with most mutation-frequencies. The weighted-sum method works in a different way. It includes mutations of all frequencies, and weights the variants with allele frequency in controls only. The score of each individual is calculated by a weighted sum of mutation counts, the weights are determined by the inverse of estimated standard deviation of the total mutations in all the samples under the null hypothesis of no association between gene and disease, specifically,

                        +2 using the mutation frequency in the unaffected individuals only. Then all individuals are ranked according to their genetic scores, and the sum of the ranks for affected individuals is calculated to get the final score, and permutation method is used to get the p-value. Our approach, the risk-based variable threshold method, determines the criterion of pooling or weighting by the risks (ratios of allele frequencies) rather than quantities from control group. From now on, we call the original variable-threshold method of Price et al. (2010) as MAF-based variable-threshold method in order to emphasize its difference with our approach. We will compare our method with the MAF-based variable-threshold and the weighted-sum methods in Section 3.

We evaluate the proposed method by extensive simulation studies. Type I error and power are assessed by empirical studies and are compared with variable-threshold and weighted-sum methods. Results show that the proposed method gain efficiency in detecting association.

Following Madsen and Browning (2009), we adopt the additive model. When MAF is small enough, the additive model is equivalent to the dominant model. The variants are assumed to be independent because correlations between rare variants are very low (Pritchard, 2001; Pritchard and Cox, 2002). The affected and the unaffected population are regarded as two groups with different gene generative mechanisms. For unaffected population we use the following Wright's formula (Cohen et al., 2006) to generate the frequency of the mutations at each rare variant locus

                        =1000. We calculate the maximum scores for our risk-based variable-threshold method and the variable-threshold approaches and calculate the ranking score using the weighted-sum method. The p-value of each test is calculated by permutating the individuals K times, with K
                        =1000. For each set of parameters, 1000 replicated data sets are simulated. When ties are present, especially in the ranking process, we break the ties by randomly ranking the variants. The power in detecting overall association at significance level 0.05 are then recorded.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We simulate M
                        =40, 50, 60 and 80 with group PAR at 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01. Under the null hypothesis all rare variants are sampled with the same genotype probabilities in affected and unaffected individuals. As shown in Fig. 1
                        , the type-I error rates at 0.05 level are well controlled for all three methods and there is no trend that one method is better than the other two methods. When null hypothesis is true, PAR does not influence the type-I error rate. Fig. 1 confirms this fact.

We first study the situation when both the functional variants (F-variants) and neutral variants (N-variants) are present. The N-variants are sampled with the same genotype probabilities in affected and unaffected individuals. The group PAR is taken to be 0.1. The number of F-variants is taken to be fixed at 50 and the number of N-variants varies from 104 to 625. Power of the three methods at significance level 0.01 is shown in Fig. 2
                        , in which the x-axis is the proportion of F-variants considered. In this case some mutation frequencies are very small and all variants have very low effect on disease. We see from Fig. 2 that the higher the proportion of F-variants, the larger the power is for all three methods, but the MAF-based variable threshold method performs not so steadily. Our method reveals a power gain over the other two methods, especially when the proportion of F-variants is low. The largest power gain of our method over the MAF-based variable-threshold method is 0.346 when the proportion of F-variants is 16% (with 262 N-variants).

From Fig. 2, the risk-based variable-threshold method gains a high power but not the most power when the proportion of F-variants is 20% (i.e., the number of N-variants and F-variants are 200 and 50) with marginal PAR α
                        =0.1/50=0.002. We conduct more simulation at this setting (20% proportion and marginal PAR 0.002) but with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 F-variants. From Fig. 3
                         we can see that the variable-threshold methods are always more powerful than the weighted-sum method, and the maximum power gain of our method is 0.224. Again, the MAF-based variable-threshold method performs not so stable although its power is close to that of our method.

In Fig. 2, we have set all the marginal PAR of the F-variants to be the same as 0.002. We also investigate the situation that the F-variants have different effects. We still set the number of F-variants to be 50 and choose different N-variants number. The marginal PARs of the F-variants are randomly chosen from uniform distribution U(0, 1), and then divided by 10% of their summation so that the group PAR equal to 0.1. Fig. 4
                         shows that our proposed method still performs the best under this situation as in Fig. 1 and the variability of marginal PAR of F-variant does not affect the performance of the methods. To simplify the presentation, we take marginal PARs to be equal in the following discussion.

The marginal PAR in the group influences the power of the tests also. We evaluate the power at two different settings. First, we fix the total number of variants to be 100 and the number of F-variants to be 50 and the group PAR takes values from 0.01 to 0.1 with increment of 0.01 and two other values: 0.15 and 0.2. In the second setting, we fix the group PAR at 0.1 and the proportion of F-variants at 50% and vary the number of the F-variants. Since the group PAR is fixed, a low number of F-variants yields a high marginal PAR. Fig. 5
                         shows the power of the three methods at significance level 0.05 for the first setting and Fig. 6
                         for the second setting. In both cases, we observe that all three methods perform well when marginal PAR is large. There is no obvious trend that one method performs better than the other two under these parameter settings.

We also investigate the scenario when the functional rare variants operate in different directions. We do this by incorporating the disease-beneficial variants (B-variants). We use the same formula to calculate the genotype probability in the affected individuals for the B-variants by setting α to be negative. Because we set the MAF of the variants to be greater than 0.001, we take the marginal PAR of the B-variants as 10−6 to ensure the effectiveness of the MAF. There are two settings of parameters. In the first setting, M
                        =100, the number of F-variants is 50 and the number of B-variants are taken to be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, respectively. In the second setting, M
                        =150, the number of F-variants is 50, and the number of B-variants are 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, respectively. Fig. 7
                         shows the results for the two settings. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that our method performs a little better than the other two methods at both settings.

We also record the mean number of variants supposing to be the functional variants (SF-variants) at which the maximum score reached and the mean number of real functional variants (RF-variants) among the SF-variants across each replicated data set. Table 2
                         shows the results for different total number of variants M and various group PARs of F-variants settings at 50 F-variants without disease-beneficial variants. Table 3
                         shows the results in presence of disease-beneficial variants. The number of SF-variants from both methods increase as the number of total variants increases, but are almost unchanged when only the group PAR varies. When the number of total variants is not too big, the number of SF-variants chosen by our method and the variable-threshold method are close. With respect to the RF-variants, our method always picks up more than those chosen by the MAF-based variable-threshold method. This indicates that our method is more effective than the MAF-based variable-threshold method in selecting F-variants.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We have proposed in this paper a risk-based variable-threshold method to examine genetic association between rare variants and disease traits. This method is similar to the variable-threshold method (Price et al., 2010). The difference is that our method uses the ratio of the reference allele frequencies in the cases and controls as the pooling/grouping criteria while the variable-threshold method uses the reference allele frequency in the controls as the criteria. So, the proposed method utilizes more information than the variable-threshold approach. As an extension of the variable-threshold approach, Pan and Shen (2011) proposed a series of adaptive tests for detecting association between rare variants and disease traits. The tests take a unified form as

                     here aT(U) denotes an adaptive version of the test T which depends on the order of the components of the score vector U. For example the order of the components U in the default aT test is determined by the chromosome locations of their corresponding rare variants. Different choices of the test statistic T lead to different adaptive tests. Our risk-based variable-threshold method and the original variable-threshold method can be viewed as two different adaptive tests using the same test statistic but different ordering schemes. Do et al. (2012) recommended to use the variable threshold implementations of the tests, and when it is not practical to apply the variable threshold methods a variety of frequency cut-offs should be considered. Our risk-based variable-threshold method and the original variable-threshold method are both variable threshold implementations.

We have assessed power performance of our method and compared with the MAF-based variable-threshold approach and the weighted-sum method under various simulation settings. Our method gains power in some situations. Simulation results show that power of the three methods are affected by the following factors: the proportion of the F-variants and the marginal PAR of each F-variant. We have used two approaches to investigate the influence of the marginal PAR, either by changing the group PAR of the variants or by changing the number of F-variants. Another important aim of association study is to pick the variants which is disease-related. As pointed out by Li and Leal (2008), exclusion of rare functional variants from study may reduce more power than does inclusion of rare nonfunctional variants. We have shown that our method can select more functional rare variants. In our simulations, the rare variants and the common variants are randomly assigned to be functional variants (F-variants), neutral variants (N-variants) and disease-beneficial variants (B-variants). Simulation results have shown that inclusion of protective common variants does not cancel the effects of rare risk variants as long as the latter are not too weak.

The rapidly developed high throughput sequencing technology boosts researches on association analysis of rare variants contributing to complex disease (Do et al., 2012; Gibson, 2012). Neale et al. (2011) proposed a C-alpha test score test based on comparing the expected variance with the observed variance of the distribution over all the variants. Wu et al. (2011) proposed a sequencing kernel association test (SKAT) using the variance-component score statistic with different kernel function choices. The C-alpha test is a special case of the SKAT test. Because of the differences of the spectrum of functional variants and their characteristics between genes, Do et al. (2012) expected that there will be no optimal statistical test, filtering strategy or frequency cut-off for gene-based tests. Our method provides a variable-threshold method based on risks (ratios of allele frequencies between cases and controls) in testing association of rare variants with diseases.
