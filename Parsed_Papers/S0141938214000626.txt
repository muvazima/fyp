                  Recombination zone and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in multilayer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were investigated. Basis device architecture is indium tin oxide (ITO)/N, N′-diphenyl-N, N′-bis(1-naphthyl-phenyl)-1, 1′-biphenyl-4, 4′-diamine (NPB)/4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6-(1, 1, 7, 7- tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB)/NPB (spacer)/tris-(8-hydroxyl quinoline) aluminum (Alq3)/2, 9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1, 10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Al. Exciton recombination zone is located at DCJTB and Alq3 layers. When the NPB spacer is 10-nm-thick, Alq3 emission governs in electroluminescent (EL) spectra owing to absence of FRET between DCJTB and Alq3. FRET occurs while the NPB spacer is 5-nm-thick and thus DCJTB emission is dominant in EL spectra. As the emissive layout of DCJTB/Alq3/NPB substitutes for DCJTB/NPB/Alq3, both DCJTB and NPB emissions are observed due to electron-blocking effect of NPB.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the report of the first low driven voltage organic light-emitting diode (OLED) by Tang and Van Slyke [1], a vast number of publications and patents have been published by both academia and industry. Nowadays, OLED products, such as TVs, mobile phones, are commercially available in display markets [2] and also being explored for next-generation lighting sources [3–5]. For the applications in display as well as solid-state lighting, white light, which is usually composed of three discrete peaks in the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) regions or two complementary colors, such as blue and orange, is generally required. White OLEDs (WOLEDs) can be mainly classified into three kinds according to the used emissive materials: all-fluorescent WOLEDs [6,7], all-phosphorescent WOLEDs [8,9] and hybrid WOLEDs combined fluorescence with phosphorescence [10,11].

In these devices, different emitters, contributing different color components of the overall emission spectrum in WOLEDs, can be blended in a single layer [6] or separated in different layers of the same OLEDs [8] to build single- and multi-layer architectures, or contained in several formally independent cells each of which emits light of a different color (i.e. stacked and tandem structures [12–14]). Light emission of different colors is generated by direct recombination of holes and electrons in emissive materials [15] and/or by energy transfer between various materials [16].

For direct recombination of carriers, an excited state (i.e. exciton) is formed by the sequential trapping of a hole and then an electron onto the emissive material. The direct carrier recombination mechanism is most favorable if the emissive materials have a shallower HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level (i.e. closer to vacuum level) and/or a deeper LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level (i.e. farther from vacuum level) than other materials.

So-called energy transfer is that energy of excitons formed in a high band gap material (i.e. donor) is transferred to a luminophore with a lower band gap (i.e. acceptor) located within the potential radius of the exciton to make the luminophore emit light. Generally, there are two pathways of energy transfer: short range Dexter transfer of triplet excitons and long range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of singlet excitons. If the relative band gap levels of donors and acceptors are balanced, it is possible to saturate the lower energy emitter and obtain emission from both donors and acceptors. However, for WOLEDs, it is difficult to control the energy transfer between R, G and B emitters to achieve balanced white emissive under various bias conditions. As a consequence, voltage-dependent color-shifts caused by evolutions of recombination zone are often observed. Although color-stable white emission has been demonstrated by several research groups [17–19], it is still a relatively challenging task to keep emission color constant over a wide range of brightness levels and over the entire operational lifetime of devices [20–24].

Recently, several types of spacers are introduced to achieve high-efficiency and color-stable WOLEDs [10,25–27]. However, the effect of a spacer on the FRET and recombination zone still deserves further investigation. In this study, based on the device structure of ITO/NPB/DCJTB/NPB/Alq3/BCP/Al (the abbreviations of materials are listed in Table 1
                     ), we demonstrate the influence of emissive layer architecture (such as the emissive layer thickness, spacer thickness) on recombination zone and FRET since the modulation of emissive layer architecture is a simple and effective approach towards achieving high-performance WOLEDs [11].

The configurations and energy levels of devices in this experiment are depicted in Fig. 1
                     . Three sets of devices are prepared.

Set A: ITO/NPB(30nm)/DCJTB(0.3nm)/NPB(10nm)/Alq3(2&5nm)/BCP(40nm)/Al, named as A1 and A2, respectively.

Set B: ITO/NPB(30nm)/DCJTB(0.1nm)/NPB(5nm)/Alq3(2&5nm, labeled as B1&B2, respectively)/BCP(40nm)/Al.

Set C: ITO/NPB(35nm)/DCJTB(0.3nm)/Alq3(1.0nm)/NPB(5nm)/BCP(40nm)/Al.

NPB layer adjacent ITO anode functions as a hole transport layer (HTL). DCJTB and Alq3 are the acceptor and donor of energy transfer, respectively. And BCP plays dual roles of hole-blocking and electron transport layer (HBL&ETL). The NPB layers between DCJTB and Alq3 in sets A&B act as a spacer. The molecular structures of the organic materials can be found elsewhere [28].

The cleaned ITO-patterned substrates are loaded into a vacuum chamber, and thermally evaporated NPB, DCJTB, Alq3 and BCP in turn under a pressure of 2–5×10−4
                     Pa. During the deposition of organic layers, the thicknesses and rates are monitored by a 6MHz quartz crystal oscillator. Then, the substrates are transferred into another chamber to evaporate Al cathode. The overlap of ITO and Al (3mm×3mm) is defined as active area of samples.

The optical and electrical characteristics were immediately recorded after preparation at room temperature under ambient conditions without encapsulation. The electroluminescent (EL) spectra were acquired by a charge-coupled device (CCD) fiber spectroscopic system. The current–voltage–luminance characteristics were simultaneously measured using a software-controlled source meter (Keithley 2410) combined with a calibrated silicon photodiode (Newport 1830C) by PR-650 spectroradiometer.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

An appropriate spacer, located between different emitters, can control energy transfer between different emitters and tune emission spectra [17,25,29]. In this work, the effect of NPB spacer on recombination zone and FRET was investigated. Firstly, devices of sets A and B, with 10- and 5-nm-thickness spacers, respectively, were prepared. Meanwhile, the effect of Alq3 thickness on the spectrum and device performance was examined.

EL spectra are usually helpful to identify the location of the recombination zone. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3
                     
                     , EL spectra of devices A1 and A2 at different applied voltages are normalized to the emission peak of ca. 526nm. It can be found that the spectra of devices A1 and A2 are negligibly changed with applied voltage. Correspondingly, deconvoluted spectra under 12V by Gaussian fitting are also illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Both devices A1 and A2 give two components: green emission of Alq3 and red emission from DCJTB. The ratio of green to red (I
                     Alq3:I
                     DCJTB) can be deduced by integrating the area under them. The calculated values of I
                     Alq3:I
                     DCJTB are 2.5 and 1.5 for devices A1 and A2, respectively. That is, the emission of DCJTB is enhanced with the increase of Alq3 thickness.

As shown in Fig. 1, holes from the anode can be partly captured by DCJTB due to its shallower HOMO relative to that of NPB, and some of holes transfer through NPB spacer into Alq3. On the other hand, a part of electrons from the cathode recombine with holes in Alq3. And some of electrons tunnel through NPB spacer into DCJTB. Electrons are not expected to recombine with holes in NPB due to its shallower LUMO relative to DCJTB and Alq3. Therefore, EL spectra of set A devices contain both DCJTB and Alq3 emission, indicating the recombination zone is located at both Alq3 and DCJTB layers. More electrons tunnel into DCJTB since the electron mobility of Alq3 is increased with the thickness [30]. Hence, more intense emission of DCJTB is observed as the thickness of Alq3 increases.

Next, EL spectra of devices B1 and B2 under various biases are normalized to the maximum peak at ca. 601nm, shown in Fig. 4
                     . The spectra at 12V are correspondingly decomposed by Gaussian fitting, depicted in Fig. 5
                     . Green emission of Alq3 and red emission from DCJTB are also observed in devices B1 and B2. The values of I
                     Alq3:I
                     DCJTB is 0.24 for devices B1 and B2 at 12V, lower than those of devices A1 (2.5) and A2 (1.5). This can be explained by FRET from Alq3 to DCJTB since absorption spectrum of DCJTB and photoluminescent (PL) spectrum of Alq3 are greatly overlapped [31] and also since FRET can occur within the distance of less than 10nm [32].

To further understand the effect of the spacer thickness on FRET from Alq3 to DCJTB, set C with the configuration of ITO/NPB(35nm)/DCJTB(0.3nm)/Alq3(1.0nm)/NPB(5nm)/BCP(40nm)/Al was prepared. The EL spectra of set C (shown in Fig. 6
                     ), different from those of sets A and B, contain two components: the peak of ca. 450nm belonged to emission from NPB and the peak at ca. 622nm originated from emission of DCJTB. The recombination zone is extended to NPB because of its electron-blocking effect [33], shown in Fig. 1(b). Interestingly, the device of set C exhibits no emission from Alq3. It is difficult for excitons to be formed and recombined in Alq3 layer since it has a deeper HOMO than NPB and DCJTB. Moreover, the emission of the ultrathin Alq3 layer, if any exists, can be absorbed by adjacent DCJTB molecules due to efficient FRET between Alq3 and DCJTB.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the emissive layer layout of DCJTB/NPB/Alq3, recombination zone and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in OLEDs are demonstrated. Exciton recombination zone is located at Alq3 and DCJTB layer. When the NPB spacer between DCJTB and Alq3 is 10nm thick, Alq3 emission governs in EL spectra owing to absence of FRET between Alq3 and DCJTB since FRET effectively occurs within the range of less than 10nm. When the thickness of NPB spacer is 5nm, FRET between Alq3 and DCJTB is present and thus DCJTB emission prevails in EL spectra. While the emissive layer layout of DCJTB/NPB/Alq3 is replaced with DCJTB/Alq3/NPB, besides DCJTB emission, NPB emission is observed due to its electron-blocking effect. These results provide a simple but effective approach for the design of white OLEDs, i.e., varying a spacer thickness to control the efficiency of FRET between various emitters.
