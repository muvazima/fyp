                  The specific thermal resistance values of several thermal interface materials (TIMs) intended to thermally enhance Cu contact pairs and their degradation under isothermal ageing at 170°C have been investigated using Cu stack samples consisting of 10 Cu discs and 9 layers of the TIMs. The results obtained indicate that the specific thermal resistance values of the as-prepared Cu stack samples, one with conductive Ag thermal grease, one with Sn–3.5Ag solder joints and one with 25μm thick Sn foil as TIMs are significantly lower than those of the Cu stack sample without any TIM. However, after the isothermal ageing at 170°C for 90days, the specific thermal resistance values of the samples with these TIMs are not substantially different from those of the sample without any TIM. Also reported in this paper is an estimation of testing errors for the specific thermal resistance values, microstructure characterization of the aged samples and effect of the degradation of these TIMs on the thermal performance of a high-temperature half bridge power switch module.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Thermal interface materials (TIMs) have been widely used to minimize the contact thermal resistance between heat-generating electronic components and a variety of cooling systems such as heat sinks and heat pipes [1–5]. For example, in a typical power electronics package as shown schematically in Fig. 1
                     , a TIM is used to enhance the heat transfer between the direct bonded copper (DBC) substrate under the semiconductor chips and a base-plate or heat sink [6]. In a wider context of electronics applications, TIMs can be rather arbitrarily categorized as polymer-based TIMs, solders, metallic foils, sintered metallic TIMs and carbon nano-tubes [1–5,7–16].

Polymer-based TIMs include thermal greases (also called thermal pastes), organic phase-change materials, gels and adhesives [1–5,7,10]. For most of the state of the art polymer-based TIMs, they have good ability of filling microscopic voids and grooves on the mating surfaces, and hence their thermal performance with sufficient thick bondline was found to be more dominated by their bulk thermal conductivities, rather than by the contact resistance values [4]. However, when thin bondlines are used, their thermal performance may be dominated by interface resistance, and they are not stable at elevated temperatures regardless of their thicknesses because the temperatures of glass transition for these polymer-based matrixes are generally lower than 150°C.

The rest of the TIMs are not as well developed and understood as those polymer-based TIMs. Solders are actively being used as TIMs for enhancing the thermal contact between two surfaces because solders have high thermal conductivity and can melt at relatively low temperatures to flow and spread along the mating surfaces [2,4,11]. The thermal performance of as-prepared solder joints used as TIMs is generally very good when compared to the polymer-based TIMs [2,4]. However, used as TIMs, the solders are generally soft Sn-based alloys and are prone to creep at elevated temperatures and the accumulation of plastic work leads to crack initiation and propagation [17,18]. Also, it was pointed out that the growth of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) between a solder and the contact metal on the mating surfaces would reduce the thermal contact conductance [2].

In-Bi–Sn alloys had been used as liquid TIMs and achieved exceptionally low thermal resistance between heat-generating electronic components and heat removal systems [8,9]. However, this approach requires suitable barrier layer which needs to be deposited on the mating surfaces and have both good wettability and slow reaction with the liquid solder alloys [19]. In addition, it is also challenging to obtain polymer-based containments which are reliable at elevated temperatures to provide mechanical support for such thermal interface systems [20].

Relatively soft metallic foils including Sn, In, Pb, Cu, Al and Au under certain amounts of pressure were investigated to improve thermal contact conductance in the stainless steel–stainless steel, mild steel–mild steel and Al alloy–Al alloy contact pairs [1]. Despite that fact that the surface characteristics may have effect on the conductance ratio, the mechanical properties of the foils tend to dominate the effectiveness of the material in thermal conductance applications.

Sintered metallic TIMs using pastes of Ag, Cu, Au, Al, Mg, W and/or Ni nanoparticles to form effective joints between microelectronic devices and heat spreaders have been patented [15]. The sintering temperatures are generally below 250°C, and the sintered TIMs would consist of metallic networks or compacts with high thermal conductivity through burning out of the organic ingredients [13,15].

Because of high flexibility and extremely high axial thermal conductivity, carbon nano-tubes were also investigated for use in TIMs [14,16]. They were mainly added as fillers in the polymer-based TIMs. In recent efforts, they were prepared as stand-alone aligned TIMs to make use of their high axial thermal conductivity, or as freestanding and flexible thermal pads in the form of buckypapers with three-dimensional networks [14].

Despite the wide research and development of the various TIMs described, there is a lack of data about their long-term thermal performance for high temperature power electronics applications. For instance, it is desirable to develop power electronics modules which are reliable in continuous operation in an ambient temperature of 150°C and above for periods of several years. Examples includes aerospace where there is an increasing move to electronic rather than hydraulic or pneumatic systems, automotive under-hood applications in conventional, hybrid and electric drive systems and down-hole gas and oil field applications. Therefore, there is a need to identify suitable TIMs and understand their long-term thermal performance for high temperature power electronics applications.

In the existing literature [7,21], the studies of TIMs were particularly directed for power electronics applications. Narumanchi et al [7] improved the steady-state test method based on the ASTM D5470 to measure the thermal resistance of several commercially available thermal greases at bonding line thickness of 100μm or thicker for automotive power electronics applications. Ousten and Khatir [21] investigated the thermal interface ageing of several elastomer films, phase change materials and graphite sheets under thermal cycling conditions between −50 and +150°C at a pressure of 20bar as found in power modules.

The present study is concerned with the TIMs for high temperature power electronics applications. The objectives of this paper are to: (i) test and report the thermal performance of one conductive Ag thermal grease, one eutectic Sn–Ag solder joint and three soft metallic foils including one Ag and two Sn foils as TIMs to thermally enhance Cu contact pairs at temperatures above 150°C; (ii) investigate and compare the degradation of these TIMs under isothermal ageing at 170°C and a pressure of about 0.5MPa; (iii) characterize the interfacial microstructure between these TIMs and the Cu mating surfaces to explain the degradation of these TIMs after the isothermal ageing; and (iv) provide insight into the effect of the degradation of these TIMs on the thermal performance of one assumed high-temperature half bridge power module.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

The thermal performance of the candidate TIMs were tested by filling them into the 9 interfaces of a stack of 10 polished Cu discs with diameter of 40mm and thickness of 0.88mm. The Cu discs were cut from commercially available 99.9 purity Cu sheet (Obtained from Unicorn Metals, Derby, UK) and then polished to a surface roughness Ra of ∼0.05μm and Rz of ∼1.90μm. The Cu discs were chosen because Cu is widely used as base-plate materials for achieving good ability of heat dissipation in power modules, and one example can be seen from Fig. 1 in Ref. [7].

The conductive Ag thermal grease was commercially available CircuitWorks CW7100 (CircuitWorks®) which is specified to be thermally stable over a wide temperature range of −57°C to 252°C. It was manually applied into the 9 interfaces of one Cu stack sample and the average thickness was about 9μm for each of the 9 layers of applied grease.

Sn-based solder alloys, e.g. eutectic Sn–Ag solder, have been used as TIMs between direct bonded copper substrates and base-plates in commercial power modules. The eutectic Sn–Ag solder selected in the present work was 50μm thick 96.5Sn–3.5Ag preform (obtained from Indium Corporation). The solder preform, measuring 25mm by 25mm, was inserted into each of the 9 interfaces of the Cu stack sample, they were put into a vacuum reflow oven which was first pre-heated up at 200°C and evacuated below 5mbar for 3min, and then held at the same temperature and purged with 2%H298%N2 forming gas (450L/min at 1.5bar) for 5min. The reflow was finally performed at 260°C for 5min, also under the forming gas flow of 450L/min at 1.5bar, before being cooled down to room temperature within 3min. The average thickness for each of the 9 layers of as-reflowed solder joints was approximately 25μm. It should be pointed out that a relatively long reflow time of 5min at 260°C was used to ensure that the liquid solder could wet and spread over all the interfaces of the 10 Cu discs sufficiently.

Metallic Sn and Ag foils were selected because they can be compared with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint and conductive Ag thermal grease, respectively. Two Sn foils were considered and they included 25μm thick, hard and 99.9% pure Sn foil and 12.5μm thick, tempered as rolled and 97.8% pure Sn foil (obtained from Alfa Aesar and Advent respectively). Only one Ag foil was used and it was 25μm thick, annealed and 99.95% pure Ag foil (obtained from Alfa Aesar). For all the three metallic foils, they were first cut into circular pieces, the same size as the Cu discs, and then placed into each of the 9 interfaces of one Cu stack sample.

The thermal resistance values of the TIMs in the Cu stack samples as described above were tested based on the steady-state test method. The stack samples consisting of 10 Cu discs and 9 layers of identical TIM were employed to increase the overall thermal resistance measured to improve absolute accuracy of the results. The thermal tests were performed with an experimental rig as schematically shown in Fig. 2
                        . The heating source was three electrical cartridge heaters with a total power of 640W, and the cooler was an oil-based cooler allowing testing at high temperatures. The bottom surfaces of the hot plate and the top surface of the cool plate which contact the stack sample were both polished to a surface roughness similar to that of the polished Cu discs. Both the top and bottom of the stack was insulated with Duratek insulation blocks with a low thermal conductivity of 0.5Wm−1
                        K−1, and the pressure was applied using a hydraulic pump. During every test, the lateral sides of both the hot plate and the stack sample were further insulated using thermal barrier foam.

All the above samples with the candidate TIMs and one stack sample of 10 Cu discs without any TIM were tested under three conditions that were easily controlled with the experimental rig: (I) a power level of 200W for the heater and a pressure of 1.4MPa; (II) a power level of 200W for the heater and a pressure of 3.0MPa; and (III) a power level of 350W for the heater and a pressure of 3.0MPa. Between the measurements, the Cu stack samples were clamped together with a pressure of ∼0.5MPa and put into the isothermal ageing at 170°C in air. It should be pointed out the levels of pressure on the sample during both the thermal testing and the isothermal ageing were similar to those usually encountered in power module interfaces [7,21]. The results of the bare Cu discs without any TIM will be used as bench marks to reveal how serious the high temperature degradation of the candidate TIMs after the isothermal ageing was.

During each test, the temperatures measured from 6 thermal couples installed in the hot and cool plates were monitored until the heat transfer of the system reached the steady state. The specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs, Rth
                        , was calculated using the following equation:

A factor of 12 rather than 10 is placed in the front of d because the distance between the top three thermal couples and the bottom surface of the hot plate and the distance between the bottom three thermal couples and the top surface of the cool plate are both similar to the thickness of one Cu disc.

                         values were estimated from the tested results of the Cu stack sample without any TIM, and will be presented below.

After the Cu stack samples were aged at 170°C for 90days, metallographic cross-sections were prepared for characterizing their interfacial microstructures. The samples were first mounted in epoxy resin that was cured at room temperature for over 24h. The mounted samples were then successively ground with 400, 800, 1000, 1200 and 2400 grit SiC papers and eventually polished using diamond slurries of 3μm and 1μm both for 10min.

A JEOL 6400 scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) using both the secondary electron and backscattered electron signals was employed to observe and analyze the microstructural features and take the corresponding images from the polished cross-sectional samples. The interfacial reaction products formed between the Cu discs and the TIMs were identified using an Oxford Instruments ISIS EDXS microanalysis system fitted on the SEM.

                         presents the results of the thermal testing for the Cu stack sample without any TIM, showing the effects of test condition and aging time on the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs. For testing condition I, Ttop
                         was in the range of 152–169°C, and Tbot
                         was in the range of 104–124°C. For testing condition II, Ttop
                         was in the range of 144–166°C, and Tbot
                         was in the range of 107–128°C. For testing condition III, Ttop
                         was in the range of 182–209°C, and Tbot
                         was in the range of 135–149°C. During the calculation of the specific thermal resistance with Eq. (1), the Rth

                         values before the sample was aged for over 30days. This is because the bottom surface of the hot plate and the top surface of the cool plate had surface roughness similar to that of the Cu discs. Then the Rth

                           S
                        
                        /
                        
                           P
                         values were estimated with the dash lines in Fig. 3. This is because with increase in the ageing time, the Cu discs had locally been joined to each other through the formation of CuO at the interfaces between the Cu discs as shown in Fig. 4
                        . In this case, the thermal resistance between two Cu discs should be lower than that between the top surface of the Cu stack and the bottom surface of the hot plate or between the bottom surface of the Cu stack and the top surface of the cool plate. It should be pointed out that another stack sample of 10 as-polished Cu discs without any TIM had been used to check the reproducibility of the thermal tests from time to time, and the difference between the different measurements were all within ±5% relative to those values shown in Fig. 3 for ageing time of zero under the three testing conditions. This reveals that the effect of ageing of the bottom surface of the hot plate and the top surface of the cool plate was negligible. Therefore, the Rth
                        
                        ,
                        
                           S
                        
                        /
                        
                           P
                         values were considered as slight increase with ageing time after 30days, taking into account of the increase in the thickness of CuO at the top and bottom surfaces of the aged Cu stack samples.

From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs decreases with increasing both pressure and temperature during the test. This is easy to be understood because the true contact area between two Cu discs increases with increase in the pressure. The Young’s modulus and yield strength of copper decrease with increasing temperature [22], which also leads to increase in the true contact area occurring at microscopic surface asperities between two Cu discs. Therefore, with increasing both pressure and temperature, the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs decreases because of the increase in true contact area [4].

During the early stage of the isothermal ageing, the CuO layer formed at two adjacent surfaces of the Cu discs had not joined to each other at any location. The specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs increases with increasing the ageing time because an oxide is generally harder and has lower thermal conductivity than the corresponding pure metal. With further increasing the ageing time, the CuO layers formed at the two adjacent Cu continuously grew and locally joined together. This resulted in increase in the true contact area, and hence the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs appears to decrease with increasing the ageing time during the late stage.

                            present the results of the thermal testing for the Cu stack samples with the TIMs compared to the Cu stack sample without any TIM. For the results in Fig. 5 tested under testing condition I, the corresponding Ttop
                           
                           =127–171°C and Ttop
                           
                           
                           −
                           
                           Tbot
                           
                           =11–60°C for the different samples and ageing times. For the results in Fig. 6 tested under testing condition II, the corresponding Ttop
                           
                           =125–168°C and Ttop
                           
                           
                           −
                           
                           Tbot
                           
                           =10–60°C for the different samples and ageing times. For the results in Fig. 7 tested under testing condition III, the corresponding Ttop
                           
                           =154–215°C and Ttop
                           
                           −
                           Tbot
                           
                           =15–81°C for the different samples and ageing times. The majority of the results in Fig. 7 can be considered as the thermal resistance values at temperatures above 150°C which is of interest in the present work.

Similar to the result for the sample without any TIM, the specific thermal resistance values of all the Cu stack samples with the TIMs decrease with increasing both the testing pressure as can be seen by comparing Figs. 5 and 6 and the testing temperature (which was achieved by using two levels of heating power 200 and 350W) as can be seen through comparing Figs. 6 and 7. Such effects of varying pressure and temperature on the specific thermal resistance for all the Ag and Sn foils and conductive Ag grease as the TIMs can also be explained similarly. This is because for the Cu stack samples with these TIMs, each of the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs consists of the contact resistance of two Cu/TIM interfaces and the bulk resistance of the corresponding TIM itself. Microscopically, the true contact areas between Cu and these TIMs increase, and hence the contact resistance values decrease with increasing both the testing pressure and temperature. On the other hand, even for the softest conductive Ag grease, the change of the average thickness of the applied grease under the three testing conditions could be neglected. Therefore, the effects of the testing pressure and temperature on the thickness and thermal conductivity and thereby the bulk resistance values of these TIMs are negligible [23,24].

For the as-reflowed eutectic Sn–3.5Ag solder joint as TIM, the tested specific thermal resistance values under the three testing conditions were all around 5Kmm2/W. They are clearly lower than the specific thermal resistance value calculated from the thermal contact conductance value of 20.8×104
                           W/(m2
                           °C) for a 25μm thick solder TIM that was reported in Ref. [2]. The present results reveal that there must be some contact resistance between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu. This may be attributed to the fact that metallurgical bonding (identified by the formation of Cu–Sn intermetallic compounds) between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu was only partly achieved in the as-reflowed sample (Fig. 8
                           a), or a chain of voids or defects was formed and grew along the interface between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound (IMC) with increasing the ageing time (Fig. 8b and c). During the thermal test, the true contact area at part of the Sn–3.5Ag/Cu interface where no metallurgical bonding was formed would increase, or more voids or defects along the Sn–3.5Ag solder/Cu6Sn5 IMC interface would be closed with increasing the testing pressure. In both cases, the contact resistance between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu would decrease with increasing the testing pressure to some extent. The effect of the testing temperature on the specific thermal resistance might also be related to increase in the true contact area at the Sn–3.5Ag/Cu interface or increase in the closure of the voids or defects along the Sn–3.5Ag solder/Cu6Sn5 with increasing testing temperature. This is because the Young’s modulus and yield strength values of both Cu and Sn–3.5Ag solder decrease, and the creep strain rate of Sn–3.5Ag solder increases with increasing temperature [22]. Another possibility is the bulk thermal resistance of the Sn–3.5Ag solder that probably decreases with increasing temperature because the thermal conductivity of a metallic alloy generally increases slightly with increase in temperature [24].

For the as-prepared Cu stack samples, the specific thermal resistance between two Cu discs and all the TIMs is reduced when compared to the Cu stack sample without any TIM under the three testing conditions. Overall, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack samples with the different TIMs all increase with increasing the isothermal aging time. The specific thermal resistance of the Cu stack sample with 12.5μm thick Sn foil somewhat fluctuates with respect to the aging time. During the different periods of isothermal ageing, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack samples with 25μm thick Sn foil and 25μm thick Ag foil are quite similar to each other, and those of the Cu stack samples with 25μm thick Sn–3.5Ag solder joint and 9μm thick conductive Ag thermal grease are more similar to each other. After the isothermal ageing at 170°C for 90days, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack samples with four of the five TIMs are not substantially different from those of the Cu stack sample without any TIM. One exception is the aged Cu stack sample with 12.5μm thick Sn foil as TIM, and its specific thermal resistance values are somewhat higher than those of the other samples.

As aforementioned, the conductive Ag thermal grease is specified to be thermally stable over a wide temperature range of −57°C to 252°C. However, the present result reveals that its thermal performance is not durable for continuous operation at a temperature of 170°C. This is probably due to the fact that the polymer-based matrix in this conductive Ag thermal grease had been gradually burnt out over the isothermal ageing. As a result, only the Ag particles were left and the true contact between the Ag particles and the Cu surfaces was extremely low, see Fig. 9
                           .

Despite the fact that metallurgical bonding between Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu was formed or at least partly formed, the thermal performance of the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint appears to be similar to that of the conductive Ag thermal grease. From the data of thermal conductivity of the Cu–Sn IMCs and Sn–3.5Ag solder reported in [23,25], and the cross-sectional structure of the as-soldered sample and the sample after the isothermal ageing shown in Fig. 8a and b, the increase in the thermal resistance of the Cu stack sample with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint as TIM with increasing the aging time cannot be explained with the increase in the thicknesses of the IMCs formed between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and the Cu. This is because the thermal conductivity values of 34.1Wm−1
                           K−1 and 70.4Wm−1
                           K−1 for the Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs are similar to or higher than the value of 36.2Wm−1
                           K−1 for the Sn–3.5Ag solder [25]. Therefore, the degradation of the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint as TIM is also more probably related to the voids or defects formed along the interface between the Sn–3.5Ag solder and Cu6Sn5 IMC as previously mentioned (Fig. 8c). Although the percentage of these voids and defects within the bondline may be negligible, they had gradually developed towards a continuous crack, likely leading to significant increase in the thermal resistance. This is because the thickness of the crack mainly consisting of the voids was approximately 0.5μm, which is larger than the mean free path of air molecules at ambient pressure, i.e. <100nm. Given the fact that the thermal conductivity of air is lower than 0.04Wm−1
                           K−1, a continuous crack of 0.5μm in width and filled with air would contribute to a thermal resistance higher than 12.5Kmm2
                           W−1. Such a contribution is in qualitative agreement with the increase in the thermal resistance of the Cu stack sample with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint as TIM.

It is interesting to note that prior to isothermal ageing, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack samples with 12.5μm thick Sn foil and 25μm thick Sn foil are similar to those of the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Sn–3.5Ag solder joint. However, during the early isothermal ageing, the former specific resistance values appear to be higher than the latter specific thermal resistance values. This may be ascribed to the different interfacial microstructure in the as-prepared Cu stack samples. As can be seen from Fig. 10
                           , Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs were observed only at one of the two original Sn/Cu interfaces, and more CuO was formed at the other Sn/Cu interface without true contact between Sn and Cu in the Cu stack sample with 12.5μm thick Sn foil. By contrast, Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs were observed at the two original Sn/Cu interfaces, and less CuO was formed at local Sn/Cu interface in the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Sn foil after the isothermal ageing. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the formation and growth of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs at the original Sn/Cu interfaces in the Cu stack samples with 12.5μm thick Sn foil were less uniform than those in the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Sn foil, and they were both less uniform than those in the Cu stack sample with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint during the early ageing. This may be the reason why the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack sample with 12.5μm thick Sn foil fluctuate with respect to the ageing time and are higher than those of the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Sn foils, and they are both higher than those of the Cu stack sample with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint. Also, the non-uniform formation and growth of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn IMCs at the original Sn/Cu interfaces in the Cu stack samples with12.5μm thick Sn foil might lead to reduction in the true contact during the early aging stage. This is probably the reason why an abrupt increase in the thermal resistance of this Cu stack sample was observed for ageing time of 0–10days. After the isothermal ageing for 90days, the interfacial microstructure in the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Sn foil were more or less similar to that in the Cu stack sample with the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint (Figs. 8b and 10b). Therefore, the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint can offer lower specific resistance than the Sn foil as TIM during early stage of the isothermal ageing, but their specific thermal resistance values are finally close to each other (Figs. 5–7).

Prior to the isothermal ageing, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Ag foil are higher than those of the Cu stack samples with the other four TIMs under the three testing conditions. This may be ascribed to relatively higher Young’s modulus and hardness (thus the yield strength) of Ag than those of Sn and Sn–3.5Ag solder, leading to smaller true contact area between Ag and Cu. However, the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Ag foil increase more slowly than those of the Cu stack samples with the other TIMs over the entire ageing time of 90days. As shown in Fig. 11
                           , there is a thin layer of CuO with quite uniform thickness formed at the two original Ag/Cu interfaces between two Cu discs and one layer of Ag foil, after the Cu stack sample was subjected to the isothermal ageing for 90days. The formation of CuO should increase the chemical bonding and thus increase the path of heat transfer between the Cu and the Ag foil. On the other hand, there is also a chain of voids accompanying this layer of CuO at the Cu side. These voids are thermal barriers of heat transfer and would increase the thermal resistance between the Cu and the Ag foil. Therefore, a combination of the above two aspects led to the observed evolution of the specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack sample with 25μm thick Ag foil over the ageing time.

In addition, it may be arguable that changing the samples pressure between the isothermal ageing and the three different test conditions for thermal resistance measurements as well as for the preparation of metallographic cross-sections might have an impact on the interfacial microstructures of the samples. However, the pressure levels applied during both the isothermal aging and the thermal testing were significantly lower than the strength values of the interfacial solid phases in all the tested samples. Furthermore, no microstructural feature observed in all the samples can be reasonably ascribed to the damage caused by preparation of the metallographic cross-sections. Therefore, such an impact must be very weak (even if it existed) and have been ignored in the above discussion.

The uncertainty of the temperature measured by the thermocouples was within ±0.5°C and that of the power levels provided by the heater during the thermal tests was within ±5W. The testing error caused by these two uncertainties should be negligible as can be estimated with Eq. (1). As aforementioned, the repeatability of the specific thermal resistance values for the Cu stack sample without any TIM was experimentally verified to be within ±5% for the variations. However, during calculation of the above presented specific thermal resistance values for the different samples, the heat losses through the top insulation block and lateral sides of the samples and heating plate were ignored, and the temperature distribution and heat flux through the samples were assumed to be one-dimensional. In order to estimate the testing errors from these assumptions, finite element (FE) analysis using commercial software Abaqus 6.10-2 and its graphic user interface CAE has been employed to simulate the temperature fields within the Cu stack samples with the conductive Ag thermal grease and without any TIM under the thermal testing conditions I and III.

In the FE model, the heating power of 200W or 350W was applied as volumetric heating sources within the cartridge heater. The top surface of the top insulation block was defined as a convection boundary with a heat transfer coefficient of 200Wm−2
                        K−1 to ensure that the heat loss through the top surface was not underestimated (Further increasing this value had no appreciable effect on the simulated temperature fields). Despite the fact that the lateral sides of both the hot plate and the stack sample were further insulated using thermal barrier foam during the thermal testing, these lateral sides were defined as convection boundaries all with a heat exchange coefficient of 5 Wm-2K-1 which may correspond to the worst heat loss through these lateral sides [26]. Rather than defining a convection boundary at the inner wall of the oil-based cooler, the temperature values measured with the three bottom thermocouples during the thermal tests were used to define a plane boundary with linear temperature distribution.

During the FE simulation, the specific thermal resistance values obtained with the thermal tests were considered as the real values and applied between the Cu discs. The temperature values at the tips of the three top thermocouples were taken as unknown and were determined from the simulated temperature fields and used to calculate the “measured” specific thermal resistance values with Eq. (1). Because these temperatures were determined from the solutions of the nodes within, rather than at the boundaries of the domain, they were less sensitive to the meshing size, and the difference would be less than 0.1°C even if the meshing size was further significantly reduced. Assuming that the Rth

                         presents the plot of the specific thermal resistance calculated through the FE simulation versus the real specific thermal resistance. The good linearity of this plot demonstrates that the tested specific thermal resistance values in Figs. 5–7 can be used to provide relative comparison among the different samples, testing conditions and periods of isothermal ageing. Furthermore, the slope of the fitted line in this plot shows that tested specific thermal resistance values were at most 12.2% underestimated when compared with the real values, if the testing errors caused by other factors were ignored.

In order to provide insight into how the degradation of the presently tested TIMs would affect the thermal performance of high-temperature power electronic modules, transient temperature fields within an “assumed” high-temperature half-bridge power switch packaged with an integrated base-plate cooler as shown in Fig. 13
                         have been simulated using FE analysis as a function of specific thermal resistance of the TIM and heat exchange coefficient of the cooler. In Fig. 13, the size of both IGBTs is 13×13×0.3mm, and that of both diodes is 9.5×7.5×0.3mm. Conventional Sn–3.5Ag solder joins with a thickness of 0.1mm are used for attaching the IGBTs, diodes and joining the Cu bus bars on the AlN-based substrate. The AlN-based substrate is 0.3mm thick active brazed Cu on both sides of 1mm thick AlN tile. The Al wires used for the electrical interconnects are represented with half circular wires of 0.38mm in diameter. All bonding areas between the Al wires and the dies and between the Al wires and the Cu substrate are all 0.38×2mm. The integrated base-plate cooler is made of Cu and the TIM between the substrate and the cooler is represented with an effective thermal resistance in the range of 0.1–35Kmm2
                        W−1. Because the insulation epoxy and plastic encapsulation have thermal conductivities that are much lower than the other materials in the power switch module, their effects on the thermal analysis are negligible and therefore they were not included in the FE analysis.

In the simulation, the power losses of the IGBTs and diodes as shown in Fig. 14
                         were taken as heating sources to simulate the thermal performance of the switch during a realistic mission profile. The inner wall of the cooler was set as convection boundary, and two heat exchange coefficients, 15,000 and 3000Wm−2
                        k−1 were considered and compared. The other boundaries were approximated as adiabatic boundaries, and the temperature of the coolant and the initial temperature of the entire module were both set as 150°C. In addition, the thermal properties of all materials of Si, Al, Cu, AlN and Sn–3.5Ag solder in the power switch module for the thermal simulation were taken from Refs. [22,27].


                        Fig. 15
                         gives an example of the simulated hottest temperature field in the half bridge switch module during the mission profile. Note that the maximum juncture temperature is observed on the IGBT whose gate has been connected with Al wire, rather than the other IGBT whose gate has been left without any interconnection. Fig. 16
                         shows the simulated maximum juncture temperature in the half bridge switch module as a function of the specific thermal resistance to represent the TIM between the substrate and the cooler and the heat exchange coefficient applied at the inner wall of the cooler. For one example of the high-temperature power electronics design and applications, the maximum juncture temperature in the half bridge switch module may be limited to 175°C. For high-temperature applications, we may take the results given in Fig. 7 and calibrate them with Fig. 12 as the specific thermal resistance values of the tested TIMs. For the as-prepared Cu stack samples with the conductive Ag thermal grease, Sn–3.5Ag solder joint and two Sn foils as TIMs, the specific thermal resistance values were 1.9–5.9Kmm2
                        W−1. From Fig. 16, it can be seen that these values can meet the thermal resistance requirement of the TIM for ensuring the maximum juncture temperature of the power switch to be lower than 175°C during the mission profile under a heat exchange coefficient of 15,000Wm−2
                        k−1 that can be readily achieved with a water-based cooler [6,7]. However, if any of these TIMs is used in the power switch module, its degradation over high temperature ageing would result in increase in the specific thermal resistance and the maximum juncture temperature being above 175°C soon. Enhancing the cooling boundary condition up to a heat exchange coefficient of 30,000Wm−2
                        k−1, the conductive Ag thermal grease and the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint may enable the power switch module for short term operation before their specific thermal resistance values degrade and rise over 13Kmm2
                        W−1. Therefore, unless other TIMs with the thermal resistance values lower and/or more stable than the presently tested TIMs are used, the half bridge power switch module shown in Fig. 13 has to be re-designed to reduce the power density so as to decrease the heat dissipation and/or use a much more intensive cooler which produces a significantly higher heat transfer coefficient.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Based on the above results and discussion for the tested TIMs, the following conclusions are drawn:
                        
                           (1)
                           The tested specific thermal resistance values of the Cu stack samples with the TIMs and without any TIM all decrease with increasing pressure and temperature. This can be mainly attributed to the contact resistance values between the interfaces which decrease with increasing pressure and temperature.

The specific thermal resistance values of the as-prepared Cu stack samples with conductive Ag thermal grease, Sn–3.5Ag solder joint and 25μm thick Sn foil as TIMs are significantly lower than those of the Cu stack sample without any TIM. The lowest thermal resistance values have been achieved with the conductive Ag thermal grease.

After the isothermal ageing at 170°C for 90days, the specific thermal resistance values of the samples with these TIMs are not substantially different from those of the sample without any TIM. Over the entire period of isothermal ageing, the evolution of the specific thermal resistance for the conductive Ag thermal grease is similar to that of the Sn–3.5Ag solder joints.

The formation and growth of CuO on Cu surface may contribute to both an increase and decrease in the specific thermal resistance of the Cu stack samples. The degradation of the Ag thermal grease was due to the burn out of the polymer-based matrix, and the degradation of the Sn–3.5Ag solder joint was probably related to the formation and growth of voids and defects along the Cu6Sn5/Sn–3.5Ag solder interface during the isothermal ageing.

Testing errors estimated through FE analysis reveals that the tested specific thermal resistance values can be used to provide relative comparison among the different samples. The tested specific thermal resistance values were at most 12.2% underestimated when compared with the real values, if the testing errors were caused by ignoring the heat losses through the insulation blocks and assuming the heat transfer across the Cu stack samples being one-dimensional.

For high-temperature applications, the effect of the degradation of the TIMs on the thermal performance of power switch modules must be taken into account for ensuring long-term operation.
