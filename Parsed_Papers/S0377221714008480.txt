                  In this paper we examine multi-objective linear programming problems in the face of data uncertainty both in the objective function and the constraints. First, we derive a formula for the radius of robust feasibility guaranteeing constraint feasibility for all possible scenarios within a specified uncertainty set under affine data parametrization. We then present numerically tractable optimality conditions for minmax robust weakly efficient solutions, i.e., the weakly efficient solutions of the robust counterpart. We also consider highly robust weakly efficient solutions, i.e., robust feasible solutions which are weakly efficient for any possible instance of the objective matrix within a specified uncertainty set, providing lower bounds for the radius of highly robust efficiency guaranteeing the existence of this type of solutions under affine and rank-1 objective data uncertainty. Finally, we provide numerically tractable optimality conditions for highly robust weakly efficient solutions.

                     i ∈ I, is called the objective matrix. The problem 
                        
                           (
                           
                              P
                              ¯
                           
                           )
                        
                      has been extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., the overviews Branke et al., 2008; Ehrgott, 2005), where perfect information is often assumed (that is, accurate values for the input quantities or parameters), despite the reality that such precise knowledge is rarely available in practice for real-world optimization problems.

The data of real-world optimization problems are often uncertain (that is, they are not known exactly at the time of the decision) due to estimation errors, prediction errors, or lack of information. Scalar uncertain optimization problems have been traditionally treated via sensitivity analysis which estimates the impact of small perturbations of the data in the optimal value, while robust optimization, which provides a deterministic framework for uncertain problems, has recently emerged as a powerful alternative approach (see, for instance, Ben-Tal and El Ghaoui, 2009; Bertsimas and Sim, 2004; El Ghaoui and Lebret, 1997; Goberna et al., 2013; Jeyakumar and Li, 2010).

Particular types of uncertain multi-objective linear programming problems have already been studied, e.g., Sitarz (2008) considers changes in one objective function via sensitivity analysis, while Pando et al. (2013) consider changes in the whole objective function 
                        
                           x
                           ↦
                           
                              C
                              ¯
                           
                           x
                        
                      and Goberna et al. (2014) considers change in the constraints by using different robustness approaches. The purpose of the present work is to study multi-objective linear programming problems in the face of data uncertainty both in the objective function and constraints from a robustness perspective.

Following the robust optimization framework, the multi-objective problem 
                        
                           (
                           
                              P
                              ¯
                           
                           )
                        
                      in the face of data uncertainty both in the objective matrix and in the data of the constraints can be captured by a parameterized multi-objective linear programming problem of the form

In this paper, we provide some answers to the above questions for the uncertain multi-objective linear programming problem (P) in the face of data uncertainty by focusing on two choices of the robust optimal solutions: the first one is called a minmax robust efficient solution or simply robust efficient solution following the approach widely used in robust scalar optimization problem (see also Ehrgott et al. (2014); Kuroiwa and Lee (2012) for recent development), and corresponds to an efficient solution to a deterministic worst-case (minmax) multi-objective optimization problem; the second one is called highly robust efficient solution as in Ide and Schöbel (2013) and Kuhn et al. (2013) (see also Sitarz, 2008; Pando et al., 2013, Section 4), and consists of the preservation of the efficiency for all

                        U
                      is small in some sense (e.g., Cartesian products of balls in

                      ). To compensate the “smallness” of the uncertainty set, we focus our analysis on the larger class of highly robust solutions: highly robust weakly efficient solutions. On the other hand, in (Pando et al., 2013, Section 4), highly robust efficient solutions are considered instead of highly robust weakly efficient solutions. For the convenience of the reader, other notions of robust solutions are summarized in Appendix A.

Our key contributions are outlined as follows:

                        
                           (1)
                           We first introduce the concept of radius of robust feasibility in Section 3, guaranteeing non emptiness of the robust feasible set X of (P) under affinely parameterized data uncertainty. This concept is inspired by the notion of consistency radius used in linear semi-infinite programming in order to guarantee the feasibility of the nominal problem under perturbations preserving the number of constraints (Cánovas et al., 2005, Cánovas et al., 2011). We derive a formula for the effective computation of the radius of robust feasibility that also applies to single-objective linear programming under the same type of uncertainty.

We examine the robust weakly efficient solution of an uncertain multi-objective linear programming problem in Section 4, and establish numerically tractable mathematical characterizations of robust weakly efficient solutions under various data uncertainty.

We present, in Section 5, an explicit formula for the radius of highly robust efficiency, i.e., the greatest value of certain parameter associated with two families of uncertainty sets for the objective data such that the corresponding multi-objective linear programming problems have highly robust weakly efficient solutions. The mentioned families are formed by Cartesian products of balls in 
                                 
                                    R
                                    n
                                 
                               and by segments in 
                                 
                                    R
                                    
                                       m
                                       ×
                                       n
                                    
                                 
                               in the direction of rank-1 matrices (the same type of uncertainty considered in Pando et al., 2013, Section 4). Recall that rank-1 matrices are the products of non-zero column vectors by non-zero row vectors (see Osnaga, 2005 for other characterizations). These matrices are frequently used in computational algebra (as building blocks for more complex matrices), in conic optimization (as the rank-1 matrices are the extreme rays of the semidefinite cone), and in statistics (as the singular value decomposition gives the best rank-1 approximation of a given matrix with respect to the Frobenius and the spectral norms).

We finally provide, in Section 6, numerically tractable mathematical characterizations of highly robust weakly efficient solutions under various data uncertainty.

                            we can measure the size of this perturbation as the supremum of the distances between the vectors of coefficients corresponding to the same index. This can be done by endowing the parameter space

We would like to note that we have given a self-contained proof for Theorem 4 by exploiting the finiteness of the linear inequality system. This proof is totally different from the one given in (Goberna et al., 2014, Theorem 2.5), where we made a massive use of the very technical stability machinery for linear semi-infinite systems developed in Cánovas et al. (2005); 2011).

In the following example we show how the radius of robust feasibility of (Pα
                     ) can be calculated using Theorem 4.

Below, we show that robust solutions for uncertain multi-objective linear programming problems with various objective data uncertainty sets can be found by solving deterministic multi-objective linear programming problems or deterministic linear multi-objective programming problems with cone constraints, and so, can be computed via existing technology of deterministic multi-objective programming problems (cf. Ehrgott, 2005). These classes of commonly used data uncertainty sets include box data uncertainty, norm data uncertainty and ellipsoidal data uncertainty. We note that these data uncertainty sets have been successfully employed in modeling uncertain scalar optimization problem arising in diverse areas such as finance (Costa and Paiva, 2002), management science (Bertsimas and Thiele, 2006), statistical learning (Jeyakumar et al., 2014; Lanckriet et al., 2002; Li et al., 2011) and engineering (Ben-Tal and Nemirovski, 1997; Lorenz and Boyd, 2005).

We finally note that in the case when the objective function is free of uncertainty, the characterization of a robust solution for uncertain multi-objective linear programming problem under ellipsoidal constraint data uncertainty was derived in Goberna et al. (2014).

From now on, we consider highly robust solutions for uncertain multi-objective linear programming problems of the form

                        U
                     . Consequently, we may assume without loss of generality that 
                        
                           V

                      is a compact convex set, for each j ∈ J , while 
                        U
                      is a compact set.

Next we first provide a simple uncertain multi-objective linear programming problem where the set of highly robust weakly efficient solutions is nonempty.

                           and so, the set of highly robust weakly efficient solutions is {(1, −1), ( − 1, 1)}. In this case 
                              U
                            is not a cartesian product, so that there is no minmax robust weakly efficient solution.

The relationship between minmax robust solutions and highly robust solutions is established in the following proposition.

The next example illustrates the fact that the set of highly robust weakly efficient solutions may be empty despite of the existence of minmax robust weakly efficient solutions (the opposite situation holds, e.g., whenever 
                        U
                      fails to be a Cartesian product of subsets of

                           so that there is no highly robust weakly efficient solution.

For this purpose, consider the parameterized uncertain linear multi-objective programming problem

                         in (23) can be effectively computed.

Below, we provide two examples. The first example illustrates how to use (23) to compute a lower bound for the radius of highly robust efficiency. The second example shows that the lower bound for the radius of highly robust efficiency provided by (23) can be achieved (and so, is the best possible lower bound).

In Theorem 18 we require that 
                           
                              v

                               are polytopes. Note that (i)⇒(iv) always holds because of (25) and Definition 11. Finally, the implication (iv)⇒(ii) is immediate by the usual characterization for weakly efficient solutions (e.g., see Goberna et al., 2013, Proposition 18 (iii)). Thus, the conclusion follows.□

The equivalence (i)⇔(iii) in Corollary 20, on robust weakly efficient solutions of uncertain vector linear programming problems, can be seen as a counterpart of (Pando et al., 2013, Theorem 3.1), on robust efficient solutions of the same type of problems.

Next, we provide various classes of commonly used uncertainty sets determining the robust feasible set

Throughout this section we assume that the objective function of (1) satisfies the rank-1 matrix data uncertainty, as defined in Section 5. We begin with the simple box constraint data uncertainty.

                        Theorem 23 shows that one can determine whether a robust feasible point

                         under norm data uncertainty is a highly robust weakly efficient solution or not by solving finitely many sth-order cone systems (that is, linear equations where the variable lies in the ball determined by the ‖ · ‖
                           s
                        -norm) as long as the strict feasibility condition (35) is satisfied.

In this subsection we consider the case where the constraint data are uncertain and belong to the ellipsoidal constraint data uncertainty sets

The above robust solution characterization under the constraint ellipsoidal data uncertainty shows that one can determine whether a robust feasible point is a highly robust weakly efficient solution point or not by solving finitely many second order cone systems as long as the strict robust feasibility condition (39) is satisfied.

                     i = 1, …, m. When the uncertainty affects exclusively the objective function f, the functional constraints gj
                     (x) ≤ 0, j = 1, …, p, are usually subsumed by the set constraint x ∈ S. The uncertainty in (P) may be produced by internal sources (rounding errors occurring in the computation of solutions) or from external sources (data uncertainty).

Although this paper only considers problems with external uncertainty, let us mention here two concepts of robust solution which have been introduced for problems with internal uncertainty, where robustness is synonymous of stability. In Deb and Gupta (2005) and Deb and Gupta (2006), the solutions to the multi-objective problem where each function fi, i = 1, …, m, in (P) is replaced by its average

                      are called robust solutions of Type II (Deb and Gupta, 2005; 2006 only consider efficient solutions, but other users could be interested by weakly efficient solutions, properly efficient solutions or strongly efficient solutions). These concepts of robust solution, and other notions formulated in terms of fuzzy numbers, are discussed in Dellnitz and Witting (2009).

Concerning problems with data uncertainty, the aim of the robust optimization approach is to find solutions which remain feasible and of good quality for all or for some possible scenario (i.e., realization of the uncertain data). To do this, the decision maker must select the requirement (either ‘all’ or ‘some’) and the precise interpretation of ‘good quality’.

When the uncertainty only affects the constraints, the immunization against infeasibility requires to replace each constraint function gj
                      in (P) by its supremum over all possible scenarios 
                        
                           sup
                           
                              g
                              j
                           
                           ,
                        
                      giving rise to a deterministic multi-objective semi-infinite programming problem (RP), called robust counterpart, whose solutions are called ordinary robust solutions to (P) (see Ben-Tal and El Ghaoui, 2009; Bertsimas et al., 2011).

Different robust counterparts have been proposed for (P) when the uncertainty is confined to the objective. The classical methodology for scalar problems called point-based minmax robustness (see, e.g., Ben-Tal and El Ghaoui, 2009; Bertsimas and Sim, 2004) can be adapted to multi-objective optimization (see Ide and Schöbel, 2013; Kuroiwa and Lee, 2012). This adaptation consists of replacing in (P) each objective function fi
                      by 
                        
                           sup
                           
                              f
                              i
                           
                           ,
                        
                      where the supremum is taken over all possible scenarios, and introducing m new variables 
                        
                           
                              z
                              i
                           
                           =
                           sup
                           
                              f
                              i
                           
                           
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                           ,
                        
                      
                     i = 1, …, m, so that (RP) is the deterministic multi-objective optimization problem with m linear objectives z
                     1, …, zm
                      and constraints zi

                     (x), i = 1, …, m, aggregated to the constraints of (P). The solutions to (RP) are then called point-based minmax robust solutions to (P). A second option, proposed in Ehrgott et al. (2014), is obtained by introducing a set-valued function F such that F(x) is the set of images of the feasible solution x by f for all possible scenario. Replacing the vector objective function f in (P) by the set-valued function F, one gets a set-valued robust counterpart whose solutions are the set-based minmax robust solutions to (P). For instance, a feasible solution 
                        
                           x
                           ¯
                        
                      is set-based minmax robust efficient (set-based minmax robust weakly efficient, respectively) if there is no feasible solution 
                        
                           x

                      respectively). The highly robust solutions to (P) have been recently defined in Ide and Schöbel (2013) as the solutions to (P) for any possible scenario while the flimsily robust solutions are the solutions of (P) for at least one scenario. Obviously, the concept of highly robust solution is quite exigent while the concept of flimsily robust solution is very permissive. Other concepts of robust solutions are compared with the previous ones in Ide and Schöbel (2013) and Kuhn et al. (2013) while Pando et al. (2013) provide conditions guaranteeing the maintaining of solutions through the elimination or aggregation of objectives.

When the uncertainty affects both the constraints and the objective functions, the concepts of robust solutions are the same as in the latter paragraph except that, in (RP) each uncertain constraint gj
                     (x) ≤ 0 is replaced by 
                        
                           sup
                           
                              g
                              j
                           
                           
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                           ≤
                           0
                        
                      (the supremum taken over all possible scenarios).
