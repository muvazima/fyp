                  The repetitive and excessive workload accompanying grip strength- or hand-intensive tasks are often considered to be common causes of work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders. For this reason, numerous experimental studies have been performed on maximum grip strength. However, due to an absence of standard guidelines, researchers have adopted different resting times and number of trials suited for their particular research purposes. The effects of resting time and the number of trials on the maximum total grip strength and individual finger forces of 24 participants over 20 trials were investigated. Results showed that the total grip strength and individual finger strengths differed significantly according to the resting time and the number of trials (p
                     <0.05). Overall, grip strength tended to increase with a reduction in resting time (% reduction: 7.8%, 9.1%, 11.1%, and 13.0% for 3min, 2min, 1min, and 30s resting time, respectively) as well as with an increase in the number of trials (% reduction: 8%, 10%, 13%, and 16% for 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th trials). The effects of resting time and the number of trials also showed statistically significant effects on individual finger forces. Regression equations of total grip strength and finger forces with resting time and number of trials were established. These equations were then applied to formulate guidelines for appropriate resting times in experiments based on the number of trials and acceptable reductions in grip strength. Data from this and future studies regarding decreasing grip strength and the contribution of each finger are expected to form the groundwork for ergonomic hand tool design and development.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which most often occur in industries such as production assembly and auto-repair, have recently drawn considerable attention. According to previous researches, many WMSDs have been reported in industry workers due to tasks that involve high risk activities such as the lifting and carrying of heavy objects, repetitive motions and exertions, insufficient resting time, awkward body postures, and vibrations (Putz-Anderson, 1988; Armstrong et al., 1990; Punnett et al., 1991; Bernard, 1997). Researchers have sought to lower the incidence rate of WMSDs, but it has remained stubbornly high. The incidence rate of WMSDs is greater in the upper limbs than in the lower limbs (Baker, 1995; Macleod, 1999). According to data from the Industrial Accident Examination (KOSHA, 2008), the incidence rate of upper limb WMSDs, relative to occurrences of all WMSDs, has gradually increased from 29.9% in 2005 to 37.6% in 2006 and 42.9% in 2007. Generally, WMSDs affect the upper limbs because workers repeatedly use tools or carry heavy items, often employing their upper limb joints such as the wrist, elbow, shoulder, and neck. Workers can succumb to WMSDs due to unsuitable work environments, for example where workers are required to contort their limbs in unnatural ways (Macleod, 1999). Grip force is used in general tasks and is also needed for repeated handling (Gurram et al., 1993; Dubrowski and Carnahan, 2004). Generally, over-exertion and repetitive grip forces are required in maintenance, fastening and repair activities in which hand tools are used. When using hand tools, WMSDs can be caused by excessive radial or ulnar deviation or bent wrists (Armstrong et al., 1990). It has been reported that the generation of excessive forces, improper posture, extreme temperatures, vibrations, and other variables can also lead to losses of grip force (Kattle et al., 1996). It has been suggested that WMSDs could be reduced if hand tools were ergonomically designed with a focus on the comfort and safety of the tool users (Lewis and Narayan, 1993).

The provision of adequate resting time and limitation of repetitions between rest periods are important factors in preventing WMSDs and improving operational efficiency and comfort. However, relatively few studies have investigated the effects of resting time and repetition of force exertions on the total grip strength and individual finger forces in a maximum grasping task. Mathiowetz (1990) and Shechtman et al. (2007) only showed that grip force is reduced as the gripping task is repeated. Caldwell et al. (1974), Trossman and Li (1989), Garg et al. (2005), and Chow and Dickerson (2009) analyzed the reduction of grip force with 1–3min of resting time, which is advised to minimize the consequences of fatigue.

There is a lack of research findings addressing the sufficiency of resting times relative to the number of trials in a grasping task. Some researchers have applied different resting times and number of grasping task trials for each set of experiments (Caldwell et al., 1974; Trossman and Li, 1989; Montazer and Thomas, 1992; Shechtman et al., 2007; Kwak et al., 2010). Table 1
                      indicates resting times and the number of trials researchers used for their grip strength measurement experiments, which of course have varying results due to the different lengths of resting time.

Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the effects of resting time and the number of trials on the total grip strength and individual finger force in a maximum grasping task and, based on the study, (2) provide suggestions on the proper amount of resting time associated with the number of gripping measurement tasks and trials.

@&#METHODS@&#

Twenty-four males (age: 24.7±1.3 yrs, weight: 70.2±8.6kg, height: 176.6±5.3mm) were recruited via advertisements within the University community. All participants were right handed and free of known upper-limb musculoskeletal injuries. At the beginning of the experiment, signed informed consent forms were obtained, and basic anthropometric data such as hand length and width were collected.

The Multi-Finger Force Measurement (MFFM) system, which was developed by Kim and Kong (2008) to measure individual finger forces and total grip strength, was used in this study. The system consists of four sub-miniature load cells (Honeywell Model 13, force ranges from 0 to 0.49N, 9.5mm in diameter, 2.75mm in thickness) placed where the fingers were bent. The grip span and grip length of the MFFM system were 55 and 80mm, respectively (Fig. 1
                        a). When measuring grip force, output signals were collected by an NI DAQmx-6259 system and presented on the screen by custom-made software written in the LabVIEW Program widely used for computer control and measurement, as shown in Fig. 1b.

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

Participants were provided with a brief description of the purpose and procedures of the experiment. Posture during the measurement experiment was adopted from the ASHT (American Society of Hand Therapists, 1981). All participants were asked to sit upright in a chair with the elbows bent such that the forearms were at 90° to the upper arm and the forearms and wrists were in a neutral position. They were also asked to look straight ahead and keep their backs straight. To record the changes in maximum grip force and finger force associated with resting time and trial number, 20 maximum grip force trials were conducted in 4 groups with different resting times (30s, 1–3min). Based on standard measuring methods provided by Caldwell et al. (1974), grip force was measured with the dominant hand and participants were asked to generate their maximum grip force for 4s. All participants tested their maximum exertion for all 4 different resting time groups with a three day gap between each resting time condition to minimize fatigue. Measurements for each resting condition were performed in random order. Two researchers led the experiments: one fixed the posture of participants and the other measured time and recorded data. In order for participants to generate their maximum grip force, verbal instructions were given, such as “strong” and “stronger” (Mathiowetz, 1984).

Grip strength reduction was investigated based on the reduction of force capability from the initial grip strength which is the grip strength of the first trial for each participant. The following equation (1) is applied to calculate the reduction rate of grip strength based on the initial grip strength.

                        , ith trial grip strength; Initial Grip Strength, 1st trial grip strength.

The regression equations for the total grip strength and individual finger force were also developed in order to estimate proper resting time based on the % reduction of total grip strength and % reduction of individual finger forces associated with the number of trials.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

In order to analyze the effects of the number of trials and the resting time duration on grip force, both the total grip force and the individual force of each finger were measured. As can be seen in Table 1, most of the researchers in previous grip force studies applied resting times of less than 3min and fewer than 20 trials. Thus, a consistent number of trials (20 levels of trials: 1–20) and set of resting times (4 levels of resting times: 30s, 1–3min) were used as the independent experimental variables in this study. Dependent variables, namely % reductions of total grip strength and individual finger forces (index, middle, ring, and little finger) from the initial maximum total grip and finger forces, were analyzed for each measurement. SPSS Ver 18.0 was used to statistically prove the effects of variables on the grip and finger forces. Total grip strength was calculated by summing over all four individual finger forces. Tukey's HSD was used for the ANOVA multiple comparison method. The statistical significance level was α
                        =0.05 for all verifications.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Statistical analysis showed that the effects of resting time on the % reduction of total grip strength were statistically significant (p
                        <0.001). The average % reduction of total grip strength increased with decreasing resting time, with the lowest reduction in total grip strength at 3min resting time (7.8% – i.e., 92.2% of initial total grip strength), followed by those at 2 and 1min and 30s resting time (9.1%, 11.1%, and 13.0%, respectively). Fig. 2
                         shows the % reductions of total grip strength associated by resting time.

The % reduction, defined by eq. (1) as the total grip strength of a particular trial and resting time over the maximum grip strength, is also depicted in Fig. 3
                         as a function of trial number. The average total grip strength across participants was the largest at the first trial and decreased as the number of trials increased. It is noted that reductions in grip strength of about 8% (92.0% of initial total grip strength), 10% (90.0% of initial total grip strength), 13% (87.0% of initial total grip strength) and 16% (84.0% of initial total grip strength), relative to the initial total grip strength, were reported at the 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th trials, respectively. That is, the total grip strength was found to decrease with increasing trial number, but the slope of total grip strength reduction varied by resting time group.

Results showed that the slope of % reduction of total grip strength increased as resting time length decreased from 3min to 30s. In the 5th trial, reductions of 6–8% were obtained at resting times of 1–3min, whereas a 12% reduction was obtained at a resting time of 30s. In the 10th trial, reductions of 7–8% were obtained at resting times of 2min and 3min, while reductions of 11–13% were obtained resting times of 1min and 30s. In the 15th trial, a reduction of 9% was obtained at a resting time of 3min, whereas reductions of 12% at 2min resting time, 14% at 1min resting time, and 17% at 30s resting time were measured in this study.

Using the experimental data from Fig. 3, the total grip strength reductions associated with resting time were estimated based on the following regression curves. General linear test and sum of squares for error were applied to obtain appropriate regression models in this study. Results showed that Ln regression was a better model fit than linear and quadric regression models. Thus, Ln transformation models were applied as follows:

% Reductions of individual finger forces (index, middle, ring and little) relative to the initial maximum finger forces were also measured and analyzed in this study. The effects of resting time and trial number on the % reduction of individual finger forces were statistically significant (p
                        <0.001).

Although there were slight differences in the % reduction of individual finger forces, all fingers (index, middle, ring, and little) generally showed similar trends to one another (i.e., the finger forces decreased as the number of trials increased). As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 4
                        , as the resting time decreased and the number of trials increased, the % reduction of individual finger forces increased.

In general, the average % reductions (9.8–13.7%, 12.9–14.4%; 14.0–15.4%, and 11.8–16.1% for index, middle, ring and little fingers, respectively) at 30s and 1min resting time were higher than those (8.3–8.6%, 8.6–9.5%; 11.1–13.3%, and 10.0–12.4% for index, middle, ring and little fingers, respectively) at 2min and 3min resting time for all four fingers (see Fig. 2).

The individual finger forces for particular trials and resting times are also depicted in Fig. 4 as a function of trial numbers. The average finger forces for all participants were the largest at the first trial and decreased as the number of trials increased. Following Table 2
                         represents the average % reductions of individual finger forces associated with the number of trials.

The experimental findings indicate that finger forces decreased with increasing trial number; however, the slopes of % reductions differed by finger and resting time group. Based on the experimental data, reductions in individual finger forces were converted into regression curves, with the following functional forms for all four fingers and resting times:

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The changes in individual finger force (index, middle, ring, and little) and total grip strength associated with different resting times (30s, 1–3min) and the number of trials (20 trials) were analyzed in this research. Results showed that resting time and number of trials both showed a statistically significant effect on the total grip strength and individual finger forces.

In the analysis of % reduction of total grip strength by resting time, the smallest % reduction (7.8%) was obtained at the longest resting time (3min), followed by reductions of 9.1% and 11.1% at 2min and 1min resting times, respectively. The largest % reduction (13.0%) of total grip strength was obtained at the shortest resting time (30s) for each of the 20 trials in this study. A similar trend of grip strength reduction was observed in the Trossman and Li (1989) study, which tested grip strengths over 5 trials with resting times of 15s, 30s, and 60s in order to mitigate grip force reduction. They reported that the grip strength in the 60s resting time group showed the lowest reduction in force (5.41%) followed by those in the 15s and 30s resting time groups (9.71% and 12.67%, respectively). The % reductions in the current study differ from those reported by Trossman and Li (1989) possibly because the experimental tasks differ (i.e., 30s, 1–3min resting times vs. 15s, 30s, 60s resting times). Caldwell et al. (1974) suggested a 2min resting time for measuring total grip strength, although the guideline cannot be deemed a standard due to differences in experimental environments and the number of cases. For this reason, many researchers have used various resting times for their own studies, as summarized in Table 1. Thus, a certain guideline that considers the nature of the experimental tasks and conditions may need to be developed.

The effects of resting time on individual finger force were also investigated in this study. Generally, the reduction in individual finger force showed a similar trend to that of total grip strength, i.e., % reductions of the individual finger forces increased as resting time decreased. After a total of 20 trials, the average % reductions of finger force between the 3min and 30s resting time groups were 10.1%, 11.3%, 13.5%, and 12.6% for the index, middle, ring, and little fingers, respectively. In detail, however, the slopes of the reduction for resting times in total grip strength and individual finger force were different. The slopes of total grip strength (eqs. (2)–(5)) were gradually decreased as the resting time was increased from 30s to 2min, whereas the middle, ring and little fingers had larger slopes for 1min (eq. (11)), 1min (eq. (15)), and 2min resting times (eq. (20)), respectively. The discrepancies in slopes of the total grip strength and individual finger force for resting times might be explained by finger ‘force deficit effects’ or ‘force sharing effects’ during multi-finger force-production tasks. Further investigation is needed to explore the different decline rates of the total grip strength and the individual finger forces.

The change in grip strength by trial number was also evaluated and results showed that total grip strength and individual finger forces decreased with increasing trial number. The reductions in total grip strength exceeded 8%, 10%, 13%, and 16% in the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th trials, respectively. These findings were similar to those of previous researches (Reddon et al., 1985, Montazer and Thomas, 1991, 1992, Kundson and Noffal, 2005; Kwak et al., 2011), which suggest that grip strength decreases due to muscle fatigue as trial number increases.

For the analysis of the individual finger force reductions by trial number for all resting times, the rate at which each individual finger's force is reduced also tends to increase with increasing trial number. The average individual finger force reductions exceeded 9–11.4%, 10–12.5%, 11.6–17.4%, and 13.8–21.5% in the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th trials for the index, middle, ring, and little fingers, respectively, for all four resting groups (Table 2). It is noted that the reduction rate was lowest in the index finger, followed by the middle, ring, and little fingers. The fatigues of muscle groups may largely relate with physiological cross-sectional areas (PCSA) of muscles. That is, muscle groups which have small PCSAs may tend to more tired than other muscle groups which have large PCSAs. According to Chao et al. (2007), the PCSAs of the flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and extensor digitorum communis muscles are 3.6±2.1, 4.1±2.4, and 1.1±0.3cm2 for the index finger; 4.2±1.2, 4.1±1.4, and 1.7±0.8cm2 for the middle finger; 2.4±1.2, 3.7±1.1, and 1.2±0.4cm2 for the ring finger; and 2.1±1.4, 2.5±0.9, and 0.5±0.4cm2 for the little finger. Thus, the reasons for the ring and little fingers are more likely to tire faster than the index and middle fingers might be possibly explained by PCSAs of the ring and little fingers are smaller than those of the index and middle fingers.

When repeated maximum grip strength is measured, an adequate amount of resting time should be provided with consideration given to the number of trials and the reduction in total grip strength. Guidelines for resting times, as shown in Table 3
                     , were suggested based on the logarithm regression equations (eqs. (2)–(5)) that were the results of this study. Experimenters can use this table based on their acceptable % reduction in grip strength as well as the number of trials in the maximum gripping tasks. For example, when there are to be 15 repetitions in an experiment, if the experimenter thinks that a 5% reduction in grip strength might be acceptable (i.e., maintaining 95% of participants' maximum grip strength), then a 3min resting time would be recommended. If the experimenter set 10% as an acceptable reduction in grip strength, either a 1 or 2min (at least 1min) resting time could be appropriate. However, a 30s resting time would not be recommended because the reduction in grip strength is 15% in Table 3, which is over the 10% reduction in grip strength specified as being acceptable.

The guidelines for the resting time in Table 3 were established by the grip strength reduction regression curves based on resting time and trial number. The reductions in grip strength from these equations showed results similar to previous findings. Trossman and Li (1989) reported 12.7% and 5.4% reductions in grip strength after 5 trials with 30s and 1min resting times, respectively. Based on equations of (2) and (3) in this current study, reductions in grip strength would be 10.4% and 8.5% for 30s and 1min resting times, respectively. For a 1min resting time, Kundson and Noffal (2005) found 2.1%, 4.2%, and 6.8% reductions in grip strength after 2, 5, and 10 trials, respectively. If the same testing conditions were applied to equation (3), the reductions in grip strength would be 3.9%, 8.5%, and 12.1% after 2, 5, and 10 trials, respectively. In a 2min resting time study, Kwak et al. (2011) showed reductions in grip strength of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 19% after 8, 12, 17, and 20 trials, respectively, whereas reductions calculated from equation (4) are 8.9%, 10.9%, 12.6%, and 13.4%, respectively.

This research was somewhat limited in that it did not use a 15s–5min resting time range, as is often used in related research. Additionally, only male participants took part in this study. To address these limitations, a wider range of resting times and trials with participants of different genders, ages, and occupational groups should be considered for further study in order to arrive at a generalized guideline for both domestic and international use. Although this research has limitations, its guidelines are expected to provide useful information for future experimenters who wish to determine appropriate resting times according to experimental conditions including the number of trials and acceptable reduction in grip strength.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The effects of resting time (30s and 1–3min) and the number of trials (1–20) on the reductions in total grip strength and individual finger force were explored in this study, using the MFFM system developed by this research group. In addition, regression curves were developed based on these grip strength data as a function of the number of trials for each resting time. These regression curves were used to establish guidelines for resting times (Table 3) according to the number of trials and acceptable reductions in grip strength.

When resting time was decreased, % reductions of the total grip strength and individual finger force tended to increase. The average % reduction of these forces was smallest for the 3min resting time, followed by the % reductions seen after resting times of 2min, 1min, and 30s.

The reduction in grip strength according to trial number also showed that as the number of trials increased, % reductions of both the total grip strength and individual finger forces increased.

Regarding individual finger force, the reduction rate of the index finger was lowest, followed by the middle, ring, and little fingers. The ring and little fingers are also more likely to tire than the index and middle fingers when the resting time is shortened.
