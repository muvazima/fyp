                  We study a two-person zero-sum game where the payoff matrix entries are random and the constraints are satisfied jointly with a given probability. We prove that for the general random-payoff zero-sum game there exists a “weak duality” between the two formulations, i.e., the optimal value of the minimizing player is an upper bound of the one of the maximizing player. Under certain assumptions, we show that there also exists a “strong duality” where their optimal values are equal. Moreover, we develop two approximation methods to solve the game problem when the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the performances of the proposed approaches.

In this paper, we consider the classic two-person zero-sum game, i.e., there are only two players where one player wins what the other player loses. Without loss of generality, we refer to the players as Player I and Player II. Let

                                 )

                      be the payoff matrix of a two-person zero-sum game. If Player I plays pure strategy i and Player II uses pure strategy j, then the payoff from Player II to Player I is aij
                     . In the game, Player I seeks a mixed strategy to maximize his minimum payoff while Player II seeks a mixed strategy to minimize his maximum loss. In this case, the two-person zero-sum game can be mathematically formulated as two linear programming (LP) problems:

For Player I,

With a deterministic payoff matrix A, the famous von Neumann minimax theorem von Neumann (1928) states that the two optimal values of the two LP problems are equal, i.e., 
                        
                           
                              d
                              *
                           
                           =
                           
                              t
                              *
                           
                        
                     . However, in practice, due to modeling or prediction errors, different kinds of uncertainties occur. Therefore, the payoff matrix is unknown in advance. In this case, it is natural to model the payoff matrix by continuously or discretely distributed random variables, which turns the underlying problem into a stochastic optimization problem. If the random payoff matrix is replaced by its expectation, then the variability of the payoffs is not captured. In this paper, we consider chance-constrained criteria for determining optimal strategies Charnes, Kirby, and Raike (1968). Each player optimizes his strategy and return such that the probability of attaining that return is at least some given value. In this context, the random-payoff two-person zero-sum game can be formulated as the following stochastic programming problems:

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature related to chance-constrained games. In Sections 3 and 4, we investigate the relationship between the best payoff of the two players, and derive both weak and strong duality results. In Section 5, we consider the special case where the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed. Two approximation methods to solve the problem are given, namely a conservative approximation and the other is a relaxed approximation. A numerical study is given in Section 6. Finally, the last section contains the conclusions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Game theory, as a mathematical study on conflict and cooperation situations, has been widely studied in several fields, namely economics, networks, political science and psychology and recently computer science. Since von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) developed game theory, this topic has attracted the attention of economists, mathematicians and operations researchers. We refer the reader to some famous game theory textbooks Dixit, Skeath, and Reiley (2014); Gibbons (1992).


                     Nash (1950) proved that there exists at least one Nash equilibrium where no player can improve his expected payoff by changing his strategy. Peski (2008) presented simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the comparison of information structures in zero-sum games. In game theory, two-person zero-sum game is one of the fundamental problems with two players where one player wins what the other one loses. When the payoff matrix is deterministic, von Neumann (1928) proved that the best payoff of one player is equal to the best one of the other player. However, in practice, due to modeling or prediction errors, the payoff matrix is not known in advance. Stochasticity in game theory can be handled by at least two different approaches: stochastic optimization Blau (1974); Cassidy, Field, and Kirby (1972); Charnes et al. (1968) which considers payoffs as random variables, and fuzzy sets approach Aubin (1981); Butnariu (1978); Xu, Zhao, and Ning (2006).


                     Flesch, Schoenmakers, and Vrieze (2009) studied the product-game where there are 
                        
                           n
                           −
                        
                      player stochastic games played on a product state space. They establish the existence of 
                        
                           0
                           −
                        
                      equilibria. In the case of two-players zero-sum games of this type, they show that both players have stationary 
                        
                           0
                           −
                        
                     optimal strategies. Product-games with an aperiodic transition structure were also considered in Flesch, Schoenmakers, and Vrieze (2008). Monroy, Hinojosa, Marmol, and Fernandez (2013) considered stochastic cooperative games where the coalition values are fuzzy. Stochastic linear programming games were studied by Ulhan (2015) where the uncertainty of the payoffs is determined by a specially structured linear program. When each player preferences over random payoffs are represented by a concave functional, the author proves that these games have a nonempty core. A computable algorithm to calculate uniform 
                        
                           ϵ
                           −
                        
                     optimal strategies in two-players zero-sum stochastic games was proposed in Solan and Vieille (2010). This approach can be used to construct 
                        
                           ϵ
                           −
                        
                     equilibria algorithms in various classes of multi-player non-zero-sum stochastic games.

Duality in linear programming can be formulated as a game theory problem. In Bot, Lorenz, and Wanka (2010), the authors give the deterministic equivalent formulation of a linear chance-constrained optimization problem and its conjugate dual problem. They provide weak sufficient conditions which ensure strong duality for this primal-dual pair. Komaromi (1992) proposes two chance constrained linear programming problems pairs. He provides conditions under which the dually related problems have no duality gap.

In this paper, we investigate two-person zero-sum game problem with a random payoff matrix. There are different ways to deal with the uncertainty. For instance, if we replace the random payoff matrix by its expectation, stochastic variability and risk measure will not be considered, see Song (1992) for more details. Charnes et al. (1968) first introduced the chance constrained programming method to address random payoffs in the two-person zero-sum game problem. Later on, Song (1992) extended the major results of Charnes et al. (1968) for joint chance constraints. The main idea of his conservative method is to introduce the quantile of each element of the matrix such that the chance constraints are satisfied. In this paper, we study the relationship between the best payoff of the two players under joint chance constraints. Precisely, we prove that there exists a “weak duality” between the two formulations, i.e., the optimal value of player I is an upper bound of the one of player II. Moreover, we show that there exists a “strong duality” under certain assumptions. Additionally, when the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed, two approximation methods of the game problem are given, namely a conservative approximation and a relaxed approximation. We call an approximation hereafter conservative when its feasible set is a subset of the feasible set of the original problem whilst it is relaxed when the feasible set of the original problem is subset of the relaxed one. Finally, numerical tests on random generated instances are given to illustrate the quality of our approaches.

For the deterministic payoff, the two LP problems are a pair of primal and dual problems and their optimal values are the same. However, it is not the case any more for stochastic games. In this section, we investigate the relationship between the stochastic primal and dual problems.

In the case where A is a continuous random matrix, we have the following “strong duality” results.

                        Theorem 4.0.3
                        
                           Suppose that A is a continuously distributed and satisfies the following two conditions:
                           
                              
                                 1.
                                 
                                    for any two scenarios of A denoted by Ai and Aj, we have Ai
                                     ≥ Aj or Ai
                                     ≤ Aj.
                                 


                                    its cumulative distribution function is continuous and strictly increasing in all its components.

For the sake of simplicity, we introduce the following notation ≨ defined as follows: A≨B means that A ≤ B and also there exists at least an element of A less than the corresponding element of B. Before the proof, we introduce the cumulative distribution function of A as follows:

As Problems (9) and (10) are generally nonconvex except the case where α and β are sufficiently large Henrion and Strugarek (2008), we propose two approximations to come up with upper and lower bounds.

We apply the tangent approximation method Cheng and Lisser (2012) to approximate Problem (9). The main idea is to approximate

In this section, we illustrate and evaluate numerically the performance of our proposed methods. All the considered problems are solved using Sedumi 1.3 Sturm (1999) and CPLEX IBM ILOG with their default parameters on two different configurations: an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4600U @ 2.10 gigahertz 2.70 gigahertz with 16.0 gigabyte RAM for the normally distributed payoff-matrix, and an Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.26 gigahertz with 4.0 gigabyte RAM for the discretely distributed pay-off matrix. Furthermore, a direct solving method based on Mathematica is introduced in order to compare with the proposed methods.

We solve the chance constrained game with an independent and normally distributed payoff-matrix. Three different sizes of the constraints are considered with the following parameters:

                         denotes the optimal value of Mathematica. We generate 5 instances for each problem size.


                        Tables 1–3 show that the “weak duality” holds for all tested instances. Further, we observe in Table 1 that for the conservative approximation, the larger average gap is 0.81 percent for the first approximation while it is 0.89 percent for the piecewise tangent approximation with three tangent points, and only 0.60 percent with ten tangent points. We can see that Mathematica based method is better than the proposed approaches in terms of solution quality but requires more CPU time.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we study and solve a stochastic two-person zero-sum game problem where the payoff matrix entries are random and the constraints are satisfied jointly with a given probability. We prove that there exists a “weak duality” between the two formulations, i.e., the optimal value of the minimizing player is an upper bound of the one of the maximizing player for the general stochastic zero-sum game problem. Under certain assumptions, we show that a “strong duality” holds, i.e., the best payoffs of the two players are equal. Moreover, when the payoff matrix entries are independent and normally distributed, a relaxed and a conservative approximations are given to solve the game problem. Finally, numerical tests on random instances are performed and showed the efficiency of our approaches.
