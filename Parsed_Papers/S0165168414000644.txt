                  In this paper, we design and analyze a Newton-like blind equalization algorithm for the APSK system. Specifically, we exploit the principle of minimum entropy deconvolution and derive a blind equalization cost function for APSK signals and optimize it using Newton׳s method. We study and evaluate the steady-state excess mean square error performance of the proposed algorithm using the concept of energy conservation. Numerical results depict a significant performance enhancement for the proposed scheme over well established blind equalization algorithms. Further, the analytical excess mean square error of the proposed algorithm is verified with computer simulations and is found to be in good conformation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In digital communications at high enough data rates, almost all physical channels exhibit inter-symbol interference (ISI). One of the solutions to this problem is blind equalization, which is a method to equalize distortive communication channels and mitigate ISI without supervision. Blind equalization algorithms do not require training at either the startup period or restart after system breakdown. This independence of blind schemes with respect to training sequence results in improved system bandwidth efficiency.

In blind equalization, the desired signal is unknown to the receiver, except for its probabilistic or statistical properties over some known alphabets. As both the channel and its input are unknown, the objective of blind equalization is to recover the unknown input sequence based solely on its probabilistic and statistical properties [1–3]. From the available literature, it can be found that any admissible blind objective (or cost) function has two main attributes: (1) it makes use of the statistics which are significantly modified as the signal propagates through the channel [4] and (2) optimization of the cost function modifies the statistics of the signal at the equalizer output, aligning them with the statistics of the signal at the channel input [5].

One of the earliest methods of blind equalization was suggested by Benveniste et al. [5]. Their proposed method assumed the transmitted signal to be non-Gaussian, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of a known statistical distribution. It sought to match the distribution of its output (deconvolved sequence) with the distribution of the transmitted signal and the adaptation continued until the said objective was achieved. Another approach to this problem was devised by Donoho [4], who defined a partial ordering, measuring the relative Gaussianity between random variables. He suggested to adjust the equalizer until the distribution of the deconvolved sequence is as non-Gaussian as possible. A somewhat informal version of Donoho׳s method appeared in the work of Wiggins [6,7]. According to Wiggins, assuming the transmitted signal is a non-Gaussian signal with certain distribution p
                     
                        a
                     , the equalizer must be adjusted to make its output signal distribution resemble p
                     
                        a
                     . He termed this approach as a minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) criterion.

In this work, the MED criterion is the subject of our concern for designing (and optimizing) cost functions to equalize signals blindly in amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) systems. The APSK signals are very important in modern day communication systems due to their robustness against nonlinear channel distortion and advantageous lower peak-to-average power ratio compared to the conventional quadrature amplitude modulation signals (refer to APSK based systems in [8–14] and references therein).

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the baseband communication system model, notion of Gaussianity, and traditional blind equalizers. Section 3 describes the MED criteria for channel equalization, discusses the admissibility of costs tailored for APSK, and stochastic gradient-based optimization. Section 4 formulates the proposed adaptive MED-based blind equalization scheme for APSK systems exploiting Newton-like update. Section 5 provides a steady-state tracking performance of the proposed algorithm in time varying scenario. Simulation results are discussed in Section 6 and conclusions are provided in Section 7.

The baseband model for a typical complex-valued data communication system, as shown in Fig. 1

                        w
                     , a certain cost function J depending on y

                     The cost J is a function of implicitly embedded statistics of y
                     
                        n
                      and 
                        J
                        (
                        ·
                        )
                      is a real-valued function. Ideally, the cost J makes use of statistics which are significantly modified as the signal propagates through the channel, and the optimization of cost modifies the statistics of the signal at the equalizer output, aligning them with those at a channel input. The equalization is accomplished when equalized sequence y
                     
                        n
                      acquires an identical distribution as that of the channel input a
                     
                        n
                     . More formally, we have the following theorem [5]: 
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           If the transmitted signal is composed of non-Gaussian i.i.d. samples, both the channel and the equalizer are linear time-invariant filters, noise is negligible, and the probability density functions (PDF) of transmitted and equalized signals are equal, then the channel has been perfectly equalized.

This mathematical result is very important since it establishes the possibility of obtaining an equalizer with the sole aid of signal׳s statistical properties and without requiring any knowledge of the channel impulse response or training data sequence. Meanwhile, Donoho [4] noted that, as a consequence of the central limit theorem, linear combinations of identically distributed random variables become more Gaussian than the individual variables. Therefore, the received signal x
                     
                        n
                      will have a distribution that is more nearly Gaussian than the distribution of a
                     
                        n
                     . Any suitable objective function capable of measuring Gaussianity or non-Gaussianity can therefore be used for deconvolution.

One of the measures of Gaussianity is (normalized) kurtosis, κ, which is a statistic based on second and fourth-order moments. For a circularly-symmetric complex-valued random variable X, kurtosis is defined as [15]:

Expectedly most of the existing blind equalizers use second and fourth-order statistics of the equalized sequence. The first ever method which relies on the aforesaid statistics is the constant modulus criterion [16]; it is given by

Under the similar assumptions, as laid in Theorem 1, they discussed the possibility to perform blind equalization by satisfying the condition

                     In the next section, we discuss equalization/deconvolution techniques which evolved around the notion of entropy as a measure of Gaussianity.

In statistics, the most powerful test of the null hypothesis against another is one which maximizes discrimination and minimizes the probability of accepting the null hypothesis as true when actually the alternative is true. In information theory, a statistic that maximizes detectability of a signal while minimizing the probability of a false alarm is most powerful. In seismic community, however, a statistical (rank-discriminating) test against Gaussianity, which can be used to design a deconvolution filter, is loosely termed as a MED criterion [4,6].

Hogg [19] developed a scale-invariant and the most powerful rank-discriminating test for one member of the generalized Gaussian against another by considering the following PDF:

                     This scheme seeks the smallest number of large spikes (or impulses) consistent with the data, thus maximizing the order, or equivalently, minimizing the entropy or disorder in the data [23]. Wiggins coined the term MED criterion for the test (10).

                        The simple structure of the impulsive function led Wiggins to call his technique MED. According to [24], however, the approach which Wiggins actually adopts is not entropy; it is rather a variant of varimax rotation which is widely used in obtaining a simple factor structure in factor analysis.
                      Immediately after Wiggins, Ooe and Ulrych [24] realized that better deconvolution results may be obtained for super-Gaussian signals if non-Gaussianity is maximized with some α less than two; they used

                     Note that costs (10)–(12) are members of (8) for different values of shape parameters. In the context of digital communication, where the underlying distribution of the transmitted (possibly pulse amplitude modulated) data symbols is closer to a uniform density (sub-Gaussian), we can obtain a blind equalizer by optimizing Gray׳s cost (12) as follows [26,27]:

                     Maximizing (14) can be interpreted as determining the equalizer coefficients, 
                        w
                     , which drives the distribution of its output, y
                     
                        n
                     , away from Gaussian distribution toward uniform, thus removing successfully the interference from the received signal. Note that the cost (14) is an optimal, scale-invariant test for the APSK signal against Gaussianity (refer to Appendix A for details).

                         yields consistent estimates of the exact channel equalizer when the transmitted signal is i.i.d. or in other words the steady-state overall impulse response (

                        ) is a delta function with arbitrary delay. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the channel, the equalizer and the transmitted signal are real-valued. Note that

                     . So, assuming a converging equalizer, the Hessian is found to be negative definite. It means that such an equalizer will try to maximize the cost instead of minimizing it. This is contrary to the problem definition and we conclude that a straight Newton-like βCMA equalizer, implementing Hessian as specified in

One possible way to resolve this matter is to ensure that the recursively computed Hessian remains positive definite. Consider the following solution:

In this section, we study the steady-state tracking performance of NL-βCMA in a non-stationary environment. Although the steady-state performance essentially corresponds to only one point on the learning curve of the adaptive filter, there are many situations where this information is of value by itself. The addressed approach is based on studying the energy flow through each iteration of an adaptive filter [34,35], and it relies on a fundamental error variance relation that avoids the weight-error variance recursion altogether. We may remark that although we focus on the steady-state performance of NL-βCMA, the same approach can also be used to study the transient (i.e., convergence and stability) behavior of this filter. These details will be provided elsewhere.

In [28], the βCMA has already been compared and shown to be better than four existing algorithms which include traditional CMA [16] and three of its variants: the (unnormalized) relaxed CMA (RCMA) [40], the Shtrom–Fan algorithm (SFA) [41] and the generalized CMA (GCMA) [42]. In this work, we provide performance comparison of NL-βCMA (as summarized in Table 1) with Newton-like CMA (NL-CMA) [32] and recursive least square CMA (RLS-CMA) [43]. The performances of CMA and βCMA are shown as standard benchmark. Moreover, we consider an unorthodox benchmark [44] which is an adaptive method for blind equalization and relies on explicit estimation of PDF using Parzen window and is termed as a stochastic gradient algorithm (SQD). For reference CMA, βCMA, SQD, RLS-CMA and NL-CMA are summarized in Table 2
                     .

Here we would like to highlight the following important implementation details: first, for the SQD scheme the required compensation factor 
                        F
                        (
                        σ
                        )
                      is computed numerically (see [44] for details). The compensation factor 
                        F
                        (
                        σ
                        )
                      is a function of the constellation scheme and hence we find the values of 
                        F
                        (
                        σ
                        )
                      for 16APSK(8,8) using the bisection method (see Fig. 4
                     ). The authors of [44] highlight that the use of a smaller σ (e.g., 1) results in an increased number of local minima of the cost function. It is for this reason that we use a higher value of σ (i.e., 
                        σ
                        =
                        15
                     ) in all simulations (the corresponding 
                        F
                        (
                        σ
                        )
                      is 1.325 as shown in Fig. 4). Secondly, to ensure the stability of NL-CMA, we slightly modify it. According to Miranda et al. [45] one must check the reliability of the error quantity in Hessian. If the statistic of error quantity in Hessian is not reliable, one must adhere to simple autocorrelation matrix. Incorporating this recommendation and owing to sub-Gaussian nature of the transmitted signal, the stability of NL-CMA requires to use

                      i.e., center tap initialization is used. The data is modulated using 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8) shown in Fig. 5
                     (b) and (c). For all experiments, the value of β is obtained using (B.7) (this value is 1.9319 for 8APSK(4,4) and 3 for 16APSK(8,8)). ISI (as defined in (2)) is used as index to evaluate the performance of different equalization schemes. Experiments comparing the proposed scheme to existing equalization methods are discussed in 6.1 and 6.2. Furthermore, additional experiments are carried to compare the theoretical and practical EMSE of the proposed schemes for both 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8). The details of these experiments are discussed in 6.3.

In this experiment the performance of the proposed scheme is tested for a channel with low eigenvalue spread. The signal is modulated using 16APSK(8,8) and a complex-valued channel with coefficients

                        . It can be observed from Fig. 6 that NL-βCMA shows the fastest convergence rate followed by βCMA.

In this experiment, a channel with higher eigenvalue spread is considered. Generally, an increase in the eigenvalue spread of the channel results in poor performance of equalization schemes. For this experiment, the 16APSK(8,8) modulated signal is passed through a channel with impulse response

                         (the eigenvalue spread of this channel is calculated to be 65.28). Again, SNR is set to 30dB and a stationary environment is assumed. The step sizes and forgetting factors of all schemes are adjusted for comparable performances and are summarized in Fig. 7
                        . The learning curves are obtained for 40,000 iterations and are ensemble averaged over 200 independent runs. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that the performance of SQD, CMA and βCMA degrades significantly in comparison with the first experiment. However, it should be noted that NL-CMA, RLS-CMA and NL-βCMA converge relatively faster. Further, among the three fast converging schemes, NL-βCMA shows the fastest convergence rate.

In this experiment, analytical and empirical performance of the proposed scheme is compared in a non-stationary environment. In steady state, we assume that the proposed scheme converges in the mean to a zero forcing solution, i.e., the mean of combined channel-equalizer response converges to a delta function with arbitrary delay and phase rotation. We consider a non-stationary channel with

                         in (29). The equalizer length is set to N=11 and the steady state EMSE is evaluated for 20,000 symbols in a noise-free environment. The forgetting factor is set to 0.98 and step size is varied to obtain the desired curves for both 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8). A close match between the analytic and measured EMSE for both constellation types is observed as depicted in Fig. 8

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Exploiting the notion of minimum entropy deconvolution, a cost function was specifically derived for the blind channel equalization of amplitude phase shift keying signal in digital communication systems. The cost was optimized adaptively using Newton׳s method and it yielded a Newton-like constant modulus algorithm NL-βCMA. Tracking analysis of the proposed algorithm was performed based on Sayed-Rupp׳s feedback approach. Simulation results demonstrated significant improvement in performance compared with conventional algorithms. Further, observations of excess mean square error demonstrated good agreement between theoretical and practical findings.

                     1) that the signal suffers from multi-path interference as well as with additive Gaussian noise (refer to Fig. A1(b)).

Thus, the in-phase and quadrature components of the received signal are modeled as normal-distributed; owing to central limit theorem, it is theoretically justified. It means that the modulus of the received signal follows the Rayleigh distribution,
