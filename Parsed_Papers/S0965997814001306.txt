                  This paper addresses the economic lot scheduling problem where multiple items produced on a single facility in a cyclical pattern have shelf life restrictions. A mixed integer non-linear programming model is developed which allows each product to be produced more than once per cycle and backordered. However, production of each item more than one time may result in an infeasible schedule due to the overlapping production times of various items. To eliminate the production time conflicts and to achieve a feasible schedule, the production start time of some or all the items must be adjusted by either advancing or delaying. The objective is to find the optimal production rate, production frequency, cycle time, as well as a feasible manufacturing schedule for the family of items, in addition to minimizing the long-run average cost. Metaheuristic methods such as the genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms are adopted for the optimization procedures. Each of such methods is applied to a set of problem instances taken from literature and the performances are compared against other existing models in the literature. The computational performance and statistical optimization results shows the superiority of the proposed metaheuristic methods with respect to lower total costs compared with other reported procedures in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Economic lot scheduling problem (ELSP) is concerned with scheduling the production of multiple items in a single facility on a periodical basis with the restriction that one item is produced at a time. Narro Lopez and Kingsman [1] provided an excellent review of this problem and the solution approaches. Throughout the past half century, a considerable amount of research on this problem has been published with several directions of extensions. Subsequently, various heuristic approaches have been suggested using any of the basic period approach [2], common cycle approach [3], or time-varying lot size approach [4]. This study deals with common cycle approach, where the objective is to determine the optimal cycle time.

In industry, products are stocked and used up during the production cycle. If they are stored more than a specified period of time, some products may get spoiled. This time restriction of life for a product is called shelf life. Shelf life constraints directly influence the wastage, out-of-stock rates, and inventory levels [5]. Generally, the inventory systems assume implicitly unlimited shelf lives for the stored items. However, storing products beyond a specific shelf life may bring about the deterioration or diminution of the products. It might also lead to loss of the profitable or fruitful life of a product in an emerging market of new competitive products [6]. Therefore, when the optimal cycle time goes beyond the time restriction of life for an item, the cycle time period must be decreased to less than or equal to the shelf life to ensure a feasible schedule. This storage time can be lowered by regular restocking of the items, and subsequently decreasing the inventory maintained in the stock [7].

Silver [8] studied the ELSP with shelf life constraint while disallowing the production cost under the postulation that the production rate variation does not impose any further cost. Two options of decreasing the cycle time and the production rate were investigated, and it was concluded that it is more cost-efficient to reduce the production rate. Sarker and Babu [7] exploited the Silver’s models [8,9] by considering production time cost, and a limited shelf life for each item. They found that when the production cost is included into the model, it might be more efficient to reduce the cycle time rather than the manufacturing rate.

Goyal [10] investigated the results obtained by Sarker and Babu [7], and suggested that their proposed model can be improved by allowing the production of items more than one time in a cycle. Viswanathan [11] implied that Sarker and Babu’s model [7] offers a feasible schedule only when all the items produced have the same frequency. Viswanathan [11] also stated that although Goyal’s suggestion [10] can incur a lower inventory cost, his method does not assure a feasible production schedule. Yan et al. [12] tackled the problem of schedule infeasibility, and made the production of each item more than once in every cycle permissible. Yan et al. [12] indicated that advancing or delaying the manufacturing start times of some items can lead to a feasible production plan. Accordingly, costs associated to the adjustment schedule must be taken into account.

Since ELSP is categorized as NP-hard [13] which leads to difficulty of checking every possible schedule in a reasonable amount of computational time, recently, metaheuristic algorithms have been implemented effectively to solve the problem.

Khouja et al. [14] proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the ELSP applying the basic period approach, and showed that the GA is appropriate for solving the problem. Moon et al. [15] addressed the ELSP based on the time-varying lot size method, and suggested a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to solve the model. The obtained results by the HGA surpassed the best-known Dobson’s heuristic [16]. Chatfield [17] proposed a GA, namely, genetic lot scheduling procedure, to solve the ELSP using the extended basic period (EBP) approach. Their method was compared with the well-known benchmark problem presented by Bomberger [18]. The results outlined that the proposed approach offers better optimization reliability. Jenabi et al. [19] solved the ELSP in a flow shop setting utilizing the HGA and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Their computational results indicated the superiority of the proposed HGA compared to the SA with respect to the solution quality. However, the proposed SA outperformed the HGA in terms of the required computational time.

Chandrasekaran et al. [20] investigated the ELSP with the time-varying lot size approach and sequence-independent/sequence-dependent setup times of parts, and applied the GA, the SA, and the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. The computational performance analyses revealed the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic methods. Raza and Akgunduz [21] examined the ELSP with time-varying lot size approach using the SA, and conducted a comparative study of heuristic algorithms on the problem. They compared the results with Dobson’s heuristic [16] and Moon et al. [15], and concluded that the SA finds the best-known solution for the suggested problem. Bulut et al. [22] proposed a GA for the ELSP under the EBP approach and power-of-two (PoT) policy. The experimental results showed that the proposed GA is highly competitive to the best-performing algorithms from the existing literature under the EBP and PoT policy.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no research on the ELSP with multiple products having various production frequencies, and respecting the shelf life and backordering constraints using the metaheuristic methods. In this paper, the proposed ELSP model by Yan et al. [12] is modified. A computational study of the well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely the GA, the SA, the particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms are presented to solve the proposed model. Accordingly, the performance of the best existing approach presented by Yan et al. [12] and the proposed metaheuristic algorithms are evaluated and compared.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the mathematical formulation. In Section 3, applied methods are explained. Section 4 demonstrates numerical examples and discusses the computational results. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.

In this section, a mathematical model for the ELSP is presented based on the integration and modification of the models presented by Goyal [10] and Yan et al. [12]. Consider N types of items are produced on a single machine in the manufacturing cycle time of T, investigating the effect of constituent costs in an inventory system with shelf life constraint and production of items more than once in a cycle. The objective is to minimize the total cost, in addition to obtaining a feasible production schedule, the optimum production frequency, production rate, backorder level, batch size for each item, and optimal production cycle time for the family of items using optimization engines.

The objective function aims at minimizing the total cost which comprises of machine operating, setup, inventory holding, and backordering costs, in addition to an adjustment cost in case of overlapping production times of different items which leads to an infeasible schedule. A detailed description for the adjustment cost can be found in Yan et al. [12].

For a feasible solution, the total setup time and production time for N products cannot go beyond the cycle time T

It is supposed that each item i has a shelf life of Li
                         years, and the inventory is used on first-in-first-out basis. Accordingly, item i with the longest keeping period will be produced at the later section of the manufacturing cycle. Thus, the maximum time that product i is stored is T(1−

                        /pi
                        ) [8]. However, the shelf life constraint amends in the model allowing the backorders [23]. Thus, the shelf life constraint in this condition is:

                        When the optimal cycle time goes beyond the time restriction of life for an item, spoilage of the product might occur that in turn leads to a loss to the manufacturer. The storage time for an item can be lowered by producing that item more frequently in a manufacturing cycle. If item i is produced more than once in a production cycle, the shelf life constraint considering the production start time advancement or delay for the j

                        . If the required machine time for other products exceeds the available time, it causes production times conflicts between some or all the items. Therefore, the constraints given in Eqs. (11)–(18) based on Yan et al. [12] must be met to avoid the schedule infeasibility.

The production of an item can be commenced only after the completion of production of its former batch. Hence:

The formulation given in Section 2 is a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. These characteristics justify the model to be adequately hard to be solved using exact methods. To deal with the complexity and find near-optimal results in a reasonable computational time, metaheuristic approaches are widely used for which the GA, the SA, the PSO and the ABC algorithms are explained in the following subsections.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a stochastic search technique based on the natural evolutionary processes. Fundamental of the GA was primarily instated by Holland [24]. Simplicity and capability of finding quick reasonable solutions for intricate searching and optimization problems have brought about a growing interest over the GA. GA contains a set of individuals that constitute the population. Every individual in the population is represented by a particular chromosome which indicates a plausible solution to the existing problem. Throughout consecutive repetitions, called generations, the chromosomes evolve. During each generation, the fitness of each chromosome in the population is evaluated. Upon the selection of some chromosomes from the existing generation as parents, offspring will be produced by either crossover or mutation operators. The algorithm stops when a termination condition is reached. The required steps to solve the proposed model by a GA are described in the following subsections.

The primary data needed to start the GA method comprises two sections:
                              
                                 1.
                                 Model data: includes quantities to compute the required variables.

The GA data: involves the probability of operating crossover known as crossover rate represented by ‘Pc
                                    ’, the probability of operating mutation called mutation rate represented by ‘Pm
                                    ’, the number of chromosomes kept in each generation that is named population size, and indicated by ‘Npop
                                    ’, and maximum number of generations denoted by ‘max gene’.

In this paper, both the crossover and mutation rates alter in the range [0.1,1]. The computational results show that the effect of Pc
                            on the total cost value is positive. Therefore, the smaller the crossover probability, the lesser the total cost will be. However, C(T) will decrease as Pm
                            increase. Additionally, several population sizes in the range [50,200] are examined in the experiments.

The GA starts with encoding the variables of the problem as finite-length strings called chromosomes. Since the proposed model in this paper is a non-linear problem containing three different types of variables (discrete, continuous, and binary), a real number representation is applied to lessen this intricacy.

                           This matrix contains three rows and N columns. The three elements of each column represent the cycle time τ (floating point), adopted production rate p (integer), and production frequency φ (integer) for every item. Furthermore, the first row of the matrix presents the cycle time, the second row indicates the adopted production rate, and the third one presents the production frequency for all items.

An infeasible production plan may occur as products are allowed to have more than one setup per cycle. In order to attain feasibility, the production start time(s) of one or more of the items can be advanced (

                            where ω is the total number of production frequencies. To have a feasible schedule for each column only one non-zero value of 1 must be generated. The mechanism of generating 1 and 0 is random (1 and 0 indicate whether the item is produced or not during cycle time T). The summation of values in each row shows the production frequency for each item.

                           When the GA generates a randomly initial population of variable γ, the matrix may have more than one value of 1 in each column. Therefore, the columns of matrix γ must be rechecked. If the number of value of 1 in per column is greater than one, the values of 1 must be changed to 0, and only one value of 1 is kept. In order to select which of those ones must convert to 0, a cost for each element is considered in the form of (O
                           ×
                           Di
                           /pi
                           ). Those 1s that have higher costs will be changed to 0.

GA starts with a group of chromosome known as ‘population’. The initial population is generated randomly by keeping the value of each variable in the range specified by its lower and upper bounds.

The crossover is the main operator of generating new chromosomes. It applies on two parent chromosomes with the predetermined crossover rate (Pc
                           ), and produces two offspring by combining the features of both parent chromosomes. In this research, the arithmetic crossover operator that linearly combines parent chromosome vector is used to produce offspring. The two offspring are obtained using Eqs.

Mutation exerts stochastic change in chromosome genes with probability Pm
                           . It is considered as a background operator that maintains genetic diversity within the population.

Suppose a particular gene such as gj
                            is chosen for mutation; then the value of gj
                            will be changed to the new value g’j

When new chromosomes are produced by the genetic operators, a fitness value must be assigned to chromosomes of each generation in order to evaluate them. This evaluation is achieved by the objective function to measure the fitness of each individual in the population. As explained in Section 2.2, the mathematical model of this research contains different constraints, which may lead to the production of infeasible chromosomes. Therefore, one of the main issues in employing the GAs to solve a constrained problem is how to handle the constraints. In order to deal with infeasibility, the penalty policy is applied, which is the transformation of a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one. It can be attained by adding or multiplying a specific amount to/by the objective function value according to the amount of obtained constraints’ violations in a solution [25].

In the proposed algorithm, once a constraint is violated a penalty will be considered in the form of a positive and known coefficient. When a chromosome is feasible, its penalty is zero while in case of infeasibility, the coefficient is selected sufficiently large. Therefore, the fitness function for a chromosome will be equal to the sum of the objective function value and penalties. The penalty policy is employed for all the metaheuristic algorithms proposed in this research.

Selection is the driving force in a GA that determines the evolutionary process flow. In each generation, individuals are chosen to reproduce, creating offspring for the new population. Therefore, it provides the selection of the individual, and the number of its copies that will be chosen as parent chromosomes. Usually, the fittest individuals will have a larger probability to be selected for the next generation. In this research, the “roulette wheel” method has been applied for the selection process. The selection probability, pj
                           , for individual j with fitness Cj
                           , is calculated by Eq. (29)

                           The selection process is based on spinning the wheel the number of times equal to Npop, each selecting a single chromosome for the new procedure.

Fitness function value of all members, including parents and offspring are assessed in this stage. Next, the chromosomes with higher fitness scores are chosen in order to generate a new population.

The selection and reproduction of parents will be continued until the algorithm reaches a stopping criterion. The procedure can be ended after a predetermined number of generations, or when no substantial improvement during any one generation is achieved. In this study, the process is stopped when the number of iterations has reached the maximum generations.

Simulated annealing (SA) is an effective stochastic search algorithm for solving combinatorial and global optimization problems. The basic thought is inspired from the analogy with the physical annealing process of solids. Based on this procedure, the SA algorithm explores different areas of the search space of a problem by annealing from a high to a low temperature. During the search process both better solutions as well as worse solutions are accepted with a probability related to the temperature in the cooling schedule at that time. This feature brings about escaping from the local optima.

In this paper, a population-based SA is utilized. Unlike the conventional SA, population-based SA iterates a population of solutions rather than a single solution. During each iteration, it explores the candidate solutions around several promising samples, and prevents the candidate solution from being stagnated in one local optimum. This not only enhances the search speed, but also yields a solution near the global optimum [27,28]. The main steps of the SA algorithm are described below.

In this step, the input parameters of the SA algorithm are initialized. The parameters are:

                           ) is the starting point of temperature computation in every iteration. ϕ
                           0 should be adequately high to escape a premature convergence. Practically, the SA algorithm begins with an initial temperature where most of the moves are accepted.

Cooling schedule determines the functional form of the change in temperature required in the SA method. A geometric temperature reduction rule which is the most commonly utilized decrement rule is applied for this study. If the temperature at k
                           th iteration is ϕk
                           , then the temperature at (k
                           +1)th iteration is given by [29]:

The temperature is remained fixed once it reaches the lowest temperature limit (ϕf
                           ).

In our implementation, various values for the initial and final temperature, population size, number of neighbors, cooling factor, and number of iteration were examined in order to find the proper values of the SA algorithm’s parameters.

The neighborhood search structure is a procedure that generates a new solution that slightly changes the current solution. To delineate the neighborhood configuration, the following process is used in order to prevent the fast convergence of the SA. The number of neighborhood searches in each temperature level (epoch length) is considered 10. It is the number of solutions which are accessible in an immediate move from the current solution.

For selecting which equation to be used, a random number in the range [0, 1] is generated. Then, if random number is less than 0.5, Eqs. (31) and (33), and if it is greater than 0.5, Eqs. (32) and (34), will be used.

The SA algorithm begins with a high temperature and selects initial solutions (S0
                           ) randomly. The initial value of ϕ
                           0 performs as a controller factor of the temperature. Next, a new solution (Sn
                           ) within the neighborhood of the current solution (S) is computed in each iteration. In the minimization problem, if the value of the objective function, C(Sn
                           ), is smaller than the previous value, C(S), the new solution is accepted. Otherwise, in order to avoid the local optimum solution, the new solution is accepted with a stochastic function given in Eq. (35):

The Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is a stochastic optimization technique which was initially introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart [30]. It is a population-based evolutionary computation method for solving continuous optimization problems. The idea of the procedure was inspired by the social behavior of fish schooling or bird flocking choreography.

The PSO method exchanges the information among individuals (particles) and the population (swarm). Every particle continuously updates its flying path based on its own best previous experience in which the best previous position is acquired by all members of particle’s neighborhood. Moreover, in the PSO, all particles assume the whole swarm as their neighborhood. Therefore, there occurs social sharing of information between particles of a population, and particles benefit from the neighboring experience or the experience of the whole swarm in the searching procedure [31].

Every particle in the swarm has five individual properties: (i) position, (ii) velocity, (iii) objective function value related to the position, (iv) the best position explored so far by the particle, and (v) objective function value related to the best position of the particle. In any iteration of PSO, the velocity and position of particles are updated according to Eqs. (36) and (37)

                         is the velocity of i
                        th particle, w is the inertia weight which is developed to better control exploration and exploitation usually in range [0.8, 1.2]; c
                        1 is the cognitive component (self-confidence of the particle); r
                        1 and r
                        2 are random numbers uniformly distributed within the range [0, 1]; pi
                         is the best solution found by particle i; xi
                         is the current value particle i; c
                        2 is the social component (swarm confidence); and gi
                         is global best position explored so far by the whole swarm. In order to obtain the i
                        th particle’s new velocity in every iteration, Eq (36) is applied, while to determine the new position of the i
                        th particle, Eq. (37) is used which is adding its new velocity to its current position. This process continues until stopping conditions are satisfied. The performance of each particle is evaluated according to the fitness function (objective function).

Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was introduced by Karaboga [33] which is a novel intelligent search process suitable for multi-variable and continuous multi-modal optimization problems. Inspired by the honey bee foraging behavior, the ABC algorithm includes three main components, namely employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. Details of such components can be found in [34,35]. The main steps of the ABC procedure are described in the next subsections.

The main parameters of the ABC algorithm are the number of colony size (NB), number of food sources (NS), number of trials (limit), and maximum number of cycles of the search process (MC). In the basic ABC algorithm, half of the colony size relates to employed bees, and the rest represents the number of onlooker bees. There is only one employed bee for each food source position; therefore, total number of employed or onlooker bees indicates the amount of food source positions encompassing the hive (potential solutions). Similar to the other swarm intelligence techniques, the ABC method is an iterative procedure, and begins with a population of random potential solutions (food sources).

The ABC algorithm generates a randomly initial population of i solutions (i
                           =1,2,…,
                           NS), where i denotes the size of population, and NS is the quantity of food sources which is equal to the number of the employed bees or onlooker bees. Let Fi

                           th food source (solution) in the population; and each solution fi
                            is a d-dimensional vector, where d refers to the decision variables to be optimized which are explained in Section 3.1.2. Then, each food source is created using Eq. (38):

                            is rounded. After initialization, the population of the food source positions (potential solutions) is commanded to iterate the cycle of search processes for the employed, onlooker and scout bees (cycle=1, 2,…, MC).

The properties of the ABC algorithm are chosen by applying try and error method. In order to test the performance of each combination, several combinations of NB (20, 50, 100, 200), and limit (2, 50, 100) have been implemented. The number of food sources (NS) is considered as NB/2.

At this phase, every employed bee (fi
                           ) explores its neighborhood food source to generate a new food source (fnew
                           ) according to the following equation:

                           th food source (fi
                           ). Once the onlooker has chosen its food source, it makes an adjustment on fi
                            using Eq. (39). The same process applied on the employed bees for the selection and replacement adjustment is also utilized on the onlooker bees.

If a food source (fi
                           ) does not improve for a specified number of trials (limit), associated employed bee will abandon the food source, and that employed bee will become a scout. The scout randomly generates a food source. Eq. (38) is used for this purpose. In the basic ABC process, during per cycle at most one scout goes outside for exploring a new food source. After the new position is specified, a new algorithm cycle (MC) begins. The same processes are iterated until the termination condition is reached.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

In this section, a three-product inventory problem is investigated using the data given in Table 1
                     , which were firstly presented by Silver [8], and later were applied by many authors [6,7,9,12,36,37]. In order to find near-optimum solutions, the GA, the SA, the PSO, and the ABC algorithms were coded in MATLAB 7.14.0.739, and run on a laptop equipped with an Intel Core i5 processor working at a speed of 2.67GHz and 4GB of RAM.

To find the values of the algorithms’ parameters, each algorithm is employed through pilot runs, each time changing the parameters in their corresponding ranges and obtaining the response values. The parameter settings of all algorithms are given in Table 2
                     .

In order to compare the performances of the four algorithms, each problem instance has been run 10 times with the parameters settings given in Table 2. The objective function values along with machine operating costs of $1000, $750, and $500, are reported in Tables 3–5
                     
                     
                      respectively.


                     Table 6
                      represents the best obtained solutions by the GA, the SA, the PSO, and the ABC algorithms accompanied with other approaches given in the literature for different amounts of machine operating cost.

From Table 6, it can be concluded that all metaheuristic methods used in this research found the minimum total cost among other methodologies reported in the literature. It is evident that if a product is permitted to be produced more than once per cycle, a lower total cost will be produced. Therefore, same deduction was achieved as the conclusion implied by Yan et al. [12]. Silver [36], and Viswanathan and Goyal’s [23] assumption of production of per item exactly once every cycle generated higher total cost. However, in Silver’s model [36] backordering was not considered. According to Viswanathan and Goyal’s model [23], including backordering in the model produces a smaller total annual cost compared to the model which excludes backorders.

It is noted that the ABC algorithm founds the best-known solutions, and outperformed the proposed GA, SA, and PSO methods. The ABC method obtained approximately 14%, 21% and 26% reduction in total cost for machine operating costs $1000, $750, and $500 respectively compared with the two-stage heuristic algorithm presented by Yan et al. [12]. The model’s variables obtained by the ABC algorithm for the best solutions are summarized in Table 7
                     .

The results show that in a high machine operating cost, e.g. O
                     =$1000, diminution of cycle time causes a lower cost than reduction in the production rates. Sarker and Babu [7] also proved that when the manufacturing cost is considered into the model, it may be more economical to decrease the cycle time rather than the production rate. Adversely, when the machine operating cost decreases, production rate reduction might be more effective. For instance, when the annual machine operating cost is $500, the production rate for item 1 is reduced from 3000 to 2800, and for items 2 and 3, the reduction is from 2500 to 2000; while, cycle time T is increased. Silver [8] declared that if the manufacturing rate is decreased, the production should be performed for a longer period.

Silver [8] also stated that in the absence of production cost, i.e. O
                     =$0, the reduction in production rate is more cost-effective than decreasing the cycle time. For instance, O
                     =$0 was examined by the ABC method, and the production rate for item 1, 2, and 3 decreased to 2000, 800, and 1400 respectively. Furthermore, total cost of $1040 was obtained, which is much less than the results reported in previous works (45% reduction in total cost compared to Yan et al. [12]). However, as machine operating cost $0 is not probable in practice, it is not tested on the problem instances in this paper.

In Yan et al. [12], the items’ production frequencies were limited to three in order to make the problem practical, and limit the computational effort. Their proposed algorithm becomes computationally expensive for solving relatively large problems. In this paper, there is no such limitation on the production frequencies. The order of production of items, and their frequency for machine operating costs $1000, $750, and $500 are shown in matrices A
                     4, A
                     5, and A
                     6 respectively.

As the number of production frequency increases, production time conflicts may occur between production start times of some products. If the schedule is feasible, there is no need to adjust the production times as there are no production time overlaps for all the items. However, if conflicts exist in production times, some adjustments are necessary to attain feasibility.


                     Fig. 2
                      shows the production schedule over the first production cycle for three items with machine operating cost $1000. It can be seen that the second batch of item 2 has production time conflict with the first batch of item 1, indicating the infeasibility of the current schedule. Item 1 needs to be produced from time 0.016 to 0.115, while second batch of item 2 needs to be produced from 0.1 to 0.116. Therefore, for achieving a feasible schedule, the start time for the second batch of item 2 is delayed from 0.1 to 0.115.

Moreover, second batch of item 3 needs to be produced during the interval 0.281–0.323. However, according to Eq. (17), the last batch cannot exceed the overall cycle time. Hence, production start time of the second batch of item 3 is advanced from 0.281 to 0.258. The advancement and delay of production start times (time units) in each cycle time T for each instance are shown in Tables 8–13

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A mixed-integer non-linear model has been addressed in this paper which considers the practical characteristics, including backordering, shelf life, and multiple setups for each product in a manufacturing cycle. The paper investigated the problem of obtaining the optimum production rate and production frequency for each item, the optimal production cycle time for all the products, in addition to a feasible manufacturing schedule. However, the assumption of production of items more than once in a cycle might cause an infeasible schedule due to the overlapping production times of various items. To eliminate the production time conflicts and to achieve a feasible schedule, the production start time of some or all the items must be adjusted by either advancing or delaying.

The solution of the large scale proposed ELSP model may be out of reach using the existing approaches based on the complexity and the required computational efforts associated with the model. Thus, efficient heuristic methods are required to solve the NP-hard model for large problems usually found in real-world situations. In this paper, effective solution approaches based on real-coded GA, SA, PSO, and ABC algorithms for integer, non-integer, and binary variables are presented for solving the proposed model. The results indicate the efficiency of the applied metaheuristic methods in solving the proposed model. Comparisons were based on the percentage improvement in the total cost. All the applied methods showed an impressive performance and excellent solution qualities. The metaheuristic algorithms can also efficiently handle large-sized instances in a moderate computational time. However, the ABC method produced the lowest cost, which may indicate its superiority in searching for solutions of similar problems. Therefore, the ABC-based approaches can be served as a useful decision-support tool for production managers.
