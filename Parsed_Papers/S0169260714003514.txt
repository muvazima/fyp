                  This research examines the precision of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy computing technique in estimating the anti-obesity property of a potent medicinal plant in a clinical dietary intervention. Even though a number of mathematical functions such as SPSS analysis have been proposed for modeling the anti-obesity properties estimation in terms of reduction in body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and body weight loss, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. Since it is a very crucial problem, in this paper a process was constructed which simulates the anti-obesity activities of caraway (Carum carvi) a traditional medicine on obese women with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference (ANFIS) method. The ANFIS results are compared with the support vector regression (SVR) results using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R
                     2). The experimental results show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and capability of generalization can be achieved by the ANFIS approach. The following statistical characteristics are obtained for BMI loss estimation: RMSE=0.032118 and R
                     2
                     =0.9964 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.47287 and R
                     2
                     =0.361 in SVR testing. For fat loss estimation: RMSE=0.23787 and R
                     2
                     =0.8599 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.32822 and R
                     2
                     =0.7814 in SVR testing. For weight loss estimation: RMSE=0.00000035601 and R
                     2
                     =1 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.17192 and R
                     2
                     =0.6607 in SVR testing. Because of that, it can be applied for practical purposes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Health issues have come to be an essential part of human life, and the significance of wellness and fitness in modern and developing societies around the world is proven. International health has become an important component of foreign policy and many governments now give emphasis to community health, and encourage organizations, scholars, and the mass media to improve, support and broadcast research projects associated with health promotion and wellness [1]. This superior necessity for health awareness among people brings attention to those features which affect, positively and negatively, both individual and societal health.

One of the most important global health issues is overweight and obesity and their consequences to society in terms of morbidity and mortality are enormous. The use of the word “Globesity” in reports shows the severity of this problem worldwide [2]. Based on World health organization report [8], the term overweight and obesity are defined as BMI greater than 25 and 30kg/m2, respectively (Fig. 1
                     ). Statistics show that by 2008, the prevalence of obesity had reached up to 1.4 billion adults. Across the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, half of the adult population is currently overweight, and one in six is obese [3]. Fig. 2
                      shows the projections for overweight population trends in different countries up to 2020.

One of the solutions is treatment with medicinal plants which could offer a safer, more reliable, and also cheaper, approach to addressing concerns of overweight and obesity, than the customary current methods. The application of natural remedies for inducing weight loss has risen radically during the last few decades, and usually includes the addition of certain medicinal plants in the diet on a regular basis to assist an individual to lose weight progressively [5,6]. Henceforth, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was intended to study the antiobesity influence of caraway intake on overweight and obese women in Iran.

Even though several models are projected for modeling the obesity management, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. ANN could be applied as alternative to current analytical methods offering advantages including no prerequisite knowledge of core system parameters, solid explanation for multi-variable complications and fast calculation.

In this investigation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) [10], which is a particular form of the ANN family, is applied to estimate the anti-obesity activities of caraway – a potent medicinal plant – in a dietary intervention study. For the currently advanced neural network, overweight and obese women were used as case studies for ANFIS training data. The principal purpose of this research is to analyze the performances of ANFIS for estimation of anti-obesity properties.

ANFIS displays great learning and estimation functions, which change it to a well-organized and effective tool to manage uncertainties faced in different systems. Researchers used ANFIS, as a hybrid intelligent system that boosts the capability to automatically learn, estimate and adjust, in various medical systems [11–13]. Up to now, numerous researches is done on the application of ANFIS for estimation and real-time documentation of various systems [14–16].

In clinical studies, different mathematical approaches such as SPSS software is usually applied as the conventional analysis methods. Also, several functions have been proposed for modeling the anti-obesity properties estimation in terms of reduction in BMI, body fat percentage, and body weight loss. However, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time, accuracy, and correctness. Consequently, ANFIS and Artificial neural network (ANN) could be applied as a more precise alternative method to current analytical approaches. Moreover, ANN suggests other benefits including no needed information of interior system factors, compact answer for multi-variable issues and fast calculation.

A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the anti-obesity effects of caraway seeds extract (CE) on overweight and obese women in Iran. In this study, 70 healthy adult women with BMI between 25 and 46kg/m2 were screened and randomized into a test group and a placebo group. To assure that the number of patients is enough to predict the results statistically, sample size was calculated based on Greenberg formula. Subjects were asked to consume either 30ml of the CE or placebo samples per day, for 90 days. This trial was approved by the clinicaltrial.gov protocol registration system with the Protocol ID: NCT01833377. The safety of CE has been already approved in previous clinical study [7].

Body composition of the participants including body weight (Kg), and of body fat percentage (%BF), was evaluated by means of a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) machine with remote control (Beurer digital diagnostic scale, Model BG63, Ulm, Germany). BMI (kg/m2) was calculated based on the formula (BMI=weight/height2).

ANFIS model is established in this research to estimate obesity according to the three input parameters. There are three outputs:
                           
                              1.
                              Weight loss ≥5%

Fat loss ≥5%

BMI loss ≥0.5

Each of the output has different inputs according to results of weight loss, fat loss and BMI loss before and after testing. The ANFIS networks should determine the optimal obesity for a given number of data inputs. Fig. 3
                         shows an ANFIS structure with thee inputs.

In the present study, the first-order Sugeno model with two inputs and fuzzy IF-THEN rules of Takagi and Sugeno's category is applied:

The primary layer comprises input values membership functions (MFs). This level only provides the input variables to the subsequent layer. The input is month in year. In the primary layer, every node is an adaptive node with a function

                                    (

                                    ,
                                    y
                                    ,

                                    )
                                    ,

                           i
                         are MFs.

The next sheet (membership layer) shows the weights of every MFs. This layer take delivery of the input values from the primary layer and performs as MFs to characterize the fuzzy sets of the relevant input variables. Each node in the second layer is non-adaptive and this layer proliferates the entering signals and drives the product out like

Every node output denotes the firing strenght of a rule or weight.

The third layer is known as the rule layer. In this layer, every node (neuron) executes the pre-condition balancing of the fuzzy rules, i.e. calculating the initiation level of each rule, the number of layers being equivalent to the number of fuzzy rules. Every node of the layers analyzes the weights, which have been standardized. Similarly, the third layer is non-adaptive and each node computes the proportion of the rule's firing strength to the sum of all rules’ firing strengths like

The results of this layer are known as normalized firing strenghts or normalized weights.

The fourth layer is named the defuzzification layer which is responsible for delivering the output results being caused by the implication of rules. Each node in the fourth layer is an adaptive node with node function, where

The fifth layer is known as the output layer which totalities all the inputs arising from the fourth layer and transmutes the fuzzy classification outcomes into a crisp (binary). The single node in the fifth layer calculates the complete output as the outline of all entering signals which is not adaptive.

In this study, BMI loss, fat loss and weight loss measurements before and after training was used for generating ANFIS model. To get more reliable evaluation and comparison, ANFIS model are tested by evaluating a data set that was not used during the training process. The statistical parameters for data sets are calculated and given in Tables 1–3
                        
                        
                        .

At the beginning, the ANFIS network was trained with measured data in Tables 2–4
                        . According to the experiments, the input parameters and output parameters are collected and defined for the learning techniques. For the experiments, 70% of the data was used to train samples and the subsequent 30% served to test samples. We analyzed the ANFIS models based on the three inputs.

                         shows ANFIS decision surfaces for anti-obesity activities of caraway in a dietary intervention study for different input combinations and for different outputs.

The training and testing data prediction by ANFIS and SVR methods of BMI loss are shown in Fig. 6(a and b). Fig. 6(c) presents ANFIS and SVR prediction of the BMI loss.

The training and testing data prediction by ANFIS and SVR methods of FAT loss are shown in Fig. 7(a and b). Fig. 6(c) presents ANFIS and SVR prediction of the FAT loss.

The training and testing data prediction by ANFIS and SVR methods of WEIGHT loss are shown in Fig. 8(a and b). Fig. 8(c) presents ANFIS and SVR prediction of the WEIGHT loss.

The performance of ANFIS and SVR models that estimated BMI, FAT and WEIGHT loss was evaluated according to statistical criteria such as RMSE and coefficient of determination R
                        2. This confirms the RMSE statistics evaluated in Table 4. As can be seen in Table 4 testing R
                        2 correlation coefficient is very high for all ANFIS models in comparison to SVR models. It should be concluded, that the proposed ANFIS model can be used for forecasting of BMI, FAT and WEIGHT loss with high reliability. The proposed ANFIS model can also play important role in the anti-obesity properties of a medicinal plant.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The anti-obesity property of CE has been reported in previous studies, in which the paired t-test and Student's t-test, were used with 99% confidence interval. The SPSS analysis of the results showed significant reduction in body weight, body fat percentage and BMI of participants in CE group compared with placebo group [7,9]. These outcomes are in line with the findings of this study using ANFIS (Table 5
                     ). Hence, the proposed ANFIS model can be embedded as a module for estimating anti-obesity activity specific bioactive compounds.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The accuracy of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique in estimation of estimating the anti-obesity property of a potent medicinal plant in a clinical dietary intervention was presented in this study. Even though a number of mathematical functions such as SPSS analysis have been proposed for modeling the anti-obesity properties estimation in terms of reduction in body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and body weight loss, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. The study indicated that modeling of anti-obesity property is possible through the use of ANFIS technique. The ANFIS models were compared with support vector regression (SVR) results.

The following statistical characteristics are obtained for BMI loss estimation: RMSE=0.032118 and R
                     2
                     =0.9964 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.47287 and R
                     2
                     =0.361 in SVR testing. For fat loss estimation: RMSE=0.23787 and R
                     2
                     =0.8599 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.32822 and R
                     2
                     =0.7814 in SVR testing. For weight loss estimation: RMSE=0.00000035601 and R
                     2
                     =1 in ANFIS testing and RMSE=0.17192 and R
                     2
                     =0.6607 in SVR testing. Because of that, it can be applied for practical purposes. The main advantages of the ANFIS model are computationally efficiency and adaptability.
