                  This article studies the role of social capital on cotton production efficiency and productivity for a sample of small farms in Maharashtra, India using data envelopment analysis. Input shadow prices are computed as an indicator of the importance of social capital relative to other inputs. Results suggest social capital to be the input with the highest contribution to production efficiency after land. The Luenberger indicator is used to assess the productivity improvement associated to an investment in social capital, which is found to be on the order of 12%. Undertaking collective production activities is found to play an important role in improving productivity. This is especially relevant to agricultural households facing important economic and institutional restrictions that make it difficult to increase conventional (expensive) inputs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Formal institutions and interpersonal relationships can promote trust, improve search activities and encourage trade, which are usually hindered by asymmetries in human society (Hayek, 1945). The concept of social capital was coined to embrace “the internal social and cultural coherence of society, the norms and values that govern interactions among people and the institutions in which they are embedded” (Grootaert, 1998a). While initially, social capital was mainly drawing the attention of sociology and political science disciplines, later on it found its path into economic analysis (Fukuyama, 1995). Coleman (1988) popularized the social capital term and defined it as the embodiment of relations among individuals for the purpose of productive activity. The Social Capital Initiative, launched in 1996 by the World Bank, contributed to further spread this concept. In spite of this, social capital is still a relatively awkward concept in mainstream economic thinking.

A growing literature has documented the significant connections that exist between social capital and economic outcomes (Knack & Keefer, 1997; Whiteley, 2000). At an aggregate level, Whiteley (2000) finds social capital to be as relevant as human capital when it comes to understanding national economic growth. Casey and Christ (2005) do not provide evidence that social capital brings economic prosperity, but argue that it promotes economic equality and employment stability. At a subnational level, research results have been mixed. Helliwell and Putnam (1995) or Rupasingha, Goetz, and Freshwater (2002) research findings support that social capital explains economic differences across different Italian and US regions, respectively. In contrast, Schneider, Plumper, and Bauman (2000) find economic, rather than social forces, to be the drivers of economic prosperity in European regions. At the microeconomic level, several articles have found a positive correlation between social capital and household incomes (Narayan & Pritchett, 1999; Robison et al., 2000). There is increasing evidence that social capital plays a especially relevant role in the rural sector in developing economies, where it can help overcoming the scarcity of other more expensive inputs (Fafchamps & Minten, 2002; Ha, Kant, & Maclaren, 2006; Narayan & Pritchett, 1999). A number of studies have even suggested that the contribution of social capital to production may be greater than the contribution of other conventional inputs.

Economic theory has provided foundation for the economic impacts attributed to social capital. For example, Greif (1993), among others, have discussed the role that social interaction has in solving free rider issues and opportunism (Glaeser, Laibson, & Sacerdote, 2002). Alternatively, game theory has shown that cooperation between individuals is more likely to occur when individuals expect to continue interacting in the future (Abreu, 1988; Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts, & Wilson, 1982). Membership in social organizations may create generalized bands of trust in the community that can replace missing or expensive legal structures, reduce risk and transactions costs. This will enhance economic efficiency and community welfare and reduce community poverty and vulnerability (Casey & Christ, 2005; Narayan & Pritchett, 1999; Whiteley, 2000; Woolcock, 2001). From an economic theory perspective, while some types of social capital may enhance productivity, others may reduce it (Dasgupta, 2002). Game theory has warned that long-term links can also imply allocations in which some of the parties are worse off than they would be if they were not involved in these relationships (Dasgupta, 2002). In the terminology of Putnam (2000), some forms of social capital may stifle economic progress.

Social networks play a relevant role in linking farmers with knowledge, technology, skills, etc. Although extension services can also contribute to increased knowledge, in many developing economies they can be under-resourced, suffer from gender and cultural biases, or be highly dependent on political agendas. Social capital has very limited economic value if not combined with other forms of capital and can make the latter much more efficient (Grootaert, 1998a). It is conceived as “capital” because of its ability to increase the productive output by producing goods and services (Robison, Schmid, & Siles, 1999). Social capital may be important to small, resource-poor agricultural households. These farms have usually very restricted access to economic resources, conventional agricultural inputs and marketing channels. The impact of social capital on rural household economies has been widely debated. Contributing to this debate, many recent economic development analyses at the micro level have included social capital in household production functions (Grootaert, 1999; Ha, Kant, & Maclaren, 2004; Ha et al., 2006; Innes, 2010; Maluccio, Haddad, & May, 1999; Narayan & Pritchett, 1999; Ruben & Strien, 2001). A growing empirical evidence is supporting the idea that social capital can indeed help rural households overcome the deficiency of other capitals and inputs, thus increasing their welfare (Annen, 2001; Fafchamps & Minten, 2002). We add to this literature by assessing the contribution of social capital to the productive efficiency and productivity of a sample of smallholder farms in Maharashtra, India. Social capital shadow prices are derived and compared with other input shadow prices to assess their relative importance. Since the different dimensions of social capital have been shown to reduce transaction costs, improve market information, facilitate information flows, etc., this capital is likely to have an impact on production activities of agricultural holdings (Grootaert, 1998a).

Agriculture in the developing world is considered as a key instrument for poverty reduction and rural development (World Bank, 2008). This role is undisputable in many Indian economies where the agricultural sector is a major contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) and a relevant employer. This is especially true for the area of Vidardbha (specifically Wardha District) in the state of Maharashtra in central India, where a state of profound agrarian distress has been characterizing farmers’ situation, to the extent that this area became internationally known for the tragedy of farmer suicides (Das, 2011; Mishra, 2008; Mitra & Shroff, 2007). The poor performance of agriculture in the area studied is evidenced by its low standard of living. Development economics generally agrees that a sustainable economic development should be based on promoting productivity and output growth (Bravo-Ureta & Pinheiro, 1993, 1997). Efficiency improvement allows increasing production without requiring increased input use or investments in new technology. Noteworthy is the fact that efficiency gains in subsistence agricultural economies go ahead of economic considerations and can be crucial for the survival of the household.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present a literature review. The third section focuses on methodological issues. Results and policy implications are derived in the fourth section. The paper ends with the concluding remarks section.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature on the impacts of social capital on the efficiency with which agricultural holdings operate is very scarce. Jaime, Salazar, and Novoa (2011) apply Battese and Coelli (1995) efficiency model to study the effects of social capital, measured as the participation in organizations, on the technical efficiency of wheat smallholder farms in Chile. Their findings suggest that social capital improves farms’ performance. In a similar study, Jaime and Salazar (2011) reach the same conclusion. Nyemeck, Tonyè, and Wandji (2005) examine technical efficiency of groundnut monocrop, maize monocrop and maize-groundnut intercrop Cameroonian farms. Once the technical efficiency scores are derived, a two-limit tobit regression is run in order to identify the determinants of technical efficiency. Membership in a farmers’ club or other associations is found to improve efficiency (this is compatible with results in Nyemeck, Tonyè, Wandji, Nyambi, & Akoa, 2004). Further, public sector involvement in providing information or technical assistance is also found to enhance technical efficiency. Gómez-Limón, Picazo-Tadeo, and Reig-Martínez (2012) study managerial eco-efficiency of a sample of olive-farms in Andalusía, Spain, using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A censored tobit regression is estimated to identify the factors affecting eco-efficiency. Social capital, measured as agricultural associations membership, is not found to be statistically significant.


                     Solís, Bravo-Ureta, and Quiroga (2007) use Battese and Coelli (1995) model to assess technical efficiencies of a sample of El Salvador farms with different levels of adoption of soil conservation programs. A switching regression model is used to address selectivity biases and derive efficient parameter estimates in the stochastic production frontier analysis. The specification of inefficiency effects equation includes social capital variables (the participation in social networks). However, social capital is not found to be statistically relevant. Waheed and Ayodele (2010) evaluate efficiency of a sample of maize smallholder farms in Nigeria. The causes of inefficiency are studied using Battese and Coelli’s (1995) model. In the inefficiency effects model, a dummy variable for membership in a farmer association is introduced, which is found to enhance farm performance.


                     Ha et al. (2006) adopt a slightly different perspective in that they consider social capital as an input a la par with conventional inputs such as labor and physical capital. To show the extent to which social capital contributes to production efficiency, the authors estimate a distance function from which to elicit social capital shadow values. They find a positive impact of social capital on efficiency levels, with an increase in social capital of 1% having a higher contribution than adding one million Vietnamese dong of physical capital to the production process. The objective of our work is to identify the impacts of social capital on the technical efficiency and productivity of small agricultural cotton holdings in Maharashtra, India, thus contributing to the scant literature on the topic.

Social capital is a multidimensional concept. Grootaert and Bastelaer (2002) distinguish at least four key dimensions: its scope, its manifestations, its channels and the kind of relationships through which social capital has an economic impact. Given the multidimensionality of social capital, some definitions proposed in the literature are highly complex and almost impossible to operationalize in an empirical setting. This has led many scientists to move toward a narrower and focused micro definition of social capital. A majority of the analyses on the economic impacts of social capital have considered this form of capital along the lines of Putnam (1993), i.e., mainly as an associational activity that facilitates cooperation and coordination among individuals (Grootaert, 1999; Grootaert & Narayan, 1999; Grootaert, Oh, & Swamy, 2002; Narayan & Pritchett, 1999). While this approach makes it easy to determine what is and what is not social capital, it neglects the much broader environment in which communities are rooted (Woolcock, 2002).

Late research has moved toward a characterization of social capital as a multidimensional variable that not only reflects associational practices, but that also embraces information sharing, trust, reciprocity, etc. (Ha, Kant, & Maclaren, 2008). Information sharing facilitates the flow of information, reduces transaction costs, mitigates imperfect market information and may create mutual knowledge (Fafchamps & Minten, 2002; Grootaert, 1998b). Trust, that results from repeated interaction, also reduces transaction costs, saves resources and contributes to contract enforceability (Pargal, Huq, & Gilligan, 2002; Pretty & Ward, 2001). Dasgupta (2002) defines trust as the expectations that an individual has about others’ actions which have a bearing on the individual choice of action, when the individual decision will be taken before she can observe the others’ actions. Trust is based on reputation, which in turn is acquired through observed behavior over time. Reciprocity, on the other hand, motivates exchanges for mutual benefit (Maluccio et al., 1999; Pretty & Ward, 2001). Reciprocity appears, for example, when an individual helps another individual when he is in need, with the understanding that the latter will help the former when he needs it. While some analyses have considered the different dimensions of social capital separately, others have aggregated the different components into an additive social capital index (Grootaert, 1999; Grootaert & Narayan, 1999; Grootaert et al., 2002; Ha et al., 2008).

Closely related to the need to define social capital is the debate on how to measure and quantify it. Social capital is difficult to measure because we are unsure of what we shall be measuring: it comprises different types of social interrelationships and engagements and its components are often intangible (Dasgupta, 2002). Social capital measurement is not only conditional upon its definition, but also upon other issues such as the geographical area or the sector studied (Grootaert & Bastelaer, 2002). While some authors have developed a large number of indicators (Bebbington & Carroll, 2000), others have focused on a very tight number of them (Wolz, Fritzsch, & Reinsberg, 2005).

In order to generate quantitative data on the different dimensions of social capital, the World Bank (Grootaert, Narayan, Nyhan Jones, & Woolcock, 2004) has provided the Integrated Questionnaire for the Measurement of Social Capital (SC-IQ). Such questionnaire captures information about “groups and networks; trust and solidarity; collective action and cooperation; information and communication; social cohesion and inclusion; empowerment and political action” (Grootaert et al., 2004, vii). Different empirical studies that have been conducted afterward have adapted the SC-IQ to their particular case study (Ha et al., 2004). Our questionnaire is also an adaptation of the World Bank’s questionnaire.

While the debate is still vigorous on whether a narrow or a wide definition of social capital shall be adopted, and on how social capital contributes to production processes, scholars have moved forward both in conceptual and empirical terms. As it emerges from the literature review presented above, most studies assessing the influence of social capital on production efficiency have relied on a parametric specification of the production frontier and have considered social capital as exogenous to the production process. By taking the decision on whether to participate or not in social processes, firms can modulate social capital levels. Our model specification allows for the ability of producers to manage social capital in order to produce the maximum feasible output. Specifically, social capital is defined as an input in the distance function characterizing the production technology of a sample of Indian, cotton-producing farms. In order to overcome misspecification issues, a nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used. Directional derivatives are used to retrieve shadow prices from the distance function to show the extent to which social capital contributes to production efficiency in terms of value. A Luenberger productivity indicator allows estimating improvements in productivity and efficiency derived from investment in social capital. Twofold is the contribution of this work to the literature. First, it represents the first approach to derive social capital shadow values using DEA and the directional derivative approach. Second, it is the first article that sheds light on the relevance of social capital in the Indian rural sector.

@&#METHODS@&#

Our empirical analysis aims at assessing the role that social capital plays in cotton production obtained by a sample of smallholder farms in Maharashtra, India. An input-oriented directional distance function is used to represent the technology of sample farms and determine the technical efficiency levels with which these farms operate. The dual formulation of the directional distance allows retrieving the netput relative shadow prices and evaluating the contribution of netputs to production efficiency. Absolute shadow prices can be calculated if the market price of one of the netputs is known and it is assumed to coincide with its shadow price. The advantage of using absolute rather than relative shadow prices is that absolute values are connected to real market prices (Chambers & Färe, 2008; Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell, & Yaisawarng, 1993).

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models are used as a representation of the technology that allows for efficiency measurement. Since DEA models are derived as appropriate hulls of observed input and output data, the resulting frontier of the enveloped data is kinked (Chambers & Färe, 2008), which implies lack of differentiability of the frontier for extreme efficient units. This also entails lack of unique shadow prices for efficient units. Previous literature has proposed different approaches to select appropriate shadow prices among the many that are contained in the “dual” flat that corresponds to the primal “kink”. Chambers and Färe (2008) use the concept of directional derivative to address this issue, which we adopt. Once shadow prices are determined, and in order to provide further insights on the influence of social capital on farm performance, the Luenberger productivity indicator is used to compare the productivity of farms using high social capital levels, and farms with lower social capital levels.

This section follows, very closely, Chambers and Färe (2008). The technology is represented as follows V(y)={x: x can produce y} where

                      is a vector of input quantities, including social capital. While the production economics literature has widely assessed how to model the link between outputs and conventional inputs, the debate on the proper modeling of social capital in the production process is still alive. This makes it especially recommendable to use nonparametric approaches such as DEA models that avoid misspecification biases. An input-oriented directional distance function is used to represent the production technology, as it is closely related geometrically to the directional derivative. Given a directional vector

                     =
                     x. In this case, the directional distance function can be expressed as D(x,
                     y)=max{β: (1−
                     β)x

                     V(y)}, where (1−
                     β) is the efficiency score.

While the dual representation of the directional distance allows deriving the unique netput shadow prices for non-efficient firms, computation of shadow prices is not clear cut for efficient firms. Chambers and Färe’s (2008) directional derivative concept of the distance function is used to compute shadow prices for efficient firms and can be defined as follows:

By using the dual representation of the technology, Chambers and Färe (2008) show how the directional derivatives are related to the shadow prices. The willingness to pay (WTP) and to accept (WTA) for an additional unit of input are used to define the intervals within which shadow values are placed. The WTP for an additional unit of xn
                      can be expressed as:

                     . While at a kink point of the production frontier the WTP and WTA will diverge, these two values are unique and delimit the interval within which the shadow price moves. On the other hand, the decision making units facing a smooth technology are willing to buy and sell inputs at the same price when operating at the margin. In other words, for a smooth technology WTA and WTP coincide.

A data envelopment representation of our shadow pricing problem can be specified, in its primal version, as follows:

In order to further assess the influence of social capital on farm performance, the Luenberger productivity indicator (Chambers, 1996) is used to compare productivity of farms using high social capital levels, and farms that are less intensive in social capital. For such a purpose, we divide our sample into two subsamples, one containing farms with social capital levels above the median (group A) and farms below that level (group B). The productivity change experienced by farms when moving from technology A to technology B can be computed as:

                     (⋅) means that the reference technology to evaluate farm efficiency is constructed from data from the social capital intensive firms. The data that are evaluated are included in the parenthesis. For example, DA

                     g) means that the data corresponding to farms with low social capital levels are evaluated using the technology of farms with high social capital levels. Following Chambers (1996), the direction vector is assumed to be technology independent. This implies that the selection of a direction toward the efficient frontier is the same, independently on whether farms are more or less intensive in social capital. As well known, the productivity indicator in (11) can be decomposed into two components: the efficiency change and the technical change components (Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively):

As in many other Indian states, more than 50% of Maharashtra population depends on agriculture for subsistence. The economic relevance of the agricultural sector has however been declining in Maharashtra state, from a 50% share of GDP in the mid of the twentieth century to a 20% in the beginning of the new century (Wakude, 2010). As a result, poverty in rural areas has been increasing, triggering the growth of urban suburbs across the state. Mumbai is a classical example of the impacts of insufficient subsistence opportunities in rural areas.

The rural population has responded to increased economic difficulties by shifting from the production of low-priced crops to more profitable cash crops such as cotton, sugarcane and soya. Within only a few decades, the state of Maharashtra became the first cotton producer in India. Almost all cotton cultivated within this state (97% according to the census – Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, 2011) is not irrigated and yields are among the lowest of cotton yields in India. The area under food grain, in contrast, has declined considerably, which has important implications for food security of local population (Rukmani & Manjula, 2009).


                     Acharya (2006) characterizes Maharashtra cotton production as a sector with relevant shortcomings that include market instability and the lack of transportation systems and market information. On the other hand, Maharashtra farmers are facing increasing difficulties to access credit sources. Over the last years, and following a national trend, credit institutions have been restricting their operations in rural areas. Unsatisfied demand for rural credit has thus been increasing (Golait, 2007; Sahu & Rajasekhar, 2005; Sidhu, Vatta, & Kaur, 2008), leading to a growth in informal credit sources. The launching of new agricultural technologies, not only the GM varieties, but also the introduction of new hybrid crop varieties that require costly productive inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides), has led input suppliers to become the lenders of the new era.

Financial costs have become an important burden for farmers who face increasing interest rates. The burden is especially unbearable when crops do not yield reasonable returns on investments. This situation can result in farmer suicides in bad crop years, a phenomena that has been growing over the past decade and that has strongly affected cotton producers. Maharashtra agricultural sector, that faces serious threats to its economic sustainability, has registered the highest number of farmer suicides among cotton producers (Behere & Behere, 2008; Mishra, 2008; Viswanathan & Lalitha, 2010).

This article investigates the role of social capital as an instrument to improve the efficiency and productivity and thus the economic viability of India’s smallholder agriculture. This is a very interesting research topic, given the magnitude of social, institutional, economic and technical constraints faced by this category of farmers who have trouble increasing conventional input use such as land, capital, and labor. In such context, social capital may enhance agricultural production where other conventional inputs are hard to improve.

Our empirical analysis is based on a farm-level survey that was conducted from January to March 2012, in the Wardha District, Maharashtra, India. It is estimated that more than three million families who are spread over 22 thousand villages of Maharashtra, depend upon cotton cultivation. The World Census of Agriculture (Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, 2011) categorizes Maharashtra agricultural holdings into four size categories: marginal (with 52.4% of the Maharashtra farms), small (30.3%), semi-medium (13.5%) and large (0.3%). The Wardha district, one of the main Maharashtra cotton producing districts, represents 5% of total Maharashtra cotton area and 3.5% of its cotton production. Wardha district cotton yields are considerably below the state average (Department of Agriculture, State of Maharashtra, 2013). Our survey focuses on the small and marginal farms, representing the majority of the area’s farming population. A total of eight villages in the District (Zadgaon, Shivanphal, Kosurla, Nagazari, Madani, Malakapur, Jamani, Muradgaon and Karanji) with similar social and agronomic conditions were chosen. The survey was administered to 250 small-holder Bt cotton farmers.

Data were collected on farms’ input use, including land use (in acres), crop-specific inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and pesticides (in physical and monetary units), and labor (in monetary units). We further collected data on total output produced (both in physical and monetary units). Data to quantify social capital were also elicited. As noted above, there is currently considerable debate over the appropriate measures to define social capital. Research in social capital has been criticized because of the considerable heterogeneity that exists across different alternative definitions, as well as the measurement difficulties (Schafft & Brown, 2003). In spite of this, various definitions have proliferated in the scientific literature during the recent years.


                     Ha et al. (2004) consider social capital as integrated by four different components: associational activity, social relations (information sharing), trust and norms of reciprocity, and examine the contribution of these components to the production process. Our social capital questionnaire is designed based upon the work by Ha et al. (2004, 2006) and the World Bank’s Social Capital Questionnaire (Krishna & Shrader, 1999). The questions are however adapted to suit the specific framework of analysis. The context-specific nature of social capital has been emphasized by previous literature (Claridge, 2004). Faculty from the College of Rural Services, Wardha and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbay, provided very useful advice on the adaptation of the survey to the area characteristics.

                      A total of 25 questions were introduced in our survey to capture information on associational engagement, information sharing, trust and reciprocity and collective production activities (see Appendix A). Collective production activities imply undertaking collective actions such as labor force sharing, practicing collective soil or water conservation activities, and are considered by the College of Rural Services, Wardha and the Tata Institute faculty as a very (if not the most) important factor in improving production performance in the area studied.

A principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on the social capital variables measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, with increasing score values denoting higher levels of social capital. PCA allows to objectively extract relevant information and permits a dimensional reduction. PCA reveals three main underlying structures: collective production (CP) activities, information sharing (IS) and trust and mutuality (TM). The component CP summarizes, into a single variable, the information on farmers’ degree of cooperation in production activities (collective input acquisition, share of labor force, collective soil and/or water conservation, etc.). IS represents the capacity of farmers to find, generate and share valuable technical information on cotton production. TM, on the other hand, represents mutual support, cooperation and volunteership in the development of community activities. Only the variables with a significant loading in each of the three components are retained for the analysis (a total of 14 variables). The sum of the score points for each of these variables is used to quantify the social capital variable.

Seven variables are defined to conduct our analysis. These include cotton production measured in quintals (y); cotton area in acres (x
                     1); seed costs in rupees (x
                     2); fertilizer costs in rupees (x
                     3), which comprise manure and fertilizers; pesticides (x
                     4) in rupees; and total labor costs

                     5) in rupees. The social capital variable is represented by x
                     6 and measured in score points. Summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis are presented in Table 1
                     . Our sample farms produce, on average, 15 quintals of cotton on 2.9 acres that are usually owned by sample farmers. Around 1.6 acres are irrigated, mainly through bore-dug wells. The average income obtained per quintal is slightly below 4100 rupees. Among production costs, labor costs are the most relevant, followed by fertilizer, seeds and pesticides. The low cost of pesticides relative to other costs is not surprising given the Bt cotton variety planted by our sample farms. The average per quintal net income is around 1250 rupees. Farm income represents almost 80% of the income obtained by sample households. While sample farms rarely own farm machinery, the tenure of bullocks is more common (around 54% of sample farms). Around 60% of sample farms sell their products to ginning mills. The rest is sold to private agents and the Cotton Marketing Federation (18% and 12% of the sales, respectively). The average social capital score is 68, being 140 the maximum score.

Results derived from the primal approach to efficiency measurement imply relatively poor performance of sample farms. The average efficiency score is on the order of 64%, suggesting ample scope to reduce input use, while keeping cotton production unaltered. The distribution of efficiency scores is presented in Table 2
                     , and suggests a bimodal distribution with most farms displaying efficiency scores between 0.5 and 0.8 and above 0.9. The dispersion graph that shows the relationship between social capital and efficiency ratings suggests a positive link between the two (Fig. 1
                     ). Higher levels of social capital thus seem to bring higher performance levels. This is confirmed below through the derivation of social capital shadow prices and the Luenberger productivity indicator and its decomposition into its technical change and efficiency change components.

Shadow prices are derived as a method to assign a value to the non-marketed social capital in terms of its contribution to production efficiency. These are drawn from the dual representation of the directional distance function as described in the methodological section. While this representation is differentiable for non-efficient units, it is not differentiable for extreme efficient units. The directional derivative is used in the latter case. By assuming that the cotton price is equal to its shadow price, the absolute shadow prices of productive inputs are derived. Results are offered in Table 3
                      and can be used to evaluate the relative importance of the inputs used. The average shadow price of land is close to 9576 rupees per acre for the group of inefficient farms. In other words, an additional unit of land (acre) requires the output value to be increased by 9576 rupees for efficiency levels to be maintained constant. For the group of efficient farms, the land shadow price ranges from 1867 to 15,016 rupees per acre. Social capital shadow values for inefficient farms are around 507 rupees per score point. The range for efficient farms is between 169 and 569. Hence, an additional score point of social capital requires the output to be increased by around 507 rupees if efficiency levels are to be maintained constant. Social capital represents the second most valuable input after land, which is compatible with the hypothesis that social capital can play a key role in the production process. The dispersion graph describing the relationship between social capital and the social capital shadow price (Fig. 2
                     ) is compatible with diminishing returns to social capital. This may imply the need to better instrumentalize social links, so as to optimize returns from collective action.

In order to get a different perspective on the relevance of social capital for cotton production in rural India, our sample is split into two sub-samples, corresponding to farms with social capital values above the median (group A) and the below the median (group B). The Luenberger productivity indicator is computed to compare the two technologies. Productivity of group A farms is 12% higher than productivity of group B (Table 4
                     ). This increase in productivity is mainly attributable to higher efficiency ratings displayed by group A farms. According to Simar and Zelenyuk (2006) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, group A and B efficiency ratings come from different statistical distributions (see Table 5
                     ). The Luenberger productivity indicator decomposition also shows that an investment in social capital by group B farms, will involve a 2% increase in productivity, resulting from technical change. While it should be acknowledged that group A and B farms not only differ in social capital, but also in other inputs and that these differences may also be explaining differences in efficiency and productivity between the two groups, our results document significant links between farm technical performance and social capital in Maharashtra, India.

While an active agricultural input rental market could help small-scale farms to access inputs that cannot afford to purchase such as agricultural machinery or bullocks, deficient market structures constitute one of the strongest constraints faced by our sample farms. Further, other inputs are difficult to acquire through rental agreements. This is the case of water leasing, which requires negotiating a passage for water channels and management of water flows, all of which are difficult to undertake through rental agreements (Agarwal, 2010). As a result, cooperation in the procurement of different productive inputs leads to more efficient operation of sample farms. This is confirmed by our results. Collective farm activity can range from joint investment in inputs such as agricultural machinery, to land pooling and joint cultivation by small owners, or even joint land acquisition through purchase or lease. Joint investment by small farmers with contiguous plots can provide a solution to input underuse. Moreover, through labor sharing, farmers overcome the problem of a lack of agricultural labor during peak seasons. This especially benefits small farmers who are unable to compete for extra labor during intensive-work seasons (Agarwal, 2010).

Our results are thus compatible with the argument that Indian small-holder farmers use social capital as a means to save transaction costs by reducing information and search costs and by substituting for poor market institutions. Potential gains of group farming to bring greater productive efficiency are proved in a number of empirical studies that show that small-scale, dispersed and unorganized producers gain from collective action (Johnson & Berdegue, 2004). Our results are compatible with those of Narayan and Pritchett (1999) and Robison et al. (2000) who find a positive association between social capital and microeconomic performance. They are also compatible with other aggregate studies showing the influence of social capital on economic growth (Casey & Christ, 2005; Whiteley, 2000).

Under the premise that biotechnology can foster economic growth and ensure food security, the Indian government has devoted, since the 1980s, substantial public spending to its promotion. However, by pointing at the constraints that limit access to biotechnology, significant voices have raised doubts about its developmental impacts (Acharya, 2006; DeJanvry & Saudolet, 2000, 2002; FAO, 2004, Lipton, 2007; Qaim & DeJanvry, 2003). These constraints include inefficient infrastructures and marketing systems, excessive price and lack of credit. In contrast to biotechnological innovations that usually require a top-down approach in which the government and/or the industry have a key role, bottom-up social innovation can increase social capital stocks. The role of civil society in shaping social capital explains its ability to adapt to its specific context. Further, social capital can usually be acquired without monetary payments. Both the context-specific and cost-free nature of social capital make it especially useful as a development tool. Our empirical results show the role of social capital in improving cotton farms efficiency and productivity. In this regard, Indian authorities should pay further attention to promote social capital formation.

Bonding ties with the local community probably constitute the only type of social capital to which poor farmers have access to. Poor communities, however, may lack the material and social resources for bridging such horizontal ties. Social capital has also a vertical dimension related to the forge of connection with political institutions to ensure participation in policy making (Bebbington, 1999; Fox, 1996; Heller, 1996). A key task for policy makers is to ensure that poor rural communities not only reach out, but also scale up. In support of this objective, several recommendations follow. Policymakers should identify and mobilize local social capital. In this regard, connecting groups of poor people with efficient and reliable local entities or local public services, can bring empowerment to those facing difficulties and strengthen social capital. Forging alliances of poor groups with individuals that occupy positions of power (Brown & Fox, 1998) can scale social capital up. Another social capital enhancement strategy involves promoting a reliable institutional framework with decentralized governance and participatory political institutions that recognize, legitimate and provide the rights to groups, so that they can represent poor communities’ political interests (Prakash, 2002). In short, while social capital in poor rural communities is likely to be forged mainly by means of a bottom-up approach, political institutions can help by providing a better framework for its development.

Several research articles aim at disentangling the impact of social capital on economic performance. While there is an open debate on the characterization of social capital in economic analyses, either as a public or private good, we allow for the ability of producers to manage social capital, in order to produce the maximum feasible output. We are especially interested in studying poor rural communities, where sustainable economic development claims for promotion of productivity and output growth, and where increasing the use conventional (and expensive) inputs such as land, capital or labor is difficult, given the economic restrictions faced by farmers. We study production characteristics of a sample of small Maharashtra farms in India. Building efficiency is a first step toward achieving sustainability. Technical efficiency is a prerequisite for economic efficiency, which in turn ensures the economic sustainability of a firm. This article shows relatively poor technical performance of our sample farms, which could reduce input use by 36%, leaving output levels unaltered. Efficiency ratings are positively correlated with social capital levels. Investment in social capital further implies an increase in productivity resulting from technical change. Productivity levels of farms that are more intensive in social capital are thus higher than the productivity levels of social capital-poor farms.

Shadow prices suggest that social capital contribution to production efficiency is the second most relevant after land. Average shadow prices are on the order of 507 rupees per score point, considerably below the land shadow price, but considerably above the shadow price of expenses in seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and labor. Our work makes a relevant contribution to the literature, given the scarcity of research on the shadow values of social capital. In short, sample farms can improve their performance by means of undertaking collective production activities such as collective input acquisition, collective soil and water conservation, and share of labor force. This will not only increase the amount of output obtained for the same level of inputs, but will also increase the economic viability of sample farms.

Evidence is also found in favor of decreasing returns to social capital, which might be pointing toward the need to increase the quality of this capital. The determinants of social capital are numerous and varied. Consensus regarding definition of these determinants is poor. While some analyses advocate that social capital built up implies centuries of cultural evolution (Putnam, 1993), others postulate that social capital can be created and enhanced in the short term (Brown & Ashman, 1996; Fox, 1994; Petersen, 2002). Schmid (2000) and Dekker and Uslaner (2001) see social capital as the by-product of other activities resulting in dynamic changes. This is compatible with Soubeyran and Weber (2002) vision that any social interaction creates (or changes) social capital. These authors advocate that social capital can thus be created in the short-term and social exchanges are key to this social capital built-up.

Along these lines of thought, recent research has studied how social capital benefits can be maximized through participatory mechanisms that involve social interaction (Claridge, 2004). Pelling (1998) theorizes that participatory methods could strengthen social capital in host communities. Brown and Ashman (1996) postulate that social capital can be generated by active participation in problem solving and project implementation by NGOs or other organizations. Success or failure of participatory mechanisms depends crucially on the context, which should be carefully considered in project design. In developing rural economies, traditional social networks are usually key determinants of the social capital structure. Other issues such as time availability, access to information, political society and structure, and satisfaction shall also be considered. Political institutions can facilitate social capital built up by providing an adequate framework for its development.

Further extensions of this work shall consider how social capital can be improved in the area of study so as to obtain higher productive and economic benefits from it. It would also be interesting to compare our results with those derived from a parametric model. Another interesting area for future research would be the derivation of input-specific performance scores along the lines of Sáez-Fernández, Picazo-Tadeo, and Llorca-Rodríguez (2012), or Beltrán-Esteve (2013), which would allow assessing whether the effect of social capital on efficiency is different across different inputs.
