                  Pouring hot water from a kettle into a cup may prove a hazardous task, especially for the elderly or the visually-impaired. Individuals with deteriorating eyesight may endanger their hands by performing this task with both hands, relaying on tactilo-kinesthetic feedback (TKF). Auditory feedback (AF) may allow them to perform the task singlehandedly, thereby reducing the risk for injury. However since relying on an AF is not intuitive and requires practice, we aimed to determine if AF supplied during the task of pouring water can be used naturally as visual feedback (VF) following practice. For this purpose, we quantified, in young healthy sighted subjects (n = 20), the performance and kinematics of pouring water in the presence of three isolated feedbacks: visual, tactilo-kinesthetic, or auditory. There were no significant differences between the weights of spilled water in the AF condition compared to the TKF condition in the first, fifth or thirteenth trials. The subjectively-reported difficulty levels of using the TKF and the AF were significantly reduced between the first and thirteenth trials for both TKF (p = 0.01) and AF (p = 0.001). Trunk rotation during the first trial using the TKF was significantly lower than the trunk rotation while using VF. Also, shoulder adduction during the first trial using the TKF was significantly higher than the shoulder adduction while using the VF. During the AF trials, the median travel distance of the tip of the kettle was significantly reduced in the first trials so that in the thirtieth trial it did not differ significantly from the median travel distance during the thirtieth trial using TKF and VF. The maximal velocity of the tip of the kettle was constant for each of the feedback conditions but was higher in 10 cm s−1 using VF than TKF, which was higher in 10 cm s−1 from using AF. The smoothness of movement of the TKF and AF conditions, expressed by the normalized jerk score (NJSM), was one and two orders of magnitude higher from the VF, respectively. The median NJSM then decreased significantly by the fifth trial. Monitoring in-house activity via motion capture and classification of movements, i.e. liquid pouring, can assist with daily activities via AF. As a built-in feature in a smart home, this task-specific AF may prevent burn injuries of the visually-impaired.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Pouring hot water from a kettle into a cup may prove a hazardous task, especially for the elderly or the visually-impaired. Most burn injuries in the elderly occur in the kitchen (Redlick et al., 2002), the majority of which occur due to accidental spillage of hot water. A study over a 12-month follow-up period among older adults with age-related macular degeneration reported that burns or scalds accounted for 9% of non-fall-related injuries (Wood et al., 2011).

Although several assistive devices, aimed to increase the safety of liquid pouring exist, e.g. a mechanical kettle tipper, they fail to provide a solution for this problem since they are usually limited to shape-specific kettles and the user is embarrassed to use them, saying they feel like crutches. While most of the hot water related injuries might not be severe enough for the individual to seek medical assistance, they might have an impact on the perceived difficulty in daily activities.

While blind individuals may adopt strategies for preventing burns by placing the cup on the counter and pouring the water without holding the cup with the opposite hand, individuals with deteriorating eyesight, may be prone to retain their accustomed daily behavior of pouring hot water while the second hand is holding the cup. For these visually impaired individuals, the task of pouring hot water from a kettle to a cup is therefore controlled with both hands, relaying on tactilo-kinesthetic feedback (TKF) of the upper limbs. The proximity of the hot water poured by one hand to the hand holding the cup, endanger the later for burns. An in-house technology providing auditory feedback (AF) indication that the kettle is safely above the cup, may allow the individual to successfully pour the water safely, either singlehandedly or by using both hands, thereby preventing burn injury.

Current technology allows for smart homes equipped with cameras and various sensors, that can detect falls, bed/chair occupancy, gestures (Choi et al., 2014), recognize activities (Krishnan and Cook, 2014) and more, e.g. the GiraffPlus project (Palumbo et al., 2014). The smart home will ultimately contribute to a higher occupational performance, satisfaction and higher functional independence of persons with disabilities and elderly people (Ocepek et al., 2013). As the prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment and blindness continues to grow (Stevens et al., 2013), so does the need for in-house or in-office solutions for safety. Among the plentiful potential benefits of the smart house, preventing burn injuries of the visually-impaired by using AF has yet to be explored. The rational for sensory substitution via AF is derived from researches depicting its role in motor learning. A recent study (Oscari et al., 2012) supports the aforementioned rational by showing that AF is readily incorporated into brain learning networks in the absence of visual feedback (VF). Also, it has been concluded in a recent review (Sigrist et al., 2013) that AF may reallocate perceptual and cognitive workload, as well as reduce distraction, since it does not require a focus of attention. However, since relying on an AF, e.g. for indicating distance from a rear obstacle when reversing a car, is not intuitive and requires practice, we aimed to determine if AF supplied during the task of pouring water can be used naturally as VF following practice. For this purpose we quantified, in a small sample of young healthy sighted subjects, the performance and kinematics of pouring water from a kettle into a cup in the presence of three isolated feedbacks: auditory, tactilo-kinesthetic, or visual.

@&#METHODS@&#

Twenty healthy right-handed subjects (2 males and 18 females; mean ± SD for age of 27.6 ± 3.3 years) participated in this study. Participants were recruited through personal contact and snowball sampling. The study was approved by the Occupational Therapy Department Ethics Committee at Tel Aviv University. Exclusion criteria were cognitive or upper body orthopedic impairments. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing.

Eleven passive-reflective spherical markers were placed on the right upper arm and forearm of each subject. Markers were placed at the following bony landmarks: spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebrae, deepest point of incisura jugularis, xiphoid process of the sternum, left and right acromio-clavicular joints, right mid-clavicle, right greater tubercle of humerus, right lateral elbow epicondyle, right upper arm between the elbow and the shoulder markers, right radial styloid, right ulnar styloid. The following segments were determined: trunk, right upper arm, right forearm. Trunk rotation was computed in relation to the lab coordinate system, shoulder flexion and adduction were computed for the upper arm in relation to the trunk, and elbow flexion was computed for the forearm in relation to the upper arm. Also, four markers were located on a standard electric water kettle (Fig. 1
                        ). A six-camera motion capture system (Qualisys Medical AB, Sweden) was used to stream the markers 3D coordinates in real time at a sampling rate of 100 Hz, and automatically identify the markers placed on the kettle. Real-time output was streamed to LabView software (V12, National Instruments, USA), where the 4 markers placed on the 6DOF kettle were recognized and the coordinates of a fifth virtual marker of the tip of the kettle (the endpoint), were calculated in real-time. In order to produce the auditory signal, the LabView code was used to calculate the position of the tip of the kettle in regard to the rim of the cup, set on the table in a constant position. Preliminary attempts of pouring water from the kettle at different locations above the cup, at different velocities were performed to determine the boundaries of a “safety volume”, in which the probability for water spilling is minimal (Fig. 1, radius of cup was 4.2 cm, “safety volume” of 55.4 cm3). These trial-and-error attempts were performed while monitoring the location of the tip of the kettle in relation to the upper rim of the cup during water pouring. The attempts were conducted while pouring at slow, normal and fast tilting velocities. The boundaries of the location of the tip, in those trials where water did not spill, were chosen as the “safety volume”; however, it should be noted that the selected volume was chosen as a mean for studying the aforementioned research questions, and not for validating a safety protocol for pouring hot liquids.

When the virtual marker located at the tip of the kettle entered these boundaries, a clearly audible 300 Hz beeping sound was activated and held for as long as the tip was inside the “safety volume”.

Calibration of the motion capture system was performed according to the guidelines of the manufacturer, using an L-shaped construction placed at a constant location on the table and rotating a wand for 20 s in the captured volume. Kinematics of body movement and tip of the kettle were analyzed for consecutive trials and between the three different feedback conditions, detailed below.

Each subject started each trial in a standing position with the right hand holding the handle of the lightweight kettle, set on a marked position on a table, 42 cm from the cup. Both kettle and cup were placed 13 cm far from the edge of the table. The height of the table was adjusted to the pelvic level of each subject and the subject stood at a midpoint between the kettle and the cup. The subject was instructed to pick up the kettle, pour its content (200 ml water at room-temperature) into a cup (capacity of the cup: 330 ml) and place the kettle back on the table. Each subject repeated this activity 13 times blindfolded with an opaque cloth and touching the handle of the cup with the free left hand (TKF condition), then 13 times blindfolded with the AF activated when the kettle is at the safe location above the cup (AF condition), and finally, 3 times with only VF (control condition). This was a randomized AB/BA design where 10 subjects first performed the task with the TKF and then with the AF and 10 subjects performed the reversed order. The 3 trials with the VF were always last. Each subject then filled a visual analog difficulty scale regarding the difficulty level (ranging from ‘1’ = very easy, to ‘5’ = very difficult) of pouring water on the first and thirteenth trials using the AF or TKF conditions.

Analyses were performed on the first, fifth, and thirteenth trials of using the TKF and AF. All three trials of the VF were analyzed. Motion data were processed using Visual 3D (C-Motion, Germantown, MD, USA). Raw kinematic data were filtered using a moving average filter of 9 frames. The start time (t
                        1) of each trial was defined as the point in time when the changes in the 3D coordinates of the markers placed on the kettle were visible, indicating that the kettle was no longer static on the table. The end time (t
                        2) of each trial was defined as the time when the rear marker placed on the base of the kettle began descending following the act of pouring the water into the cup. In trials where the markers were not visible for one or more of the anatomical segments, the related joint kinematics were discarded in the statistical analysis (no more than five discarded trials in each time point). The movement time was registered in seconds. Range of movement of the trunk, with respect to the lab, and the shoulder and elbow, with respect to the torso and upper arm, respectfully, were computed. Additionally, the following parameters were extracted from the 3D coordinates of the tip of the kettle: travel distance [cm], maximal velocity of the tip of the kettle [cm s−1], and the normalized jerk score movement (NJSM) to quantify the smoothness of the movement, calculated by (Chang et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2014):

Last, the amount of spilled water was quantified by absorbing the spilled water with a paper towel, weighted before each trial on a 0.1 g sensitive scale and then reweighted following the trial, when all water was absorbed.

All data are presented as medians (interquartile range, IQR). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (Version 21, IBM SPSS statistics). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of distribution of continuous variables. Since most of the variables were not normally distributed, we performed the Mann–Whitney U test to confirm that there were no differences between the group who began with the AF and the group who began with the TKF. Comparison between the aforementioned parameters between the three feedback conditions was performed using the Friedman's two way analysis of variance by ranks. Post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests was conducted and pairwise comparisons were performed separately for the first analyzed trial of each feedback condition, the second and the third. Also, within each feedback, the differences between the first, fifth, and thirteenth trials were analyzed. The visual analog difficulty scale results between the AF and the TKF and between the first and thirteenth trials of each of the two conditions were compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks. Results were considered statistically significant differences if p < 0.05 and a Bonferroni adjustment was also included in post hoc comparisons, resulting in a significance level set at p < 0.017.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We present herein detailed results of two different analyses: first, intra-condition results, where motor learning can be observed by improved performance; second, inter-condition results where the water pouring using AF can be compared to water pouring using either TKF or VF. As will be detailed below, motor learning was observed by reduced water spilling, movement time, travel distance and NJSM between the first and fifth trials in both AF and TKF. Also, although performing the task with AF was reported by the subjects as more difficult compare to using TKF or VF, the range of motion of the trunk, shoulder and elbow, were similar between the AF condition and both VF and TKF conditions.


                        Intra-condition analysis: No water was spilled using the VF. The weight of spilled water was significantly reduced between the first trial and the thirteenth trial of the AF (p = 0.012) but it was not significantly reduced for the TKF (p = 0.028).


                        Inter-condition analysis: There were no significant differences between the weights of spilled water in the AF condition compared to the TKF condition in the first, fifth or thirteenth trials. Specifically, in the first trial, five subjects spilled water using the TKF and seven subjects spilled water using the AF. The total weights of spilled water in the first trial were 463.9 g and 408.1 g for the TKF and AF, respectively. It should be noted that during this initial trial, two of the subjects using the TKF missed the cup entirely and poured the 200 g contents of the kettle on the table. This occurred only in the first trial. In the fifth trial, no water was spilled using the TKF and 3 subjects spilled a total of 49.7 g water using the AF. No water was spilled during the thirteenth trial of both TKF and AF.

Since the only instruction for performing the trial with the TKF was to place the left hand on the handle of the cup, several subjects developed a strategy where they extended the fingers of their left hand, translated the kettle so that it would touch the left hand fingers, thereby confirming the location of the kettle in respect to the cup, and then continued by pouring the water on their fingertips, placed above the cup.

The subjectively-reported difficulty levels of using the TKF and the AF are depicted in Fig. 2
                        .


                        Intra-condition analysis: The reported difficulty levels were significantly reduced between the first and thirteenth trials for both TKF (p = 0.01) and AF (p = 0.001).


                        Inter-condition analysis: The subjects reported that using the AF was more difficult than using the TKF, however the reported difficulty level in the thirteenth trial with the AF did not differ from that reported difficulty level of the first trial with the TKF.

The range of motion of the trunk, shoulder and elbow for each condition and trial are reported in Table 1
                        .


                        Intra-condition analysis: There were no significant differences between the first, fifth, and thirteenth trials.


                        Inter-condition analysis: Trunk rotation during the first trial using the TKF was significantly lower than the trunk rotation while using the VF. Also, shoulder adduction during the first trial using the TKF was significantly higher than the shoulder adduction while using the VF. There were no significant differences in shoulder and elbow ranges of flexion between the three feedback conditions.

The median movement time using VF was approximately 4 s for all three trials (Table 2
                        ). The median movement time using the TKF for the first trial was approximately 11s and was reduced to approximately 6.5 s from the fifth trial. When first using the AF, the median movement time was approximately 33 s and decreased to 14 s and then to 11 s on the fifth and thirtieth trials, respectively (Table 2), so that after thirteen trials, the time to complete the task using the AF was two-fold the time needed to complete the task using the TKF.

The median travel distance of the tip of the kettle was approximately 72 cm when using the VF (Table 2). The median travel distance of the tip of the kettle was 10 cm higher for the first trial using the TKF, but did not differ significantly from the median travel distance during the VF trials from the fifth trial. During the AF trials, the median travel distance of the tip of the kettle was significantly reduced in the first trials so that in the thirtieth trial it did not differ significantly from the median travel distance during the thirtieth trial using TKF and VF (Table 2).

The maximal velocity of the tip of the kettle was constant for each of the feedback conditions. The median velocities were approximately 55 cm s−1, 45 cm s−1, and 35 cm s−1 for the VF, TKF, and AF, respectively (Table 2).

The median NJSM was constant for the VF at approximately 20. During the first trial of the TKF and AF conditions, the NJSM were approximately 2-fold to 4-fold higher, respectively, compared to the fifth and thirteenth trials. The median NJSM then decreased significantly by the fifth trial but were still 3.5-fold and 11-fold higher than the NJSM during the VF condition (Table 2).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this study, a motion capture system was utilized for administrating accurate AF provided when the tip of a kettle enters a safety volume above the cup (Fig. 1). We believe that this monitor-alert system could be configured with less sophisticated cameras installed at the home of the visually-impaired. This preliminary study allowed us to show the feasibility of using an AF as a sensory substitution for VF during a goal-directed movement of the upper extremity.

Motor learning was observed by the reduced water spilling, movement time, travel distance and NJSM (smoother movement) between the first and fifth trials in both AF and TKF (Table 2). Since there were no significant differences in all the measured parameters between the fifth and thirteenth trials of both TKF and AF, it can be concluded that the process of learning to use non-visual substitution feedback was very quick (Tables 1 and 2), requiring no more than five trials. Our findings are in good agreement with the findings of Levy-Tzedek et al. (Levy-Tzedek et al., 2012) who requested blindfolded sighted participants to reach quickly and accurately to targets on a screen using auditory feedback.

The first trial using the TKF was characterized by small trunk rotation and high shoulder adduction ranges compared to using VF. However these differences were not found in the fifth and thirtieth trials. Since arm movements often occur simultaneously with trunk rotations, the trajectory of movement depends on their interaction. It was well established that Coriolis torques are produced during trunk rotation and the brain uses these torques to control the smoothness and accuracy of the movement of the arm (Simoneau et al., 2013). It was reported that trunk rotation could cause Coriolis torques to be almost six times larger than those without trunk rotation (Bortolami et al., 2008). Also, self-generated Coriolis forces as small as 0.2 g greatly deflect movement trajectories and endpoints (Pigeon et al., 2003). In this study, we observed that the constrained trunk movement compensated by a higher shoulder adduction range during the first trial with the TKF resulted in a longer trajectory (high travel distance) of the tip of the kettle, which was reduced to normal in the fifth and thirteenth trials (Table 2). We therefore assume that the longer kettle trajectory in the first TKF trial was caused by lower Coriolis torques. Once the subjects employed a larger trunk rotation in the fifth and thirteenth trials with the TKF and reduced shoulder adduction the optimal kettle trajectory was achieved, i.e. trajectory that does not differ from the one measured with the control VF condition (Table 2).

Using the AF proved to be a challenging task in the first trial, indicated by subjective difficulty reports of the subjects (Fig. 2), as well as the long time for completion, long travel distance, and high NJSM. However, the range of motion of the trunk, shoulder and elbow, were similar between the AF feedback condition and both VF and TKF conditions (Table 1). This similarity suggests that the motor plan of the subjects, skilled in the water-pouring task, was utilized when using the AF, however since the target was hidden, the velocity was greatly reduced (Table 2), thereby decreasing the smoothness of the movement (Table 2). Since there was no feedback regarding the location of the cup when the AF was silent, i.e. the tip of the kettle was not in the safety volume above the cup (Fig. 1), the subjects scanned the air using the kettle, prolonging the movement time and travel distance of the tip of the kettle. In a similar real life scenario, however, where the AF would be provided for the visually-impaired individual, it is expected that the person will start by translating the hot-water kettle, without tilting it, with one hand towards the cup, held by the other hand. Once the kettle is located at the proximity of the cup, the person can then choose to continue in one of the following manners, depending on his or her confidence level or habit: either remove the second hand from the cup and use the AF to make sure the water are poured directly into the cup, or keep the cup held in the second hand and only pour water when the AF is heard. The first choice is safer, of course, eliminating the risk of injury to the hand holding the cup and guiding the subject to pour the water directly into the cup. The second option is a combination of both TKF and AF and would likely be more effective in terms of movement time and kettle trajectory. Also, for most individuals, pouring hot water using both hands is a habit. The AF in this case may prove useful in reducing the risk for hot water burn in this case. A limitation of this study is that the effect of the combination of TKF and AF on the kinematics of pouring of water into the cup was not quantified. The effects of this kind of auditory-haptic information on pouring water into a cup should be studied in healthy subjects and the visually-impaired both in the laboratory and in real house conditions. Also, for safety reasons, water at room-temperature was used. However, to truly simulate real-life scenario, it would be necessary to perform the trials using hot water. We believe that having used water at room-temperature may have influenced the techniques of water pouring, particularly with the TKF condition, where several subjects let the water run through their fingers placed above the cup to verify that the water is pouring into the cup. Also, since kinematic viscosity of water decreases when its temperature is increased, hot water flows faster than room-temperature water. Therefore, we cannot expect that the kinematics of the kettle would have been identical with hot water.

It has been previously noted (Rossetti et al., 1994) that if the target (in this case, the cup) is viewed by the subject immediately prior to the movement, then the accuracy of the movement is significantly higher compared to that achieved when a delay is set between target presentation and movement. In this study, the subjects were allowed to take the blindfold off between trials and the next trial was immediately started when the blindfold was donned.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Monitoring in-house activity via motion capture and classification of movements, i.e. liquid pouring, can assist with daily activities via AF. As a built-in feature in a smart home, this task-specific AF may prevent burn injuries of the visually-impaired.
