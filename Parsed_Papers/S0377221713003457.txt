@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  In the last few years, according to the evolution of financial markets and the enforcement of international supervisory requirements, an increasing interest has been devoted to risk integration. The original focus on individual risk estimation has been replaced by the growing prominence of top-down and bottom-up risk integration perspectives. Following this latter way, we bring together different approaches developed in the recent literature elaborating a general model to assess banking solvency in both the long-run (economic capital) as well as in the short period (liquidity mismatching). We consider banking capability to face credit, interest rate and liquidity risks associated to macro-economic shocks affecting both assets and liabilities. Following the perspective of commercial banks, we concentrate on information available in the risk management practice to propose an easy to implement statistical framework. We put in place this framework estimating its scenario generation parameters on Italian macro-economic time series from 1990 to 2009. Once applied to a stylized commercial bank, we compare the results of our approach to regulatory capital requirements. We emphasize the need for policy makers as well as risk managers, to take into account the entire balance sheet structure to assess banking solvency.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

At the beginning of the last decade, the Northern Rock bank had a business which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding. At the same time, the bank was active in re-selling these mortgages on international capital markets. In August 2007, when the global demand from investors for mortgages was falling away, the lack of money raised through capital markets meant that Northern Rock became unable to repay loans from the money market. The bank received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, but was unable to raise from the money market. This led to panic among individual depositors who feared that their savings might not be available. The result was a bank run. Depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same.

In order to avoid the above described issue, banks are required to have an adequate capital structure. According to Kretzschmar et al. (2010), banking economic capital can be defined as the amount of resources that a financial institution requires in order to operate as a solvent concern at a specified confidence level over a given time horizon. Usually, the economic capital is set equal to a percentile of the bank loss distribution (value at risk, VaR) or the expected value of losses exceeding a given threshold of the same distribution (expected shortfall, ES). At the same time we emphasize that an adequate liquidity structure is required to ensure banking solvency. For this reason we distinguish between a long run banking solvency (i.e., economic capital) and the short term capability to face liquidity issues (i.e., liquidity mismatching).

Aiming to compute the economic capital for regulatory issues, banks usually adopt a modular approach. In the modular approach the loss distribution due to credit risk, market risk, operational risk and so on, are computed individually. The economic capital is obtained as a sum of independent risk measures. Thus, considering that a portfolio is exposed to different imperfectly correlated risks, a question arises: is the sum of capital buffers set against these risks smaller than the sum of individual risks? Breuer et al. (2010) discuss this problem in the context of market and credit risk assessment for the banking and trading book. They show that in some cases the risk measure of the total portfolio can be higher than the sum of the independent risk measures. In order to aggregate different risks, dependencies have to be considered. Thus, a key issue is to identify financial activities which are affected by the same risk factors and are subject to risks over the same holding period.

The most intuitive approach to integrate risks is to follow the top-down approach. According to this approach, a function is employed for linking the distributions of profit and losses resulting from different risk types. It is evident that some crucial assumptions are required to merge different risks into an overall economic capital measure (Rosenberg and Schuermann, 2006). The key element is the choice of the joint distribution function to be exploited to merge individual risks and to estimate parameters even in the case where there are few data.

An alternative way to integrate risks is to follow the so-called bottom-up approach. The goal pursued through this approach is to overwhelm the above described difficulties studying interactions among risk factors and evaluating their impact on the banking financial activities. The most recent literature due to Grundke (2009), Alessandri and Drehmann (2010), Drehmann et al. (2010), Grundke (2010) and Kretzschmar et al. (2010) concentrate on these mechanics showing how to integrate risks focusing on alternative specific assumptions. Following the bottom-up approach, the aim of our paper is to build a bridge between the above mentioned literature and the risk management practice. Remarking the importance of the assumptions underlying the above mentioned approaches, we consider a very general asset and liability environment where credit, interest rate and liquidity risks are jointly considered. We propose a statistical framework which enhances the most familiar risk management tools (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations, regressions, copulas and so on) allowing to consider all elements which concur to build up the economic capital. We apply this framework to a stylized commercial bank where credits are investigated at the debtor level, while liabilities are examined at an aggregated level. Focusing on cash flow grids, we emphasize the impact of asset and liability mismatching on the overall banking solvency.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the topic and in Section 3 we explain the motivation of our research. In Section 4 we describe the integrated risk modeling on which we build up the statistical framework described in Section 5. In Section 6 we apply our analysis to a stylized commercial bank. Section 7 contains concluding remarks and directions for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The credit lending is strictly linked with financial markets and the overall macro-economic environment. The need to integrate risks in order to evaluate banking solvency has been faced in the last few years moving from different perspectives. Attention has been devoted mainly to economic capital estimation, but considering the recent liquidity crisis, we cannot avoid considering, in our analysis, both the long run as well as the short term banking attitude to face its obligations. We can summarize the most important contributions in economic capital estimation distinguishing between top-down and bottom-up approaches.

In the top-down approach the idea is to start from the marginal distribution of individual risks and aggregate them through a joint distribution function. Some authors exploit elliptical distributions while others rely on copulas. The difficulties to implement the top-down approach are, on the one hand, to choose the adequate joint distribution function and, on the other, to estimate parameters with limited availability of loss data. Furthermore, as is evident from Kuritzkes et al. (2002), Dimakos and Aas (2004), and Aas et al. (2007) it is problematic to represent all interactions among risks through some parameters of a joint distribution function. For these reasons, in the last few years, researchers as well as practitioners devoted their attention to bottom-up approaches.

The goal pursued through the bottom-up perspective is to tackle the risk integration by modeling, at a micro-level, the interactions between macro-economic variables, risk factors and individual financial instruments. Changes in macro-economic variables can influence the value of financial instruments directly (e.g., a reduction of the gross domestic product is usually associated with an increase of default probabilities). Moreover, they can have an impact on the value of financial instruments by affecting risk factors (e.g., an increase in risk-free interest rates, due to macro-economic changes, causes a reduction of fixed rate credit fair value).


                     Grundke (2009) analyzes how the importance sampling technique can be successfully applied to integrate market and credit portfolio models. The well-known CreditMetrics framework is extended to jointly contemplate credit and interest rate risks. The effectiveness of this technique is tested through numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear portfolios. This framework is further exploited by the same author to evaluate how top-down approaches are accurate to compute integrated risk measures (Grundke, 2010). The author emphasizes that it is rather difficult to decide which is the copula function to be used, in a top-down approach, in order to catch the risk integration simulated through a bottom-up model.


                     Kretzschmar et al. (2010) implement a fully-integrated risk analysis based on the balance sheet of a composite European bank. They exploit an economic-scenario generation model which is calibrated to conditions at the end of 2007. Their results suggest that modular approaches can lead banks to be under-capitalized.

Moving from a different perspective, Drehmann et al. (2010) propose an integrated framework for stress testing purposes where banking micro-structures are investigated from an asset and liability point of view. They take into account the repricing characteristics of assets, liabilities and off balance sheet items. Thus, they assess the integrated impact of credit and interest rate risks on banking economic value and capital adequacy. Following the same perspective, Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) develop a model on book value accounting. They focus on the banking earning at risk. They show through a simulated analysis that interactions matter in assessing banking economic capital. Ignoring risk interaction leads to risk overstatement. The magnitude of the error depends on the structure of the balance sheet and on the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities.

All the above described approaches are effective in capturing some specific integration issues. In addition, they do not consider the liquidity problem which has been dramatic during the recent crisis. We emphasize the need to catch all these risks together in order to derive an overall approach where risks due to credit, interest rate, liquidity, asset and liability mismatching are jointly considered. Emphasizing the need to derive an easy to implement framework, we dedicate the next section to motivate our contribution.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

Our research aims to bring together the risk integration contributions above described and build up an effective statistical framework. In order to achieve these goals, we need to face the following issues:
                        
                           1.
                           Identify a general model to represent banking interactions.

Check available information.

Effectively represent the real-world sources of risk.

Develop an easy to implement and easy to interpret statistical framework.

Outline risk issues that policy makers and banking risk managers should take care.

In order to identify the model to be exploited for assessing banking solvency, we rely on alternative bottom-up frameworks. Kretzschmar et al. (2010) concentrate on asset value changes due to shocks in risk factors. They assume that liabilities are modeled by a matched replicating portfolio of assets. By contrast, Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) maintain that both assets and liabilities are crucial in order to compute the economic capital. In fact, they carry out their research through the profit and loss analysis which necessarily incorporates the two sides of the balance sheet. Following the same perspective Grundke (2010) models the banking loss distribution through the comparison of asset and liability present value. In our opinion, the main drawback of the first approach is not to investigate the relationship between assets and liabilities. Thus, the impact of the whole balance sheet structure is under-estimated. On the other hand, the second approach suffers from the crucial assumption to investigate only the (yearly) profit and loss. The impact of changes associated to asset and liability repricing is not considered. As pointed out by Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) 
                     the current regulatory approach to credit risk and the commonly used earning at risk approach to interest rate risk do not take changes in market valuations into account. However, if we avoid to contemplate their impact, the analysis is certainly incomplete. Grundke (2010) considers both sides of the balance sheet. He focuses on the present value of assets and liabilities, but he does not explicitly consider earnings at risk as detailed by Alessandri and Drehmann (2010). Considering that in these researches no attention is devoted to the liquidity risk, we move from the above considerations to elaborate a general model to assess banking solvency. In our model we represent repricing issues, but instead of applying them only to assets, as detailed by Kretzschmar et al. (2010), we consider both assets and liabilities. According to Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) we take into account earnings at risk. Thus, distinguishing between long run and short run solvency we incorporate the liquidity risk.

The second key issue we face in our research is the scarcity of information. All the approaches described in the literature review section rely on market driven approaches. However, the risk management practice faces market imperfections. It is difficult, for example, to directly exploit credit spreads to compute the present value of financial activities as proposed by Kretzschmar et al. (2010) and Grundke (2010). In other words, banks do not lend money only to companies with publicly traded financial instruments. Therefore, contrary to the assumptions of these researches, banks cannot rely on market credit spreads, credit default swaps and so on. The need to exploit other information arises. For this reason we exploit a scenario generation mechanics and we explicitly rely on banking internally estimated risk parameters to represent the risk process. Furthermore, the above mentioned researches do not explicitly describe the link between the internally estimated risk parameters and those necessary to run their models. When considering default probabilities, for example, it is crucial to figure out their link with (macro-economic) credit risk factors. From a practitioner point of view, it is evident the benefit to explicitly link risk parameters to risk factors. An interesting novelty of our framework is the way of modeling and assessing this relationship.

Passing to the above stated third issue regarding the representation of real-world financial environment, the above described literature assumes that the scenario generator is directly or indirectly linked to a Normal or at least elliptical environment. Grundke (2009) and Grundke (2010) rely on CreditMetrics Normal random generator. Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) draw a vector of random macroeconomic shocks and use a GVAR model. Kretzschmar et al. (2010) exploit a JLT model for default probabilities, a BK model for interest rate and so on. This perspective can be useful in order to assess the amount of resources required by a bank in a Normal setting, but it may be unsatisfactory in the case where we consider extreme events. Therefore, aiming to assess bank solvency, it is useful in our opinion not to identify and ex-ante distribution, but to rely on a scenario generator based on distributions directly fitted on (even extreme) real data.

According to the fourth key point, we start from the information available in any risk management department to build up a bottom-up statistical framework. We consider a stylized commercial bank where credits are studied at their minimum level, while liabilities are examined at an aggregated level in order to describe conditions under which the following statements hold:
                        
                           •
                           
                              Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) show that, under their assumptions, the simple sum of risk measures due to credit and interest rate is higher than the integrated measure. Thus the integration process seems to lead to a reduction of the economic capital.


                              Kretzschmar et al. (2010), maintain that the integrated economic capital, considering their hypothesis, is higher than the simple sum of individual risks.

Stressing the need to highlight potential risk sources, in line with the fifth point, we study a stylized commercial bank. We aim to figure out conditions under which banking solvency is undermined. For this reason we compare balance sheet structures with different mismatching peculiarities and we investigate both the long run (economic capital) and the short term (liquidity) solvency risks. From the perspective of policy makers and risk managers, the benefit of such a representation is to highlight risk interactions in a commercial bank. Our goal is to show that the so – called modular approach cannot be effective from both the regulatory as well as from the managerial perspectives.

In the next section we introduce our risk integration model.

Relying on the economic capital definition of Section 1, we can suppose that at time t the value of the assets and the liabilities of a bank are respectively A
                     
                        t
                      and L
                     
                        t
                     . Assuming that A
                     
                        t
                     
                     >
                     L
                     
                        t
                     , this bank is initially solvent with equity E
                     
                        t
                     
                     =
                     A
                     
                        t
                     
                     −
                     L
                     
                        t
                     . A risk manager assessing capital adequacy at time t is concerned with fluctuations in these values as well as with the capability of the bank to face liquidity issues.

As in the stress testing framework described by the EBA (2011), in our analysis, we focus on a static balance sheet with zero growth and constant business mix assumptions. Our attention is devoted to understand what happens to the present value of both assets and liabilities, in the case where scenarios different from the actual ones will take place. We concentrate on instantaneous shocked scenarios aiming to analyze both the economic capital and the liquidity distributions under different perspectives.

According to the above described environment, to ensure banking solvency with a probability (1−
                        α) over a fixed time horizon h (e.g., one year), it is required that

                        where ΔA and ΔL are the asset and liability variations due to macro-economic instantaneous shocks, while I

                         refers to the income of the period under investigation.

It is useful to remark that Kretzschmar et al. (2010), relying on the simplifying assumption that liabilities are replicated by a portfolio of assets, exploit the following inequality

                        Thus, setting ALoss
                        =−ΔA, we can express Eq. (1) as follows

                        −
                        E(ALoss)] is the so-called unexpected loss. This argument justifies setting the economic capital at the (1−
                        α)-percentile of the loss distribution. In our analysis, however, we do not exploit the assumption of Eq. (2). We compare variations of both assets and liabilities contemporaneously setting the economic capital at the (1−
                        α)-percentile of the overall loss distribution. It is evident the need to investigate how to evaluate both sides of the banking balance sheet. Thus, in what follows, we consider a bank with N assets A

                           For simplicity, hereafter, we consider assets corresponding to credits and bonds while liabilities correspond to debits. One asset corresponds to the credit (or bond) toward one debtor, while one liability corresponds to a debit.

Valuing financial instruments in the present and in the future is a significant challenge. In some cases they are marked to market, while in others they are required to be marked to model. In any case, the valuation is subject to ongoing expectations about risk factors. In order to compute the effect of risk factor fluctuations on financial instruments, we need to generate scenarios. We consider a set of macro-economic variables which can directly or indirectly affect the value of financial instruments. We denote by Z
                        
                           t

                        ) the vector of macro-economic variables. For historical data, on which we fit model parameters, t ranges from −τ to 0. For the perspective analysis, t ranges from 0 to T. We denote by Z
                        Δ
                        =(Z
                        1,Δ,…,

                           h
                         of Eq. (1), we can distinguish the following elements: net interest income, operational profits, operational losses and credit losses. Emphasizing that operational activities are beyond the scope of our analysis, we define the income as follows

                         are the coupon rates from the time t to the next repricing time. They are function of the vector of macro-economic variables Z
                        
                           t
                        . In order to compute the net interest income, we apply the above described coupon rates to the notional residual amount A
                        
                           i,ra,t
                         (where the subscript ra,t stands for residual amount at time t) and the notional residual amount L
                        
                           j,ra,t
                         at time t. We exploit the indicator functions ζ

                         to specify the coupon rate to be applied at each time t. As is evident from Eq. (5), positive interests are computed on each A
                        
                           i
                        , while negative interests are calculated on each L
                        
                           j
                        . According to Eq. (1), we consider the net interest income for the period h, which represents our holding period.

In order to catch the credit risk, we consider the default indicator ξ
                        
                           i
                         associated to each debtor i, (i
                        =1,…,
                        N). In the case where ξ
                        
                           i
                        
                        =1, debtor i defaults within the time horizon, otherwise ξ
                        
                           i
                        
                        =0. The marginal default probability Pd
                        
                           i
                        
                        =

                           i
                        
                        =1), constitutes the crucial element of the above mentioned default indicator and it becomes one of the key issues of our statistical framework. The net loss associated with the default of debtor i is ϖ
                        
                           i

                           i
                         (LGD stands for loss given default). In some models ϖ
                        
                           i
                         is assumed to be a random variable, but here, without loss of generality, we assume ϖ
                        
                           i
                         to be a constant. The portfolio credit loss (CLoss) can be represented as follows

                        =0, for the 1 (euro) notional zero coupon bond, the PV is as follows

Once specified how to compute the present value of default free financial instruments, in order to evaluate the overall value of the bank, we need to incorporate:
                           
                              •
                              Macro-economic shocks Z
                                 Δ: they impact on both interest rates (which compare on the above described pricing formula) and default probabilities (on which we rely to simulate the default indicator function ξ
                                 
                                    i

Credit losses: they are generated through the simulation of ξ

                                 Δ).

We compute ΔA and ΔL by comparing the present value of asset and liability according to:
                           
                              •

                        In order to compute banking losses, we rely on Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, concentrating on credits, we compare the default free present value of each asset (PV A

On the one hand, we figure out shocks on interest rates due to changes on the macro-economic variables. On the other hand, we generate default events through ξ

                         does not change. Thus we focus only on changes in interest rates. For each generation g, we represent the shocked present value of liabilities as follows

                         stands for (simulation g) performing net interest. In order to ease the representation, we consider only performing asset interests (without considering the nonperforming ones) and all liability interests.

According to what we stated above, we can consider the loss definition of both Kretzschmar et al. (2010) and Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) as special cases of Eq. (12). In addition, there are two main differences between Eq. (12) and the general formula of Grundke (2010). First of all, this latter author does not consider the impact of changes on profit and losses. Secondly, the mechanics on which we rely to compute integrated losses is not established on credit spreads as assumed by Grundke (2009, 2010) and Kretzschmar et al. (2010).

Once defined the integrated loss and relying on what we emphasized examining Eq. (3), we define as EC
                        
                           VaR
                         the economic capital associated to the VaR of the Loss distribution over the pre-defined holding period h at a given confidence level.
                           2
                           Following a conservative perspective, we could align with Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) computing both VaR and ES considering only positive losses (i.e., Loss
                              ⩾0). In what follows, we consider the whole loss distribution without focusing only on Loss
                              ⩾0.
                        
                        
                           2
                         In order to obtain the Loss distribution, we consider all G simulated losses. We define the VaR, at level (1−
                        α), as the smallest loss, l, such that the probability that the loss exceeds l is no larger than α

                        It is evident, however, that VaR suffers from two severe deficiencies if considered as a measure of downside risk. In fact, it is not sub-additive and it is insensitive to the size of loss beyond the pre-specified threshold level. For these reasons, in addition to EC

                        The ES is sub-additive and it provides information about the amount of loss exceeding the VaR. Then, portfolios with a low ES should also have a low VaR. In addition, under general conditions, ES is a convex function and it is a coherent measure of risk as well (Acerbi and Tasche, 2002).

Emphasizing that bank solvency does not depend only on long run evaluations, but also on short term liquidity capability, in the next section we describe our liquidity risk modeling.

It is useful to remark that Eq. (1) and, therefore, Eq. (3) hold in the case where no liquidity problem arises. In fact, as emphasized in the Northern Rock bank example, this issue becomes crucial in order to ensure banking solvency. For this reason, in addition to the long-run equilibrium described through the above mentioned equations, to ensure solvency with a probability (1−

In the next section we describe how to implement our model from a statistical point of view.

Starting from what we described in the previous section, in what follows, we specify the statistical framework that we use to carry out the analysis.
                        
                           •
                           We simulate macro-economic scenarios Z
                              Δ,g
                              , where g
                              =(1,…,
                              G).

We compute R
                              
                                 t,Δ,g
                               and, therefore, the present value of assets, liabilities and calculate PNI
                              
                                 h,Δ,g
                              .

For each scenario we derive Pd
                              
                                 i,Δ,g
                              .

Once Pd
                              
                                 i,Δ,g
                               is obtained, in order to simulate defaults, we generate ξ
                              
                                 i,Δ,g
                              .

We compute the loss of Eq. (12) obtaining a distribution from which to calculate EC
                              
                                 VaR,(1−α) and EC
                              
                                 ES,(1−α).

Considering the short-term banking liquidity structure, we simulate H
                              
                                 i,Δ,t
                               and ϱ
                              Δ,g,t
                               in order to derive the liquidity mismatching distribution described in Eq. (17) and compute LM
                              
                                 VaR,(1−α) and LM
                              
                                 ES,(1−α).

Following the purpose to evaluate assets and liabilities under different scenarios we need to build up a scenario generator. The most natural form to generate scenarios is conditional on past realized values of the process. In Basel II regulatory methodology a mix of conditional and unconditional approaches are contemplated. In the case where we consider the market risk, in the parametric approach (Longerstaey and Spencer, 1996), the measurement may be based on conditional estimates of risk factor volatilities. On the other hand, in the historical simulation approach, estimates are derived from scenarios based on historical data (McNeil et al., 2005). When we focus on credit risk measurement, the formula used in the internal ratings based (IRB) approach can be implemented in either conditionally or unconditionally, depending on whether the internal assessments of default probabilities are considered to be point in time or through the cycle.

The definition of economic capital that we use throughout our analysis allows us to exploit both conditional and unconditional scenarios. In order to consider even the most extreme historical events, we rely on the unconditional ones. Therefore, we fit the distribution of macro-economic variables considering a multivariate mixture model approach. We prefer this solution despite other approaches (i.e., copulas) because it is very flexible, allowing us to capture multi-modality and other specific historical data patterns.

Considering the vector of random variables Z
                        1,…,
                        Z
                        
                           K
                        , the density of each random variable may be written as follows

                           k
                         are positive and sum to unity. In our empirical study, in the next section, we rely on the Normal density function parametric family.

Using estimated parameters of Eq. (18), we generate Z

There is a wide literature concerning the estimation of the term structure of interest rates (Bellini and Riani, 2012). The objective usually pursued is to model the entire term structure, eventually investigating the relationship with macro-economic variables (Diebold et al., 2006). In our framework, however, it is crucial to highlight the functional relationship between interest rates and macro-economic variables. Therefore, concentrating on each node d, (d
                        =1,…,
                        D), of the term structure, we catch the relationship between macro-economic variables and the interest rate through the following linear model

Originating from the well-known logit model, and pointing out that our framework can be extended to other models, we assume that

                        In the financial literature, Wilson (1997) exploited Eq. (21) estimating default probabilities and simulating defaults at a sector level. We extend this idea in order to simulate defaults at the customer level and taking into account sector dependencies. In order to do so, we represent default probabilities as a function of both microeconomic variables X and the index ϑ
                        
                           s
                        , which represents the health of sector s, (s
                        =1,…,
                        S). This index can be represented as a function of the set of macro-economic variables. Our main contribution, in this area, is to introduce a multilevel logit model (Gelman and Hill, 2007) allowing model parameters to vary according to their sector specific features. In other words, relying on Eq. (21), we assume that

We need to define a coherent framework which jointly considers macro-economic scenarios, interest rate impact on financial instruments and debtor specific features. For this reason we exploit an approach where default correlations are captured through a copula function. Stressing that each debtor i belongs to a specific sector s, we assume that default correlation among debtors can be drawn through the sector correlation expressed through the index ϑ
                        
                           s

                        =1,…,
                        S). The research can be conducted exploiting alternative copula functions. In our simulated banking analysis, in the next section, we rely on a Student T copula (Bellini, 2010).

Once described all elements required to compute the economic capital, in the next section we describe our liquidity framework.

Recent researches suggest that liquidity varies with economic conditions. Following Amihud (2002) we can compute the proxy of the liquidity from stock market: ILLIQ. The author defines ILLIQ the ratio between the absolute value of stock daily return and its daily dollar volume. This ratio shows the price change per daily trading volume for each stock, st.

In the next section we apply our framework to a stylized commercial bank.

We investigate a stylized commercial bank whose asset cash flows are distributed among few maturities t, (t
                     =0,3M,6M,2Y,3Y,5Y,10Y) as shown in Table 1
                     . Aiming to show the impact of different balance sheet schemes, we consider three alternative liability structures as described in the same table. Without loss of generality, for sake of simplicity, we do not introduce additional repricing issues assuming credits and debits to have fixed coupon rates.

In the case where we consider credits and debits 1, cash flows are perfectly matched for all maturities. When we compare credits and debits 2, total credits are greater than total debits and, in addition, debits have a shorter duration (they are mainly concentrated on the maturity t
                     =0). Intuitively, in this second setting, shocks on interest rates have a greater impact on credits than debits. At the same time, in the case of difficulties in rising money, the bank faces deep liquidity issues. Finally, when we focus on credits and debits 3, we aim to investigate the impact of simulated scenarios on a liability sensitive balance sheet structure. As in the previous setting, there is an unfavorable liquidity mismatching.

Relying on the unconditional approach to generate the macro-economic scenarios (Z
                     Δ), we estimate the parameters of Eq. (18) on ISTAT quarterly datasets
                        3
                        Data are available on the website http://www.dati.istat.it.

                      from 1990 to 2009. The set of macro-economic variables, Z
                     
                        t
                     , is constituted by the quarterly observations of gross domestic product (GDP), total free on board exports (EXP), total free on board imports (IMP), gross housing investments (INV), internal consumption (CONS), added value for food, beverages and tobacco (VAL) and unemployment rate (UR). The choice of these variables, is due to the availability of the data for the entire period and it is functional to investigate the relationship between real macro-economic variables and the financial ones.

                     . Frequency histograms emphasize that, apart from VAL, all variables are multi-modal (Atkinson et al., 2004). The matrix of scatter-plots helps to understand the relationship between each variable and others. Concentrating, for example, on its first row, it is evident the strong positive relationship between GDP and EXP. An increase in EXP (horizontal axis, re-scaled value of EXP) is associated to an increase in GDP (vertical axis, re-scaled value of GDP). The same positive connection is highlighted between GDP and IMP, CONS. A less stable link is remarked between GDP and INV, VAL. The correlation is negative between GDP and UR.

It is clear from what we showed above that it is not appropriate to fit a Normal multivariate variable to our data. For this reason we rely on the mixture model described in Eq. (18). We exploit the gmdistribution Matlab R2011a expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the Normal mixture model with K
                     =7 components. The estimated parameter vector θ(λ,
                     ϕ) is made up by the vector of equal weights λ and the vector ϕ of K
                     =7 means and K
                     =7 variance–covariance matrices among macro-economic factors. All estimated parameters are reported in Appendix A, Table 4. In order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit, it is useful to remark that for univariate distributions there is wide statistical literature. In multi-dimensions, several procedures have been developed for testing multivariate Normality or a given (copula) distribution (Kojadinovic and Yan, 2010). However, they cannot be exploited in our case. The two most important classes of tests of goodness-of-fit based on the empirical distribution function of a random sample are the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic and tests based on the distance between two distributions (Aslan and Zech, 2005). Justel et al. (1997) propose a generalization of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in high dimensions. This procedure implies a series of numerical complications when applied to high-dimensional datasets, for this reason we prefer to consider distance based tests. In particular we rely on a non-parametric test for equality of two multivariate distributions based on Euclidean distance between sample elements (Rizzo and Szekely, 2010). We exploit the energy test (Szekely and Rizzo, 2004) implemented in the energy R package. The high p-value 0.967 highlights the good fitting of our estimated model.

Once obtained parameters to fit the macro-economic distribution, we are allowed to randomly (random function Matlab R2011a) simulate Z
                     Δ which are crucial for our analysis because they enter in the simulation of interest rates, default probabilities and liquidity scenarios.

Concentrating on the term structure of interest rates, we fit the parameters of Eq. (19) considering the German quarterly interest rate, R
                     
                        d
                     , time series from 1990 to 2009 at (yearly) maturities d, (d
                     =2,3,5,10). The regression is carried out exploiting the R package and parameter estimates as well as the goodness-of-fit R
                     2 are shown in Appendix A, Table 5. Relying on these estimates as well as on Z
                     Δ and exploiting Eq. (20), we obtain the simulated interest rates R
                     
                        d,Δ, which are used to compute the present value of credits and debits of the stylized bank.

In the next sections we analyze both the economic capital as well as the liquidity of the above described stylized bank.

The credit portfolio of our stylized bank is made up by 200 debtors chosen among firms of a private Italian dataset. We randomly associate to each obligor credits and bonds to meet the asset structure described in Table 1. Thus, we estimate default probabilities as described in Section 5.3. The estimation is carried out considering balance sheet and centrale dei rischi

                         information. The private Italian dataset is constituted by 457 firms (386 good and 71 bad) for which we have 46 indicators. We run a stepwise logit regression which allows to identify the following firm specific variables: liquidity ratio (LR), debt over total assets (DOA), days of payment delay (DPD), return on asset (ROA) and the ratio between the overall Italian credit available for the firm and the credit effectively used (CAU). In addition, according to Eq. (22), we consider the index ϑ
                        
                           s
                         representing the health of the sector s to which the firm belongs. This index corresponds to the default rate computed by the Bank of Italy.
                           5
                           Data are available on the website http://www.bancaditalia.it.
                        
                        
                           5
                         We concentrate on the 15 most important Italian economic sectors s, (s
                        =1,…,15). We fit the default probabilities relying on the multilevel regression arm R package obtaining S
                        =15 regression models. Fixed parameters as well as varying intercept α and coefficient γ (associated to ϑ) are detailed in Appendix A, Table 6. The R
                        2
                        =0.572 represents the goodness-of-fit of the overall model.

Aiming to shock default probabilities according to Eq. (27), for each of the S
                        =15 sectors we estimate the regression parameters of Eq. (24) as detailed in Appendix A, Table 7. Considering Z
                        Δ, it is easy to derive the simulated ϑ
                        
                           s,Δ of Eq. (25). The above estimated values are used to obtain Y
                        
                           i,Δ as described in Eq. (26), and Pd
                        
                           i,Δ of Eq. (27).

Pursuing the objective to simulate default events for the banking portfolio, we rely on a Student T copula to simulate u
                        =(u
                        1,…,
                        u
                        
                           S
                        ). For each generation g, (g
                        =1,…,
                        G), emphasizing that default occurs when Pd
                        
                           i,Δ,g
                        
                        >
                        u
                        
                           i,g
                        , we obtain the indicator function ξ
                        
                           i,Δ,g
                        . Copula parameters are fitted on ϑ
                        
                           s
                         time series. Applying Mashal et al. (2002) approach we estimate υ
                        =10 degrees of freedom. We exploit the copula R package to fit parameters relying on the correlation matrix detailed in Appendix A, Table 8. The high fitting of our model computed on the transformed pseudo-observations (of the original Bank of Italy default rate time series) is emphasized by the p-value 0.4091 of the Cramer-von Mises test (Kojadinovic and Yan, 2010).

Considering all above described parameter estimates, now we are able to simulate scenarios from which to derive the loss distribution of Eq. (12). It is evident that both assets and liabilities affect this distribution. Thus, focusing on credits and bonds, we need to consider two elements: the loss due to default events and the loss due to interest rate changes. Relying on 1000 simulations, for each scenario we compute separately losses due to default and losses due to interest rate changes. The top panels of Fig. 2
                         show the distribution of portfolio (credits and bonds) for these two risk sources. Default losses are concentrated on the 0–500 interval (of a portfolio of nominal value 10,000). Interest rate losses show a different distribution. The maximum is around 500 and there is a fat tail representing higher losses in the interval between 500 and 1800. For each of the 1000 simulations, the scatter-plots show portfolio losses pairs due to default and interest rate. According to this figure, we can state that there is no statistically significant relationship between losses due to default and losses due to interest rate changes. These findings are aligned with Kaplin et al. (2009) results obtained (at the firm level) examining U.S. companies from 1982 to 2008.

Emphasizing that the above described results concern the asset side (credits and bonds) of the balance sheet, when considering liabilities as detailed in Table 1, we obtain the loss distributions described in Fig. 3
                        .

It is evident from the joint analysis of Figs. 2 and 3 that, according to macro-economic scenarios, simulated interest rates lead to an asymmetric distribution of asset and liability present values and, therefore, of their variations. Higher interest rates than the actual ones are at the base of the present value reduction emphasized in both these figures. Comparing debits and integrated losses, in Fig. 3, we notice that, in the first setting (debits 1 of Table 1), credit and bond losses overtake gains due to debits reduction (associated to interest rate changes). As we anticipated, in the second (asset sensitive) balance sheet structure (debits 2 of Table 1), asset losses, due to both defaults and interest rate changes, exceed debit gains. In the third context (debits 3 of Table 1), the impact of debit mitigation is higher than in the other cases. The overall integrated loss distribution is narrower than the previous ones.

In Table 2
                         we compare alternative estimates of the economic capital. We consider both EC
                        
                           Var,(1−α) and EC
                        
                           ES, (1−α) distinguishing between assets (credits and bonds) and debits contributions to EC. In addition, we separate the portion of asset losses due to defaults and the ones due to interest rates. We further show the measure of the Basel II economic capital computed according to the internal models approach (IM)
                           6
                           This economic capital is obtained as sum of individual risks exploiting, for the market risk, the VaR computed on bonds and, for the credit risk, the IRB model applied to banking customers. Assuming that the repricing structure is aligned to the grids of Table 1, the interest rate risk is substantially negligible in all settings.
                        
                        
                           6
                         and the ones calculated according to Kretzschmar et al. (2010) (KMK). We avoid considering the Alessandri and Drehmann (2010) because of our analysis assumptions. It is evident that, for our analysis, we need to consider the whole balance sheet structure, while for the other approaches the asset structure is sufficient to compute the economic capital.


                        Table 2 highlights the conclusion that the overall EC associated to the balance sheet 2 is greater than the EC associated with other frames. According to the macro-economic scenarios, asset present value reductions are more marked when assets exceed and have a greater maturity than liabilities. When we examine the first balance sheet structure, we notice that the impact of asset and liability variations due to interest rates is the same. Thus, in this setting the overall EC matches credit losses. It is interesting to emphasize that, in balance sheet 3, the gain due to liabilities value reduction plays a key role in determining the overall EC estimate. When we decompose the EC into its asset (default, interest) and liability elements, the coherence emphasized describing Eq. (14) holds for the total EC, but not necessarily for its elements.

Finally, comparing our ES estimates to EC
                        
                           IM
                        , it is evident that our integrated approach leads to a greater EC estimate. This is due to both the credit mechanism exploited to capture defaults as well as the interaction between credit and interest rate risks. On the other hand, when we consider EC
                        
                           KMK
                         it is evident that our approach brings higher or lower EC than EC
                        
                           KMK
                         according to the balance sheet structure which is examined.

From a practical point of view, it is easy to highlight that the perfect matching of assets and liabilities constitutes the paradigm of a safe bank. However, in the current positive maturity transformation setting (liabilities have shorter maturities than assets), as described in balance sheet structure 2, banks need to pay attention to their asset and liability equilibrium. From both the policy makers as well as the risk managers point of view, it is evident that a deep liability short term mismatching affects banking solvency and requires more (economic) capital. At the same time, when considering the balance sheet structure 3, we need to be conscious of the great impact of debit evaluation (see column Debits of Table 2). Thus, from a conservative perspective, we could figure out as economic capital the maximum between the ones computed considering the perfectly matched balance sheet structure and the real ones. In all cases, we need to consider the short term banking solvency. For this reason, in the next section we focus on liquidity analysis.

Concentrating on the liquidity analysis of the stylized bank described in Table 1, we compute the illiquidity ratio of Eq. (29) relying on the time series of ten among the most important stocks of the Italian market. Starting from these individual ratios, we compute the average market illiquidity ILLIQ
                        
                           avg
                        . Thus, we compute regression parameters of Eq. (30) considering as independent variables the set of Italian macro-economic factors Z
                        
                           t
                         above described. We consider the quarterly time series from 2003 to 2009. Parameter estimates are shown in Appendix A, Table 9. The R
                        2
                        =0.745 highlights the high fitting of the model. Once obtained these parameters, we exploit Z
                        Δ simulations to derive the simulated illiquidity ratio of Eq. (31). We re-scale ILLIQ
                        Δ within the range [0,1] and we set the liquidity threshold at 0.6. When a liquidity shock occurs (ILLIQ
                        Δ exceeds the threshold) both H

                         are randomly generated respectively within the intervals [0,0.4] and [0.4,0.5].

                           ES,(1−α) described in Table 3

                        Table 3 emphasizes the role of liquidity mismatching under different balance sheet structures. From a practical point of view, both policy makers and risk managers need to be conscious that the liquidity mismatching LM
                        
                           VaR,99.9% and LM
                        
                           ES,99.9% show the need of a balance between cash inflows and outflows. The assets and liabilities equilibrium is crucial for banking solvency both from the long run and the short term perspectives.

Originating from the recent literature on risk integration, we propose a model which incorporates the contribution of researches ranging among Kretzschmar et al. (2010), Alessandri and Drehmann (2010), Grundke (2009) and Grundke (2010). We emphasize the distinction between long run and short term banking solvency highlighting the need to consider them jointly.

Stressing the need to use risk models for practical purposes, we build up an easy to implement statistical framework aiming to exploit information available within the risk management department. We propose a mixture model to estimate the multivariate distribution of macro-economic factors and apply these estimates to generate scenarios. Once identified the functional relationship between these macro-economic variables and banking risk drivers, we derive the banking loss and the liquidity mismatching distributions on which we compute VaR and ES risk measures.

We apply our framework to a stylized commercial bank emphasizing the need to take into account the whole balance sheet structure to assess banking solvency. One of our major contributions is to highlight that banking risks are associated not only to the asset balance sheet, but also depend on both assets and liabilities.

From both the policy makers as well as the risk managers point of view, we figure out that the perfect matching of asset and liability has the advantage of smaller economic capital and liquidity risk (balance sheet structure 1). On the contrary, when banks pursue a deep positive maturity transformation strategy (the maturity of liabilities is shorter than the maturity of assets), they are subject to high risks in the short as well in the long run (balance sheet structure 2). Within these extremes there are many other structures hiding potential risk issues (balance sheet structure 3).

More generally, we figure out why policy makers as well as risk managers should take care of risk integration. The Basel II building block modeling is ineffective in capturing interactions among different risk sources. Today’s financial innovation forces political institutions and practitioners to analyze banks from a fully integrated perspective. Our model can easily embrace all banking risk sources, thus our statistical framework can simply be extended to consider other risks apart from the interest rate, credit and liquidity ones. Further studies need to be devoted to identify robust capital allocation mechanics (Bellini, 2012), which are crucial for an effective risk management practice.
