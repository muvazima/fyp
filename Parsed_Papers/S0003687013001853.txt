                  This paper provides a case study of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) as applied to a continuous monitoring dual-task environment. Specifically, SDT was used to evaluate the independent contributions of sensitivity and bias to different qualitative gauges used in process control. To assess detection performance in monitoring the gauges, we developed a Time Window-based Human-In-The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation bed. Through this test bed, we were able to generate a display similar to those monitored by console operators in oil and gas refinery plants. By using SDT and TWHITL, we evaluated the sensitivity, operator bias, and response time of flow, level, pressure, and temperature gauge shapes developed by Abnormal Situation Management® (ASM®) Consortium (www.asmconsortium.org). Our findings suggest that display density influences the effectiveness of participants in detecting abnormal shapes. Furthermore, results suggest that some shapes elicit better detection performance than others.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

User-centered design of a process monitoring display is important for supporting proactive monitoring by console operators, which not only prevents critical mistakes, but also improves users' acceptance and satisfaction level (Quintana et al., 2012). Recently, a significant challenge of the information age is overcoming the information gap between data produced and information needed (Endsley, 2009). Advanced technology provides an almost unlimited ability to instantly process data while human's abilities to simultaneously understand this data is limited. This problem is exacerbated when an operator has a very high workload. Console operators in oil and gas refineries are a good example of workers that experience a high workload task. Most control room operators are responsible for continuously monitoring at least 200 control loops for long periods of time (Tharanathan et al., 2012). A high level of sensitivity for detecting a process parameter deviating outside of normal variation is necessary to safely manage a plant. For that reason, the Abnormal Situation Management Joint Research and Development Consortium (ASM Consortium) initiated a Visual Thesaurus project to research and create a set of graphical objects that can support operator monitoring tasks. In 2006, the Visual Thesaurus research began by creating the set of graphical shapes (Peter Bullemer, 2009). In 2007, the research team focused on the effectiveness of the 2006 Visual Thesaurus objects to support proactive monitoring. To measure the accuracy of change detection, Geoffrey Ho and his research team used Signal Detection Theory (Geoffrey Ho, 2008). Based on this result, an illustrative Overview Display (OD) was designed for an actual coker process plant at one of the consortium members' refinery sites (see Fig. 1
                     ).

The limitation of 2007 Visual Thesaurus research was the team conducted an experiment based on the single-task environment. The experiment was held in a dark room, where the only source of light was the computer monitor. This is an unrealistic condition for console operators in oil and gas refinery plants because they commonly perform other work activities while monitoring their process displays. There is a significant difference between the single-task and the dual-tasks environment to detect process deviation from normal range. According to Bundesen's TVA (Theory of Visual Attention), visual search performance can be influenced by the strength of the visual stimuli as well as the perceptual decision bias (Bundesen, 1990). In the dual-task environment, the model of visual attention should include switching time between the dual-tasks for changing parameters compared to the single-task environment (Logan and Gordon, 2001) because the requirement to switch from one task to another task creates an emergent need to organize and schedule the elementary, subordinate processes (Allport et al., 1994). Hence, in the dual-task environment, operators must quickly switch their attention from one task to the other in order to keep pace with performance for both tasks continuously (1972). In addition, the usage of channels of visual information (referred to as foveal and peripheral vision) in dual-tasks interference is different compared to single-task interference (Wickens, 2002). Human observers use foveal and peripheral vision based on the location of the subject (Thorpe et al., 2001). These visions are working together to produce the entire visual perception. Foveal vision is required in order to look at the subject with high acuity. Peripheral vision is the region outside a person's gaze. Peripheral vision consists of parafoveal, mid-peripheral, and far peripheral vision (Rayner et al., 1981). For that reason, there is a significant difference between the single-task and dual-task in most visual scanning environment.

To create a more realistic testing environment using a dual-task assessment approach was developed to reflect the control room task environment to the participants (Tharanathan et al., 2010). Tharanathan and his colleagues used a flag-matching task for the additional task because this task demanded the use of similar cognitive resources as needed when performing typical console operations activities. The results showed that operators' situation awareness was significantly higher when they monitored the process on the OD compared to a traditional display in the dual-task test environment (Tharanathan et al., 2010). However, they could not evaluate the effectiveness (e.g. sensitivity, operator's bias, and operator's response time) of change detection in different graphical gauge shapes. In order to supplement the limitations of these previous Visual Thesaurus research, we developed the Time Window-based Human-In-The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation test bed and focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the abnormality detection in process changes at flow, level, pressure, and temperature shapes from Visual Thesaurus in the dual-task test environment.

The purpose of this research effort is to investigate the impact of shapes and display density on the following:
                        
                           •
                           detection effectiveness in terms of sensitivity (d’) and bias (β);

detection response times;

perceived workload; and

performance on the secondary task.

Process monitoring displays using qualitative shapes can become very dense when showing a large number of process parameters. Based on the rationale of the visual attention difference between single-task and dual-task environment, the performance of both tasks might be significantly influenced by the increment of the display density level of the primary monitoring task. In our experiment, display density was manipulated using different set sizes for the display. Set size refers to the number of shapes that were in the display. Time Window-based Human-In-The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation provided different levels of set size.

@&#METHODS@&#

We developed Time Window-based Human-In-The-Loop (TWHITL) simulation. This test bed provides an interactive simulation to represent changing gauge conditions in a continuous process monitoring task typically found in oil and gas refinery factories. When an underlying process parameter value exceeds its normal or alarm limit, the operator must indicate that the gauge is abnormal or in an alarm condition by clicking on the gauge tag. Normal limits were set based on normal variability observed in a process simulation of a crude distillation unit (CDU). Alarm limits were also set based on a typical CDU configuration. The gauge monitoring task begins with all gauges in the normal condition. We designed the simulation in order to focus on the effect of having more than typical number abnormal gauges. This enabled the novice participants to better detect anomalies compared to more experienced control room operators at an oil and gas refinery plant. Values of each gauge are updated every second (up to ± 30% from the current values) within the range of the normal condition. The numbers of gauges that increase or decrease their values were set to reflect the way gauges function in the operational environment.

                           1
                           Each gauge is connected with a random number generator function (uniformly distributed by mean 1 with different random seeds ({6235897, 9323846, and 2018281)). If the generated random number is greater than 0.5, the value will increase. If the random number is less than 0.5, the value will decrease.
                         Based on the experimental scenarios, participants executed different conditions of the display density. Fig. 2
                         shows a screenshot of the gauge monitoring task (top left) and flag-matching task (top right).

Participants completed the secondary flag matching task while simultaneously monitoring the display in the TWHITL simulation. For the flag matching task, participants were presented with a 6 × 8 grid of numbered tiles on a computer screen. When an operator selected a tile using the mouse, a country flag appeared. Only the four most recently selected flags could be in view at a time. When the four flags in view matched, the tiles disappeared from the grid. In order to make participants to use both foveal and peripheral vision, the degree between the center point of two screens and participants (D

                        ) is larger than 10°, so they fell inside the participant's peripheral vision field.

                           Parafoveal vision is the region surrounding the fovea, corresponding to the retinal area from 2 to 10° off-center. Mid-peripheral vision exists in the middle of the field of view (around 10–30°) and far peripheral vision exists at the edges (more than 30° off-center) of the field of view Thorpe et al., 2001. Detection of animals in natural images using far peripheral vision. European Journal of Neuroscience 14, 869–876.
                         Participants were trained to pay attention to the primary gauge monitoring task rather than the flag matching task because the safety of the process plant is a top priority to console operators in a control room.

The simulation starts with normal events. Here, the definition of a normal event is a gauge shape which is pointing to the inside of the normal region. Abnormal events refer to a gauge shape which is pointing between the normal and alarm region. Alarm events describe a shape that is exceeds the abnormal region. Table 1
                         shows the example of each shape for normal, abnormal, and alarm condition. Every gauge consists of five regions: low alarm, low abnormal, normal, high abnormal and high alarm region. The gauge shapes were designed according to recommendations from previous ASM research; the grey colors and functional specifications of flow, level, temperature, and pressure gauges were based on the previous ASM results (Tharanathan et al., 2010). The gauges in this study, however, did not include any color change or flashing indications for abnormal or alarm situations as specified in the ASM design. This was a conscious decision by the team for two related reasons. First, changes in color and flashing indications are very effective at capturing attention (as was intended by the design). Second, all gauges use the same colors and indications. Thus, by excluding these aspects of the design, the assessment could focus on the design characteristics of the shapes that are different. Namely, the base shape (horizontal fill bar vs. circular fill bar vs. speedometer with an arrow). To ensure that each participant group was provided similar workload conditions, fixed scenarios were used that controlled the states of gauge shapes. If a next scheduled event is an abnormal event, the simulator will smoothly move the location of the current value indicator toward a point in the abnormal region. Therefore, instead of “jumping” to the final destination, the simulation will steadily move the gauge indicator with each time increment until it reaches the desired value.

During the simulation, discrete events happen at the given event time based on the scenarios. In this study, we collected participant responses based on Time Windows (TW). This is a construct that specifies a functional relationship between a required situation and the time interval that specifies the availability of an action opportunity which leads to the required situation (Rothrock, 2001). There are three possible states of any time window: INACTIVE, OPEN, and CLOSE (See Fig. 3
                        ).

The Time Window (TW) is said to be in the OPEN state when an opportunity to execute an action that relates to the required situation exists at the current point in time space. TW is in the INACTIVE state when it remains unopened throughout the duration of the simulation. For example, the scheduled TW will be in the OPEN state when the simulation time reaches a specific abnormal event time. As seen in Fig. 4
                        , when the flow gauge “9F206” changes its state from normal to abnormal, the TW for the flow gauge “9F206” is in the OPEN state. If a participant detects the abnormal condition of the abnormal event gauge within the event duration time, the participant action will change the gauge condition from abnormal to normal by closing the TW, and the action will be recorded to “Hit”. If the participant fails to detect the abnormal condition of this gauge, it will move to alarm condition. If the participant also fails to detect the alarm condition within the full event duration time, then the event gauge will be back to the normal condition by closing the TW, and it will be recorded “Miss”.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

A group of 20 students from Penn State University (24–34 years of age, 12 men and 8 women) participated in this study. All participants had no vision problem to conduct the experiment and no previous experience for the gauge monitoring task. All subjects were paid for participating in the study. We designed a two-factor (Gauge Type and Set Size) experiment with repeated measures on one factor. In this design each participant is measured after receiving all levels of Gauge Type in combination with only one level of Set Size. The first factor, called Gauge Type, consists of flow, pressure, level, and temperature gauge. Shapes were randomly distributed in each display (see Fig. 1). The second factor, called Set Size, changes the number of gauges and the overall grid size for each session. The high level consists of 96 gauges (24 flow gauges, 24 level gauges, 24 temperature gauges, and 24 pressure gauges), the medium level consists of 64 gauges (16 flow gauges, 16 level gauges, 16 temperature gauges, and 16 pressure gauges), and the low level consists of 32 gauges (8 flow gauges, 8 level gauges, 8 temperature gauges, and 8 pressure gauges). A sample display is shown below. The control interface of the primary task is shown on the left monitor (20 inch). The right monitor (15 inch) is the secondary flag matching task for which the participant must remove all flags by matching same flags. On the left side of the figure shows the experimental setup for a 4 × 8 grid while the right side of the figure shows an 8 × 12 grid. The 8 × 8 grid condition is located at the center of Fig. 5

According to the results from the previous Visual Thesaurus research, operators' workload ratings for the process monitoring task increased by an average of two points on the 10-point scale from Low complexity scenarios to High complexity scenarios. The total number of process changes during each scenario ranged from 15 to 33 for Low complexity scenarios and 146 to 169 for the High complexity scenarios. Hence, in our experiment, we decided to contain total 64 abnormal events for each scenario to maintain medium level of workload among scenarios. The full Event duration time

                              ) of abnormal event TW was determined by a pilot test result. During the pilot test and regardless of participant's task accuracy, the maximum response time was 31.4 s and average time was 21.2 s for the high complexity scenario with an 8 × 12 grid (i.e., worse case condition). In order to provide a reasonable response time to participants, we decided to use the maximum time for the duration time of this experiment.

                        ) of the Time Window (TW is 32 s (0–16 s: abnormal condition; 16–32 s: alarm condition). Fig. 6
                         shows how the duration time of abnormal and alarm events vary with the participant response during the TWHITL simulation. T is an elapsed time from the time when the TW is in OPEN state to the current simulation time. The system continuously checks whether participants acknowledge the abnormal event or not. If participants recognize the abnormality in the gauges within 16 s, then the TW state is changed from the OPEN to CLOSE. However, if they cannot detect this stimulus, then it will move to the alarm event. If T reaches the full Duration time, then it resets to zero.

Each participant experienced three different scenarios. Each scenario contains predefined combinations of set sizes and event timing of abnormal situation. The basic structures of these scenarios are based on the 2009 Visual Thesaurus research in which the research team created a total of 15 scenarios based on the input from a process expert. The scenarios were analyzed in terms of the number of abnormal process deviations that occurred in addition to the number of alarms. The order of three scenarios was randomly generated by using RANDBETWEEN function in Microsoft Excel in order to eliminate ordering effects. Each scenario took 8 min to complete all events. The definition for each scenario is shown in Table 2
                         where n is the number of signals (actions required) and m is the number of gauges displayed. Descriptions for scenario 1 to 3 are included in Appendix A. Each scenario consists of 17 event blocks: nine normal event blocks, four below normal (low abnormal and alarm condition) event blocks, and four above normal (high abnormal and alarm condition) event blocks. When the simulation executes the normal event block, every gauge's current value indicates within a normal range.

Each experiment session began with a general briefing about the primary task, qualitative gauges, and the secondary flag matching task. The objective of the briefing was to introduce the participant to the task apparatus and its main interface. The briefing was presented in the form of self-paced PowerPoint slides and took approximately 10 min. Participants were given the opportunity to ask questions any time during the briefing session. After the briefing, participants proceeded to the practice session. The practice session aimed to train participants on the baseline condition of the primary task (to detect and respond to an abnormal or alarm event) and secondary task (matching all flags in the size of 6 × 8 grid). Participants were asked to perform five practice trials. Each practice trial lasted 2 min, within which there were 5 events that required participant attention and action. Participants were free to ask questions throughout practice. A practice session took 10 min.

. In order to minimize the effect from the scenario order, we used a counterbalanced design. Participants were randomly assigned into two scenario sequences and each sequence has a different scenario order to reduce the chances of influencing the results caused by the scenario order. 10 participants were assigned to each sequence.

Scenario sequence 2: Scenario #3 (high Set Size) → Scenario #2 (medium Set Size) → Scenario #1 (low Set Size)

Each test scenario took about 8 min and the NASA-TLX test was administered following the scenario. As a participant finished one scenario, he/she asked the experimenter to launch the next scenario. Participants were not allowed to ask questions during the test sessions. Total experimental time took approximately 60 min (10 min for briefing session + 10 min for practice session + 10 min for Q&A session + 30 min for executing TWHITL simulation and NASA-TLX).

The basis of performance measurement in the primary task is TW (Time Window) and SDT (Signal Detection Theory). Fig. 7
                         shows the Time Windows outcomes of signal detection. We use the framework developed by Rothrock (2001) to assess participant performance.

The presence of a signal (i.e., Required Situation EXIST) is defined as a gauge shape which is outside the normal range (either in abnormal or alarm conditions). In contrast, when a gauge stays within the normal range, no signal is present (i.e., Required Situation NOT EXIST). We begin by defining n signals, which are denoted as s
                        
                           i
                         where i = 1 to n, and m gauges, which are denoted as g
                        
                           i
                         where j = 1 to m.

At the initial state, there is Non-Signal for all gauges (i.e., everything is in normal condition) and all TW (Time Windows) are designated as INACTIVE state. Until a time window is designated as OPEN, it remains INACTIVE. The set of OPEN TW at time t is designated as O
                        
                           t

                           t
                         is based on the above or below normal event block timing scheme on each scenario. Every scenario contains 8 sets of OPEN TW (4: above normal event block, 4: below normal event block). In each scenario, there are 8 signals for each set of OPEN TW. Each Gauge Type has 2 signals. Time Window accepts the participant's action for D
                        
                           t

                        t = 32 sec). When a required participant action is not made during D

The relation between action and time window can be described by two Boolean indicator functions, W
                        1 for an abnormal time window and W
                        2 for the alarm time window.

For the primary task, three objective measures were recorded: operators' sensitivity (d’), bias (β), and detection times (sec) for abnormal events. The sensitivity index d’ is used to measure an operator's detectability for a given task (Macmillan and Creelman, 2004). If an individual shows random detection performance, d’ will be close 0. The optimal performer who is able to detect small differences with regularity will have a d’ score that is close to 4. Operator bias, or β, determines the extent to which one response is more probable than the other. For example, a β of one represents a decision maker who will be equally likely to commit a miss or a false alarm. A high β reveals a higher likelihood of committing misses. A low β, therefore, indicates an aversion to misses and a tendency to accept more false alarms. β and d’ provide a complementary perspective on an operator's ability to detect signals. Using P(H) and P(FA), we can calculate both d’ and β (for more details, see (Gescheider, 1997)). We also measure the time for correct responses to a signal (e.g., all Hit outcomes). For the response time, it measures the time needed by an individual to respond to a process change. In the case of a missed event, the response time does not exist.

For the flag matching task, performance is measured by the number of flags a participant matches during a scenario. In order to collect subjective workload for the dual-task test environment, we used the NASA Task Load Index (Hart and Staveland, 1988). NASA TLX is a multidimensional subjective workload rating technique commonly used to measure workload such as general workload experienced by operators (Nygren, 1991) or to assess the difficulty of a simulated task (Hancock et al., 1995).

We investigate participant response (y) along the five measures discussed in the previous section: d’, β, response time for all hits, flag task matches, and NASA-TLX workload. For the signal detection measures, we can isolate the performance measures to specific shapes in terms of the Set Size because the signals are equally distributed among the shape types within each scenario. Therefore, the statistical model for d’, β, and response time is shown below.

For i = low, medium, high; j = flow, level, pressure, temperature; k = 20 participants. However, we collected data for the flag matching task and NASA-TLX workload only once per scenario and cannot isolate these measures to shape type. Therefore, the statistical model for these measures is shown below.

To assess the impact of Set Size and Gauge Types on participant sensitivity (d’), bias (β), and response time (sec), a two-way within-subjects ANOVA General Linear Model was conducted. For sensitivity, significant effects were found for the main effects: Set Size, F(2,152) = 29.54, p < 0.001, and Gauge Types, F(3,228) = 2.76, p < 0.05. In addition, a significant interaction effect was found between Set Size and Gauge Types, F(6,456) = 2.5, p < 0.05. Operator bias was significantly influenced by the Set Size, F(2,152) = 43.83, p < 0.001. For response time, significant effect were found for the main effects: Set Size, F(2,152) = 11.18, P < 0.001, and Gauge Types, F(3,228) = 4.58, P < 0.01. Comparisons of d’, β, and response time means are shown in Table 5
                        . Fig. 8
                         shows the interaction plot for d’, β, and response time.

We used Tukey's test to further analyze the differences between the main and interaction effects. For the main effects, we found significant differences between low and medium set size, p < 0.001, between low and high set size, p < 0.001, and between medium and high set size, p < 0.005, (low set size: mean = 3.3613; medium set size: mean = 3.1008; high set size: mean = 2.8392). We also found significant sensitivity difference between flow and pressure shape, p < 0.05, level and pressure, p < 0.001, and level and temperature, p < 0.05 (flow gauge mean = 3.1.86; level gauge mean = 3.441; pressure gauge mean = 2.904; temperature gauge mean = 3.156). For the interaction effects, the grouping table shows that Low Set Size × (Level, Flow, and Temperature) have higher d’ means that other levels. Table 6
                            contains all pairwise comparison of p-values among all levels in detail.

Hence, results suggest the following sensitivity (d’) relationships between Set Size and Gauge Types:
                              
                                 •
                                 sensitivity at low set size > sensitivity at medium set size > sensitivity at high set size

sensitivity for flow and level > sensitivity for pressure; sensitivity for level > sensitivity for temperature

sensitivity for flow and level at low set size > sensitivity for pressure at low set size

Only one significant effect for operator bias (β) was found for the main effects of Set Size. There were no significant interaction effects found in operators' bias. Mean β values are quite high overall. A high beta means that participants are allowing more misses and avoiding false alarms. It shows that participants' responses for the abnormal events are highly biased toward the “Signal NOT EXIST” response. Given the skewness of the population distribution, we used the Mann–Whitney Test to verify our ANOVA results. We compared β scores between the set sizes in terms of median and found that the operator bias (β) for low Set Size was significantly different than medium Set Size, W = 5028.5, p < 0.001, as well as the high Set Size, W = 4693.0, p < 0.001, (median for low Set Size = 9.27; medium Set Size = 35.20; high Set Size = 35.2). The difference between medium and high Set Size was not significant. These results suggest the following relationship in terms of operator bias (β):

Significant effects were found for the main effects: Set Size, and Gauge Types. No interaction effects were significant. Grouping information of multiple comparison using Tukey's test (95.0% simultaneous confidence level) provides that significant differences between low (mean = 15.5 s) and medium (mean = 18.2 s) Set Size, p < 0.005, and between low and high (mean = 18.2 s) Set Size, p < 0.001. However, no significant difference was found between medium and high Set Size, p = 0.601. We repeated Tukey's test (95.0% simultaneous confidence level) to analyze the differences between Gauge Types. We found significant differences between flow (mean = 16.8 s) and temperature (mean = 19.2 s) gauge, p < 0.05, and between level (mean = 16.5 s) and temperature gauge, p < 0.05. Therefore, results suggest the following relationships:

To assess the impact of set size and complexity on participant performance on the flag matching task and perceived workload, a one-way within-subject ANOVA was conducted. We found that Set Size significantly influence the number of matched flags, F(2,38) = 6.64, p < 0.005, and perceived workload, F(2,38) = 8.08, p < 0.001. Comparisons of mean number of flags matched and perceived workload are shown in Fig. 9

For secondary task, grouping information of multiple comparison using Tukey's test (95.0% simultaneous confidence level) provides that significant differences between low (mean = 9.0) and high (mean = 6.7) Set Size, p < 0.005, However, no significant difference was found between low and medium Set Size, p = 0.123, and medium and high Set Size, p = 0.2475. We repeated Tukey's test (95.0% simultaneous confidence level) to analyze the perceived workload. Significant differences between low (mean = 33.8) and high (mean = 45.8) Set Size, p < 0.001, and between medium (mean = 33.3) and high Set Size, p < 0.05. However, no significant difference was found between low and medium Set Size, p = 0.0683, and medium and high Set Size, p = 0.2152. Therefore, results suggest the following relationships:

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Operators' sensitivity (d’) and response time for the abnormal events are significantly influenced by both Set Size and Gauge Types factors in the dual-task test environment. However, operators' likelihood ratio (β) is only influenced by Set Size.

For the Set Size, d’ significantly decreased as they moved from low to medium to high levels of the display density. However, operator bias (β) was opposite. β values got higher as the display density level went from low to medium or high (no significant β difference between medium and high Set Size). These results suggest that participants in the low display density level are more inclined to be neutral in their judgments than in the medium or high because a higher β value represents fewer false alarms and more misses committed by participants. In other words, participants are getting more conservative for their decision when they have more gauges to monitor during the experiment. This phenomenon may suggest that participants have high standards of performance expectations for the gauge monitoring task because high standards associated with perfectionism are responsible for a negative correlation between the number of hits, correctly detected signals, and responses bias related to the signals (Stoeber and Eysenck, 2008).

The sensitivity finding is supported by participants' response time results. It was consistent with β in that the low Set Size condition enabled faster responses than either medium or high conditions. The result suggests that the low Set Size condition promoted faster response times while the medium and high conditions slowed response times. Combined with β results, we see a speed-accuracy trade-off in which the low display density level promotes faster response time but poorer accuracy (more false alarm), while medium and high display density levels promotes slower response time but better accuracy (less false alarm). Hence, we can say that participants might pay more attention to the monitoring task with medium and high Set Size compared to the low Set Size. We could find a similar result from Chan and Tang's research (2007).

In terms of Gauge Types, our results suggest that various graphical shape show different sensitivity (d’) due to different levels in the display density in the dual-task test environment. Sensitivity for the pressure shape was significantly lower than other shapes at low set size and level shape enabled participants to detect the abnormal events better than pressure and temperature gauges.

The cause for the poor performance on the pressure shape may be attributed to the phenomenon that its parameter deviation (indicator circle
                           5

                        ) is less perceptible than other shapes. The parameter appeared to be changing up or downward direction of the ball indicator rather than changing in the shape itself. According to the research done by Burns, a shape changing in angle from horizontal or vertical is more noticeable than simply a change in position (Burns, 2005). We submit that the level shape elicited better performance (d’) because of the size of the fill bar. The temperature and level gauges have similar types of a bar shape indicator design. However, the fill bar size of level gauges is wider than the temperature and thus changes are more salient. According to visual lobe research in the useful field of view (Chan and Tang, 2007), the results indicated that the more horizontally elongated visual lobe shape (Length–Width ratio
                           6
                        
                        
                           6
                           A value of 1 of the Length–Width ratio represents a square. Values larger than 1 mean the shapes are elongated horizontally.
                        : 1.415) was easier to perform at visual searching compared to the narrow lobe shape (Length–Width ratio: 1.266). Table 7
                         shows that a Length–Width ratio of indicator bar for both temperature and level gauges. It indicates that, for both minimum and maximum size, the ratio for the level gauge is larger than the temperature gauge. Moreover, combined with d’ and response time results, we can say that participants are more sensitive and faster to response the abnormal events for the level gauges as compared to the temperature gauges (No significant difference for β).

Set Size significantly influenced the performance of the secondary task in terms of how many flags the participants matched during the simulation. The performance difference on the matching task suggests that the tasks with a high Set Size were substantially more difficult than the tasks with the low Set Size. Based on this finding, we could suggest that participants did not quickly switch their attention from one task to the other to maintain the performance of both tasks when the number of gauges in the primary display was large. It means participants took advantage of time when they had a larger set size of gauge monitoring task. One interesting finding is that the performance of the secondary task did not significantly decrease when the display density of the monitoring task was increased from low to medium. While we suspect that performance on the additional task is linked to overall cognitive resource demands, the participants may have focused primarily on the gauge detection task at the expense of the additional task. Therefore, further investigation into the use of the additional task is recommended as future work.

For NASA-TLX, the result shows that operator perceived workload is significantly influenced by the display density of the primary task within the dual-task test environment we found a significant mean difference between low and high Set Size. This validates our display density condition in terms of difficulty. The result supports that process monitoring displays using qualitative shapes is judged to impose high workload and difficult cognitive effort on operators when they are exposed to the large number of process parameters. For that reason, it is important to understand how the number of objects in the display influences the monitoring performance in order to design the proactive monitoring display as well as to evaluate the tradeoffs of using each shape.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we used SDT and TWHITL simulation to investigate the impact of shapes and display density on multiple dependent variables in a continuous monitoring dual-task environment. In terms of d’ and the secondary task, we found that both performance levels dropped as the number of shapes (Set Size) increased. Our findings also suggest that change detection will be better and faster when displays contain relatively few shapes, but we found a speed-accuracy trade-off in which the low Set Size promotes faster response time but more false alarms, while high Set Size promotes slower response time but fewer false alarms. For Gauge Type, abnormality detection using the temperature shape was worse when compared to the level shape.

Our findings suggest design principles for continuous monitoring multi-task environments in oil and gas refineries. Specifically, the results point toward combinations of shapes and set sizes that elicit effective (e.g., small set size using flow and level gauges) and ineffective (e.g., large set size with pressure and temperature gauges) performance. In general, a smaller set size will elicit faster and more sensitive performance. This result is confirmed by performance on the secondary task as well as perceived workload using NASA-TLX. However, smaller set sizes will also elicit β values that indicate more false alarms. If false alarms will cause major problems, perhaps a medium set size should be used to elicit more deliberate actions. Furthermore, the results suggest that, if specific shapes like the temperature gauge must be used, modifications should be made to improve performance.

In this research, there are several limitations to this study that are worth mentioning. First, this study was conducted using a simple test bed and with student participants. This is an area of future validation research. Although the team tried to replicate the workload that operators typically experience by introducing the flag matching task, the study lacked an operational context, and the random field of moving gauges does not represent real process operations. It is not clear how much the lack of an operational context and using random moving gauges would influence the results. However, the primary goal of the study was to test the effectiveness of each shape in terms of supporting change detection from a fundamental visual perception point of view.
