                  In this study, the air layer distribution and evaporative resistances of 39 sets of male Chinese ethnic clothing were investigated using a sweating thermal manikin and the three-dimensional (3D) body scanning technique. Relationships between the evaporative resistance and air layers (i.e., air gap thickness and air volume) were explored. The results demonstrated that the clothing total evaporative resistance increases with the increasing air gap size/air volume, but the rate of increase gradually decreases as the mean air gap size or the total air volume becomes larger. The clothing total evaporative resistance reaches its maximum when the average air gap size and the total air volume are 41.6 mm and 69.9 dm3, respectively. Similar general trends were also found between local mean air gap size and clothing local evaporative resistance at different body parts. However, different body parts show varied rates of increase and decrease in the local evaporative resistance. The research findings provide a comprehensive database for predicting overall and local human thermal comfort while wearing male Chinese ethnic clothing.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Clothing has a three dimensional shape and serves as a thermal and moisture barrier between the human body and environments. Both the fabric material and air layers inside the clothing affect heat and mass transfer through clothing and thereby, contribute to the clothing thermal insulation and evaporative resistance (Ding et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2002). On the other hand, clothing thermal comfort is mainly determined by evaporative resistance and thermal insulation. Clothing with a high evaporative resistance can greatly impede moisture transfer through clothing. Hence, a low clothing evaporative resistance (i.e., vapour permeable) is always preferred for the majority summer wear and protective clothing. Previous studies (Cubric et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2011) have demonstrated that fabric physical properties (e.g., air permeability, thickness, mass per unit area) and clothing design features (e.g., covering area, clothing layer distribution, closures, vents) have a tremendous impact on clothing evaporative resistance. Also, clothing evaporative resistance can largely be affected by environmental conditions, human body movements and body postures (Bernard, 1998; Belghazi et al., 2005; Caravello et al., 2008; Clifford et al., 1959; Havenith et al., 1990; Nielsen et al., 1987; Wang et al., 2012). Generally, air and body movements can greatly decrease clothing evaporative resistance. Clothing evaporative resistance determined in sedentary and supine postures is normally greater than that determined in a standing upright posture. In addition, garment fit can greatly affect clothing evaporative resistance (Chen et al., 2004). Usually, a loose-fitting garment has a higher evaporative resistance than a tight-fitting garment due to larger air layers entrapped inside the clothing.

Air layers may largely exist under, between and over clothing layers, on clothing fabric surfaces and in voids between adjacent yarns (Wilson et al., 2002). The determination of air gap distributions inside the clothing is complicated and challenging due to the complex geometry of clothing. Sullivan et al. (1987) developed a method to objectively determine the clothing microenvironment volume using an impermeable outer suit and a vacuum source. Chen et al. (2004) established a circumference model to estimate clothing air gap thickness. In recent years, advancement of modern technologies in three-dimensional (3-D) scanning has helped scientists to utilise 3D body scanners to determine the distribution of air layers inside the clothing (Kim et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2014; Mah and Song, 2010; Psikuta et al., 2012). Many researchers have explored the impact of air layers on clothing dry heat transfer, few studies have examined the effect of air gap on the moisture transfer property of fabric assemblies. Hes and de Araujo (2010) found that the relative water vapour permeability of the fabric with a small air gap is lower than that of the fabric with no air gap. Ding et al. (2011) discovered that fabric evaporative resistance increases with the increasing air gap size, but too big air gaps lead to a reduction in the evaporative resistance due to the occurrence of natural convection. It should be emphasized that all the aforementioned studies are focused on two dimensional textile fabrics. There is a lack of systematic study on the relationship between air layers and the evaporative resistance of full-scale clothing ensembles. Also, air layers entrapped inside the clothing vary greatly across the whole body and it is meaningful to investigate clothing local air layer distributions as well as to explore the relationship between local air layers and local evaporative resistances.

Further, the vast majority of published studies on clothing air layers and evaporative resistance have been focused on regular fitting western clothing and protective clothing. Although the heat transfer property of non-western clothing has been extensively examined (Al-ajmi et al., 2008; Havenith et al., 2015), comparatively little research work has been carried out to investigate the moisture transfer properties of non-western clothing. Non-western clothing, particularly Chinese traditional clothing, is so unique in clothing structures, garment fit and wearing styles that these unique features may greatly affect clothing moisture transfer property. Hence, it is of paramount importance to study the moisture transfer property of Chinese traditional clothing as well as to explore the relationship between air layers and evaporative resistance of Chinese ethnic clothing. In this study, the total/local air gap size/volume and clothing total/local evaporative resistance of 39 Chinese male ethnic costumes were investigated. Relationships between air layers and clothing evaporative resistance for the whole body and local body parts were also explored. The results may serve as a further extension of the clothing database for ASHRAE 55 (2013), ISO 7730 (2005), and ISO 9920 (2009).

@&#METHODS@&#

Thirty-nine sets of typical male Chinese ethnic clothing are selected from 39 (out of 55) ethnic minority groups (selected based mainly on the number of population). They are divided into 6 groups according to design characteristics. Group 1 (G1) is two-piece clothing including short-sleeve shirts or short dresses; Group 2 (G2) is robe-typed clothing; Group 3 (G3) is consisted of two-piece garments with short gowns and trousers or long dresses; Group 4 (G4) is comprised of long-sleeve coats and trousers with decorations; Group 5 (G5) includes robes and trousers; Group 6 (G6) is three-piece clothing. Table 1
                         shows the clothing components and physical properties of the selected 39 sets of clothing.

A 34-zone ‘Newton’ sweating manikin (Thermetrics, Seattle, WA, USA) is selected for measurements. Measurements of clothing thermal insulation strictly follow the ISO 15831 (2004) standard. For measurements on clothing evaporative resistance, a piece of stretchable tight-fitting polyester fabric ‘skin’ (‘skin’ thickness: 0.53 mm) is worn over the manikin body and the continuous water supply is used. The segmental surface temperature, heat loss and sweating rate can be controlled individually. All outputs (e.g., the heat loss, surface temperature, ambient temperature, relative humidity and air velocity) are recorded by the ThermDAC® software (Thermetrics, Seattle, WA, USA). To simplify the calculation of clothing local evaporative resistance as well as data analysis on air gaps, the 32 segments (the remaining 2 segments are hidden inside the manikin body and thus are excluded from calculations) are re-categorised into 11 main body parts.

To visualise and quantify the three-dimensional (3-D) body shape and clothing contour, a contactless VITUS smart 3-D whole body laser scanner (Human Solutions GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany) is used. A model mannequin with similar body geometry of the ‘Newton’ thermal manikin is used to replicate the clothing air layer between the thermal manikin and the tested clothing. Several nodules are attached at the forehead, cheek, posterior neck, hands, feet and ankles for the alignment of the nude scan and clothed scan. The nude and the dressed mannequin are scanned with the same posture at the same position, respectively. Each clothing ensemble is scanned for three times by dressing and undressing.

There are some missing areas in the scans where the scanner is not able to capture the data. An integral and smooth body surface is required to accurately calculate the air gap between the clothing and the mannequin. The scanned data are processed according to following procedures: first, the scan data are meshed; second, it is rewrapped and the holes are filled; subsequently, the healing wizard tool is applied and the refined mesh model is exported. Both the total and local meshed models at each body part are spliced and processed. The nude scan is defined as nominal data and the clothed scan is defined as scan data. To determine the air gap size and air volume, both nude and clothed scans are required to be aligned as precise as possible. The two scans can be aligned by several nodules and then the coordinates of the clothed scan is slightly shift to align those two scans perfectly. Body parts are sliced according to the body separation of the thermal manikin. Both the total and local air gap distribution over the body surface is characterised by different colour bars. Finally, the total and local air volume entrapped inside the clothing is calculated. All data analyses are performed with the Geomagic Qualify 12 software (3D Systems Inc., Rock Hill, SC).

Clothing evaporative resistance measurements follow the ASTM F2370 (2015) standard. The sweating manikin is operated in the constant temperature mode and all measurements are performed in a so-called isothermal condition (i.e., T

                           manikin
                         = T
                        
                           r
                         = 34.0 °C). The water temperature is set at 34.0 °C. A uniform sweating set rate of 800 ml/h m2 is assigned to each segment to ensure the fabric ‘skin’ is fully saturated over the whole body throughout the whole test duration. The relative humidity (RH) and the air velocity inside the climatic chamber (ESPEC Corp., Osaka, Japan) are 40 ± 5% (i.e., the partial water vapour pressure was 2.1 kPa) and 0.4 ± 0.1 m/s, respectively. The evaporative heat loss is recorded at 30-s intervals and 30 min steady-state data are selected for calculating the total and local clothing evaporative resistances. Both the manikin tests and the 3-D scanning tests for each clothing are repeated three times.

The total evaporative resistance of the boundary air layer and each clothing ensemble is calculated by the parallel method using the following equation

Under the 0.4 ± 0.1 m/s wind, the evaporative resistance of the boundary air layer is 8.1 m2 Pa/W. Table 2
                         presents the total air volume, the average air gap size, and the clothing total evaporative resistance of the 39 clothing ensembles. The total air volume of the 39 clothing ensembles is between 23.0 and 93.1 dm3, the average air gap ranges from 15.0 to 51.4 mm, and clothing total evaporative resistance ranges from 13.7 to 30.2 m2 Pa/W. Of all 39 clothing ensembles, the Tibetan costume presents the largest air volume and air gap size, whereas the Li costume exhibits the smallest air gaps. The Bonan costume has the largest clothing total evaporative resistance, whereas Li shows the lowest total evaporative resistance. Also, clothing ensembles in G1 are short-sleeved and the covering body area is the smallest of all six groups. Thus, the total evaporative resistance is the lowest (range from 13.7 to 16.8 m2 Pa/W). In contrast, clothing in G6 has a three-layer structure and covers the most of the body surface and hence, the reported clothing total evaporative resistance is the greatest (i.e., 23.6–30.2 m2 Pa/W).


                        Fig. 1
                        a and b shows the relationship between the air gap (i.e., the total air volume and the average air gap size) and clothing total evaporative resistance. It is clear that the clothing total evaporative resistance increases with the increasing total air volume (or the mean air gap size), but the rate of increase gradually decreases as the total air volume (or the average air gap size) becomes lager than 69.9 dm3 (or 41.6 mm). Considering the fact that the total evaporative resistance is equal to the boundary air layer's evaporative resistance (i.e., 8.1 m2 Pa/W) if no clothing was worn, regression equations with a forced point (0, 8.1) are developed and they are read as

In this study, the manikin's head, hands and feet are not covered by clothing. Thus, only eight main body parts (i.e., arms, chest, shoulders, abdomen, back, pelvis, thighs and lower legs) are examined. It can be deduced from Eq. (5) that clothing air gap size is linearly correlated with the total air volume. In this sub-section, only the relationship between the clothing local air gap size and local evaporative resistance at the eight body parts is discussed. The local air gap size and clothing local evaporative resistance of all 39 clothing ensembles are displayed in Fig. 2
                        a and b, respectively. It is observed that the legs (i.e., lower legs and thighs) has the biggest air gap size, followed by arms, the back and the pelvis, whereas the chest and shoulders show the smallest air layer. In contrast, the local evaporative resistance at the back is the biggest, followed by the pelvis, thighs and the abdomen, whereas the chest and arms present the smallest value.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the relationship between clothing local evaporative resistance and local mean air gap size for the eight main body parts. It is clear that, for all eight body parts, the clothing local evaporative resistance increases with the increasing local mean air gap size, but the increment rate gradually decreases as the local air gap size becomes larger. Also, rates of increase and decrease in the local clothing evaporative resistance at different body parts vary greatly. For instance, clothing local evaporative resistance at the abdomen reaches its maximum when the local air gap size is 17.0 mm, whereas the maximum local evaporative resistance at the chest is found at the air gap size of 75.6 mm. Considering the fact that local R
                        
                           e,j
                         should be equal to the local boundary air layer's evaporative resistance if no clothing was worn, regression equations with a forced point (0, R
                        
                           ea,j

                         summarises the coefficients, correlation coefficient R2 and the maximum of the second-order parabola curves for each of the eight body parts.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify the relationship between air layers and clothing evaporative resistance of non-western clothing. This study has clearly demonstrated that local air gaps are unevenly distributed across the clothing microclimate. The results show that there is a downward-opening parabolic relationship between the mean air gap size and clothing total evaporative resistance. The clothing total evaporative resistance increases with the increasing air gap size/volume, but the rate of increase gradually decreases as the air gap size/volume becomes larger. Similarly, downward-opening parabolic relationships have been widely observed between local mean air gap size and clothing local evaporative resistance at different body parts, though the rates of increase and decrease vary greatly among the eight body parts.

The total thermal insulation and total evaporative resistance of the 39 male Chinese clothing ensembles range from 0.81 to 1.48 clo and 13.7–30.2 m2 Pa/W, respectively. The permeability index (i
                     
                        m
                     , dimensionless) of those 39 clothing ensembles ranges from 0.44 to 0.56 accordingly. Hence, those ensembles can be categorised as permeable (i
                     
                        m
                      > 0.38 [McCullough et al., 1989]). Our reported clothing total evaporative resistance values are comparable to those of western daily wear clothing listed in ISO 9920 (Table C2) but much lower than those of work clothing presented in ISO 9920 (i.e., Table C3). Havenith et al. (2015) measured and calculated the thermal insulation and vapour permeability of 52 sets of non-western clothing selected from seven countries and the reported clothing permeability index ranges from 0.27 to 0.54. The permeability index of all clothing ensembles except the Chinese clothing and some Nigerian/Gahanna ensembles is lower than 0.38 and hence they may only be categorised as low permeable. Our results are in good line with that of Chinese clothing (i
                     
                        m
                      = 0.40) reported by Havenith et al. (2015).

The reported total evaporative resistances of the 39 sets of male Chinese clothing ensembles are slightly lower than those of similar non-western ensembles chosen in Havenith et al.'s study (Havenith et al., 2015). There are three possible reasons for these differences. One reason is due to different calculation methods. The clothing evaporative resistances of all 39 male Chinese clothing ensembles in our study are calculated by the heat loss method using the saturated fabric ‘skin’ temperature. In contrast, Havenith et al. (2015) calculated clothing evaporative resistance from the constant manikin surface temperature. Some researchers (Wang et al., 2011; Ueno and Sawada, 2012) have found that the total evaporative resistance calculated from the manikin surface temperature is always higher than that computed from the wet fabric ‘skin’ temperature. A second reason is due to different test conditions selected for measurements. In our study, we selected an isothermal condition (i.e., T
                     
                        air
                      = T
                     
                        manikin
                      = T
                     
                        r
                      = 34.0 °C, RH = 40%, v
                     
                        air
                      = 0.4 m/s) to measure the clothing total evaporative resistance, whereas Havenith et al. selected a non-isothermal condition (T
                     
                        air
                      = 20 °C, RH = 40%, v
                     
                        air
                      = 0.4 m/s) to determine clothing evaporative resistance. The clothing evaporative resistance determined in non-isothermal condition tends to be greater than that measured in isothermal conditions due to the occurrence of condensation and the selection of the mass loss method (Wang, 2011). The third reason is that hat/scarf and shoes are excluded in our study, whereas Havenith et al. (2015) have included both shoes and hat/scarf in their tested clothing ensembles.

Further, the total air volume and the average air gap size of the 39 sets Chinese clothing ensembles range from 23.0 to 93.1 dm3 and 15.0–51.4 mm, respectively. Lu et al. (2014) found the total air volume of single layer thermal protective coveralls is in the range of 35–60 dm3. Daanen et al. (2005) reported that the total air volume of the air suit is around 33 dm3. Thus, the reported mean air gap size of the 39 sets of male Chinese clothing except the extremely loose-fitting Tibetan, Buoyei, Yi and Bonan costumes is consistent with those of thermal protective coveralls. Furthermore, our study reconfirms that the clothing total evaporative resistance increases with the increasing mean air gap size or total air volume, but the increase rate gradually decreases as the mean air gap size or the total air volume exceeds a certain value. This general trend is consistent with the findings of Chen et al. (2004). In Chen et al.'s study, it is found that the total evaporative resistance of jackets reaches its maximum when the estimated mean air gap thickness is about 10–11 mm. In our study, the clothing total evaporative resistance reaches its maximum when the mean air gap size is 41.6 mm. The difference may be because Chen et al. only examined the upper body clothing while we investigated both the upper and lower body clothing.

With regard to local air layer distributions, it is found that the air gap size at the chest and shoulders is lower than that at the arms, thighs and lower legs, which is consistent with Lu et al.'s study (2014). The local evaporative resistance at the chest and arms is lower than that at the pelvis and the back. For lower legs, loose fitting robes/trousers permit better air ventilation, and thus the local evaporative resistance at these regions is small. In addition, for each local body part, a downward-opening parabolic relationship between the local air gap size and local evaporative resistance is registered. However, the maximum (i.e., vertex) of the down-opening parabolic curves varies greatly among different body parts. The reasons for those big differences are complicated. Clothing accessories and overlap structure can change the leading coefficient of the parabolic curve. For example, decorations located on the chest region of the Tibetan and Bonan costumes increase the clothing local evaporative resistance at the chest but they have almost no impact on the air gap size. If these two costumes were excluded, the local evaporative resistance of the chest reaches its maximum when the air gap size is 7.7 mm (75.6 mm including Tibetan and Bonan costumes). Also, the pelvis, thighs or lower legs are always covered by multi-layer clothing (e.g., costumes in G5 and G6). This can lead to a greater local evaporative resistance at these body parts but without greatly changing the air gap size, and thus decreases the correlation factor. Besides, waist belts can reduce the air gap at such body parts as the abdomen and the back, but might not pronouncedly decrease the local evaporative resistance due to the adding belts. Hence, they may also change the trend of the parabolic curve.

Finally, this study has some limitations. The reported air gaps entrapped inside the multi-layer clothing ensembles consist of several layers, this study fails to determine separate air layer distributions, though it seems challenging to investigate separate air layer distributions inside the multi-layer clothing. Second, only the mean air gap size of the whole body and each body part is analysed. The unevenly distribution of air gaps affects the dry heat transfer (Mert et al., 2015; Psikuta et al., 2012), and might also have a detrimental impact on the clothing moisture transfer property. Also, all clothing is made in one size and the effect of clothing fit on local evaporative resistance hasn't been investigated yet. Lastly, only the static air gap distributions are examined in this study and future work is required to investigate the dynamic air layer distributions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We investigated the air layer distribution and evaporative resistance of 39 sets of male Chinese ethnic clothing ensembles. All those clothing ensembles can be categorised as permeable clothing and they have a better moisture transfer capacity than western clothing and the majority non-western clothing studied in documented literature. Results have demonstrated that the air gaps are unevenly distributed over the body, and thereby the clothing local evaporative resistance at different body parts varies greatly. A downward-opening parabolic relationship between the mean air gap size and the clothing total evaporative resistance is discovered. The total evaporative resistance reaches its maximum when the average air gap size is 41.6 mm. Similarly, downward-opening parabolic relationships between local mean air gap size and clothing local evaporative resistance for different body parts are also found. Nevertheless, different body parts show varied rates of increase and decrease in the clothing local evaporative resistance. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on thermal properties of non-western ethnic clothing and the relationship between clothing moisture transfer property and fit. This study also provides a scientific basis for designing non-western ethnic clothing with improved wear thermal comfort.
