                  The widespread availability of the Internet and the variety of Internet-based applications have resulted in a significant increase in the amount of web pages. Determining the behaviors of search engine users has become a critical step in enhancing search engine performance. Search engine user behaviors can be determined by content-based or content-ignorant algorithms. Although many content-ignorant studies have been performed to automatically identify new topics, previous results have demonstrated that spelling errors can cause significant errors in topic shift estimates. In this study, we focused on minimizing the number of wrong estimates that were based on spelling errors. We developed a new hybrid algorithm combining character n-gram and neural network methodologies, and compared the experimental results with results from previous studies. For the FAST and Excite datasets, the proposed algorithm improved topic shift estimates by 6.987% and 2.639%, respectively. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of the character n-gram method in different aspects including the comparison with Levenshtein edit-distance method. The experimental results demonstrated that the character n-gram method outperformed to the Levensthein edit distance method in terms of topic identification.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, applied researchers have become increasingly interested in correctly estimating the behaviors of search engine users to improve the performance of search engines. In order to determine these behaviors, researchers have investigated search engine query logs and classified them as topic continuation or topic shifts. For example, if a user continues to search on the same topic or content, the previous query is labeled as a topic continuation. Conversely, if a user changes the topic, the previous query is labeled as a topic shift. Using this approach, researchers have to improve the accuracy of search engine results.

Numerous studies based on content-based (semantic) and content-ignorant (non-semantic) methods have been developed to determine topic shifts and continuations in the transaction logs of search engine users. Content-based approaches, which use dictionaries and thesauruses, are complicated, because these tools must be created and stored (Leung, Ng, & Dik, 2008). Although content-based methods identify new topics more successfully than content-ignorant methods, the content-ignorant methods have the advantages of speed and low memory requirements, which are essential in real-time applications. Further, these methods yield satisfactory results for new topic identification problems during search engine user sessions (Leung et al., 2008). Therefore, in this study content-ignorant methods were used to identify new topics.

Content-ignorant methodologies consider the statistical characteristics of consecutive queries, such as the duration, and the set of common and different terms. Spink, Ozmutlu, and Ozmutlu (2002) and Goker and He (2000) conducted some of the first studies linking the statistical characteristics of queries to topic changes. Various content-ignorant methods have been developed to identify new topics using the same datasets and performance parameters. Some of these methods include the Dempster-Shafer theory and genetic algorithms (He, Goker, & Harper, 2002; Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005a; Ozmutlu, Cavdur, & Ozmutlu, 2006), conditional probabilities (Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, & Buyuk, 2007), Monte-Carlo simulations (Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, & Buyuk, 2008a), and neural networks (Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005b; Ozmutlu, Cavdur, & Ozmutlu, 2008b; Ozmutlu, Cavdur, Spink, & Ozmutlu, 2004a; Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, & Cosar, 2011).

These methods are limited in their ability to detect correct topic changes when consecutive queries have synonymous words or spelling errors. For example, content-ignorant methodologies cannot estimate topic continuation when subsequent queries such as “X Hotel” and “Y Inn” are included in a user session, so they generate a topic shift estimate as expected. The content-ignorant methodologies cannot recognize that the synonymous words are related, because they do not use a dictionary or a thesaurus. Further, if consecutive queries contain spelling errors, no new topic identification algorithm, whether it is a content-based or a content-ignorant algorithm, can recognize these terms are related which causes errors in topic shift estimates. For example, when content-ignorant methodologies must process two consecutive single-term queries, such as “cybersc@n” and “cyberscan”, which are the actual subsequent queries found in the FAST dataset, the two terms are not considered to be related because they do not exactly match. As a result, the two subsequent queries will be considered to be unrelated.


                     Topic continuations cannot be detected without a dictionary when consecutive queries contain synonymous words; however, if consecutive queries contain spelling errors, topic changes can be detected by using the typing information contained in the queries, which has been ignored in previous content-ignorant methods.

In consecutive queries, the majority of the characters in the words with spelling errors remain the same. In nearly all spelling errors, a single character has been mistyped, or two consecutive characters have been switched. Since the majority of the characters in the mistyped words are correct (the “cybersc@n” example given above), the use of a similarity measure could improve the performance of new topic identification algorithms by eliminating incorrect topic shift estimates due to spelling errors. The error model approach has been used to correct spelling with a dictionary, with correction probabilities and with an edit distance matrix. To eliminate the complexity of spelling error detection methods and to avoid the use of a dictionary, we chose the character n-gram method. Although this method detects spelling errors using typing information from consecutive queries, it does not perform well regardless of the statistical characteristics of queries. Therefore, the best previous method is combined with the character n-gram method to make use of the statistical characteristics and typing information of consecutive queries.

Based on the previous studies about the new topic identification problem, the artificial neural network algorithm is chosen to be integrated into the character n-gram algorithm because it generates the most accurate estimates when used in the new topic identification problem (Ozmutlu et al., 2011). In this study, a hybrid algorithm based on the character n-gram and artificial neural network methods have been developed to eliminate the incorrect estimates caused by spelling mistakes while enhancing the performance of the existing algorithms. Comparison of the results from the new hybrid methodology and the artificial neural network algorithm shows that the proposed algorithm offers significant improvements.

In addition, the performance of the suggested method is compared with one of the well-known similarity measurement method; the Levenshtein edit-distance. Moreover, original datasets are updated by different spelling correction methods (Bing, Google and ASPELL) to evaluate the effectiveness of the character n-gram method. Comparison of the results demonstrates that the character 2-grams method outperforms to the Levenshtein edit-distance, and the Google search engine can be used as a pre-processed spelling correction method.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, previous studies on the new topic identification problem and character n-gram methodologies are reviewed. In Section 3, the data sources, study notation and definition of the character n-gram are presented with examples. Experimental results from the character n-gram method and the proposed method are described in Section 4. In Sections 5, a detailed analysis of the character n-gram method is presented, and in Sections 6 and 7, the study is summarized and the limitations and future applications are discussed.

Web search engine data logs have been used in many studies by researchers such as Silverstein, Henzinger, Marais, and Moricz (1999), Cooley, Mobasher, and Srivastava (1999), Spink, Bateman, and Jansen (1999), Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, and Saracevic (2001), Spink, Jansen, Blakely, and Koshman (2006), Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2004b), Ozmutlu et al. (2006) which are based on statistical or linguistic characteristics of web search queries (Pu, Chuang, & Yang, 2002).

As usual, content-based algorithms work with dictionaries and thesaurus; they are more expensive and difficult to be implemented due to the requirement of creating and storing these dictionaries. Thus, there is only limited number of content-based studies in literature for the new topic identification in user sessions; mostly they are used for natural language processing, classification and clustering.


                     Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, and Saracevic (2001), aimed to determine the behaviors of search engine users by examining more than one million queries from the Excite search engine. They ignored logic expressions in the queries, and they used the Intelligent Concept Extraction which is a method of making connection between terms. In this study, some useful data were gathered such as, number of total users, queries, repeated queries and unique queries. The usage ratio of similar pages was determined with content-based methods, the classification of queries and the distributions of these classes were determined. According to the results, 16.9% of the queries were included in entertainment subject, 16.8% of them were included in sexual subject contents, and 10% of the queries were related with science and health. Most of the queries had simple content and less than 3 words, few of them had complex content because most of the users did not go beyond to second result page. Further, the frequency of terms used during search was low because query language was very rich so the sessions were mostly formed by unique queries.

One of the studies about personalization of search engines belongs to Leung et al. (2008). To improve the queries for more efficient researches, popular and advanced search engines propose various search alternatives related with search topics. Although search engines offer useful alternatives, they cannot detect the interest of users. Thus, the authors developed a method based on personalized concept-based clustering techniques to generate personalized proposals for the users. The authors used clickthrough data to generate query suggestions according to user preferences. They defined the relationship between queries, users and documents by expanding the scope of graph-based clustering algorithm which was developed by Beeferman and Berger (2000). They developed a Google interface which tracks the user clicks to collect clickthrough data. This interface recorded the data whenever user clicks on a search result. They tried to identify similar queries with content-based methods using the database of records. The study results showed that the improved method could generate personalized query proposals considering users’ conceptual requirements. Further, it was observed that the new clustering algorithm was able to yield better results compared to the previous clustering algorithms.

Besides their complexity in real time applications, content-based studies are troublesome and costly. Although successful results can be acquired through these methods, researchers prefer content-ignorant statistical methods in real time applications because of the disadvantages of content-based methods. Content-ignorant methods are simpler and less expensive than content-based methods, and they can obtain realistic results by interpreting collected data statistically.

Web researchers use web search engines for various purposes such as classification, clustering or new topic identification. Jansen, Booth, and Spink (2007) tried to classify search engine user intent; informational, navigational and transactional intent. They found that more than 80% of web queries were informational and about 20% of web queries were navigational and transactional queries. Similar to the classification, some researchers performed content analysis of Web search engine data logs at the term level; they observed that the highest ranking terms were related to topics of entertainment, pornography, and education (Spink et al., 2001).

Further, exploring the behavioral changes throughout the day could provide important data about the behaviors of search engine users. For this purpose Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2004b) performed statistical and topical analysis of about 1 million queries from the Excite and the FAST search engines. They found that the popularity of topics was diverse throughout the day. For example, topics such as finance, business and education were more popular during the earlier hours of the day whereas entertainment and pornography were more prevalent during the evening. Also Beitzel, Jensen, Chowdhury, Grossman, and Frieder (2004) reached similar results in their study.

In addition to diversity of interested topics, search engine users can be interested in multiple topics at the same user session. Spink et al. (2002) called this research behavior multitasking and defined multitasking as “the process of searches over time in relation to more than one, possibly evolving, set of information problems including changes or shifts in beliefs, cognitive, affective, and/or situational states”. Researchers observed that 1.4% of the Excite search engine users and 31.8% of the FAST search engine users performed multitasking searches.

Numerous studies have been developed based on query clustering models and algorithms to investigate search engine users behaviors. Beeferman and Berger (2000) and Wen, Nie, and Zhang (2002) applied the query clustering methods to search engine query logs, including clickthrough data. Leung et al. (2008) explored a methodology to develop personalized search engines based on Beerferman and Berger’s graph-based clustering algorithm. Muresan and Harper (2004) proposed a topic modeling system for developing mediated queries. The terms in a set of documents were analyzed statistically and then represented as a lexicographic model of the query. The context analysis was applied on the mediated queries based on the similarity of terms to specific topics. Giacomo, Didimo, Grilli, Liotta, and Palladino (2007) affirmed that classical search engines had a weak point in the presentation of results, and alternatively new generation search engines which are called web clustering engines have been designed. According to Giacomo et al. (2007) web clustering engines organized search results into set of clusters, and each cluster contained web pages that were semantically related to each other. They used various clustering algorithms to achieve this classification.

Alternatively content-ignorant methods can be used for query clustering or new topic identification in a search session. In such an approach, queries can be categorized in different groups of topics respect to their statistical characteristics, such as time intervals between subsequent queries. He et al. (2002) proposed a topic identification algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer, 1976). The algorithm identified topic changes automatically using statistical data obtained from Web search logs. The probabilities and the weights (importance) of events and a threshold were used by Dempster-Shafer theory to detect topic shifts. Probabilities of a topic shift (or continuation) based on a single factor (the time interval or the search pattern of the subsequent queries) were easily obtained through the analysis of the data log. To set the required weights and the threshold, the authors applied a genetic algorithm. The researchers concluded that the Dempster-Shafer theory could be used for the purpose of new topic identification successfully. Moreover, this approach was replicated by some researchers such as, Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a) and Ozmutlu et al. (2006).

Due to the advantages of content-ignorant methodologies, numerous studies have been performed for the purpose of new topic identification. For example, Ozmutlu et al. (2004a) and Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005b) used artificial neural networks to identify the topic changes automatically by content-ignorant methods. In addition to these studies Ozmutlu et al. (2007) proposed conditional probabilities for automatic new topic identification, and Ozmutlu et al. (2008a) applied Monte-Carlo simulation for the same reason to the same data. Ozmutlu et al. (2011) developed another neural network approach for the same data and they reached better results than the other methods. The statistical characteristics of the query log were the inputs of the neural network, whereas the binary response of topic shift/continuation was the output of the neural network. In this study, the data were cleaned from regular words found in the transaction logs, such as “AND”, “OR”, and then regarding to the statistical characteristics of queries, such as time intervals and search patterns, the neural network method was applied to the queries with the aim of identifying topic changes in a user session (Ozmutlu et al., 2011).

In previous studies by Ozmutlu et al., 2004a,b, 2006, 2007, 2008a,b; Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005a,b, the same datasets and comparison parameters were used to logically compare different approaches. Based on these comparisons as presented in Table 1
                      for the Excite dataset and in Table 2
                      for the FAST dataset, the neural network application generated better estimate results than the previous studies (Ozmutlu et al., 2011).

Content-ignorant methodologies do not improve upon the results given in previous studies. Further, two important problems that cannot be solved by content-ignorant methods have been identified (Ozmutlu et al., 2011). The first problem arises from spelling differences in subsequent queries, and the second problem arises from content-based mistakes, such as synonymous words. Because content-ignorant methodologies do not consider the meanings of queries, they cannot recognize topic continuation between sequential queries that include synonymous words. Conversely, in sequential queries that contain spelling differences, some portions of the queries often remain unchanged. This finding prompted us to identify a methodology that can detect similarities within words.

Many researchers have used error model approach for spelling correction. Brill and Moore (2000) developed a new error model using the position probabilities of words’ partitions, which were calculated based on a dictionary, for noisy channel spelling correction. They used a training set consists of string pairs, spelling errors and correct spellings of the words. They calculated distances between letters, and after editing operations, they found the probabilities of each substitution. Using a dictionary (includes 200,000 entries) and the probabilities, they tested their model with a 10,000-word corpus of common English spelling errors, paired with their correct spelling. They concluded that the new error model had a significant improvement in performance compared to the previous studies. Cucerzan and Brill (2004) developed an iterative approach for spelling correction of search engine queries. They used a modified Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance (Damerau, 1964) and a prior probability information of correction. They performed two approaches with and without a trusted lexicon. They developed a successful approach for spelling correction task of search query logs using their collective information. This study demonstrated that the Levenshtein edit-distance method without lexicon could be used as a content-ignorant method to detect spelling mistakes in search engine query logs for the purpose of new topic identification. However, detecting only spelling mistakes would not be sufficient for the new topic identification, hence this situation prompted us to search more effective tools that can detect similarities within words including spelling mistakes.

The n-gram methodology is widely used in statistical language modeling for the purpose of predicting the next word given previous words. The n-gram language models make an assumption that the probability of the next word depends upon the last n
                     −1 words. Shannon (1951) tried to guess next letter in a text with Shannon game. After Shannon’s studies, many estimate methods have been developed, but the n-gram method is remained the simplest and the most successful method in language modeling (Huang, Peng, An, Shuurmans, & Cercone, 2003). Damashek (1995) used the n-grams for measuring topical similarity in an unrestricted text. Huang et al. (2003) identified boundaries of sessions using n-grams in a large collection of Livelink log data. Canvar and Trenkle (1994) researched electronic documents, and they calculated the frequency of n-grams in terms of textual errors, such as spelling and grammatical errors. Roark, Saraclar, and Collins (2007) used a discriminative n-gram approach for speech recognition. Briefly, the n-gram language modeling can be used for speech or optical character recognition, spelling correction, handwriting recognition, and statistical machine translation.

Although the n-gram method works with word sequences in a huge amount of text, spelling errors cannot be detected without considering words in characteristic review. The spelling errors in sequential queries can be detected by character n-grams. Therefore, using the character n-grams for predicting topic continuations in search engine queries is more logical than using the word n-grams.

The use of character n-grams in language modeling dates back to Shannon (1951). The researcher made contributions to the information retrieval theory, and he also described a sequence of the character n-gram and the word n-gram approximations to English (McNamee & Mayfield, 2004). After this research, implementations of the character n-gram method increased rapidly. McNamee and Mayfield (2004) used the character n-gram method for multilingual text retrieval. They aimed to demonstrate that the character n-gram tokenization can provide retrieval accuracy better than the other language-specific approaches. Liu and Keselj (2007) studied about automatic classification of web user navigation patterns, and they implemented the character n-gram method for capturing textual content of web pages. Kamaris and Stamatatos (2007) studied about webpage genre identification for improving the quality of search engines, and they applied the character n-gram method to identify of webpage genres. Chau, Lu, Fang, and Yang (2009) researched the character usage of Chinese search logs from Chinese search engines. Since the character n-gram method is independent from language, they implemented this method to their study without any difficulty. Vilares, Vilares, and Otero (2011) used the classic stemming-based methods and the character n-gram method for the purpose of identifying spelling mistakes and make corrections in Spanish. They compared these methods and showed performance results in their study. In addition to these studies, the character n-gram method also has been used in handwriting recognition (El-Nasan A. & M., 2002; Senda & Yamada, 2001).

Researchers have developed various content-ignorant methods for the purpose of new topic identification. These methods have focused primarily on the statistical characteristics of queries rather than on typing information. As a result, recently developed methods cannot detect spelling errors or similarities between words in consecutive queries, which are important in topic identification. The aim of this study is to reduce the number of topic identification failures by using typing information from consecutive queries. We develop a character n-gram method that uses similarities between sequential queries and apply it to datasets that have been used in previous studies. Comparing the results of the character n-gram method with results from previous methods, we show that using typing information from the queries rather than the statistical characteristics of the queries is not sufficient for new topic identification. Thus, we combine the best previous method with the character n-gram method to make use of the statistical characteristics and the typing information of the queries. The results show that combining these methods ensures the accurate identification of new topics. Moreover we also compare our proposed method with well-known spelling detection methods, and we present that our methodology outperforms to these methods in terms of accurate identification of new topics.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#


                        Data collection: To avoid any performance bias in the proposed algorithm, datasets that have been used in previous studies are selected (Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005a,b; Ozmutlu et al., 2004a,b, 2006, 2007, 2008a,b, 2011). The first dataset is collected from the FAST search engine (http://www.alltheweb.com) and provide a query log of 1.257.891 queries. The second dataset is collected from the Excite search engine (http://www.excite.com) and provide a query log of 1.7 million queries for analysis. The data log structures of the Excite and FAST search engines are similar. From the Excite and FAST results, samples of 10.007 and 10.256 queries are selected, respectively, using Poisson sampling (Ozmutlu, Spink, & Ozmutlu, 2002). This approach provides sample datasets from both search engines that are statistically representative of the entire dataset yet small enough to be analyzed conveniently. The sample size is relatively small because evaluations of the algorithm’s performance would require a human expert to review all the queries. The datasets are not added to this paper because of their magnitude, but they are available to interested researchers. Details about the datasets can be found in Ozmutlu et al. (2004a, 2006, 2007, 2008a,b, 2011), Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a,b).


                        Evaluation by a human expert: The actual topic shifts and continuations in the Excite and FAST datasets are identified and marked by a human expert rather than by a software program. This step is necessary to determine how accurately topic shifts and continuations are identified by the proposed approach.


                        Separating datasets into two sets: The datasets are divided into two approximately equal sections. The first section is used to train the developed methodologies, and the second section is used to test the performance of the approaches. The methods are only tested with these datasets to ensure the consistency with results from previous methods and to facilitate logical comparisons. The last query of each session is not included in the analyses because it has no subsequent queries for identifying topic continuations or shifts. Thus, the size of the datasets is reduced, as shown in Table 3
                        . Only 3394 queries from the Excite dataset and 4484 queries from the FAST dataset are used.


                        Identification of search pattern and time interval of each dataset query: 
                        Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a) investigated queries with the same IP addresses and defined search patterns for consecutive queries. The search patterns are summarized in Table 4
                        , and their definitions can be found in Appendix A.

Each dataset query is categorized in terms of its search pattern and time interval. The classification of the search patterns is based on the consecutive queries within a user session, which are automatically identified by a computer program described in Appendix B. The time interval is the difference of the arrival times of two consecutive queries. It is determined with respect to the length of the difference of the arrival times of two consecutive queries.

The statistical characteristics of queries such as the time interval and the search pattern have been used to determine topic changes in queries (Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005a,b; Ozmutlu et al., 2004a, 2006, 2007, 2008a,b, 2011). In such methods, topic shifts and continuations are estimated based on the statistical characteristics of the queries. Thus, correctly identifying the search patterns and time intervals is essential to new topic identification.

The notation used in this study is described below.

                        Session: The entire set of queries issued by a user or an application to achieve a certain searching task over time. A session can be as short as one query, or it may contain many unique and repeated queries.


                        Topic shift: A change from one topic to another between queries within a single user session.


                        Topic continuation: Staying on the same topic from one query to another within a single user session.


                        Nshift: The number of queries labeled as topic shifts by the proposed method.

                           correct: The number of queries labeled as topic continuation by the proposed method and by the human expert.


                        Type A error: This type of error occurs in situations in which queries on the same topics are considered as separate topic groups.


                        Type B error: This type of error occurs in situations in which queries on different topics are grouped together into a single topic group.

The performance measures Precision (P) and Recall (R) are used to compare the performance results with the results of previous studies. The aim of these measures is to estimate the numbers of topic shifts and continuations correctly. Additional information about these measures can be found in Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005b) and Ozmutlu et al. (2006).

When alternative statistical methods improve a specific performance parameter, other parameters tend to deteriorate contrary to the desired result. In this case, the performance parameters P and R are inversely proportional, and an increment of one parameter adversely affects the other’s performance. To overcome this interaction, the fifth measure Fß_shift
                        , which combines Pshift
                         and Rshift
                        , can be used as a single parameter to compare the results from different studies. Similarly, the sixth fitness function measure Fß_contin
                         (Eq. (10)) can be used similarly to the Fß_shift
                         measure by combining Pcontin
                         and Rcontin
                         into a single value. To be consistent with previous automatic new topic identification studies, ß is chosen as 1.3 in this study. The calculations of these measures are as follows:

Web search engine users generally use common expressions to extend their queries. Although these terms are necessary for queries, they cause incorrect estimates in non-semantic based algorithms. The cleaning process eliminates common terms in sequential queries and helps to reduce incorrect estimates. For example, consecutive queries such as “www.expose.com” and “www.expert.com” are labeled as topic continuation due to the similarity of the terms. After the cleaning process, these queries are changed into “expose” and “expert”, and the algorithms are able to label them as topic shift. The cleaning process is the most essential element affecting the performance of the algorithms.

The order of cleaning is also important in this process. First, all letters in the dataset are changed to lower case. Then, operators and common words such as “.”, “,”, “;”, “+”, “:”, “%”, “&”, “[]”, “()”, “’”, “!”, “$”, “/”, “
                           
                              ⧹
                           
                        ”, “<”, “>”, “www”, “http”, “com”, “uk”, “au”, “edu”, “and”, “or”, “on”, “of”, “at”, “in”, “a”, “an”, “for”, and “to” are removed from the dataset by replacing them with space.


                        Robertson and Willett (1998) define an n-gram as a sub-sequence of n characters from a given word. Namely, in the character n-gram approach, n consecutive letters of a word are selected, beginning with the first letter. Then, the second n consecutive letters of the word are selected beginning with the second letter. This process continues until the selected n-gram is the last n characters of the given word. For example, “mountain” can be represented with the character n-grams shown in Table 5
                        . The first column indicates the predetermined n values of 2, 3 and 4, which are named as 2-grams, 3-grams and 4-grams respectively. The second column shows the results of the character n-gram method for specific n values, which are represented as the character 2-grams, the character 3-grams, and the character 4-grams from now. For example, if we generate the character n-grams using the n value of 2, this means that we use the character 2-grams method for the new topic identification.

The comparison process for queries varies according to the number of words that exist in consecutive queries. If two consecutive queries contain a single word, the n-gram pairs are generated using the predetermined n for both words. For instance, if consecutive queries contain “cyberscan” and “cybersc@n”, which are examples from the FAST dataset, the resulting n-gram pairs are given in Table 6
                        , with n values of 2, 3 and 4.

To determine the similarity of consecutive queries, we define a threshold value. The character n-gram method makes a decision by comparing this value with the similarity ratio, which is defined as the ratio of identical n-grams versus the total number of n-grams. The similarity ratio can be calculated as follows:

                         is the second word used for the character n-gram comparison.

According to the example in Table 5, the similarity ratio of “cybersc@n” and“cyberscan” is 
                           
                              
                                 6

                           =
                           0.
                           75
                         for the character 2-grams. With a user-defined threshold of 0.7, the similarity ratio exceeds the determined threshold. In this case, the character n-gram method concludes that these words are similar and labels the first query as topic continuation. If the queries contain more than one word, the character n-gram method labels the first query as topic continuation when the similarity ratio of at least one word exceeds the threshold. For example, if we consider the consecutive queries “buddhism” and “buddhist greetings” from the Excite dataset, the similarity ratio will be 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    6
                                 
                                 
                                    7
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0.857
                           
                         for the character 2-grams because of the “buddhism” and “buddhist” words. If we assume the threshold is 0.7, the character 2-grams method concludes that these queries are similar, and labels the first query as topic continuation. This approach is a logical progression for the classification of search patterns.


                        Topic shifts and topic continuations can be identified automatically by the character n-gram methodology in the following steps:


                        A
                        0
                        : i
                        =1.


                        A
                        1
                        : Apply the character n-gram approach to the queries that occur in the same search engine session. Label queries as “current query: qi
                        ” and “next query: qi+
                        
                        1” sequentially. Separate current query into its words and send every word to an array. Repeat this step for the next query.


                        A
                        2: Separate the words of the current and next queries into their characters according to n. Send these separated n-grams to different arrays. There are now two different arrays for the current and next queries.


                        A
                        3
                        : Compare the first word’s n-grams for the current and next queries. Calculate the similarity ratio based on the same character n-grams. If the similarity ratio exceeds the threshold, then estimate topic continuation. Until the similarity ratio exceeds the threshold, continue to compare all possible word pairs, as shown in Fig. 1
                        . If the calculated similarity ratio never exceeds the threshold, then estimate topic shift.
                     


                        A
                        4
                        : After the estimate, increase i. If qi
                        
                        +1 is the last query in a session, go to a new session and define the next two queries as the current query and the next query. Otherwise, change qi
                        
                        +1 to the current query (i=i
                        +1) and label the following query as the next query. Then return A
                        1.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In this study, we use the character n-gram method for new topic identification without combining it with another approach, and we research its performance on estimating topic changes. Experiments with the Excite and FAST datasets are replicated for different threshold and n values. Considering the number of words in queries, the threshold interval is determined to be 0.5–0.7 and the n value interval is 1–4. We present our findings in Tables 7–10
                        
                        
                        
                        .

As shown in Table 7, the character n-gram method estimates fewer topic shifts for small threshold and n values. Increasing the threshold and n values, increases the number of topic shift estimates. Compared to the human expert results, the character n-gram method always estimates more topic shifts, except for the 1-grams and threshold value 0.5. More topic shift estimates increase the number of Type A errors. Conversely, the character n-gram method estimates fewer topic continuations than the human expert, except with the 1-grams and threshold value 0.5. Moreover, these estimates are inversely proportional to the n and threshold values. The number of topic continuation estimates decreases as the n and threshold values increase, eventually dropping below the number of human expert results.

We calculate the performance parameters of the model for the Excite dataset with different n and threshold values, and present our findings in Table 8. The character n-gram method performs differently with different n and the threshold values. The Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) results are successful, and after evaluating these findings, we choose the character 2-grams method and the threshold value of 0.7, to compare the character n-gram method with previous methods.

Similar experiments are performed for the FAST dataset. The findings are detailed in Tables 9 and 10. Although the initial size of the FAST sample is 10,007 queries, the sample size decreases to 9044 queries because the last queries of the sessions are ignored. To compare the character n-gram method with previous methods, only the test sample of FAST dataset (4484 queries) is used for analysis. According to Table 9, the performance of the character n-gram method in terms of Type A and Type B errors varies for different n and threshold values. Compared to the human expert findings, the character n-gram method overestimates topic shifts, increasing the number of Type A errors. Conversely, the character n-gram method estimates fewer topic continuations than the human expert. Further, these estimates are inversely proportional to the n and threshold values. The estimated number of topic continuation instances decreases as the n and threshold values increase, eventually falling below the human expert results. These situations reduce Type B errors.

We calculate the performance parameters of the model for the FAST dataset with different n and threshold values, and illustrate our findings in Table 10. The performance of the character n-gram method varies based on the n and the threshold values. We achieve successful Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) results, and after evaluating these findings, we prefer the character 2-grams method and the threshold value of 0.7 to compare the character n-gram method with previous methods.

To evaluate the character n-gram method, we compare our approach with previous methods that use the same dataset. The experimental results for the Excite and FAST datasets are presented in Tables 11 and 12
                        
                        , respectively.

According to Table 11, the character n-gram method incorrectly estimates topic shifts (Type A errors) more than the other methods. Hence, incorrect estimates adversely affect the performance of the character n-gram method. Although the character n-gram method estimates topic shifts in the presence of a spelling mistake, its performance is poor in the absence of any statistical characteristics of queries. Comparison of the Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) results shows that the neural network approach performs better than the other methods, including the character n-gram method. Similar findings are shown for the FAST dataset in Table 12.

More studies have been performed with the FAST dataset than the Excite dataset; hence, we use the former methods for comparisons, as shown in Table 12. Evaluation of the results indicates that the character n-gram method incorrectly estimates topic shifts (Type A errors) less than the neural network method. Conversely, the character n-gram method incorrectly estimates topic continuations more than the neural network method.

Two faults are identified in the character n-gram method. First, the method identifies topic shifts that cannot be recognized by other methods. However, it overestimates topic shifts, ignoring the statistical characteristics of consecutive queries. Therefore, it performes worse than previous methods. Second, calculating the frequencies of sequential letters of consecutive queries adversely affects the character n-gram method, and its performance parameter values. Similar n-grams of dissimilar words increase the similarity ratio of consecutive queries. After comparing the similarity ratio with the determined threshold, the character n-gram method estimates topic continuation instead of topic shift. These problems can be alleviated by considering the statistical characteristics of queries in the decision-making process. Thus, we combine the character n-gram method with the neural network method in next sub-section, which is chosen as the best previous method in new topic identification.

Based on previous estimates, the statistical methods, which use the same datasets, generate incorrect topic shift estimates for similar queries that contain spelling differences and synonyms. As previously mentioned, synonyms, unlike spelling differences, cannot be detected without content-based algorithms. The main problem with synonyms is the determination of the search patterns of queries, which are determined automatically with an algorithm (Appendices A and B). If the algorithm identifies one of the two consecutive query search patterns as “new”, the statistical methodologies will generate a topic shift label. Thus, the statistical methods will likely generate correct estimates if the query search patterns are determined correctly despite the presence of spelling differences.

When the incorrect results are analyzed, most of the query search patterns are identified as “new” by the automatic pattern identification algorithm used in Ozmutlu et al. (2011). As a result of the training step of the neural network method, the algorithm yields a topic shift decision when the search pattern is identified as “new” regardless of the other parameters. Thus, recognizing incorrect search patterns due to spelling differences before the topic shift estimate may provide a different method of evaluation for such queries while also altering the topic continuation estimates. To remove these incorrect search pattern identifications, the character n-gram method can be used. However, using only the character n-gram method to identify the search patterns can cause problems due to excessive similarity between subsequent queries. Thus, to eliminate the insufficiencies of these methods, the character n-gram algorithm can be carefully used to supplement the best estimate results of the previous studies and thereby improve the topic shift estimate accuracy.

Based on the performance comparison of previous methods, the neural network method generates more accurate estimates than the other applications (Ozmutlu et al., 2011). Therefore, the character n-gram method is applied to the neural network results to improve the topic estimates, and to decrease the number of incorrect new topic identifications. In conclusion, in this approach, each word in the consecutive queries of a user session is analyzed based on its characters, and estimates are made despite their relevancy.

As an example, we analyze the “cybersc@n” and “cyberscan” queries. After calculating a similarity ratio of 0.75 for the consecutive queries shown in Table 6 with the character 2-grams and the threshold value of 0.7, the character n-gram method concludes that these words are similar and labels the queries as topic continuation unlike the neural network method. Even if these words are similar except for one letter, the search pattern of the second query is labeled as “new” (without using the proposed algorithm), and a topic shift estimate is generated by the neural network algorithm. If a spelling difference can be determined, the search pattern is labeled as “next page (browsing)”, and the second query requests another set of results on the first query. As a result, the neural network algorithm does not generate topic shift estimates because the updated pattern should be classified as “next page”.

As mentioned before, the character n-gram method decides topic continuation simply by comparing the n-grams of two words. Nevertheless, the queries from the FAST and Excite datasets usually contain more than one word; hence, comparisons of words and their n-grams are more complicated than the previous situation. To overcome this complexity, the topic continuation is assumed when the character n-gram method decides that at least one of the words in the two queries is similar. In fact, this assumption is logical considering the search patterns, because consecutive queries which are categorized as “next page”, “generalization”, “specialization”, or “reformulation” also contain similar words. Moreover, these categories are considered as topic continuation by the neural network algorithm. Therefore, with this assumption, when the character n-gram method decides topic continuation, the updated queries are categorized as “next page”, “generalization”, “specialization”, or “reformulation”, and the method will improve the results by preventing incorrect estimates.

For example, comparison of consecutive queries (qi
                        
                        =congress and social security, and qi
                        
                        +1
                        =congressional retirement) from the FAST dataset is given in Table 13
                        . The neural network method labels the queries as topic shift based on their “new” search pattern. Conversely, the character 3-grams method estimates topic continuation due to the presence of similar words such as “congress” and “congressional” for the threshold value of 0.6.

In this case, the 3-grams of six words should be compared to make a decision, as shown in Fig. 1. However, given the aforementioned assumption, a topic continuation decision can be reached when the similarity ratio of at least one word pair passes the determined threshold. Therefore, these queries will be labeled as topic continuation, and their search patterns will be labeled as “generalization”, “specialization” or “reformulation”.

Determining search patterns accurately is crucial for the neural network method which can improve the estimate results. Conversely, similar improvements can be made by applying the character n-gram method to topic shift estimates from the neural network method. Therefore, topic shift estimates are updated with the character n-gram method.

To determine the best parameter values for the character n-gram method, many experiments are conducted using different n and threshold values. For different n and threshold values, the performance parameters are calculated. Estimations of the combined approach are compared with human expert evaluations for the Excite and FAST datasets, as shown in Tables 14 and 15
                        
                        .

For the query length, n values vary from 1 to 4, and for each n, the results are calculated with threshold values between 0.5 and 0.7. For example, for a threshold value of 0.5, if half of the n-grams are equal, then second query will be labeled as topic continuation.

From the results in Table 15, the character n-gram estimates include fewer Type A errors than the neural network estimates for different n and threshold values. Conversely, the character n-gram estimates include more Type B errors than the neural network estimates, although the numbers are reduced for larger n and threshold values.
                     

According to the detailed query analysis, 38 queries in the Excite dataset (Appendix C) and 71 queries in the FAST dataset (Appendix D) are estimated as topic shifts by the neural network method because of spelling differences. The character n-gram method is expected to catch these errors and label them accurately.


                        Tables 16 and 17
                        
                         illustrate the experiments for different n and threshold values and represent the correct query estimates for the Excite and FAST dataset, respectively. These findings demonstrate that most of the query pairs are detected as the same query by the character n-gram method. Thus, these queries are marked as topic continuation instead of topic shift, and the number of Type A errors decreases because the incorrect topic shift estimates are eliminated.

As shown in Table 16, the character 1-grams approach detects 38 incorrect query estimates with the threshold value of 0.5. Although the method can detect spelling differences, the linguistics of the experiment with 1-grams and threshold value of 0.5, are not logical. Therefore, an n value of at least 2 is considered in evaluations. Similar experiments are performed using the FAST dataset. As shown in Table 17, the character 1-grams approach detects 71 incorrect query estimates with the threshold values of 0.5 and 0.6. However, n values of at least 2 are considered to ensure logical evaluations.

Based on the performance evaluation of the character n-gram method for the Excite and FAST datasets shown in Tables 18 and 19
                        
                        , respectively, the proposed method improves the accuracy of topic shift estimates. Given the Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) values for the Excite dataset (Table 18), the best results are obtained with the character 3-grams the threshold value of 0.7, which are presented in bold. With these parameter values, the highest increase, 2.639%, is observed for the Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) value. In the same experiment, the improvement in the Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) parameter of 0.619% is also deemed to be acceptable.

In addition to these evaluations, for the threshold value of 0.7, the character 3-grams method yields 188 Type A errors, while the neural network method yields 217 (Table 14). The character 3-grams method generates fewer Type A errors than the neural network method, and although the number of Type A errors is reduced, the number of Type B errors increases to 37. However, this change is acceptable given the improvements in the other performance parameters.

Using the FAST dataset, the character n-gram estimates of the precision and recall parameters are more consistent than the estimates from the neural network method (Table 19). Moreover, the character n-gram values of the fitness functions Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) are greater than the values for the neural network method because the character n-gram method generates more successful estimates. For the threshold value of 0.6, the character 3-grams yields Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) values of 0.625 and 0.924 which are presented in bold, respectively; the neural network approach yields Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift
                        
                        ) and Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           contin
                        
                        ) values of 0.584 and 0.907, respectively. As a result, the Fß
                        
                        (
                        
                           shift

In addition to these evaluations, the character 3-grams and neural network methods yield 478 and 580 Type A errors, respectively, for the threshold value of 0.6 as shown in Table 15. Consequently, the character 3-grams method generates fewer Type A errors than the neural network method. Although the algorithm reduces the number of Type A errors, the character 3-grams generates seven Type B errors. However, this number is acceptable given the overall improvements in the performance parameters.

To evaluate the performance of the character n-gram method, we use Levenshtein edit-distance method, which is a fundamental tool for the similarity measure of two strings. The edit distance method computes an “edit distance” between two strings that represents the minimum number of changes required to switch one string to another (Zobel & Dart, 1996). The edit distance method and its improved versions have been used by many researchers in terms of clustering (Kuo & Chen, 2007) and spelling correction (Varol & Bayrak, 2011). Varol and Bayrak (2011) tried to clean the customer records using the near miss strategy and edit distance tools effectively. They compared various similarity measurement strategies, such as Soundex, Phonex, Phonix, DMetaphone, Levenshtein edit-distance, LCS, Jaro-Winkler, 2-grams, 3-grams and PNRS. The experimental results demonstrated that the character n-gram method outperformed to Levenshtein edit distance method, also it produced very close estimates with PNRS. Kuo and Chen (2007) proposed a metric of normalized chain edit distance for event clustering, using a controlled vocabulary from cross-document co-reference chains. They developed different models, and summarized the experimental results. The experimental results expanded the positive effects of co-reference chains and the controlled vocabulary in event clustering.

The Levenshtein edit-distance can be used to calculate similarity of two queries. The method computes the required changes to transform one string to another, in terms of number of insertions, deletions and substitutions. Mathematically, the Levenshtein edit-distance (Levenshtein, 1966) between two strings a, b is represented by leva

The minimum part of expression (12) presents the deletion, insertion and substitution from a to b. We demonstrate the Levenshtein distance from queryi
                         to queryi+

                        +1), and use expression (12) to compute D(qi
                        ,
                        qi
                        
                        +1) for each query pairs. Then we calculate a difference ratio for the edit distance, which is similar to expression (11). However, we compute similarities between two queries in the character n-gram method, but we calculate differences between two queries in the Levenshtein edit-distance. Therefore we consider the maximum length of queries as a denominator instead of minimum n-grams of queries in expression (13).

In order to decide the similarity of two queries, we define a threshold to compare with the difference ratio. If the difference ratio of the Levenshtein distance is equal to or smaller than the threshold, we decide that two consecutive queries are similar and we label them as topic continuation. On the other hand, if the difference ratio of two queries is greater than the threshold, we conclude that these queries are different, and label them as topic shift.

We compare the performance of two methods, the character n-gram and the Levenshtein edit-distance using the same threshold values of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 with previous experiments, and we choose n values of 2 and 3 (We reach best estimate results with these parameters in Section 4). As mentioned before, we determine 38 queries from Excite, and 71 queries from FAST dataset, which are labeled wrongly as topic shift by the neural network, and we aim to label them correctly by the character n-gram method. Therefore, we use the same datasets for the comparison between the Levenshtein edit-distance and the character n-gram. The experimental results for the Excite dataset are summarized in Table 20
                        . The first column represents the threshold values, the second part indicates the number of correct estimates by the character 2-grams, the character 3-grams, and the Levenshtein edit-distance (LD) respectively, the third part demonstrates the performance of the approaches according to the correct estimates in percentage, and the last part indicates the performance gap between methods, which is calculated by expression (14). The number of correct estimates of methods is represented by the n-gramcorrect
                         and the LDcorrect

The Levenshtein edit-distance is able to label at most 16 query pairs as topic continuation in 38 query pairs for the threshold value of 0.5. On the other hand, the character 2-grams method outperforms to Levenshtein edit-distance and can detect 37 query pairs, and the character 3-grams method can detect 33 query pairs for the same threshold value. According to the performance of the methods in percentage, the character 2-grams correctly estimates 97.37% of the query pairs for the threshold value of 0.5. On the other hand, the Levenshtein edit-distance can only estimate 42.11% of the query pairs correctly for the same threshold. The last column proves that the character n-gram method with different combinations of n-grams and threshold outperforms to Levenshtein edit-distance. In worst case, for the threshold value of 0.5, the character 3-grams is 51.52% better than the Levenshtein edit-distance method, in terms of topic identification.

In addition to Table 20, we investigate the performance of two methods in detail. We only consider the correct estimates of the Levenshtein edit-distance and examine that if the character n-gram is able to label all query pairs as topic continuation. We detail the experiment results in Appendix C, and present them in Table 21
                        . The first column indicates the filtered number of query pairs, which are listed in sequence in Appendix C. The second column shows the real location of query pairs in the whole dataset, the third column presents the query pairs and the other columns group the results of three approaches, the character 2-grams, the character 3-grams and the Levenshtein distance (LD), in terms of the threshold values of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. If the approach in the sub-column can detect the topic continuation, it labels the first query of the query pair as 1, and if the approach cannot detect the topic continuation, it labels the first query as 0. The last row illustrates the total number of correct estimates of methods for different combinations.


                        Table 21 contains 16 query pairs which are estimated correctly by the Levenshtein edit-distance. According to analysis results, the character 2-grams method is able to cover all correct estimates for different thresholds. For the threshold value of 0.5, the character 2-grams detects 16 topic continuations same as the Levenshtein edit-distance, for the threshold value of 0.6, while the Levenshtein edit-distance labels only 13 query pairs as topic continuation, the character 2-grams identifies 15 topic continuations, and for the threshold value of 0.7, the character 2-grams outperforms to the Levenshtein edit-distance and detects 15 topic continuations instead of 10 topic continuations. Identifying a topic continuation is difficult for the high threshold values, but the experimental results demonstrates that the character n-gram method is more powerful than the Levenshtein edit-distance in terms of topic identification.

We repeat the same experiments with 71 query pairs from FAST dataset that are wrongly labeled as topic shift by the neural network, and we aim to label them correctly by the character n-gram method. The experimental results for the FAST dataset are illustrated in Table 22
                        . The first column represents the threshold values, the second part indicates the number of correct estimates by the character 2-grams, the character 3-grams, and the Levenshtein edit-distance (LD) respectively, the third part demonstrates the performance of the methods in terms of the correct estimates in percentage, and the last part indicates the performance gap between methods which is calculated by expression (14).

The Levenshtein edit-distance is able to label at most 26 query pairs of 71 query pairs as topic continuation for the threshold value of 0.5, which means 36.62% of query pairs in percentage. On the other hand, the character 2-grams method is able to detect 98.59% of total query pairs correctly for the same threshold value. The last column demonstrates that the character n-gram with different combinations of n and threshold outperforms to Levenshtein edit-distance for the FAST dataset. In the worst case, for the threshold value of 0.7, the character 3-grams method is 59.38% better than the Levenshtein edit-distance method in terms of topic identification.


                        Table 22 proves that the character n-gram method successfully detects similarities between the query pairs better than the Levenshtein edit-distance. Considering the correct estimates of Levenshtein edit-distance method, we also analyze 71 query pairs, and examine that if the character n-gram is able to label all query pairs as topic continuation. We detail the experiment results in Appendix D, and summarized them in Table 23
                        . The first column indicates the number of query pairs, the second column shows the real location of query pairs in the whole dataset, the third column presents the query pairs, and the other columns group the results of three methods, the character 2-grams, the character 3-grams and the Levenshtein distance (LD) for the threshold values of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. If the method in the sub-column can detect the topic continuation, it labels the first query of the query pair as 1, and if the approach cannot detect the topic continuation, it labels the first query as 0. The last row illustrates the total number of correct estimates of methods for different combinations.


                        Table 23 contains the 26 query pairs which are correctly estimated by the Levenshtein edit-distance. According to analysis results, the character 2-grams method is able to cover all correct estimates for all threshold values. For the threshold value 0.5, the character 3-grams cannot estimate first and second query pairs correctly. For the threshold value 0.6, the Levenshtein edit-distance can only estimate 21 of 26 query pairs correctly, while the character 2-grams can estimate all of them correctly, and the character 3-grams can estimate 24 of 26 query pairs correctly. In other words, for the threshold value 0.6, the character n-gram method is able detect all correct estimates of the Levenshtein edit-distance, except for the first two query pairs; “gu-5a and gu-5b” and “gu-5b and gu-43b”. On the other hand, the character n-gram method outperforms to the Levenshtein edit-distance, and successfully detects similarities between longer queries. The performance gap between the character 2-grams and the Levenshtein edit-distance increases regarding to the threshold value of 0.7. For this threshold, the character 2-grams can detect all topic continuations correctly, but the Levenshtein edit-distance can only detect 14 of 26 query pairs correctly. Moreover, the character 3-grams also can estimate all topic continuations correctly, except for the first two query pairs.

Considering the detailed analysis of the character n-gram and the Levenshtein edit-distance estimates, we conclude that the character 2-grams method can cover all estimates of the Levenshtein edit-distance method, and it can be used instead of the Levenshtein edit-distance method in terms of topic identification. Although the Levenshtein edit-distance method is able to detect the similarities between words, usually query pairs include more than one word, and hence the Levenshtein edit-distance method fails to detect the topic continuation of query pairs. In addition to these results, the experimental results demonstrate that the character n-gram method fails to detect the similarities between short words which contain spelling mistakes. If we use a spelling correction method before the character n-gram method, we would improve the performance of the character n-gram method. Therefore we investigate the performance change of character n-gram method with pre-processed spelling correction methods in next sub-section.

To improve the performance of the character n-gram method, we investigate Type A errors in detail. The experimental results show that the character n-gram method fails to detect similarities between short words which contain spelling mistakes. If we use a spelling correction method before the character n-gram method, we would improve the performance of the character n-gram method. Therefore, we consider one of the well-known spellers ASPELL. Recently, popular search engines suggest alternative queries to users when the query contains a misspelled word. To evaluate the performance of the character n-gram method, we use the corrections of query pairs by the Google and the Bing search engines. We take into account the first suggestion of search engines, the first website, and “did you mean this” expression, and we consider ASPELL’s first suggestion for the misspelled word. If the spelling correction method detects a misspelled word, it suggests an alternative spelling of the word, and the dataset is updated by changing the misspelled word with the suggested one.

We consider 38 Excite and 71 FAST query pairs for the experiments. We use original query pairs for the first two datasets, and we generate six more datasets which are different from each other and updated by the spelling correction methods. The corrections of methods are presented in Appendices E and F. Each correction method has different impact on the original dataset, and some corrections improve the estimates, and some of them damage the query pairs which adversely affects the estimates. Therefore if the correction method corrupts the query pair in the dataset and causes to estimate a topic shift instead of a topic continuation, it is recorded as Corrupted estimates. On the other hand, if the correction method improves the quality of query pair and ensures to estimate a topic continuation instead of a topic shift, it is recorded as Improved estimates. We detail our findings in next sub-sections.


                           Islam and Inkpen (2009) emphasize that the correction precision (the fraction of suggestions that are correct) is important as much as the correction recall (the fraction of errors corrected). Therefore, we consider the number of wrong corrections besides the number of true corrections in Table 24
                           . The first column illustrates the threshold values, and the second part indicates the number of correct estimates in original and updated datasets. The second dataset is updated by ASPELL corrections, and estimates are calculated by the character n-gram after correction process. The third part indicates the number of query pairs which could not be estimated correctly because of the spelling correction, and the last part shows the number of query pairs that are estimated correctly thanks to the correction method.

As seen in Table 24, the correction of Excite dataset by ASPELL adversely affects the performance of the character n-gram, and the number of correct estimates is reduced by the updated dataset. In addition, the number of damaged estimates is greater than the number of improved estimates, which means that ASPELL corrections reduces the performance of the character n-gram method. We repeat our experiments considering the FAST dataset, which are presented in Table 25
                           .

According to Table 25, the number of damaged estimates is greater than the number of improved estimates. Moreover, the ASPELL correction cannot improve FAST estimates, but one query pair “hotels in istanbul” and “istanbul” (which was “istambul” in the original dataset). However, the character 2-grams method is able to detect similarity between “hotels in Istanbul” and istambul” for threshold values of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7, and the character 3-grams with the threshold value of 0.5. The ASPELL correction only improves the character 3-grams with threshold values of 0.6 and 0.7. Although, the ASPELL correction improves only one topic continuation estimate, it damages at least six estimates of topic continuation, and hence reduces the performance of the character n-gram method.

To date, search engines have been collecting huge amount of data about their users for different purposes. They also have been storing users’ search histories and they recommend alternative queries to users according to these historical data. Therefore search engines can recognize special names, and specific terms, so they are more successful at detecting a misspelled word than spelling correction methods. For example ASPELL assumes that the query pair “aerosmıth” and “aerosmith” is misspelled and changes this query pair to “Eros” and “azimuth” which is slightly different from the first one. However, search engines are able to recognize “aerosmıth” and “aerosmith” because of their colossal databases.


                           Table 26
                            demonstrates the comparison between the original and the updated Excite datasets by Bing and Google corrections. The first column presents threshold values, the second part summarizes the number of correct estimates in three different datasets; the original Excite, the updated Excite by Bing, and the updated Excite by Google. The third part indicates the number of query pairs which could not be estimated correctly because of the spelling correction, and the last part shows the number of query pairs which is estimated correctly thanks to the updated datasets.

The number of correct estimates demonstrates that Bing and Google update the database in a good way, and these corrections improve the performance of the character n-gram method. The correct estimates in the updated datasets are equal to or greater than the original dataset. In addition, the Bing and Google corrections do not damage the original query pairs and therefore the third part of Table 26 contains zero values for each n and threshold values. Moreover, the number of improved estimates increases with threshold values. In other words, the character n-gram fails to detect topic continuations for higher threshold values because of misspelling words, but after the correction, it is able to detect these topic continuations. For example, the character 3-grams cannot label the “aerosmıth” and “aerosmith” query pair as topic continuation for threshold values of 0.6 and 0.7. Bing and Google search engines correct “aerosmıth” to “aerosmith”, and hence the character n-gram method is able to label the query pair as topic continuation for all threshold values.

We repeat our experiments for the original and the updated FAST datasets by Bing and Google corrections in Table 27
                           . The first column presents threshold values, the second part summarizes the number of correct estimates in three different datasets; the original FAST, the updated FAST by Bing, and the updated FAST by Google search engine. The third part indicates the number of query pairs which could not be estimated correctly because of the spelling correction, and the last part shows the number of query pairs which is estimated correctly thanks to updated datasets.

The character n-gram method performs better with the updated versions of datasets. The update process does not damage the original query pairs, so the third column contains zero values for each character n-gram combination. The number of improved estimates is lower, but this does not mean that queries do not include spelling mistakes. However, the character n-gram is able to detect query pairs with spelling mistakes, and label them as topic continuation.

Google and Bing search engines correct only one query pair in FAST dataset; “hotels in istanbul” and “istambul”, and change the second query to “istanbul”. The character 2-grams method can detect the similarity between “hotels in Istanbul” and istambul” query pair with threshold values of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7. In addition, the character 3-grams also detects the similarity of two queries with the threshold value of 0.5. The search engine correction only improves the character 3-grams with threshold values of 0.6 and 0.7, which assures a powerful estimate.

The experimental results so far show that the character 2-grams method is able to detect similarities between misspelled words while keeping the correction precision. However, there are several types of spelling variations, and the performance of the character n-gram method changes depending on these variations. Vilares et al. (2011) analyzed the performance of the character 4-grams method in terms of different length of queries such as short queries, mid-size queries and long queries. However, we have been trying to determine the spelling errors concerning words instead of queries, and to our knowledge, the limitations of the character n-gram method have not been studied in letter/character level. For that reason, we examine the limitations of the character n-gram method in terms of different types of spelling mistakes such as character substitution/insertion/deletion, word merging, word splitting and word reordering.

It has to be mentioned that the character n-gram method labels a query pair as topic continuation if they contain at least one same word, regardless of the position in query. Thus, the character n-gram method is able to detect the similarity between queries in situation of word reordering. For example, the Excite dataset contains “traveling to spain pampalona” and “spain the bull run” queries in sequence. The queries contain “spain” in a different order, and the character n-gram method labels the first query as topic continuation.

The character n-gram method is able to detect similarities in situations of word merging and word splitting. For example, the Excite dataset contains the query pair “etymol” and “etymology dict”, and the character n-gram method labels the first query as topic continuation regardless of n and threshold value, because the second query “etymology dict” contains the first query “etymol”. The similar situation can be observed for “wenn soft” and “wennsoft” query pair, which is labeled as topic continuation by the character n-gram method.

To investigate the performance of the character n-gram method in situations of character substitution, insertion and deletion, we consider 38 and 71 query pairs from the Excite and the FAST datasets respectively. We group the spelling variations as seen in Table 28
                        . We present the analysis results of two datasets together. The second column illustrates the type of spelling variation, the third column shows the total number of spelling variation in the related dataset, and the fourth part demonstrates the number of correct estimates regarding various n and threshold values.

According to analysis results, the character n-gram method can handle the situations of character deletion and character insertion better than the character substitution. For example, the method correctly labels 3 of 3 character insertions, and 4 of 5 character deletions in the Excite dataset. Similarly, the character n-gram correctly labels 13 of 14 character insertions, and 8 of 8 character deletions in the FAST dataset. However, the method fails to detect the topic continuation of query pairs which have character substitution situation. Especially for the Excite dataset, the method can could only label 2 of 6 character substitutions correctly in worst case, which is detailed in Table 29
                        .

Considering the detailed analysis, the performance of the character n-gram depends on the length of misspelled word and the position of substitution. For example, the character n-gram method is able to detect the topic continuation of “mitel semiconducter” and “plessey semiconductor” query pair for all n and threshold values in the Excite dataset, on the other hand it cannot detect the topic continuation between “eniac” and “enıac” query pair, but the character 2-grams and the threshold value of 0.5. Because “enıac” is shorter than “semiconducter”, and the length of word determines the number of n-grams and the similarity ratio. In this example, the similarity ratio of the related query pair would be 0.5, and the character n-gram method would not be able to detect the topic continuation of “eniac” and “enıac” for higher threshold values.

The experimental results so far demonstrate that, the character 2-grams method with the threshold value of 0.5 can handle the words with more than 3 letters, and the misspelled letter at the beginning or at the end. For example, if we had two consecutive queries as “and” and “anf”, we would detect the topic continuation with the character 2-grams method and the threshold value of 0.5, but we could not detect the topic continuation for higher threshold values. Moreover, if the misspelled letter is at the middle of the word, we also would not determine the topic continuation with the character 2-grams method and the threshold value of 0.5 either. Although, the character 2-grams method can handle the misspelled words in general, this analysis could be expanded considering the specific position of the misspelled letter and the length of word.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

These results suggest that query typing information is significant for identifying new topics with content-ignorant algorithms. However, this information is insufficient for all topic estimates. Content-ignorant methods that combine typing information and the statistical characteristics of queries perform well in the process of new topic identification. As shown in the previous section, the proposed method improves topic shift estimates in search engine queries by combining typing information and statistical characteristics.

These findings show that the proposed content-ignorant hybrid algorithm more accurately estimates topics than previous methods (Ozmutlu & Cavdur, 2005a; Ozmutlu et al., 2007, 2008a,b). Such improvements may also be obtained with content-based algorithms, although our aim is to develop an improved content-ignorant algorithm for new topic identification. The results prove that we have achieved our aim.

In this paper, a hybrid content-ignorant algorithm for new topic identification is presented. Previous studies have shown that typing mistakes and the presence of synonymous words in consecutive queries adversely affect the topic estimate performance of content-ignorant algorithms. Although synonyms cannot be recognized without content information, spelling differences can be captured based on the typing information of queries. Our results demonstrate that only using the typing information of consecutive queries in the character n-gram method is insufficient for topic identification. Thus, we gather the typing information and the statistical characteristics of queries by combining the character n-gram and neural network methods. Using the character n-gram method as a supplement, we obtain more successful estimates, and we observe that the character n-gram method significantly improves the results of the neural network method. We also examine the performance of the character n-gram method in different aspects.

Unlike other approaches, our proposed method gathers content-ignorant information from search engine queries, such as typing information, with less effort and then uses this information for automatic topic identification. The results show that the proposed method improves upon the insufficiencies of previous methods. However, the performance of the proposed methodology depends on n and threshold values, which must be determined according to the length of queries. Hence, the performance of the method for specific n and threshold values can be different for different datasets. The proposed method performes well with the character 3-grams and the threshold value of 0.7, but these parameters may be insufficient for different datasets and situations. For example, the detailed analysis of the character n-gram estimations presents that the character 2-grams method is more successful than the character 3-grams in terms of detecting the spelling mistakes in queries. Future research can be focused on determining the average length of queries by using various search engine query logs and then identifying decision parameters in a general topic identification method that does not depend on the length of queries. Further, the proposed method can be used to supplement content-based algorithms to detect spelling errors by using the typing information from consecutive queries in the process of automatically identifying new topics.
