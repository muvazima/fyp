                  We consider a single-product make-to-stock manufacturing–remanufacturing system. Returned products require remanufacturing before they can be sold. The manufacturing and remanufacturing operations are executed by the same single server, where switching from one activity to another does not involve time or cost and can be done at an arbitrary moment in time. Customer demand can be fulfilled by either newly manufactured or remanufactured products. The times for manufacturing and remanufacturing a product are exponentially distributed. Demand and used products arrive via mutually independent Poisson processes. Disposal of products is not allowed and all used products that are returned have to be accepted. Using Markov decision processes, we investigate the optimal manufacture–remanufacture policy that minimizes holding, backorder, manufacturing and remanufacturing costs per unit of time over an infinite horizon. For a subset of system parameter values we are able to completely characterize the optimal continuous-review dynamic preemptive policy. We provide an efficient algorithm based on quasi-birth–death processes to compute the optimal policy parameter values. For other sets of system parameter values, we present some structural properties and insights related to the optimal policy and the performance of some simple threshold policies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The reuse of products and materials is not a recent discovery. However, it is only during recent decades that product recovery and reverse logistics have gained increasing importance as a profitable and sustainable strategy for companies around the world (see e.g. Dekker, Fleischmann, Inderfurth, & van Wassenhove, 2004; Srivastava, 2007). Reusing may be motivated by economical, legislative or environmental reasons. As stated in Thierry, Salomon, van Nunen, and van Wassenhove (1995), there are several options to recover a product. Via remanufacturing, a product is completely recovered and its quality after remanufacturing is as good as that of a new product. Remanufacturing complicates inventory control. Integrating this reverse flow of used products affects both the materials planning and the inventory control of the supply chain. Indeed, managers have to take into account the uncertain flow of used products and they have to coordinate the remanufacturing stage with the regular mode of procurement (Inderfurth & van der Laan, 2001).

Coordination between manufacturing and remanufacturing operations is a central issue (Van der Laan, Salomon, Dekker, & van Wassenhove, 1999). The company has to decide who takes care of each operation, when and how much to manufacture or to remanufacture. In our model, we consider a single server that can perform manufacturing and remanufacturing operations. The server can switch at any time between these two operations. As stated in Ferrer and Whybark (2000), shared resources increase the flexibility of the system but also the complexity of the coordination. The study of Tang and Teunter (2006) is an example of a concrete application of a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system with a shared resource. Their research was motivated by a company which manufactures and remanufactures car parts. New and remanufactured parts are processed in the same facilities by the same workers. In their study, the remanufactured products represent approximately 30% of the annual sales. Trebilcock (2002) discusses a catalog retailer that has to prepare and ship around 65,000 products weekly. Around 15% of the products come back to the retailer. In this case, managers can ask some workers for a few days to inspect, clean and repack returned products. This type of situation (where workers switch between manufacturing and remanufacturing to satisfy customer orders) may be modeled by a hybrid system as described in our study.

In this paper, we consider a hybrid manufacturing–remanufacturing system. Manufacturing and remanufacturing operations are executed by a single shared ressource. This situation can be found in small companies or in dedicated specialized units within companies dealing with complex products (like large medical systems and dedicated copiers), when both manufacturing and remanufacturing require deep understanding of the product. Remanufactured and new products can equally well be used to satisfy customer demand. The times to manufacturing and remanufacturing a product are exponentially distributed. Demand and used products arrive via mutually independent Poisson processes. We consider the situation where products are manufactured or remanufactured one by one. The objective is to minimize discounted or average costs (holding, manufacturing, remanufacturing, backorder) over an infinite horizon. We do not include neither setup times and costs nor disposal option. These limits of our model our discussed in Section 8.

More generally, our problem can be seen as a production-inventory control with two supply channels. The first supply channel is completely controlled while the second supply channel is autonomous and random. For example, car companies like DaimlerChrysler can get very easily low quality (often less expensive) engines that are supplied by dealers in the context of take back programs or internet offers. However, it is much more difficult and uncertain to get high quality (often more expensive) engines.

To the best of our knowledge, the problem described in this paper has not been studied before. In particular it is the first paper to investigate an hybrid system with a shared resource in a stochastic environment. For the problem described above, we characterize the optimal manufacture–remanufacture policy for certain sets of system parameter values and provide for these sets an efficient method to calculate the optimal values of the policy parameters. For other sets of system parameter values, we provide insights into the optimal policy structure. We also present a sensitivity analysis for several system parameters.

In Section 2, we review the literature and our contributions. In Section 3, a detailed description and mathematical formulation of the problem is given. In Section 4, we derive several characteristics of the optimal policy structure for different sets of parameter values. In Section 5, we provide an efficient method to calculate the optimal values of the policy parameters. In Section 6, we present some insights into the optimal behavior of the system for sets of parameter values for which it is not possible to derive the optimal policy structure. Based on these insights, we introduce in Section 7 some simple heuristics that we compare with the optimal policy. In Section 8 we conclude the paper and indicate directions for further research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is a vast literature on inventory control with product returns (see e.g. Fleischmann et al., 1997; Fleischmann, Kuik, & Dekker, 2002; Ilgin & Gupta, 2010; Pokharel & Mutha, 2009). Hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing systems have received growing attention in recent years (see e.g. Van der Laan et al., 1999; Teunter, van der Laan, & Vlachos, 2004).

In a deterministic environment, only a few authors consider a shared capacity for manufacturing and remanufacturing. The first deterministic model involving product returns is introduced by Schrady (1967). He considers an EOQ setting with constant demand and returns rates, infinite manufacturing and remanufacturing rates, different holding costs for recoverable and serviceable items and different fixed costs. For the class of 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           R
                           )
                        
                      policies that alternates a manufacturing lot and a fixed number R of remanufacturing lots, he is able to derive EOQ formulae. Several papers consider variants of Schrady’s model. Nahmias and Rivera (1979) considers a variant with a finite recovery rate. Teunter (2001) includes a disposal option for returned products. Teunter (2004) investigates 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           R
                           )
                        
                      policies and 
                        
                           (
                           P
                           ,
                           1
                           )
                        
                      policies where the server alternates between manufacturing P lots and remanufacturing 1 lot. He obtains optimal lot-sizes for both manufacturing and recovery operations. These formulae are valid for both finite and infinite manufacturing and remanufacturing rates. Tang and Teunter (2006) study the multi-product economic lot scheduling problem with returns. Like previous papers, manufacturing and remanufacturing operations are performed on the same shared production line. Due to the complexity of this multi-product problem, the authors restrict their study to common cycling policies with one manufacturing lot and one remanufacturing lot in each cycle. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer problem.

In a periodic review setting, several authors present models with stochastic demand and returns but they do not consider a shared capacity for manufacturing and remanufacturing. Simpson (1978) considers a system where returns are held in a separate buffer until they are remanufactured or disposed of. He characterizes the optimal policy for the case with zero manufacturing and remanufacturing lead times. Inderfurth (1997) considers positive and identical manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes. He also shows that the optimal policy may have a very complex structure when lead times are different. Li, Zhang, Chen, and Cai (2010) include fixed manufacturing costs and fixed disposal costs. Zhou, Tao, and Chao (2011) investigate a situation where returns can have different quality levels. DeCroix (2006) extends the results of Inderfurth (1997) to a multi-stage series system where products are remanufactured at the upstream stage. Fleischmann and Kuik (2003) study the optimal policy structure for a single stock point with a stochastic demand that is either positive or negative in each period. They show the average-cost optimality of an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy. Teunter and Vlachos (2002) study the necessity of a disposal option for a hybrid manufacturing and remanufacturing system with constant lead times over a finite time horizon. By using simulation, their results show that a disposal option leads to an important cost reduction only if the demand rate is low, the recovery rate is high and remanufacturing is almost as expensive as manufacturing. The authors also notice that it is more difficult to find the optimal policy when considering a disposal option for product returns.

As far as we know, Heyman (1977) is the first who investigates a continuous-time inventory control model with product returns. He assumes zero lead times, linear costs and a disposal option. Heyman (1977) shows that the optimal disposal policy is a threshold policy and derives an explicit formula for this threshold. The author also indicates that introducing a remanufacturing lead time requires a new variable (the remanufacturable inventory) resulting in a very complex model. Vercraene and Gayon (2013) consider a variant of Heyman (1977) where the manufacturing leadtime is exponentially distributed and there is no disposal option. They prove the optimality of a base-stock policy to control the serviceable inventory and derives an exact formula for the optimal base-stock level. Muckstadt and Isaac (1981) introduce a hybrid system with non-zero lead times for both procurement and remanufacturing. The authors investigate a simple 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           Q
                           )
                        
                     -rule for the procurement policy and returns are remanufactured as long as returned products are available. Since an exact analysis is difficult, an approximation is given for the steady-states distribution of the system. Fleischmann et al. (2002) consider an inventory system with Poisson demand and returns, fixed procurement leadtime and zero remanufacturing processing time. They show that the optimal policy to minimize the total average cost is an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           Q
                           )
                        
                     -policy. Van der Laan et al. (1999) investigate an inventory system where manufacturing and remanufacturing occur simultaneously. They consider constant leadtimes, stochastic demand and returns, fixed set-up costs per batch and linear holding costs for the remanufacturable and serviceable inventories. They compare systems without remanufacturing with push and pull controlled hybrid systems with remanufacturing. Ching, Li, and Xue (2007) suggest a new approach to analyze a hybrid system with remanufacturing under continuous-review with Markovian assumptions. The serviceable inventory is controlled by an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                     -policy and they use quasi-birth–death processes to model the remanufacturable and serviceable inventories. The authors provide a quasi-optimization method to compute the optimal replenishment level. Aras, Verter, and Boyaci (2006) propose a new model for hybrid systems with a constant manufacturing lead time and a remanufacturing process that depends on the quality of returns. In this model, the remanufacturing lead time and cost are uniformly distributed between minimum and maximum values. Two policies are compared: priority-to-manufacturing (remanufacturing is only used when the manufacturing facility is not sufficient to satisfy all demand) and priority-to-remanufacturing (replenishment orders are placed first with the remanufacturing facility). The authors show the benefits of coordinating manufacturing and remanufacturing.

To summarize, we note that there is a lot of literature on hybrid manufacturing–remanufacturing systems but only few papers that deal with a shared capacity for manufacturing and remanufacturing. All of these papers deal with deterministic demand and returns. To the best of our knowledge, the research presented in this paper is the first one that studies a stochastic model with shared capacity for manufacturing and remanufacturing. Our model is close to the one of Teunter (2004). Like in his research, we consider a shared resource for both manufacturing and remanufacturing with finite manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities. While Teunter (2004) considers a deterministic setting, we assume random (exponential) processing times for manufacturing and remanufacturing and random (Poisson) processes for demand and returns. Furthermore, contrary to Teunter (2004) who investigates the optimal lot-sizes for 
                        
                           (

                           )
                        
                     -policies, we do not restrict our research to certain classes of policies but we investigate the optimal policy to control the system. However, unlike Teunter, we do not include setup times and costs in our problem.

We consider a single-product system with product returns (Fig. 1
                     ). Returned products require remanufacturing operations (always successful) before they can be sold. Manufacturing and remanufacturing operations are executed by a single shared resource. The single server can perform only one operation at the same time: remanufacturing or manufacturing, or be idle. New products are manufactured one by one, and returns are remanufactured one by one too. Switching times and costs are neglected. Raw materials for manufacturing are assumed to be always available. We consider a situation with preemption: the server can stop a job at any time and she or he can resume the job immediately or after a while.

All returns have to be accepted. Each return can be remanufactured into a serviceable product and disposal is not allowed. Customer demand can be fulfilled by either newly manufactured or remanufactured products. All demand has to be fulfilled. If a customer order is not immediately satisfied, it is backlogged. Two inventories are distinguished: the remanufacturable inventory of product returns, and the serviceable inventory of new and remanufactured products. There are no capacity limitations for the inventories.

We use a continuous-time infinite horizon model with Markovian assumptions: demand and returns follow independent Poisson processes while manufacturing and remanufacturing times are exponentially distributed. We further assume linear holding and backlogging costs.

We use the following notation:
                        
                           •
                           
                              b: backlog cost (per product per unit of time).

                         may not seem to be often fulfilled in practice. However, when remanufacturing implies a disassembly operation, products that are returned can take far more space than the individual components that we want to reuse, incurring large storage costs. In practice, components are often not disassembled before remanufacturing starts, in order to avoid (further) damage. This may be the case, for instance, with car wrecks or photocopy machines.

                           A Push Preemptive Priority on Returns (3PR) base-stock policy is such that:

                                    When there are returns 
                                          
                                             (

                                       , remanufacturing has always priority over the production of new products. If a return occurs while the server is manufacturing a new product, then the server stops immediately manufacturing and switches to remanufacturing returns, until the remanufacturable inventory is empty 
                                          
                                             (

                                       . When the server is idle at the moment a return arrives, the server immediately starts remanufacturing this return.

When there are no returns left 
                                          
                                             (
                                             x

                                             0
                                             )
                                          
                                       , the server manufactures if and only if the serviceable inventory y is below a certain base-stock level S.

                         and M refer respectively to “idle”, “remanufacturing” and “manufacturing”. Because we cannot display huge matrices, we only provide a representative extract of the total decision matrix. This matrix was computed with a value iteration algorithm (see e.g. Puterman, 1994).

To show that the optimal policy is a 3PR base-stock policy, we need to define the following set of value functions

In Koole (1998), Property (P3) is called convexity, Property (P4) is called supermodularity and properties (P5) and (P6) are called superconvexity. Properties (P4) and (P6) together imply Property (P3) (Koole, 1998). In Appendix A, we show that the optimal value function

The properties satisfied by the optimal value function yield properties of the optimal policy. Property (P2) ensures that, for

                      (see Theorem 1). In this section, we first explain how to compute efficiently the steady-state probabilities under 3PR base-stock policies. Then we provide a more efficient method than stochastic dynamic programming to compute the optimal policy.

For a given 3PR base-stock policy, the two-dimensional stochastic process

                      can be modeled by a continuous-time two-dimensional Markov chain, more precisely a quasi-birth–death process (QBD). We refer to Latouche and Ramaswami (1993) and Neuts (1981, chap. 3) for a formal definition of QBD. In Table 1
                     , we show the system states and output transition rates for each area of the Markov chain. For 
                        
                           x
                           =

                      and

                     , the server is idle. For 
                        
                           x
                           =
                           0
                        
                      and 
                        
                           y

                           S
                        
                     , the server is manufacturing new products. For 
                        
                           x
                           >
                           0
                        
                     , the server is remanufacturing product returns.

Because of the repeating structure of the Markov chain, if we have the steady-state probabilities for any particular base-stock S, then we can deduce the steady-state probabilities for all base-stock levels. Indeed, the two-dimensional stochastic process 
                        
                           (
                           X
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           ,
                           Y
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           -
                           S
                           )
                        
                      is independent of S. Therefore, for a given instance, we need to compute probabilities only for this stochastic process and then we can derive easily probabilities for any base-stock level. This property will be very useful in the optimization procedure.

                     To compute the steady-state probabilities, we need to truncate the state space. To do so, we increase the state space until the steady-state probabilities are no longer sensitive to further increasing the state space.

There are many methods to solve a QBD. We refer to Latouche and Ramaswami (1993) and van Leeuwaarden and Winands (2006) for an overview. Here we adopt the matrix-geometric approach (see chapter 3 in Neuts (1981)), which is usually used in problems that deal with our type of QBD (see e.g. Chang & Lu, 2008, 2010; Song, Xu, & Liu, 1999).

Once steady-state probabilities have been computed for a given base-stock level with the QBD method (e.g. 
                           
                              S
                              =
                              0
                           
                        ), we can use a dichotomic algorithm to compute the optimal base-stock level with (19). The QBD method with dichotomy search has been implemented in MATLAB (version 7.9). Using a double-core 2gigahertz processor, it took between less than one second and about one minute to find the optimal base-stock level for a given instance, with an average time of one second based on 1024 instances.

In this section we want to show how the structure of the optimal policy depends on the values of the system parameters. To compute the optimal policy for a given instance, we used stochastic dynamic programming (Puterman, 1994). Four different situations are investigated:

                     . In the numerical study that follows, we assume that this condition is always satisfied.

For each of the four different situations we plot an example of the optimal policy (see Fig. 5
                     ). For situation I, we have proved in Theorem 1 that the optimal policy is a 3PR base-stock policy.

For situation II, the shape of the optimal policy can be explained as follows. It is always better to remanufacture rather than idle the server, since it reduces both the backorder costs and the holding costs (because 
                        
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                           ⩾
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 S
                              
                           
                        
                     ). As a consequence, when the remanufacturable inventory is not zero, the server is never idle and either manufactures or remanufactures. As the return flow is not sufficient to satisfy all the demand, we know that there is a region where the server should manufacture. As the manufacturing rate is higher than the remanufacturing rate 
                        
                           (

                                 N
                              
                           
                           >
                           
                              
                                 μ

                           )
                        
                     , it is better to manufacture when the serviceable inventory is low in order to diminish backlog costs. We also observe that the switching curve, which delimitates when to manufacture and when to remanufacture, is slightly decreasing in the remanufacturable inventory in order to reduce remanufacturable inventory holding costs.

In situation III, we still have

                      but now 
                        
                           
                              
                                 h

                                 h
                              
                              
                                 S
                              
                           
                        
                     . The structure of the optimal policy is very close to the one for situation II except that the server is idle when the serviceable inventory is high enough in order to limit serviceable inventory holding costs. We also observe that the switching curve, which delimitates when to remanufacture and when to be idle, is increasing in the remanufacturable inventory. This entails reduction of remanufacturable inventory holding costs.

In situation IV (Fig. 5d), it is the reverse of situation III since it is better to remanufacture when the serviceable inventory is low enough. This is due to smaller remanufacturing leadtimes 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 μ
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                           >
                           
                              
                                 μ
                              
                              
                                 N
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . The switching curve, which delimitates when to remanufacture and idle, is decreasing in the remanufacturable inventory since the higher x is, the lower the remanufacturing replenishment leadtimes will be.

Finally, we note that in all situations if there are backorders 
                        
                           (
                           y
                           <
                           0
                           )
                        
                     , the server is never idle in order to diminish backorder costs as well as holding costs.

For situation I, we have proved in Theorem 1 that the optimal policy belongs to the class of 3PR base-stock policies. In this section we introduce new simple heuristic policies for the three other situations and compare their performance with the optimal policy.

These heuristic policies, called RM, IRM and IR, are presented in Table 2
                      and have been designed for respectively situations II, III and IV. We have on purpose chosen very simple policies defined by at most two thresholds. One could imagine more complex heuristic policies with more policy parameters. However the interest would be limited. On one hand, it would reproduce somehow the complexity of the optimal policy and would be relatively difficult to implement in practice. On the other hand, the time to find the optimal policy parameters is exponential within the number of policy parameters. In Table 2, we also remind the shape of 3PR which is a special case of RM and IR.

Hereafter we compare these heuristic policies with the optimal policy. For each heuristic policy, we compute the optimal values of the policy parameters and the corresponding optimal average cost. In the rest of the paper, the policy parameters are optimized and simply denoted by 
                        
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                              
                                 RM
                              
                           
                        
                     , etc. The relative cost difference is defined by the relative average cost increase (AC (heuristic policy)-AC (optimal policy))/AC (optimal policy) that results from using a heuristic policy (RM, IRM, IR and 3PR) instead of the optimal policy.

In situation I, the figures show that 3PR is optimal, in accordance with Theorem 1, and that IR and RM are also optimal, as they generalize 3PR. For the three other situations, we observe that the 3PR policy is no longer optimal and can result in a very poor performance. This is expected because the 3PR policy suggests to remanufacturing whenever possible. In situations with low remanufacturing rates (II and III), it is better to reduce the backlog by quickly manufacturing new products. When the remanufacturing holding cost is small (III and IV), it is preferable to keep returned products in the relatively cheap remanufacturable inventory when the serviceable inventory is sufficiently high.

In situation II, Fig. 6 show that RM is the best heuristic policy and has a very good performance with a maximum relative cost increase smaller than 2%. This is due to the very close structure of the RM policy to the optimal one in situation II. Though we have not been able to prove it, it is intuitively clear that the optimal policy never idles the server when 
                        
                           x
                           >
                           0
                        
                     , in agreement with the RM policy. It is also reasonable that the optimal policy uses the fastest server mode when the serviceable inventory is low, as does the RM policy.

In situation IV, IR works very well with a relative cost increase smaller than 0.1% on the tested instances. This is again due to the structural closeness of the IR policy with the optimal one in situation IV. The IR policy never manufactures when the remanufacturable inventory is not zero, although the optimal policy may do so. However we believe that has little effect on the costs because the manufacturing rate is lower than the remanufacturing rate.

It is much more difficult to design simple efficient heuristic policies for situation III, due to the complex structure of the optimal policy which cannot be imitated with a simple threshold policy. None of the heuristic policies work well systematically, and the relative cost increase can be larger than 25% on our test bed. Finally, we observe that there exist instances for which all heuristic policies have poor performances (see Fig. 6d: when 
                        
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                           ≃
                           2
                        
                     , the relative cost increase is greater than 10%).

We have studied a make-to-stock queue with product returns and a remanufacturing stage where manufacturing and remanufacturing are performed by one single server. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has never been studied before in a stochastic environment. For a specific set of system parameters values, we were able to characterize completely the optimal policy which is a 3PR base-stock policy. In the class of 3PR base-stock policies, we have provided an efficient method to compute the steady-state probabilities and the optimal policy. We also partially characterized the optimal policy when the remanufacturing rate is equal to the manufacturing rate. Additionally, we have given some insights into the optimal policy structure in the general case. Based on these insights, we have introduced three simple threshold policies (RM, IRM and IR) and compared them to the 3PR base-stock policy and to the optimal policy. The performances of these heuristic policies are very good in some situations. However none of them has a good performance for all situations and there exist situations where none of the heuristic policies performs well. Therefore implementing the optimal policy seems desirable.

There are several ways to extend our model. Firstly, we can consider more general distributions for manufacturing and remanufacturing times. Secondly, we could include to possibility to dispose products. It could mean to reject a return at the moment it is submitted or to dispose a remanufacturable product or even to dispose a serviceable product. The description of the optimal policy would require three additional switching curves to include these three options. Thirdly, it would be interesting to study the problem with setup costs. This requires to add additional state variables to represent the state of the server. Computing the optimal policy remains numerically tractable. However, it is unlikely that structural results could be derived for the optimal policy, because even in the special case without returns, the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      structure of the optimal policy is conjectured but has not been proven properly in a Markov decision process framework. Finally, our model assumes that preemption is allowed. The optimality of the 3PR base-stock policy, for a specific set of system parameters values, is no more guaranteed when preemption is not allowed. Indeed preempting the manufacturing of new products is interesting when the remanufacturing rate is higher than the manufacturing rate. The approach to forbid preemption is similar to the one to include setup costs and requires to add a variable representing the state of the server. Again the structure of the optimal policy is expected to be significantly more complex and it is unlikely to characterize the optimal policy theoretically. However, it would be interesting to test numerically if the 3PR policy is a good approximation for the optimal policy.
