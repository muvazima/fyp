                  Recently, several research efforts based on social network analysis and methods have been made for medical care information. One of these efforts is to extract the relationships between diseases by using social network modeling. However, all of previous works used the relationships in a simple way in a network consisting of diseases regardless of time or age factors. In this paper, we predict the onset of future diseases on the basis of the current health status of patients by considering age factor. The problem of predicting the relations between diseases is a really difficult and, at the same time, an important task. For this purpose, this paper first constructs a weighted disease network and then, it proposes a novel link prediction method, to identify the connections between diseases, building the evolving structure of the disease network with respect to patients’ ages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in predicting the connections between diseases according to patients’ ages. Experiments on a real network demonstrate that the proposed approach can reveal disease correlations accurately and perform well at capturing future disease risks.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many complex systems, such as social, information, and biological systems, can be modeled as networks [1,2], where nodes represent individuals in the network, while links show the relations or interactions between the nodes [3]. Network is a useful tool in analyzing a wide range of complex systems. Social networks are social structures composed by entities and relationships among them. In this structure, new connections and entities appear or disappear overtime. This case makes them highly dynamic and complex systems. Analysis of social network includes broad field of research concerning method and strategies for the study of social networks [3]. Link prediction is an important task treated by social network analysis. This task is related to the problem of predicting the existence of a connection between two entities and the interactions already present in the network. Many efforts have been made to understand the structure, evolution, and function of networks [3–5]. In this meaning, link prediction tries to infer the likelihood of existence of a link between two nodes, which has important theoretical and practical value [6].

In many real world problems, link prediction can be employed to expect future behavior or to identify plausible relationships that are difficult or expensive to observe directly [7–9]. One of these scenarios is related to medical care research area. Medical care area should become more proactive than reactive in identifying the beginning of disease and risk [10,11]. At present time, doctors generally utilize laboratory results to evaluate the patient’s stage of health. However, these evaluations are generally based on only a few medical parameters and are extremely dependent on a particular doctor’s experience, memory, and time. Hence, present medical care mostly steps in after a disease has emerged. Such an assessment does not treat disease at the earliest signs.

As a remedy to the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a predictor to determine the risk of individuals to develop disease, and to undertake the correct actions at the earliest signs of illness. To this purpose, we first construct a weighted disease network which indicates the relationships between diseases. In this network, nodes are the diseases and edges connect those pairs of diseases appearing in the same patient. Then, we propose an age-series based link prediction method, ASLIP, based on the evolution of the constructed disease network in order to identify the relations in between diseases. Differently from the traditional link prediction methods, in this paper, the disease network is split into several age-sliced snapshots. The more often the interaction of two diseases with each other in each age-sliced snapshot, the stronger is the connection between these diseases. Also, the larger the number of common neighbors between two diseases, the higher is their probability to be connected in the future. The disease prediction problem can thus be naturally formulated as a link prediction problem if objects are diseases and a predicted link (x,y) between two diseases x, y means that a patient affected by the illness x (y resp.) is likely to be effected also by disease y (x resp.) after a specified age interval. In other words, we see hidden relationships strengthening between diseases instead of extracting associations between very common sicknesses. The search for these missing links is performed by applying similarity-based algorithms (see Section 3) that assign a score to the pair (x,y) that measures the proximity between a and y. Finally, we test the proposed method on the disease network constructed with laboratory results of patients more than 210,000. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of our method on unsupervised prediction and encourage us for further analysis.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the construction of disease network. Section 3 briefly discusses the link prediction problem and gives some related work. Section 4 presents our age-series based link prediction method, proposing the evolving structure of disease network and the evolving cases in this network. The conducted experiments and the results achieved for the disease network are discussed in Section 5. Conclusions and future research directions are included in Section 6.

In disease network, nodes are the disease and edges connect these pairs of diseases appearing in the same patient. Thus, a relationship between two nodes exists whenever they appear in even different times in the same patient. In this paper, we first construct an evolving disease network based on age-series. For this purpose, the network is split into several age-sliced snapshots, which represent states of the network at different age intervals. After that, age-series are built by grouping sequential snapshots. These series are at the same time called as frames. We then exploit the connections between diseases to build a prediction model. In this model, we propose the utilization of link prediction methods to generate the predictive model of illnesses.


                     
                     Fig. 1 shows a snippet of the disease network. The patient records contain an important view regarding the co-occurrences of illnesses affecting the same patient. In order to understand better the correlations among the diseases contained in our dataset, a disease network whose nodes are the diseases and a link between two nodes occurs every time those diseases are appeared in even different times in the same patient, i.e., when the couple of illnesses affects at least one patient, is built. The edges are labeled with the number of patients indicating both the illnesses.

A classic definition of the link prediction problem is expressed by: “Given a snapshot of a social network at time t, we seek to accurately predict the edges that will be added to the network during the interval from time t to a given future time t
                     ı” [12]. So far, many approaches have been proposed in order to handle link prediction task. All of these methods are based on the measures indicating the proximity between nodes. These measures proposed in the literature are generally categorized into semantic or topological/structural measures [6]. In semantic measures, the content of the nodes is taken into account to evaluate proximity. For example, the similarity between topics discovered from titles can be used to predict future connections among the authors in a co-authorship network. As apart from the semantic ones, the topological measures consider the network structure to obtain the proximity values. Topological measures are more widely adopted because they are more general and do not require detailed information related to the content of node. Moreover, this content may not be present for every time at the social network considered. Topological measures are categorized into neighborhood-based or path-based measures [13]. The neighborhood-based measures consider the immediate neighbors of the nodes. According to this measure, if the neighbors of two nodes have a large overlap, they will probably form a link [6]. The most widely used measures among them are Common Neighbors [14], Preferential Attachment [14,15], Adamic–Adar Index [16] and Jaccard’s Coefficient [17]. The path-based measures generate a proximity value considering the paths between the related nodes. According to this idea, it is probable that two nodes will form a link if short paths are present in between the related nodes [18]. However, in order to predict new relations at future time, many of studies are established on the applications of proximity measures to non-connected pairs of nodes in the network at present time. Proximity measures showing the similarity between pairs of nodes can be utilized either by unsupervised [12,19,20], or supervised link prediction [21–23]. In unsupervised methods, a proximity measure is selected and utilized to rank node pairs in the network. The node pairs having good score are predicted to be linked. In the supervised approach, the link prediction problem is handled as a classification task and attributes of network are used as predictor attributes by a classification method. A classifier employs these attributes to implement a binary classification to find whether the link will be occurred or not in the future. In all of the above mentioned studies, the proximity values are calculated without considering the evolution of the network. In other words, the proximity measures are calculated using all network data up to the current network state without taking into account when links are created. Therefore, hidden and potentially valuable source of information is not adequately considered for link prediction.

There are specific cases occurred between a pair of nodes in sequential time intervals. These cases deal with creation or removal of link between nodes. For instance, a new link can be formed between two nodes in the next interval, while they are not connected in a specific time interval. This situation represents the evolution of the related social network. Some studies, recently, have been done concerning the use of time intervals for link prediction. Tylenda et al. [24] proposed a network model in which link weight was showing the age of the most recent specific cases between the related nodes. Brigmann et al. [25] proposed a network with temporal information for discovering association rules explaining the network evolution. The other approaches proposed for link prediction handles the task as a time series forecasting problem [26–28]. For this purpose, time series were first built for each pair of nodes. Here, each series observation is the frequency of occurrence of links between the nodes during a specific interval [28]. All of the studies done in this area consider time concept as interval. For instance, by using time series based link prediction in co-author network the collaborations between authors after several time series can be predicted. In this paper, as apart from the previous works, we handle age concept for intervals in the series. Our aim is to investigate the prediction of new links in age series based network. Thus, if any, we can discover the relationships between diseases having common neighbors during age series. However, time series based network is not suitable for disease networks because we think that disease is not a parameter varying with respect to time like years or seasons. For instance, since out dataset includes all the patient records only for 2013 year, we cannot say: “a patient having illness x in winter is likely to be also effected by disease y, looking at the past three seasons”.

In this section, the metrics with/without weights used for computing the similarity of two nodes are illustrated. For this purpose, some definitions and notation which will be useful to understand are first given. Let Γ(x) be the set of neighbors of node x in the social network and let |Γ(x)| be the number of neighbors (degree of node) of node x. In such a case, let w(x,y) be the link weight between nodes x and y. Many of the used approaches are based on the idea that two nodes x and y will have more chance to form a link in the future if their sets of neighbors Γ(x) and Γ(y) overlap, respectively. In other words, a link (x,y) is more likely to form if (x,z) and (z,y) already exist for some z in the network.
                        
                           
                              Common neighbors (CN): According to this measure, two nodes are more likely to be connected if they share more common neighbors [14]. The following formula defines the CN measure without weight:

                                             )

                              Resource allocation index (RA): According to this proximity measure by taking inspiration from a real physical process, x send some resource to y while their common neighbors act as transmitters. In the simplest case, x has a unit of resource and can send part of it to y by averagely distributing the amount to all its neighbors [29]. The greater the amount of resources y receives from x, the more likely a link between x and y will form. RA is defined as:

Social networks are dynamic structures. These structures evolve over time either by addition of new nodes or by new links shaping between nodes. Therefore, the evolution of these networks brings to mind the question what the future connections will be. In the present work, we propose a novel link prediction method based on unsupervised strategy that considers the evolving structure of a weighted network, such as disease network, and evolving cases concerning pairs of nodes in the network. The goal of the paper is to merge Homans’ idea [30] that the strength of a connection between two nodes is proportional with how often they interact with one another and Newman’s method [31] that the larger the number of common neighbors between two nodes, the higher is their probability to be connected in the future [28]. Since the weighted network is used in this paper, we modified Newman’s method in the form of “the larger the total weights of common neighbors between two nodes, the higher is their probability to be connected in the future”.

The proposed method will strengthen or weaken the proximity score between two nodes with respect to the evolving cases occurred among the two nodes and their neighborhood. As network evolves, the increment or decrement of weights of links at a specific rate is defined as an evolving case which will be explained in more detail in the next section. In the proposed study, an evolving structure is first constructed by extracting sequential frames of the networks at the different age intervals. Then, the predictor attributes are described for each candidate pair of nodes by proximity scores determined with the evolving cases occurred during the transitions of frames.

The evolving structure represents states of the network according to different age intervals of the patients in the disease network. For this purpose, in this paper, we built age-series or the frames by grouping several age-sliced sequential snapshots. For instance, the frame 
                           (
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           )
                         at [20–25] age interval is a sub-graph containing all links observed among diseases of all people in between 20 and 25 years old. An example of evolving structure and prediction frame of the disease network is given in 
                        Fig. 2.

It should be noted that the size of each frame is the same as the length of the prediction window, which is pre-specified in the link prediction problems.

An evolving case is generally the action that conducts a pair of nodes from a state (linked or unlinked) to another. An evolving case is defined as the increment or decrement of weight of a link between two nodes from a frame to its subsequent in a weighted network as disease network. These cases can be categorized into one of three different types; consistent, strengthening and weakening.

A consistent case in the disease network occurs when the weight of the relation between two nodes does not increase more than a case changing rate pre-determined or does not decrease less than this rate while the network evolves. In other words, while two diseases have a link in a frame, the strength of this connection is kept in the subsequent one. In such a case, in order to consider a consistent case during the transition from the (k−1)th to the kth frame,

                            indicates the positive score for consistent cases since the strength of a connection between two nodes is kept.

Strengthening cases occur when the weight of link between two nodes on different frames is increased more than the case changing rate pre-determined. In other words, they happen when the weight of two nodes in a frame increases more than the case changing rate in the next frame.

                            indicates a reward for the strengthening cases, this value should be positive since the connection between two nodes is strengthened.

Weakening case is opposite to the strengthening one. In the kind of this case, the strength of existing link between two nodes decreases from a frame to its subsequent. The weakening case score

                            is a decrement value and should be negative since the strength of the connection between the nodes decreases.

The values c, s, d which are given for the consistent, strengthening and weakening cases, respectively, are estimated by evaluating the link prediction performance on a validation set. The validation set is the last frame before the prediction frame.

Many methods for link prediction calculate scores to pairs of nodes by employing a chosen proximity measure. Thus, it is determined how similar those nodes are and, therefore, how probably a connection between them will be formed in a near future.

In this paper, we have combined the scores associated to primary cases, which are the evolving cases directly related to pairs of nodes under consideration, with the scores associated to secondary cases, which are the evolving cases observed in the nodes’ neighborhood.

Finally, the age-series score concerning a given pair of nodes

                         is the set of neighbors of the node x in the constructed network. The parameter α is a control factor that shows how strong secondary cases affect the tie between x and y.

In our experiment, the proposed measures were compared with commonly used measures in the literature for link prediction. We will use the proximity scores in the weighted networks since the edges are labeled with the number of patients having diseases in this paper. For this purpose, five proximity scores modified for weighted networks were considered; Common Neighbors (CN) [14], Jaccard’s Coefficient (JC) [7], Preferential Attachment (PA) [15], Adamic–Adar Coefficient (AA) [16] and Resource Allocation Index (RA) [29].

The steps of the proposed method, ASLIP, are as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              The non-connected pairs or pairs having a weight less than pre-specified threshold are chosen from the validation set. However, the non-connected pairs that were directly or indirectly not affected by some case during the network evolution were eliminated.

The proximity scores of these pairs chosen are computed with respect to six different predictors (CN, JC, PA, AA, RA and ASLIP).

The top 1000-pair having the highest proximity values are determined for testing. The top ranked pairs are considered as the future links that are more likely to appear.

If a non-connected pair in the validation set converts a connected pair in the prediction frame or the weight of a pair having a weight less than predefined threshold increases more than the case changing rate from the validation set to the prediction frame, the pair of nodes is assumed as positive and assumed as negative otherwise.

The performance measures of all the predictors considered are determined.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

In this study, we conducted a set of experiments using real medical data in order to evaluate the ASLIP. For this purpose, first of all, we applied to Non-Interventional Clinical Researches Ethics Board in Fırat University in order to obtain patient records coming from Elazığ and its neighbor cities in Turkey. The dataset usage was approved with decision number of 06–08 by the related board on March 25th, 2014. After this, we collected all the patient medical records belonging to Fırat University Hospital between January 1st and December 31st, 2013. Patients’ medical records were taken suitably to the ethics rules of the hospital. At the beginning there was a dataset containing 210,134 patient records. But this dataset was subjected to the data cleaning process for constructing the disease network. These cleaning steps are as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The patients who visited the hospital only once were cleaned.

Then, any patient who visited the hospital more than once but was diagnosed to have the same condition was cleaned too.

Following these processes, the number of the patients who were visited the hospital more than once was calculated as 168,006. The diagnoses belonging to the patients were coded in accordance with ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification). Only the first three digits (on the overall seven) of ICD-10-CM codes expressing the general diagnosis have been considered. Even if some detail can be missed, these three digits are sufficiently informative to understand disease correlations. In the next section, we describe the disease network data used in our experiments and the process with unsupervised strategy.

In the disease network, each node is a disease as the links between the nodes represent the co-occurrence of the disease. The total number of nodes is 3114 and the number of edges is 66,217. In this study, we performed the experiments using three versions of the network.
                           
                              (1)
                              an unweighted version in which a link is presented between a pair of diseases if they appeared at the least one patient.

a weighted version of the network in which each link between a pair of diseases is weighted by the total number of patients having both diseases. Here, the case changing rate 
                                    (
                                    r
                                    )
                                  is 25%.

A nother weighted version of the network where the case changing rate 
                                    (
                                    r
                                    )
                                  is 50%.

The weights in the relationships indicate how strong is the link between two nodes instead of only considering the binary relation between them. The purpose of doing experiments with the different versions of the network is to investigate whether the use of weights in relationship and different case changing rates provides better prediction results. As the age-series of the network are concerned, we used four different age-series with specific features. These features have been specifically chosen to test the values of precision, recall and F-measure of our method. As shown in 
                        Table 1, the frame size of the second age-series is larger than that of the first age-series. Similarly, the third age-series is concerned with young patients as the fourth age-series handle senior patients. We also used the validation set to empirically evaluate and determine the most appropriate values of c, s, d, α and threshold parameters in the link prediction task. The threshold value is the proportion of weight of the node pair under consideration to the sum of weights of all the links in the related frame. Throughout this study, the threshold value is pre-specified as 0.5%. We showed with some tests that the best performance was achieved at 
                           c
                           =
                           0.45
                           ,
                           s
                           =
                           0.85
                           ,
                           d
                           =
                           −
                           0.3
                         and 
                           α
                           =
                           0.07
                        . These results indicate that consistent (c) and weakening (d) values almost balance with each other. The best performance values were achieved when 
                           c
                           <
                           s
                        .

Some experiments for each age-series were carried out. The first set of the experiments is dedicated to evaluate the network with evolving structure consisting of

                           55

                           )
                         age interval is used as the prediction frame. 
                        Table 2 reports the top-20 most frequent diseases in the validation set of this experiment after removing diseases with generic terms as well as acute conditions such as cold, cough, fever, unspecified pain.

Performance measures, precision, recall and F-measure, found by six proximity scores for three different versions of the network are reported in 
                        Fig. 3. As can be easily seen from Fig. 3, the weighted versions of the network obtained better results for all the methods. Our approach, ASLIP, outperforms the other well-known predictors for every three versions. It also should be noted that the best prediction is achieved by our link predictor over the weighted version 1 of the network. In the version 1, the case changing rate is relatively small (r=25%). Since the case changes of the links (consistent, strengthening or weakening) between the frames are determined by this rate, it is reasonable to observe larger number of the case changes for the frames with less size as 5 in such a rate. In other words, while the size of frame remains constant, if the case changing rate increases, less number of the case changes between frames is observed. This situation directly affects the accuracy of the predictors. In this paper, only ASLIP considers age related frames. The other 5 methods do not handle these frames. They take into account non-connected pairs and weak links having a weight less than predefined threshold in the validation set only. 
                        Table 3 shows the top 10 relations having the highest scores found by the ASLIP. According to this table, the relation with the largest score for our method is the one between “Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications-Essential (primary) hypertension”. This is, at the same time, the link which its weight has showed the highest increase from the validation frame to the prediction frame. Table 3 also reveals that “Essential (primary) hypertension” is related to many diseases. It behaves as a hub in the disease network since our case based approach considers the nodes having maximum 2 length distance.

In the next experiment, the individual level risk of the disease links seen in Table 3 are given as confidence values in 
                        Table 4. The first two columns in this table show the frequency of the related diseases in the validation frame. 1→2 (%), which is also called as confidence value of the rule Disease-1→Disease-2, represents the ratio of the number of patients having Disease-1 and Disease-2 (link weight) to the number of patients having Disease-1 in the validation frame. Similarly, 2→1 (%) is determined as;

For the first row, this means that while 0.80% of the patients having “Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications” at [50, 55) age interval are also catch “Essential (primary) hypertension”. This rate raises to 4.02% at [55, 60) age interval. In other words, the risks of being captured both diseases increases more than 5 times at [55, 60) age interval. This is an important finding for individual level of risk.

The last experiment of the first set deals with observing the average confidence values of the top 1000-pair having the highest proximity values for each method. As can be seen from 
                        Table 5, the average confidence values of all the methods are almost same in the validation set. However, the average values of our method, ASLIP, are better than those of the other methods for the rules in every two directions. The increase from the validation frame to the prediction frame is about 6 times.

In the second set of the experiments, we applied our case-based proximity score on the age-series having frames with larger size. In these new age-series, the size of frame is 10. The evolving structure of the network consists of

                        Fig. 4 reports the performance results. Case-based score outperforms the other methods and delivers the highest precision on the version 2 of the network. As apart from the previous age-series, in this experiment, it is seen that larger case changing rate captured more effective predictions in the frames with the larger size. We noted another important point throughout the experiments: in the case of small changing rate, the cases change frequently during the transition of frames. However, the number of patients of each frame in these age-series is larger than that of the first age-series. The same situation is also seen at the other measures, recall and F-measure. For every two measures, our method delivers the best results compared with the other methods. 
                        Table 6 gives the top-10 links with the highest scores found by the ASLIP for the age-series having frames with large size.

The next two sets of the experiments split the age-series of the first experiment into two parts. The goal of these experiments is to evaluate the performance measures of link prediction methods on the networks constructed for young and senior patients. For this purpose, the third experiment set handles the first part of the partitioned network. This part is, at the same time, age-series of the young patients. As the evolving structure of the network under consideration contains

                         age interval. The first experiment of this set experiment investigates performance values of the proposed method and the other approaches in the case of young patients. The results given in 
                        Fig. 5 demonstrate that our method obtained better results for every three versions of the network. Furthermore, the results of our approach on the version 1 of the network are almost the best in all the experiments. There are two reasons of this. First, the number of young patients is less than that of senior patients. Second, the frame size is relatively smaller. 
                        Table 7 reports 10 of the highest scored links predicted by the ASLIP over the network with young patient.

In the fourth set of the experiments, we handled the second part of the partitioned network which includes senior patients. Larger number of patients was seen in these age-series. This is actually an expected situation because the probability of being captured a different disease in senior patients is larger than that of young patients. The corresponding experiment results are shown in 
                        Fig. 6. Although the frame size is small in these age-series, the version 2 of the network found slightly better results for our method because of larger number of patients in each frame due to senior patients. Some relations among general classes of diseases are reported in 
                        Table 8.

The next experiment is dedicated to test the importance of more recent cases observed for a pair of nodes on both weighted versions of the network. For this purpose, we used two monotonically increasing functions to weight recent cases more heavily than the old ones. In this case, the proximity score is modified as follows:

                        Table 9, the best precision performance is achieved by the first age-series with the importance of log(k) on the weighted version 1 of the network. In our experiments, we also observed a performance gain when the case-based score (ASLIP) using

                         was compared to the case-based score using

                         in the network. This situation reveals an important fact that recent cases carry more information about the occurrence of links.

In the last experiment, our aim was to investigate how the case changing rate, r, affects the performance of the case-based measure. For this purpose, we evaluate the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) values by adopting different values of r ranging from 10% to 60%, with an increment of 10 for two different age-series. The AUC values obtained as r varies are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 7. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the best AUC values were obtained at the (25–30) interval of the case changing rate for the age-series with small size. AUC values are relatively small for the age-series with large size and the best ones were observed at the (45–55) interval of the case changing rate.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we contributed to the ongoing research by proposing an age-series based link prediction method, ASLIP, for finding the most appropriate connections between diseases. Our work focuses on unsupervised machine learning strategy for link prediction. The paper includes four contributions. First, we proposed a novel weighted disease network where nodes are the diseases and edges connect these pairs of diseases appearing in even different times in the same patient. Next, we propose an efficient link prediction method for weighted social networks, such as disease network. In this method, the evolving structure of disease network was considered with respect to patients’ ages. Third, for this purpose, the evolving cases were defined. Finally, our case-based link prediction score outperforms all the methods compared in this paper in terms of prediction, recall and F-measure.

The experiments conducted on real data sets illustrate that the proposed approach produces meaningful results and has reasonable efficiency. The results at the frames with different age interval are consistent and hence encouraging. Our link prediction method can be also directly applied to other diverse types of weighted social networks, or it can be extended to address problems not yet considered.

The network proposed in this paper is a unipartite network. However, many social networks are bipartite networks, such as the author-topic networks in reviewer finding area. So far, most of the link prediction problems have usually been explained on unipartite graphs. But, when a unipartite link prediction method applies to bipartite graphs, it is seen that the results are not encouraging. In the future, we will revise our case-based score to make this score more realistic, improve our algorithm such that one could have better performance in bipartite networks having disease and symptom nodes.
