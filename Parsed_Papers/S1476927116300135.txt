                  Background
                  The statistical tests for single locus disease association are mostly under-powered. If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involves multiple SNPs or possible environmental factors, its effect might be missed if the causal SNP is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. In this study, we attempt to address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies by accounting for genetic influences that negatively impact the detection of causal variant in single point association analysis. In our method we use propensity score (PS) to adjust for the effect of SNPs that influence the marginal association of a candidate marker. These SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and/or epistatic with the target-SNP and have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. We therefore propose a propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) as a tool for dimension reduction to improve the power for single locus studies through an estimated PS to adjust for influence from these SNPs while regressing disease status on the target-genetic locus. The degree of freedom of such a test is therefore always restricted to 1.
               
               
                  Results
                  We assess PSAM under the null hypothesis of no disease association to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-I-error rate (<0.05). PSAM displays reasonable power (>70%) and shows an average of 15% improvement in power as compared with commonly-used logistic regression method and PLINK under most simulated scenarios. Using the open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction dataset, PSAM displays improved significance for all disease loci. Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing their original trend-test p-values from within 0.001 and 0.05 to p-values less than 0.0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and inflammation.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  PSAM improves the significance of single-locus association of causal SNPs which have had marginal single point association by adjusting for influence from other SNPs in a dataset. This would explain part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. PSAM is proposed as an exploratory tool that would be complementary to other existing methods. A downloadable user friendly program, PSAM, written in SAS, is available for public use.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Identifying disease susceptibility loci for complex diseases through genetic association studies assume that finding highly significant statistical differences between marker allele frequencies in case and control populations would help to discover genes influencing disease expression (Corso and Greenberg, 2014). The statistical tests used to detect causal variant using single locus association analyses are mostly under-powered. One could conceivably focus on the complex relationship between multiple genetic variants to account for the loss of heritability in such single locus association strategies (Zuk et al., 2012). If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involve multiple SNPs or environmental factors, the effect of the causal SNP might be missed if it is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. Hence, methods which focus on pair-wise statistical interaction between SNPs, in search for disease association have been developed (Sengupta Chattopadhyay et al., 2014; Hahn et al., 2003; Purcell et al., 2007). Multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MDR) is one such popular method, which uses a non-parametric technique via exhaustive search strategy for higher order epistasis analysis (Hahn et al., 2003). The epistasis module of PLINK is another popular state of the art procedure which uses a parametric technique to conduct gene-gene interaction analysis (Purcell et al., 2007). However, there are several issues that pose challenge for such interaction studies. These include the problem of handling higher order interactions (>2-way) where the number of possible marker combinations is manifold for a large number of SNPs, hence, analysis involving large samples are required to obtain a significant p-value. The amount of time needed to perform such analyses even with advanced CPU power and space is unaccountable for large-scale association data. Moreover, presence of allelic heterogeneity, varying amounts of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between disease alleles and marker SNP, and differing interactions of disease allele with alleles at other loci add to the challenge of identifying disease association with interacting loci.

In single locus analysis strategies, statistical power to detect the causal locus is likely to be reduced as the effect of the causal locus is masked by the effects of genetic variants at other loci (definition of epistasis) thereby compromising the inference of detecting causal variant (Cordell, 2002). This masking effect is essentially a definition of epistatic effect of other SNPs on the causal SNP as stated by Cordell (2002). Accounting for such masking/confounding effects would explain part of the missing heritability in single locus analysis strategies.

Propensity score (PS) approach is popular to epidemiologists for mitigating confounding effects in observational studies (Austin, 2011). It was first proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin to infer cause and effect from observational studies (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). PS is estimated through a conditional probability where a particular treatment is assigned given a vector of observed covariates and adjustment for this PS is sufficient to remove bias due to all observed covariates (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). An observational study attempts to estimate the effects of a treatment or an exposure by comparing outcomes for subjects who were not assigned at random to treatment or control (Jepsen et al., 2004). PS reduces or adjusts for the effects of confounders to estimate treatment effects, and it balances covariates (such as age, gender or population principle components) so that treated and control groups are comparable (Austin, 2011). Most often a logistic regression model is used to estimate the true PS by regressing the treatment status on observed covariates (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Several ways to adjust for covariates when estimating the effects of treatment on outcomes using PS include matching, stratification (or subclassification), covariate adjustment and inverse probability treatment weighing (IPTW) (Pourhoseingholi et al., 2012; Pirracchio et al., 2015).

In genetic association studies, to infer the direct causal effect of a genetic variant, Vansteelandt et al. (2009) have proposed to use PS to control for the effect of biological phenotypes to adjust for confounding. Jiang and Zhang (2011) have also suggested using non-parametric techniques to obtain PS while adjusting for covariates like population stratification or environmental factors for SNPs of interest to identify disease association. Instead of directly testing epistatic effects from numerous combinations of SNPs, in this paper, we propose using PS as a dimension-reduction tool to improve the marginal single-point association result for each SNP by accounting for loss of heritability. The effects include SNPs that are epistatic and/or in LD (correlated) with the target-SNP. Epistatic SNPs have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. Correlated SNPs i.e., those in LD with the target-SNP have an effect on the disease. The underlying model logit(Y)=

                        j
                      for specific i and j. The epistatic function g can only be expressed in a form of two-way matrix (Table 1
                     ). The goal of this study is to detect single point disease association of SNP

                      (k

                        j
                      for unknown i and j have relatively weak main effects (βi
                     ,βj
                     )but strong epistatic effect g, models including either SNP
                        i
                      or SNP
                        j
                      usually have low power due to the weak main effects, and their effects are likely to be ignored unless both are present in the fitted model. However it is not plausible to include either all SNPs (main effects) in one model or to try models of all possible interacting SNP combinations (for all i and j) when n is large. A conventional method, stepwise-multiple logistic regression model (S-MLRM), is to fit Y on the SNPs using stepwise selection procedure (Cordell and Clayton, 2002). However this method have low power when the target marker SNP
                        i
                      and SNP
                        j
                      have weak main effects. Another naïve choice, is univariate logistic regression model (ULRM), where univariate SNPs (SNPk
                      for each k
                     =1∼
                     n) are fitted individually through a logistic regression model and significant SNPk
                     s’ are picked, may also result in low power due to the similar reason.

The proposed propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) tests single locus association through an estimated PS to adjust for influence from correlated and/or epistatic genetic factors. Such genetic factors (SNPs) could be termed as covariate SNPs as they could possibly be predictive of the disease under study or may be in association with the SNP under study (Clarke et al., 2011). The PS of a target-SNP is expected to summarize the necessary information from the numerous other SNPs which may be potentially epistatic or correlated with the disease locus, and therefore reduces the dimensionality of statistical testing. The original application of PS was to balance the covariates’ distributions for a binary target-explanatory variable (exposure and non-exposure). However, for continuous or multi-level target-variable, it had been shown that the direct adjustment by incorporating PS into the model can also efficiently reduce the bias due to the imbalance, whereas in this case the PS was estimated by linear regression (Lian, 2003). In this study, for simplification, we illustrate the effect of the PS for a binary target-SNP i.e., the SNP under study, by assuming the target-SNP as dominant or recessive. We propose to identify candidate covariate SNPs, prioritize them using a stepwise regression method and integrate them into the PS based covariate adjustment model (Schneeweiss et al., 2009). The target-SNP is regressed over such covariate SNPs to obtain the predicted PS. The systematic differences in these SNPs are taken care of between cases and control subjects while estimating the adjusted effect of the target-SNP on disease. In our single-locus model, we do not overlook the masking effect from other epistatic and correlated SNPs that might have a confounding effect on the power to detect a causal SNP. Instead, we use an estimated propensity score (PS) as an adjustment factor to adjust for such epistatic (masking) effect from the disease-associated genetic loci.

Logistic regression including both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models has been employed in the past (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989; Cordell and Clayton, 2002) for both single point and multipoint disease-SNP association analysis. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted an extensive simulation study to compare the performance of PSAM against the popular association testing method PLINK v1.9 (Purcell et al., 2007) and standard logistic regression procedures including both univariate (univariate logistic regression method (ULRM)) (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) and multivariate (stepwise multivariate regression method (S-MLRM)) (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989; Cordell and Clayton, 2002) methods in terms of power and type-I-error rates. Through our methodology, we address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies while simultaneously restricting the degree of freedom of test to 1. PSAM displays power improvement in identifying causal SNPs over other state of the art methods used for evaluation in our simulation. When applied to an open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) dataset, PSAM have shown improved significance for the disease associated SNPs. When further applied to GAW16 North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset, PSAM identified significant SNPs which have been found to have association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and immunity.

@&#METHODS@&#

Instead of considering numerous SNPs and their higher-order interactions for an association analysis using logistic regression, the proposed PSAM intends to study the single point disease association of one SNP at a time while adjusting for the effects from other possible genetic effects through an adjustment by PS that is estimated using relevant SNPs that are in LD and/or epistatic with a target-SNP. PSAM uses a set of reduced models:

A disease association test is carried out for each SNP
                        i
                      at a time using PSAM method, described through the following steps, Step 1–Step 4.

A stepwise regression model of disease status (Y) on all SNPs (SNP1, SNP2, …, SNP
                           n
                        ) is conducted with a selection criteria C where the significance level of the score chi-square for entering a SNP into the model is 0.1 and the significance level of the Wald chi-square for a SNP to remain in the model is 0.1. The selected subset, denoted as {SNP}
                           C,
                         is a tentative subset SNPs that are moderately associated with Y and is retained for estimation of PS in step 2. Note that only the covariates associated with disease status (Y) are useful in estimating PS (Lian, 2003; Brookhart et al., 2006).

                         is considered to have marginal effect on the disease association. If SNP
                           i
                         is a disease-associated marker, then the corresponding PS
                           i
                         actually serves as a surrogate of its potential epistatic and/or correlated counterparts.

                        s’ with p-values less than a preset level α/n are identified as the disease-associated SNPs, through a Bonferroni correction (Dunn, 1961).

Note that PSAM is a set of reduced models rather than a single model, which focuses on single point disease association tests. Therefore there is no direct statistical test to compare PSAM and the underlying interaction model. Instead, S-MLRM, ULRM and PLINK, which are other popular state of the art procedures, to represent the performance of the underlying single locus association test model, are used to compare and evaluate the performance of PSAM.

PSAM, is compared with ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK with respect to power and type-I-error rates under various simulation scenarios as described in the following section.

We simulated seven types of datasets, simdata1–simdata7, using SNAP (Nothnagel, 2002) to evaluate our proposed procedure under various epistatic types and genetic parameters (Table 1). Table 1(a–g) displays the penetrance values and allele frequencies for seven disease models,Model1–Model7, respectively, that have been proposed by existing studies (Knapp et al., 1994; Dong et al., 2008; Li and Reich, 2000).

Simdata 1: 500 case-control datasets are simulated; each consisting of 21 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls. The disease status is defined by Model1 (Table 1(a)) which is a single locus penetrance model defining the causal SNP with main effects but no interaction. The 2nd marker is assumed to be the causal variant (disease-associated locus) but is not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship between this locus and disease status. SNP1 which is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the disease locus (r
                        2
                        =0.75) is instead used as the quasi-disease marker (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the analysis. The remaining 19 SNPs are non-disease SNPs, independent of each other.

Simdata 2: A set of 500 case-control datasets are simulated, each consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls. Two of the SNPs are disease associated. The disease status is defined through the epistasis model Model2 (Table 1(b)) (Knapp et al., 1994). Model 2 is a two-way epistasis model for SNPs, both exhibiting main effects, described by Knapp et al. (1994). In this model, all BB genotypes at locus 2 are at-risk. However, the Bb genotype is only at risk if coupled with the AA genotype at locus 1. Thus, this epistatic interaction may be described as that, the diseased “B” allele is dominant if and only if the “a” allele is not present in the genotype, otherwise, the “B” allele is recessive. The central loci (12th and 14th SNPs) are assumed to be the causal variants (disease-associated loci). They are not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship between these loci and disease status. LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7) and between the 13th and 14th markers (D′=0.5). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata2 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r

                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 3: 500 case-control datasets, each consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls are simulated using Model3 (Table 1(c)) (Knapp et al., 1994). For Model 3, the disease alleles, A and B, act recessively except for the genotype AABB which is not at risk. Accordingly, the only susceptible genotypes are AaBB, aaBB, AABb, and AAbb. The 12th locus and 14th locus are assumed to be disease-associated loci but are not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship between these loci and disease status. Instead, LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.8) and between the 13th and 14th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata 3 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r
                        2
                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 4: A set of 500 case-control datasets, each consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls are simulated using Model4 (Table 1(d)) (Dong et al., 2008). This model is a modifying effects model based on a modified single locus model with the exception that genotype aABB is altered from 0 to 1. The 12th and 14th loci are assumed to be the disease-associated loci but are not included in the power analysis due to the deterministic relationship between these loci and disease status. LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.8) and between the 13th and 14th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.8). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata 4 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r
                        2
                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 5: A set of 500 case-control datasets, consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls are simulated using Model 5 (Table 1(e)) (Dong et al., 2008). This model is a modifying effects model, which is a jointly dominant–dominant model, where at least one copy of the disease allele from both loci is required to be affected by the disease. The 12th and 14th loci are assumed to be the disease-associated loci but are not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship between these loci and disease status. Instead, LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7) and between the 13th and 14th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata 5 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r
                        2
                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 6: A set of 500 case-control datasets, consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls are simulated using Model 6 (Table 1(f)) (Dong et al., 2008) which is a diagonal model, where at least one allele from at least one locus should be present to be affected by the disease. The 12th locus and 14th locus are assumed to be the causal variants (disease-associated loci) but are not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship, between these loci and disease status. Instead, LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.8), and between the 13th and 14th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata 6 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r
                        2
                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 7: A set of 500 case-control datasets, consisting of 32 SNPs from 900 cases and 1000 controls are simulated using Model 7 (Table 1(g)) (Dong et al., 2008; Li and Reich, 2000). This is the x or model proposed and described by Li and Reich (2000). This is a jointly recessive model with the exception of the two-locus AABB genotype. The 12th locus and 14th locus are assumed to be the disease-associated loci but are not included in the power analysis because of the deterministic relationship between these loci and disease status. LD is assumed between the 11th and 12th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.8) and between the 13th and 14th markers (r
                        2
                        =0.7). The 11th (SNP11) and 13th loci (SNP12) are considered as the quasi-disease markers (Hsieh et al., 2011) for the simdata 7 study. The LD between the epistatic disease markers is r
                        2
                        =0.05. The rest of the SNPs have a LD of r
                        2
                        =0−0.05 with the disease SNPs.

Simdata 1. Power is calculated by using Eq. (6) as the percent of times the disease-associated locus SNP
                              i
                            (SNP1) is found to be significant using the 500 datasets which are simulated under Model 1 (Table 1(a)). A Bonferroni correction (Dunn, 1961) (α/n; α
                           =0.05, n
                           =20) is used for the cut-off threshold for significance to correct for multiple testing. Comparisons are done between PSAM, ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK.

Simdata 2–Simdata 7. Power is calculated separately for SNP11 and SNP12 and is calculated as the proportion of times the disease associated loci SNP
                              i
                            (SNP11 or SNP12) is found to be significant using the 500 datasets which are simulated under the respective model (Table 1(b–g)) using Eq. (6). A Bonferroni correction (Dunn, 1961) (α/n; α
                           =0.05, n
                           =30) is used for the cut-off threshold for significance to correct for multiple testing. Comparisons are done between PSAM, ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK.

A set of 500 case-control datasets consisting of 30 SNPs are simulated under the null hypothesis of “no disease loci” from 900 cases and 1000 controls. The type-I-error rates are calculated using Eq. (7) and comparisons under dominant and recessive assumptions are done for PSAM, ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK. The level of significance is set according to Bonferroni correction (α/n; α
                           =0.05, n
                           =30) (Dunn, 1961). Since none of the SNPs in these datasets is disease-related, we count it as a type-I-error if any of the 30 SNPs is tested to be significant with p-value<
                           α/n. The type-I-error rate is then defined as the proportion of the 500 datasets which has type-I-error:
                              
                                 (7)

                                             at least one significant non-disease-related SNP

The open source Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) (Hahn et al., 2003) data consists of 20 SNPs for 400 samples (200 cases, 200 controls) and is downloaded from http://www.multifactordimensionalityreduction.org/ (Yee et al., 2013). MDR is a data mining strategy for detecting and characterizing nonlinear interactions among SNPs that are predictive of a disease status (Hahn et al., 2003). The MDR method had detected SNP combinations (SNP1), (SNP1, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP6, SNP8), and (SNP1, SNP2, SNP6, SNP8) as the first to fourth order disease-associated interactions, respectively, using this dataset (Hahn et al., 2003). We define an ideal situation (Base) where the PS for SNP1, SNP2, SNP6, and SNP8 are calculated by only conditioning on the known interacting SNPs (SNP2, SNP6, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP6, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP2, SNP8), and (SNP1, SNP2, SNP6), respectively, by Eq. (2). The disease status (Y) is then regressed on each of the disease-associated SNPs, SNP1, SNP2, SNP6, and SNP8 with the respective PS adjustment factors using Eq. (4). Different from the ideal situation (Base), information from all SNPs is incorporated in PSAM to derive the adjustment factor PS. A comparison study is conducted using ULRM, S-MLRM, PLINK, PSAM and Base to assess how close PSAM is to the ideal scenario (Base) and how these methods (ULRM, S-MLRM, PSAM and PLINK) perform against each other in identifying the disease associated SNPs (SNP1, SNP2, SNP6 and SNP8).

The NARAC dataset included 868 Rheumatoid Arthritis cases and 1194 controls that had been assayed using the Illumina 550k platform. Quality control (QC) was applied to the dataset and SNPs were excluded with minor-allele frequency (MAF)<0.01, genotype-call rates<0.95, and p-value<10−4 (departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium). We applied the Cochran–Armitage trend-test using the PROC CASECONTROL statistical procedure within the SAS/Genetics package (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA) on the SNPs that passed the QC criteria to carry out single-point analyses. SNPs with less significant trend-p-values (0.05<trend-p-value<0.001) were retained for carrying out analysis using our proposed method. For each of the chromosomes, 100 tagged SNPs (n) were chosen with an LD of r
                        2
                        =0.8. The pair wise LD between the chosen tag SNPs ranges between r
                        2
                        =0 and r
                        2
                        =0.8 [median (r
                        2)=0.03]. This implies that the chosen tag SNPs may or may not have correlation among them depending on the LD that exists between them. A whole genome single point association analysis is conducted using PSAM on the chosen 2100 tag-SNPs, and those displaying improvement in marginal significance is reported in this study.

@&#RESULTS@&#


                        Fig. 1
                        (a) shows the power distribution for SNP1 under the simulation scenario simdata1 based on Model1. Model1 which has only one disease SNP with a marginal main effect and does not interact with any other SNP, as expected, displays almost no improvement in power over ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK when PS is used as a regression adjustment factor in PSAM. The results are similar under both recessive and dominant assumptions.


                        Fig. 1(b–g) show the power distribution for SNP11 and SNP12 under each simulation scenario simdata 2–simdata 7, respectively. For simdata 2 which is simulated using Model 2 (Fig. 1(b)), under both recessive and dominant scenarios, PSAM outperforms ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK in terms of power for identifying the disease-associated loci, SNP11 and SNP12. For SNP11, PSAM displays a higher power (0.924 under dom and 0.718 under rec) as compared to ULRM (0.80 under dom and 0.59 under rec), S-MLRM (0.86 under dom and 0.69 under rec) and PLINK (0.83 under dom and 0.59 under rec). For SNP12, the power shows a similar trend, i.e. PSAM (0.264 under dom and 0.17 under rec) performs better than both ULRM (0.01 under dom and 0.02 under rec), S-MLRM (0.15 under dom and 0.04 under rec) and PLINK (0.002 under dom and 0.01 under rec). The power for identifying SNP12 is weaker than that of SNP11 under simdata2. This is attributed to the lower LD between the real causal SNP and SNP12 (D′=0.5) as opposed to the higher LD (D′=0.7) between the real causal SNP and SNP11.

For simdata 3 that is simulated using Model 3 (Table 1(c)) under both recessive and dominant assumptions, PSAM displays improved power when compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(c)) for identifying the disease-associated loci SNP11 and SNP12. Both SNP11 and SNP12 show an overall moderate power because of their moderate LD (r
                        2
                        =0.6) with the real causal variants. In this scenario, PSAM displays a higher power (0.69 under dom and 0.37 under rec) as compared to ULRM (0.66 under dom and 0.34 under rec), S-MLRM (0.67 under dom and 0.36 under rec) and PLINK (0.66 under dom and 0.34 under rec) for SNP11. For SNP12, the results for power show a similar trend, i.e. PSAM (0.28 under dom and 0.2 under rec) performs better than ULRM (0.17 under dom and 0.08 under rec), S-MLRM (0.27 under dom and 0.12 under rec) and PLINK (0.17 under dom and 0.08 under rec).

For simdata 4 that is simulated using Model 4 (Table 1(d)) under both recessive and dominant assumptions, PSAM shows improved power when compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(d)) for disease-associated loci SNP11 and SNP12. The results for both of these loci show an overall higher power under all methods because of the high LD (r
                        2
                        =0.75) that they display with the real causal variants. The power for identifying SNP11 under PSAM is higher (0.96 under dom and 0.99 under rec) as compared to that under ULRM (0.87 under dom and 0.84 under rec), S-MLRM (0.89 under dom and 0.85 under rec) and PLINK (0.95 under dom and 0.97 under rec). A similar trend in power is also shown for SNP12. PSAM (0.96 under dom and 0.98 under rec) performs better than ULRM (0.84 under dom and 0.79 under rec), S-MLRM (0.82 under dom and 0. 8 under rec) and PLINK (0.95 under dom and 0.96 under rec).

For simdata 5 which is simulated using Model 5 (Table 1(e)) under both recessive and dominant assumptions, PSAM displays improved power in comparison to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(e)) for disease-associated loci SNP11 and SNP12. Both SNP11 and SNP12 show an overall higher power because of the high LD (r

                        =0.7) that they display with the real causal variants. PSAM displays improved power (0.96 under dom and 0.96 under rec) when compared to ULRM (0.93 under dom and 0.94 under rec), S-MLRM (0.92 under dom and 0.89 under rec) and PLINK (0.94 under dom and 0.95 under rec) for SNP11. For SNP12, the power for PSAM (0.99 under dom and 0.99 under rec) is higher than ULRM (0.98 under dom and 0.95 under rec), S-MLRM (0.90 under dom and 0.89 under rec) and PLINK (0.97 under dom and 0.97 under rec).

For simdata 6 that is simulated using Model 6 (Table 1(f)) under both recessive and dominant assumptions, PSAM shows improved power when compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(f)) for identifying the disease-associated loci SNP11 and SNP12. PSAM shows an improvement of power (0.414 under dom and 0.995 under rec) for identifying SNP11 over ULRM (0.278 under dom and 0.91 under rec), S-MLRM (0.36 under dom and 0.968 under rec) and PLINK (0.4 under dom and 0.99 under rec). For SNP12, the power shows a similar trend. PSAM (0.99 under dom and 0.14 under rec) performs better than both ULRM (0.91 under dom and 0.06 under rec), S-MLRM (0.93 under dom and 0.07 under rec) and PLINK (0.99 under dom and 0.12 under rec).

For simdata 7 that is simulated using Model 7 (Table 1(g)) under both recessive and dominant assumptions, PSAM shows improved power when compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(g)) for identifying the disease-associated loci SNP11 and SNP12. Both of the disease loci show moderate power for all the methods. PSAM displays a higher power (0.32 under dom and 0.53 under rec) as compared to ULRM (0.3 under dom and 0.47 under rec), and S-MLRM (0.31 under dom and 0.5 under rec) but marginally lower power in comparison to PLINK under dominant model (0.54 under dom and 0.62 under rec) for SNP11. For SNP12, the power shows a similar trend, i.e. PSAM (0.41 under dom and 0.14 under rec) performs better than both ULRM (0.32 under dom and 0.14 under rec), S-MLRM (0.4 under dom and 0.14 under rec) and PLINK (0. 4 under dom and 0.29 under rec).

Overall, by using PSAM, the results display a 15% improvement on average in the power for identifying disease association when compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK under the simulation scenarios. The computing time of PSAM is linearly proportional (n/10) to the total number of SNPs (n) in the study.

                         displays the type-I-error rates for ULRM, S-MLRM, PLINK and PSAM. The type-I-error rates are well controlled within the acceptable threshold of α

                        Table 3 shows the results on p-values using ULRM, S-MLRM, PLINK, PSAM, and Base for identifying the disease-associated SNPs in the MDR open access dataset. The SNP combinations (SNP1), (SNP1, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP8, SNP6) and (SNP1, SNP8, SNP6, SNP2) were identified as the first to fourth orders of disease-associated interacting SNPs by the MDR method (Yee et al., 2013). Thus, conditioning on (SNP2, SNP6, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP6, SNP8), (SNP1, SNP2, SNP8), and (SNP1, SNP2, SNP6) when calculating the PS, would adjust the effects of the epistatic SNPs for each of the disease-associated SNPs, SNP1, SNP2, SNP6, and SNP8, respectively. This, according to our proposed idea, is considered as the ideal situation, which we term as “Base” in Table 3. Under both dominant and recessive assumptions, both PSAM and Base identify disease associations for SNP1, SNP6 and SNP8. The p-values obtained from PSAM are very similar to if not better than those from Base indicating that when PSAM is compared against Base, the PSAM p-values for the disease loci do not deviate much from the Base p-values under both dominant and recessive assumptions. The results in Table 3 indicate that PSAM shows improved significance as compared with ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK under both dominant and recessive assumptions. S-MLRM uses stepwise selection criteria and only detects SNP1 and SNP6 in this analysis. Using the open-access MDR dataset, PSAM successfully improves upon the disease associated significance p-value for SNP1, SNP6, and SNP8 in comparison to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK under both dominant and recessive scenarios. There was no improvement in the significance of SNP2 because it was not selected in the step 1 of PSAM. SNP2 has no marginal association with disease (Y) hence violates the basic criteria to be selected for PS adjustment in step 2 of PSAM.

We applied PSAM to a GAW16 North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) dataset, and conducted a whole genome association study by focusing mainly on less significant SNPs (0.001≤trend-p-value<0.05) This was done to see if PSAM was able to improve on the significance of the disease-associated p-values of these moderately significant SNPs. Detailed reports of the significant findings are displayed in Table 4
                        . A total of 498,888 SNPs passed QC criteria, but only 47,766 SNPs were found to be marginally significant with a trend-p-value between 0.001 and 0.05. We applied PSAM to a further reduced set of 2200 tagged SNPs flanking the 47,766 SNPs under study. PSAM is an exploratory approach and the SNPs with an improvement in the single point p-values were reported. Table 4 lists the SNPs with improved significance through PSAM. Among the 21 significant SNPs that were found to be significant using PSAM, 6 SNPs were identified to be associated with immunity or inflammation. In chromosome 1, rs2643904 from gene SKI was reported with a significant p-value of 4.7×10−4. SKI gene has been reported to be in immune and inflammatory pathways in prior studies (Zampieri et al., 2014). Gene SORCS2 from chromosome 4 with SNP rs10937822 (p-value=2.6×10−4) is expressed in the central nervous system and is associated with neuropeptide receptor activity that is observed in RA patients (D’Amato et al., 2008). The SNP rs12655401 belongs to an intergenic region GABRG2 MRP63P6 (p-value=5.5×10−6). GABRG2 gene or GABA receptor is responsible for compromising pain inhibiting action in patients with chronic inflammation disease such as RA (Kelley et al., 2008). Rs1886066 from intergenic region LOC100506207 – TFAP2A was reported with a significant p-value 3.3×10−4. TFAP2A (Transcription factor gene) has been reported to be negative regulators of inflammation (Rácz et al., 2011). Rs7308929 from gene KLRF2 were found to be associated with immune response through activation of NK cell receptor (Vivier et al., 2011). rs4092050 from chromosome 17, belonging to gene TNS4 was also identified to be associated with transcutenous nerve stimulation for RA (Kumar and Redford, 1982). Apart from these, we found 16 other SNPs with improved significance which had indirect association with inflammation through DNA repair pathways.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A reason often cited for lack of power in single point association analysis is the presence of complex genetic mechanism involving more than one SNP and possible environmental influences. Genetic variation in any system can be decomposed into single locus and complex interacting components of variance (Zeggini and Morris, 2011). Therefore, studying the association of a SNP in isolation, without considering the complex etiology of multiple genetic effects from other SNPs, leads to loss of power in single point studies. However, a number of challenges are associated with higher order interaction studies such as 2-way, 3-way or 4-way interaction. One of those is that the full regression model which describes the relation between the trait of interest and the genetic loci under study will require many interaction terms and therefore potentially many degrees of freedom (Zeggini and Morris, 2011). The power will also be reduced unless the study focuses on a particular interaction term.

Therefore in this study, we propose PSAM, a method for single point association of SNPs by using propensity score (PS). PSAM, do not investigate the masking effect that might have a confounding effect on the power to detect a causal SNP. Instead, it adjusts for effects due to correlation (LD) and/or interaction that are attributed by other genetic variants in the dataset. In the study design of PSAM, the estimated PS, which is derived through a logistic regression of a SNP under study over other epistatic and/or correlated SNPs, serves as a surrogate of its potential epistatic and/or correlated counterparts. PS is used as an adjustment factor in the logistic regression of disease status Y on the SNP under study. If there are total of n SNPs in the study, then the underlying epistasis model, which includes all possible 2-way interacting SNP combinations, would have a {n
                     *(n−1)}/2 degrees of freedom. The incentive of our study is that the degree of freedom for our procedure is always restricted to 1 while the interaction or correlation information from multiple loci is accounted for through the PS term in the regression model. Therefore, unlike observational studies, the number of covariates in disease association studies is large and proper variable selection procedures are important in order to prioritize a subset of epistatic and/or correlated SNPs that would predict the PS with minimal bias (Brookhart et al., 2006). Along this direction, PSAM selects a subset of variables from the large set of SNPs using a stepwise procedure. This narrows down the dimensionality via selecting relevant SNPs that can be adjusted thereby improving on the single point significance of the disease association of the target-SNP. Hence, the loss of power is further controlled without having to specify a particular interaction term in the study.

The PSAM (Eq. (3)) displays higher power as compared to ULRM (Eq. (4)), S-MLRM (Eq. (5)) and PLINKv1.9 to predict disease association under all simulated scenarios (Fig. 1). When applied to the MDR open access dataset, PSAM, which performs almost identical to the “Base” where PS is estimated conditioning on only the interacting SNPs, is shown to display a higher significance as compared to ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK. We also conducted another variable selection procedure (PSAM-PCA) in order to identify relevant candidate covariates for calculating PS. PSAM-PCA used principal component analysis (PCA) over all the epistatic/correlated SNPs followed by a step-wise regression procedure to prioritize Principle Components (PCs) in order to predict the PS. For both the simulated datasets and the open access MDR dataset, PSAM-PCA performs almost similarly as PSAM. However, a drawback of PSM-PCA is that, it might not work for too many SNPs as the number of PCs rises linearly with the total number of SNPs in a particular dataset.

A major issue while handling higher order interactions is that the number of possible marker combinations increases manifold. As well as the practical difficulties associated with carrying out such large number of comparisons, very low p-values will be required in order to demonstrate genome-wide significance. Our method is such devised that we pertain only to single-point association for each SNP under study, thus restricting the dimensionality, simultaneously incorporating the epistasis and correlation information, if any, and preventing any loss of power that usually incurs due to loss of information. To evaluate the performance of PSAM against standard association methods such as MDR and PLINK (epistasis), we conducted a comparison study for both single point association tests and gene–gene interaction tests between such representative “old” methods and PSAM with respect to power using our simulation datasets. These methods use exhaustive search strategy for single point/epistasis tests for all/pairwise SNPs. Model 1 in our study is a univariate model with main effect but no epistatic SNPs. Therefore, simdata1 which is simulated using Model 1 was used only for comparing single point analysis results from MDR and PLINK. We used Model 2–Model 7 for comparison analysis using both single point and epistasis association tests (Supplementary Table 1). MDR is a non-parametric method and is conducted under additive assumption of SNPs. Moreover, MDR uses balanced accuracy tests to provide the best single point/interacting locus/loci. Therefore, the results of PSAM with MDR is not comparable. We conducted single point association analysis under dominant and recessive assumptions and epistasis analysis under additive assumption for PLINK. The results for a comparison study of PSAM with MDR and PLINK methods are provided in the supplementary section of the manuscript (Supplementary Table 1).

The LD between the SNPs in the dataset is an important criterion that needs to be determined. The presence of SNPs in LD with the target-SNP would affect the significance of the proposed method. Propensity score adjusts for such LD or correlation effects from other SNPs on the causal SNP thus adjusting for their influence thereby improving the single point significance of causal SNPs. For the real data study, we retained only the independent tag-SNPs each represented a group of correlated SNPs with a LD of r
                     2
                     =0.8. This also serves as a dimension reduction procedure for GWAS. The LD between the identified tag SNPs ranged between r
                     2 of 0 to 0.8 with a median LD of r
                     2
                     =0.03.

In our simulation study for simdata1, we simulated a disease associated SNP having a significant main-effect but no interaction effect. As per our hypothesis, controlling for interaction and correlation effects from covariate SNPs would provide increased power for the detection of disease associated SNPs. In the absence of any epistatic or correlation effect from the neighboring SNPs, PSAM showed no improvement in power over ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK (Fig. 1(a)) as expected.

Although focusing on candidate gene regions based on prior knowledge about their functions is an efficient approach, genes with unknown or ambiguous functions can often be over looked. Prior screening for SNPs that show large marginal association signals may miss susceptible interactions that display less or no marginal SNP effects (Ueki, 2014). We therefore applied PSAM to less significant SNPs (0.001≤trend-p-value<0.05) to conduct a whole genome analysis by implementing PSAM on the NARAC dataset. A pathway analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) tool (http://www.ingenuity.com) (Krämer et al., 2014) demonstrated the inclusion of the tagged SNPs, reported in our study (Table 4), within disease pathways related to immunity, developmental disorder, hereditary disorder, metabolic diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases. SKI gene and TFAP2A gene from immune and inflammatory pathways (Zampieri et al., 2014; D’Amato et al., 2008; Kelley et al., 2008), PEX14 gene responsible for peroximal membrane protein, acting as a trigger for inflammatory response in RA (Ogawa et al., 2013), CLSPN and SMC2 associated with DNA repair Pathway (ATM) in RA T-cells are identified in this study (Shao et al., 2009). Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 less significant SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing the original trend-test p-values from within 0.001 and 0.05 to less than 0.0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and inflammation. Our results show that PSAM has the ability to improve the single–point significance of less significant SNPs, which, otherwise would not be identified by traditional GWAS methods. For exploratory purposes, we report SNPs which show an improvement on the disease association significance p-value with biological significance with respect to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A probe into the reported SNPs/genes identified by using PSAM as an exploratory tool which are otherwise overlooked because of their marginal significance might provide valuable insights towards the research for cause and treatment of RA.

Most disease-association studies are carried out with SNPs under the additive assumption. PS originally balances covariates’ distributions for a binary target-explanatory variable (exposed and non-exposed). Direct adjustment by incorporating PS into the PSAM model for multi-level (additive) target-SNP can potentially reduce the bias due to the imbalance (Brookhart et al., 2006). In this study, for simplification, we illustrate the effect of the PS for binary target-SNP, by assuming a dominant or recessive transformation (Eq. (1)). Another binary transformation based on the number of alleles of SNP under study was also considered (allelic test). An analysis conducted with allelic test showed very similar results as was reported using a dominant transformation (results not shown). While calculating PS, using a stratified propensity score (SPS) or a propensity score matching (PSM) procedure (D’Agostino, 2007) produces similar results as that of the adjustment method applied in PSAM. However, PSM displayed high type-I-error rates when conducted for single point association testing. Hence, the results from PSAM were reported which was observed to produce optimum results in terms of power and type-I-error rates.

It is to be noted that in the evaluation of PSAM, the parameters (e.g. allele frequencies, penetrance) used to simulate data sets were specified according to the models that have been studied previously (Knapp et al., 1994; Dong et al., 2008; Li and Reich, 2000). Although under these pre-specified models, PSAM only show an improvement of 15%, on average in power over ULRM, S-MLRM and PLINK in simulation studies, when applying to MDR open-access dataset, PSAM improves on the significance of the disease associated SNPs when compared to ULRM (100 folds), S-MLRM (10 folds) and PLINK (100 folds). In addition, unlike S-MLRM, which did not identify all of the assumed disease-associated SNPs, PSAM identified them all. When further applied to NARAC dataset, PSAM identified significant SNPs, most of which have been found to have association with RA or immunity. We provide a user-friendly program, “PSAM” written in SAS http://www.csjfann.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/eag/programlist/PSAM/psam.html which can be downloaded for public usage.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

PSAM is a propensity score adjustment method for studying single point disease associations with the goal of improving the marginal associations. By adjusting for influences from other SNPs that are in LD or epistatic with a target SNP in a dataset, PSAM accounts for the missing heritability associated with traditional single point studies thereby improves the significance of single-locus association. While gene-gene interaction studies have been conducted to mitigate the problem of reduced power associated with single point association studies, our method (PSAM) is able to control for interacting and correlated SNPs thereby serves as an alternative way to improve on the significance of SNPs which have had marginal single point association. This would lead to an overall rise in power of single point logistic regression tests and would account for some part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis. PSAM is proposed as an exploratory tool that would be complementary to other existing methods for genetic association studies.
