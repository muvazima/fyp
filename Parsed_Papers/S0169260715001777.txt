                  Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common type of abnormal heartbeat. Without early diagnosis and proper treatment, PVC may result in serious harms. Diagnosis of PVC is of great importance in goal-directed treatment and preoperation prognosis. This paper proposes a novel diagnostic method for PVC based on Lyapunov exponents of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. The methodology consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and classification integrated into the system. PVC beats can be classified and differentiated from other types of abnormal heartbeats by analyzing Lyapunov exponents and training a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network. Our algorithm can obtain a good diagnostic result with little features by using single lead ECG data. The sensitivity, positive predictability, and the overall accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of PVC is 90.26%, 92.31%, and 98.90%, respectively. The effectiveness of the new method is validated through extensive tests using data from MIT-BIH database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) can be observed in both normal people and patients with coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease. PVC has caused extensive concern as a common, frequent arrhythmia. Frequent PVC is often associated with complications like syncope, angina, cardiomyopathy and heart failure [1]. The prevalence of PVCs varies greatly, with estimates of less than 3% to more than 60% in asymptomatic individuals [2]. Diagnosis of PVCs plays an important role in the early warning of cardiovascular diseases, which can help patients get timely and active treatment. Because of the randomness and uncertainty in the occurrence of PVC, the diagnosis of PVC needs observation of dynamic ECG during a long period, which may overload physicians with large amount of ECG data. To reduce the workload on physicians and to improve the efficiency of PVC diagnosis, computerized automatic identification techniques [3–5] have been developed for many years.

Martis et al. used Gaussian mixture model to classify ECG signals [6], and later they used higher order spectra for cardiac decision making [7]. In [8], Hickey et al. proposed to discern PVC and premature atrial contraction (PAC) beats using morphological indices such as the width, amplitude, and the area of the QRS complexes. However, one major concern of the proposed method is that its effect can be easily affected by noise. An automated diagnostic system is proposed in [9] using type-2 fuzzy clustering neural network. This system effectively combined type-2 fuzzy c-means clustering (T2FCM) algorithm with neural network. ECG signals can be classified by the cluster centers that may converge to a more desirable location. The system performs well on the classification of fuzzy boundary data. In [10], an arrhythmia classification scheme is developed which uses principal component analysis (PCA) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for feature reduction, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier to differentiate eight types of ECG beats. In [11], discrete wavelet transforms is proposed to classify ECG signals, where linear discriminant analysis and a multi-layer perceptron are used as classifiers. The neural network is trained by the back-propagation and a genetic algorithm. The results indicate that wavelet optimization may improve the classification capability of a neural network. In [12], a new supervised noise-artifact-robust heart arrhythmia fusion classification method is introduced. This method consists of structurally diverse classifiers with a new QRS complex geometrical feature extraction technique.

An interesting development is the application of the chaos theory in the processing of biomedical signals, particularly ECG analysis. As human heart is a complex system, the heartbeat signal naturally exhibits some chaotic characteristics [13,16]. It is noteworthy that methods for the study and classification of nonlinear system through the analysis of one observable are increasingly used in ECG analysis [15]. In [16], 14 features (time domain, frequency domain, nonlinear and chaotic features) are carefully selected and used to train MLP neural networks in order to classify 7 arrhythmias. In [17], the nonlinear dynamics tools are used to differentiate four types of ECG beats. The research demonstrates that the Lyapunov exponents are important features for representing the ECG signals, and the recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on these features is able to achieve high classification accuracies.

In general, existing methods need to extract multiple features from the ECG signal to deal with the influence of noise. In this paper, we present a novel method for PVC diagnosis with few features based on Lyapunov exponents of the ECG signal. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. It can also achieve more accurate and robust results in PVC diagnosis as shown in our experimental study.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes details of the proposed method. Experimental results and discussion are described in Section 3. Conclusions and future work are described in Section 4.

                        Fig. 1
                         shows the block diagram of our method which includes three stages: preprocessing (R-peak detection), feature extraction (premature beat recognition, and feature extraction of Lyapunov exponent curve), and classification (training and testing using LVQ neural network). QRS complex is first extracted from ECG signal by energy analysis. Since R wave in ECG signal is more apparent than the other waves, the peak of R wave is determined by an optimized thresholding method. Next, premature beat is classified based on the non-uniformity of RR interval. The features can be extracted based on the Lyapunov exponent curve. Lastly, PVCs are identified by a LVQ neural network. The key steps and algorithms will be described in the following subsections.

The ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (mitdb) [18] are used in this paper. The database is well recognized as the standard ECG record which contains 48 recordings each of which has a duration of 30min and includes two leads, the modified-lead II in 46 recordings, V1 in 40 recordings, and V2, V4 and V5 distributed among 10 recordings. The data of the limb lead II is chosen in our experiments except in two recordings (102 and 104), where lead V5 is substituted since modified-lead II is not available. The sampling frequency is 360Hz and the resolution is 200 samples per mV. It provides a variety of standard data of arrhythmia with artificial markers and annotation, including normal beat (N), PVC, PAC, right bundle branch block (R), junctional premature beat (J), auricular escape (e), atrial ectopic beat, and nodal ectopic beat, etc, which can be used as a reference for the scientific research of ECG signal.

ECG signals are often contaminated by various noise in real applications. To simulate the noisy condition, Gaussian white noise is added into the original ECG signal. We use wavelet transform [19,20] to remove the noise in ECG signals. DB6 is selected as the wavelet basis in wavelet decomposition. DB6 is chosen by a rule of thumb and its prototype has the same morphology as the original signal. A self-adaptive threshold method is used to isolate the original noise of ECG signal in threshold processing. QRS complex has the main energy of ECG whereas P-waves and T-waves have less energy. Meanwhile the frequency range of QRS complex and P, T waves are different. Therefore, P-waves and T-waves can be removed through wavelet reconstruction based on the analysis of energy and frequency range. Each QRS complex can be identified by a R-wave with energy peak [21]. In addition, R-waves can be associated with the maximum value of filtered ECG signal which is searched with a variable length window. The method of R-peak detection was validated by the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The sensitivity and positive predictive accuracy are 98.74% and 99.46%, respectively. Fig. 2
                           (a) shows the original ECG signal and Fig. 2(b) shows the detected R-peaks that are marked by dots.

Premature heartbeat is the most common arrhythmia that is caused by the stimulus from ectopic points. According to their different pathogenesis, premature heartbeats can be classified as PVC, PAC, and premature nodal contraction (PNC), with PVC being the most common type.

In ECG signal, the main feature of PVC is the broad QRS complex that comes in advance with interval of more than 0.12s and no premature P wave occurs. In addition, a PVC usually has a complete compensatory pause, that is, the interval of the two sinus rhythms around PVC is twice the length of the cardiac cycle (denoted by X in Fig. 3
                              ). Fig. 3 shows PVC beat and normal beat in ECG signals.

Premature beat is caused by the emission of premature impulse from ectopic pacemaker, which is the main feature to differentiate it from other heart diseases. RR interval can be determined based on the position of R peaks. Non-uniform RR interval can be observed when premature beat appears. Fig. 4
                               shows that R peak in premature beat is closer to the former R peak and farther away from the one that follows. PVC usually has a complete compensatory pause, that is, the interval of the two sinus rhythms around PVC is twice the length of the normal cardiac cycle. The average length of two RR intervals around premature beat is close to the length of normal RR interval. The PVC beats of most arrhythmia patients are usually in small numbers. Consequently the length of the average RR interval cannot be affected by the abnormal interval in ECG signals with a certain length of time. Based on advices of physicians and experimental tests, we set the length of time as 30s and the resultant abnormal interval is less than 85% of the average. Premature beat can thus be recognized by its R-peak following the abnormal interval.

In general, the study on Lyapunov exponent is carried out in phase space instead of time space. Each point in the phase space corresponds to a state of chaos. An equivalent phase space [22] can be reconstructed to investigate the characteristics of the discrete time series system. In phase space reconstruction, τ is regular interval which is called the delay time and m is the dimension of the phase space. m and τ are chosen not by traditional methods, but through contrast test. m and τ can be set to 12 and 8 with the most obvious difference in Lyapunov exponential curve between PVCs and other types of ECG beats.

Lyapunov exponent is a key parameter of chaotic dynamics which measures the average rate of separation or polymerization of two trajectories in phase space. Lyapunov exponent is calculated as follows. For discrete time series x1, x2, …, xn, the phase space can be described as

Next, all Lyapunov exponents are calculated in ECG beats. Normal heart beats (N) can be used to compare with PVCs to highlight the characteristics of PVCs. Fig. 5
                              (a1–a3) are the original ECG beats (PVC, PAC, N) on which Lyapunov exponents are computed. Fig. 5(b1–b3) represent typical Lyapunov exponent curves of PVC, PAC, and N. It is apparent that the Lyapunov exponent curve of PVC changes more smoothly without large vibration in PAC or N waves. Thus, we introduce the derivative of the Lyapunov exponent curve to capture the difference between PAC, N and PVC.

Through a large number of tests, we have indeed observed significant differences in the derivative of Lyapunov exponents between PAC, N and PVC. Suppose that the derivative of Lyapunov exponent is f′

                              The derivative of Lyapunov exponents of PAC is quite similar to that of normal heartbeats. PAC may be easily confused with normal heartbeat during diagnosis. Therefore, we focus on automatic diagnosis of PVC in this paper. Fig. 5(c1–c3) illustrates the derivatives of Lyapunov exponents of PVC, PAC and N. It can be clearly observed that the fluctuation range of the curve in Fig. 5 (c1) is much less than that in (c2) and (c3). The absolute values of the derivatives can be summed up to enlarge the difference between the three curves. So we sum up the absolute values of the derivatives.

In this paper, we set a threshold value of 0.001 as the absolute values of the derivatives. We then count the number of the absolute value being greater than 0.001, i.e.

                              We denote the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives as parameter a 
                              [23] and the number of points with values larger than 0.001 as parameter b. The two parameters are used as new features in our method to extract PVCs.

By comparing the differences in Fig. 5(b1–b3) and (c1–c3), this study selects the abnormal R-peak as a benchmark, around which a premature beat is determined with the time period of 0.83s.

300 PVC beats, 300 PAC beats and 300 normal beats are analyzed which are randomly selected from the recordings (106, 114, 118, 202, 205, 232) of different patients in MIT-BIH database. In Fig. 6
                              , the green points represent PVC beats, the pink points represent PAC beats and red points represent normal beats, where the two parameters of a heart beat are used as horizontal and vertical coordinates. From Fig. 6 it is easy to see that PVC beats are relatively concentrated around the lower left corner of the coordinate system thus can be easily distinguished, while PAC beats and normal beats are scattered in the middle and upper part of the coordinate system. Therefore, a neural network can be used to classify PVC beats.

LVQ neural network [24] is generally considered as a powerful pattern recognition tool. LVQ is a nearest neighbor pattern classifier based on competitive learning. The basic architecture of LVQ neural network is shown in Fig. 7
                           . LVQ network contains an input layer, a Kohonen layer which learns and performs the classification, and an output layer. A node in the input layer represents an input feature. 50 neurons are used in the Kohonen layer based on experimental studies. In the output layer, each output node represents a particular class.

We use the previously mentioned 300 PVC beats, 300 PAC beats and 300 normal beats as training samples to train the neural network. The two parameters of each ECG beat are used as input to the LVQ neural network. In the output layer, each output neuron produces different classes, that is, PVC class and non-PVC class (PAC or N). In this LVQ neural network, both of minimum mean square error and minimum local gradient are set to 10−3, and the maximum number of epoch is 200. The training performance is 0.0038 when the training has reached the maximum epoch in Fig. 8
                           . In the recognition stage, unknown samples are fed into the LVQ neural network which can be classified according to the training standards. The testing samples are the all ECG beats from 20 recordings (100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 114, 116, 118, 119, 121, 123, 201, 202, 205, 221, 223, 232) in MIT-BIH database. Note that in our experiments, this procedure is repeated 10 times. Each time, we use 300 PVC beats, 300 PAC beats and 300 normal beats randomly selected from MIT-BIH database to train the neural.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, three performance measures are computed, which include sensitivity (S
                        
                           e
                        ), positive predictivity (P
                        
                           p
                        ) and error rate (E
                        
                           r
                        ), where All is the total number of heartbeats, R is the number of the true PVC beats, TP is the number of correctly detected PVC beats, FN and FP are the number of false negative and false positive PVC beats, respectively. False positives are beats which have been incorrectly classified as PVC beats. A false negative occurs when a true PVC beat is missed out in the classification. Accordingly, sensitivity measures how successful the method is in recognizing PVC without missing them whereas positive predictability measures how it classifies the PVC with fewer mistakes.

                           r
                         can reflect the total number of classification errors of PVC diagnosis. A

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

Large data sets were used to test our method. The experimental results of 20 recordings are sorted according to the number of PVC beats in Table 1
                        . In the experiment, ECG signals with 30min period are chosen randomly from each recording. In the experiment, we run each test 10 times and use the mean value as the result. For each recording, we show the mean values of the performance indicators, including

                         are all substantially close to 100% in file 100, 102, 104, 121, and 123. There are very few PVC beats and PAC beats in these recordings. The abnormal intervals are also few for these recordings. Consequently, the results of classification are satisfactory. With the increase in the number of PVC beats, the more arrhythmia occurs, the greater the ECG changes. Therefore, the error rate will be relatively high in the classification of PVC. From the recordings (105, 106, 107, 114, 116, 118, 119, 201, 202, 205, 221, 223) we can see that

                         from 95.76% to 99.74%. On the whole, the sensitivity, positive predictability, and the overall accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of PVC is 90.26%, 92.31%, and 98.90%, respectively. There is no significant difference between different patients in sensitivity, positive predictability, and the overall accuracy, which shows the robustness of our method. We also computed the standard deviation (S) of the results, and find that the results in 10 different runs are quite sable, i.e., the standard deviation values are all smaller than 0.005.

In the following, our method is compared with some relative ones. In [25], Inan proposes a method using wavelet transform and time interval features (WT) to get a series test results of the diagnosis of PVC. The test data include 17 individual recordings. The result is shown in Fig. 9
                        , where the horizontal coordinate represents the record number in the database and the vertical coordinate represents the performance. WT-S

                         (red line) represent the sensitivity and positive predictability of the WT method, respectively. Similarly, Our-S
                        
                           e
                         (green line) and Our-P

                         (purple line) represent the sensitivity and positive predictability of our method. It can be seen from WT-S
                        
                           e
                         and Our-S
                        
                           e
                         that the sensitivity of our method is less than the WT method only for the following recordings: 107, 114, 119, 205, 221, and S
                        
                           e
                         of our method is equal to or higher than WT in file 100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 116, 118, 121, 123, 201, 202, 223. Similarly, the positive predictability of our method is lower than the WT method for file 106, 107, 116, 119, 205, 221, 223, and which is equal to or higher than WT in file 100, 102, 104, 105, 114, 118, 121, 123, 201, 202. Thus in most cases, the performance of our approach is better than the WT method. It is obvious from Fig. 9 that our method performs more consistently across all recordings, which illustrate the robustness of our method.

We also compare our method with two recent methods shown in Table 2
                        , namely the mixture of experts and negatively correlated learning (MENCL) [26] method and the coupled boosting by filtering and preloaded mixture of experts (CBME) [27] method. The data file in the comparison include 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, and 107. We extract a total of 15,293 beats: 627 PVC beats and 14,666 non-PVC beats. We use 200 PVC beats for training. For the classification of premature ventricular contractions, the sensitivity and positive predictability of the method of MENCL are 92.27% and 79.44%. Similarly, the two performance indicators of the method of coupled boosting by filtering and preloaded mixture of experts CBME are 93.91% and 81.17%. For our method, S
                        
                           e
                         is 94.38%, and P
                        
                           p
                         is 93.72%, which shows that our method has higher classification accuracy and stability compared to the former methods.

To further illustrate the applicability of our approach, more experiments are performed using a few ECG signals with a high irregularity in RR intervals. Table 3
                         summarizes the experimental results, where All represents the number of ECG beats during 1min, AB is the number of ECG beats with nonuniform RR interval, and R represents the number of true PVCs. Recordings 04043 and 04936 are from MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (afdb). AF (atrial fibrillation) signal for 1min are randomly selected from file 04043 and 04094. A clinician in a local hospital helps us to mark the selected signals for the rhythm annotations only include AFIB (atrial fibrillation), AFL (atrial flutter), J (AV junctional rhythm), and N (used to indicate all other rhythms). ECG signals of AFIB also have RR intervals irregularities. 19 and 18 abnormal ECG beats are found in file 04043 and 04096 through nonuniform RR interval which are excluded as PVCs by our method. Likewise, the selected ECG signals of AFIB in recordings 202 and 210 in mitdb have PVC beats. 20 and 15 abnormal ECG beats are found in file 202 and 210 which include one and 10 PVC beats, respectively. The only one PVC beat in file 202 can be correctly identified and 9 PVC beats in file 210 can be distinguished by our approach. S
                        
                           e
                         is 100%, P
                        
                           p
                         is 100% in file 202, and S
                        
                           e
                         is 100%, P
                        
                           p
                         90% for file 210. The chosen ECG signals in file 123 and 221 in mitdb have 8 and 20 ECG beats respectively with nonuniform RR interval that include 7 normal beats, 1 PVC beats and 8 normal beats, 12 PVC beats. S
                        
                           e
                         and P
                        
                           p
                         are all 100% in file 123 and 221 for normal ECG beats are ruled out and all PVC beats can be recognized correctly.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposes a novel diagnostic method for PVC based on Lyapunov exponents of ECG signals. The abnormal premature beat is primarily examined with the non-uniform RR interval. PVC can be classified by the specific performance of the features of Lyapunov exponent curve combined with the LVQ neural network. The procedure was validated on the benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The experimental results show that it achieves good classification accuracies and a high stability with few features. The proposed method helps to reduce the difficulty of feature extraction in existing automatic diagnosis methods using multiple features. In our future work, we will further optimize the proposed method and implement it in a remote health caring system that is currently being developed by our group.
