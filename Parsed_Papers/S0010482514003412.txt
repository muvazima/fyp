                  The low-weight newborns and especially the premature infants have difficulty in maintaining their temperature in the range considered to be normal. Several studies revealed the importance of thermal environment and moisture to increase the survival rate of newborns. This work models the process of heat exchange and energy balance in premature newborns during the first hours of life in a closed incubator. In addition, a control problem was proposed and solved in order to maintain thermal stability of premature newborns to increase their rate of survival and weight. For this purpose, we propose an algorithm to control the temperature inside the incubator. It takes into account the measurements of the body temperature of a premature newborn which are recorded continuously. We show that using this model the temperature of a premature newborn inside the incubator can be kept in a thermal stability range.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The stability of the body temperature is the result of heat production and heat loss. Newborns and especially premature creatures are easier to cool than later on in life. A good environmental thermal management is a key role in their care and survival (cf. [1]).

This manuscript aims at determining the proper thermal environment for premature infants under incubator treatment. Therefore we proposed the following objectives: (a) to model the process of heat exchange and energy balance during the first hours of life in incubation, (b) to set up and solve a control problem, for the environmental temperature surrounding the child, in order to keep the body temperature in a range that increases their survival rate and weight.

Modelling the process of heat generation and thermal energy transport in the body׳s neonates nursed in convectively heated incubators is a complex process that involves the blood circulation and the balance between metabolic heat production and body heat dissipation through conduction, evaporation, convection, radiation and evaporative heat losses. The complexity of incorporating the effect of blood circulation in the transfer of heat in the body is due to the variable flow, and counter-current effects between veins and arteries.

In the literature there are some models that attempt to incorporate the architecture of the vascular system. However, they are more complex and when put in practice provide similar results as the model proposed earlier by Pennes in 1948 [2]. Pennes׳ model describes the heat transfer in the human forearm and he was the first to quantify the contribution of blood circulation to the heat transfer in biological tissue. In [3] the validity of the Pennes model is discussed because it does not incorporate the counterflow effects between veins and arteries. Nevertheless, in practice it is most widely used for its simplicity. Ludwig [4] proposes a more complex model to describe the heat transfer in newborns in incubators. In his model he considers that the thermal characteristics of tissues depend on spatial variables. Other interesting proposals came from Werner [5] and Wissler [6], who divide the body into compartments: head, neck, thoracic cavity and extremities. They propose equations for each compartment and the interaction between adjacent compartments.

This paper tackles the issue with a different approach. We propose a compartment model that describes heat transfer in premature infants inside an incubator. Unlike the models proposed in [5,6] our model neither divides the body into sections nor considers in explicit form the role of the spatial variable, but divides it into three layers: deep tissue, surface tissue or skin and blood. The model incorporates mechanisms of heat generation/loss and heat exchange with the surrounding environment. The main reason for this proposal is based on the following: First in the human body there are organs that produce more heat than others such as the ones located in the thoracic and the abdominal cavity that produce 56% of the total heat in the body and the brain gives off 16% of the total heat (cf. [7]), some parts release heat like the lungs and through the skin. The flow of heat goes from the first organs to the second ones and it is transported mainly by convection throughout the blood circulation and the heat cannot be transferred by conduction due to the low conductivity rate of the tissues (cf. [7,8]). On the other hand the irregular geometrical shape of the body leads to a complicated spatial field of temperatures in which we can highlight isotherms, in other words regions of equal temperature. According to the measured data of the isotherms obtained by Aschoff and Wever [9] they could identify a body periphery belonging to the skin and the extremities and whose temperature in the parts change according to the temperature in the environment and core homoeothermal by the body and head. A gradient of temperature is established between the internal and the external region of the body and for this reason it can be considered that there are two layers of the body that are the Core or also known as Kernel layer and the other known as the Surface layer. These two factors, the low conductivity rate of the tissues and the two layers which we have seen, show us not to include spatial variable in our model. Obviously this goes on the detriment as the role of the blood is to supply the heat through a convective process within the organism. Due to that we consider the blood to be a intermediate agent that transfers heat from the Core to the body Surface. The core temperature can be estimated through the temperature in the armpit, the surface temperature is estimated through the temperature in the sole of the foot, these two kinds of temperature are used as diagnostic temperatures to determine the thermal stability of the premature newborns. The thermal stability is the range of the body temperature in which the newborn has the lowest metabolic waste. The existence of these diagnostic temperatures that are taken in specific areas in the human body can be justified as an average of temperatures in different regions of the periphery and the core. Due to this we have confirmed again that the spatial variable can be omitted in the model. According to the above in the model that we are proposing we will consider the average variations of the temperature in the core, the peripherals, and the blood. Also using this model we will propose and solve a problem that gives us an algorithm to optimize and monitor the thermal environment in an incubator that is convectively heated as stated in the introduction of [19], which even to this day continues to be a challenge.

Several studies have revealed the importance of the thermal environment and humidity to increase the rate of survival of sick, low weight or premature newborns. From the published literature useful information can be extracted to determine whether a newborn is in thermal stability. Thermal stability is understood as the state in which the baby maintains the temperature of the deep structures of his body (central or core temperature) between 36.8 and 37.3°C, using only the smallest possible amount of heat generated by metabolic reactions. Furthermore, the difference between the central temperature (

                     ) and the temperature of the extremities of the body or peripheral (

                     ) must be less than

                      (cf. [1,10]).

In general, the methods for monitoring the core temperature are invasive, so the core temperature is approximated by the armpit temperature and the peripheral temperature is approximated by the temperature at sole [10,11].

In order to increase the survival rate and growth of the premature infants, it is important to maintain the temperature inside the incubator (

                     ) in a range known as neutral thermal environment (NTE) [12]. That is the range of the temperature inside the incubator in which the baby is in thermal stability. The tables to approximate the NTE consider factors such as the weight of the baby and the chronological age in the case of premature newborns; see, for instance, [13–15]. It is important to remark that the NTE tables were obtained experimentally and they are used by doctors in hospitals. In our model, we assume that a premature newborn is inside of a closed incubator, lying on a heated mattress that has a constant temperature (

                      which corresponds to a material mentioned in [16]. In our model the mattress is expected to have a constant temperature of 30°C unlike what is proposed in [16] where the mattress has a constant temperature of 36°C. The walls of the incubator are simple and made of Plexiglass, which are maintained at an average temperature

                      using two infrared lamps, located on top of the incubator. We assume that the Plexiglass is opaque to the wavelengths emitted by the lamps, because of that the effect of direct radiation from lamps is not considered as a variable. On the other hand, the coefficient of transference of heat by radiation of the Plexiglass is too low (

                     , see [17]) due to this it is possible to omit the exchange of heat between the walls and the air flow around the child. Furthermore the coefficient of the emissivity of Plexiglass is very high, due to that, the radiative heat loss of the newborn is calculated. That loss is derived by

                      inside it are the result of the variation in the intensity of the lamps and the power of the incoming air heater, among other factors. Note that the air speed has spatial and temporal variation in the interior of the incubator, but the temporal variation of the temperature is not considered because we assume that there is a control mechanism (the description of this mechanism is not within the scope of this work) which kept air velocity ranges stable inside the incubator during the time that simulations were carried out. Furthermore, the air flow over the body of the baby is laminar and thus has little variation. Also the body of the baby is small and the velocity values are low (cf. [21]). These features allow us to ignore the spatial variation of the velocity and consider it as an average value measured 10cm above the center of the mattress, according to the recommendations of the American National Standards, 1997 [20]. The temperature within the incubator is also measured at the same point.

The incubator has three temperature sensors that are located inside. Two of the sensors monitor the baby׳s temperature, one is located in the armpit the other one in the sole of the foot. The third sensor monitors the average air temperature inside the incubator. There are five more sensors located inside and on the walls that estimate the temperature

Before formulating the model we will review the physiological mechanisms of generation and distribution of heat and the influence of the environment temperature.

We assume that the body of the baby consists of two layers: Core or Kernel (K) and surface (S). The Core includes tissue, bones and internal organs, while the surface consists of fat and skin. We define two layers because through the skin heat exchange with the environment is performed and, although the fat layer is thin, it has thermal properties different from those of the core.

The main source of heat in the body of a premature newborn is the basal metabolism and the most important mechanism of heat distribution is the blood circulation. We assume that the basal metabolism is generated uniformly in layer K. Besides heat sources we consider the evaporative losses through respiration and skin. We assume that the heat loss through respiration only occurs in K, while the water losses that occur by skin permeation only involve layer S. There are other physiological mechanisms (vasomotor processes, tremor, exercise, food intake, sweat) in the human body that are not considered in the model because their contribution on the temperature variation is negligible or because the premature newborn is not able to do so.

The body temperature is also influenced by physical mechanisms of heat loss or gain that usually occur through the thermal exchange within the skin. These mechanisms are present only in the S-layer and they are the following: (i) Conduction: describes the heat exchange through a portion of the child׳s body that makes contact with the mattress. (ii) Convection: describes the exchange of heat between the body and the air circulating around inside the incubator. (iii) Radiation: describes the effect of heat exchange between the body of the baby and the walls of the incubator. Any of these three processes can generate heat losses or gains. The other mechanism is (iv) Evaporation: describes the insensible water loss from the skin. We need to highlight that the proposed model can be applied to describe the evolution and stabilize the core body temperature in a situation where are known certain anthropometric and physiological characteristics, gestational age and during a certain time interval. To show the results of this manuscript we have considered the following characteristics of the premature newborn: the weight 1.2kg, 1 or 2 days old and with an average oxygen consumption of

                      (all the temperatures considered here are given in degree Celsius). The procedure by which it can be reached that temperature value depends on how the input of hot air into the incubator is controlled and is not an objective of this work.

We assume that the core temperature (

                     ) are functions that depend only on time. We assume that the blood circulates through K and S without distinguishing between arterial and venous blood and we denote by

                      the average blood temperature. We propose a model with three equations. The first one describes the variation of temperature in the core (

                     ), the second one describes the variation of temperature in the surface (
                        
                           
                              T
                           
                           
                              S
                           
                        
                     ), and the third one describes the variation of average blood temperature (
                        
                           
                              T

                     ), without considering some blood effects as the distribution mechanism and the flow effects between veins and arteries. We suppose that the blood acts as a third compartment whose function is that of a mediating agent in the heat exchange between the core and the surface.

Under these considerations, we propose a model of ordinary differential equations that represent an energy balance. Each equation represents the following:


                     Left-hand side: It is the rate of accumulation of thermal energy per unit volume due to the change of temperature in the tissue or blood.


                     Right-hand side: Here we have the heat sources and heat losses. As sources we consider the rate of heat transfer per unit volume due to contact between layers, blood circulation and metabolic reactions. Among the terms that produce heat losses we include heat transfer rates per unit volume due to respiration, conducting, convection, radiation and evaporation. The low conductivity of the tissues which we have seen leads us not to include the process of heat exchange between Core and Surface layers.

The terms above may or may not appear in the equations depending on the physiology of each layer. The resulting equations are the following:

In model (1a)–(1f) time is given in seconds and we have chosen one hour as the reference time. Moreover, the body temperature hovers around 37°C so that we use this value as the reference temperature. Then we consider the following normalized variables:

                      in system (13a)–(13c) taking predetermined constants values as shows in Table 3.

This is because they depend on a priori controllable magnitudes such as the temperature of the intensive care unit, the air velocity and the relative humidity inside the incubator, as well as some physical and physiological parameters that can be considered fixed for the case study.

Coefficients M
                     3 and M
                     4 may vary due to the appearance of factor N in (4) and (5), corresponding to the number of breath per minute. Values of M
                     3 and M
                     4 in Table 3 are given for N=40.

                      because the results that we will obtain must be valid in the range corresponding to a neutral thermal environment.

Finally, we consider that the oxygen consumption O
                     
                        o
                      may vary in a neighborhood of 3.9.

                     . In our case it is logical that

                      can take a value given by the formula (35) since the radiant lamp can be controlled independently until it produces and stabilizes the temperature over the surface of the walls of the incubator. The form in which this is made is not an objective in this research. However, we consider that the effective value of

                      appearing in our model allows us to determine the losses by radiation of the newborn from Stefan Boltzmanns law that is the nonlinear term found in Eq. (1c). For practical uses we could consider any of the methods proposed in [19] to effectively calculate

                     . According to formula (3) in [19],

                      was calculated by weighting the wall and mattress temperatures according to each calculated view factor. However, since our model considers the conductive effect produced on the child׳s warm mattress separately, we think that it would be appropriate to calculate an effective value of 
                        
                           
                              T

                      from an average of measurements taken only on the surface of the incubator walls, regardless of the temperature of the mattress. The calculation of such effective value

                     1 and M
                     2 close together, so each of them has a stable point of equilibrium that at the same time is close to each other. This shows us that the result of Theorem 5.1 is little sensitive to small variations of the coefficients in (13a)–(13c).

Now we carry out calculations based on our model for the particular case of premature newborns weighing 1.2kg at the time of being introduced into the incubator. Clinically the baby is in the critical state. We consider in the model the parameters corresponding to this weight. Henceforth, we use the values of the coefficients of system (13a)–(13c) expressed in Table 3, calculated from data in Tables 1 and 2
                      (cf. [18,26,16,27]) and expressions (2)–(12). We assume that the average consumption of oxygen O

                     . Then, from Lemma 4.1 we deduce that system (13a)–(13f) has a stable local equilibrium given by (48a) 
                     (Fig. 1
                     ).

Although the initial temperature of the baby is equal to 37°C in the described conditions the temperature will drop gradually until it reaches values close to 20°C. Fig. 1 shows the behaviour of the core temperature.

We conclude that in the absence of controls, when the baby is directly under the temperature of the ICU, his or her body temperature tends to stabilize at a value close to that temperature even when the mattress is kept at a temperature above.

Now, we consider the particular case in which the average temperature inside the incubator is constant and equal to

Matrix A has eigenvalues −42.0311, −13.5604 and −0.2254 and, therefore, the equilibrium state (49) is asymptotically stable.

                      (axillary temperature). When the temperature is outside this range the newborn is at risk (he may die). This temperature range is called undesirable risk range for

In this manuscript we consider premature newborns weighing 1.2 kg who are treated in an incubator although the numerical results do not vary substantially for parameters that correspond to the range between 1kg and 1.5kg. We consider a simulation period for 24h. The neutral thermal environment suggested in [13,14] is [34, 35.4]°C for the first 24h, which we call ideal range for

The fact that some cases take a long time to reach the desirable state is due to the existence of a negative eigenvalue of matrix (51) very close to zero. In the next section we will see that controlling the temperature inside the incubator can considerably reduce this time.

We begin by recapitulating some concepts of controllability and observability (for more information, see [24,28]).

The fact that the two complex conjugate roots have negative real part is a consequence of Theorem 5.1.

                           Suppose the model parameters satisfy the conditions listed above for premature infants of Group IV. Then the state equation 
                           (56a) 
                           is controllable.

To prove the controllability of (50a) we use the PBH range test which tells us that it is enough to show that

It is clear that (65) holds for

                              ≠

                           . Therefore it is enough to show (65) for

                           in the range of values of λ, s and b given in (68). However, it is easy to see that Eq. (70) can not be solved in this range of parameters as its right-hand side is always negative while the left-hand side is always positive in that range. From here we conclude the truth of (67) so that the state equation (56a) is controllable.□


                           Suppose the model parameters satisfies the conditions listed above for premature infants of group IV. Then state equation 
                           (56a) 
                           is observable with respect to the output 
                           (56b).

It is known that the observability of system (56a) and (56b) depends only on matrix A and vector h and the condition of observability is equivalent to the controllability of the pair 
                              (

                                    h

                              )
                           . Then, repeating the argument of Theorem 7.1, we see that it is equivalent to show that

So far we have shown that keeping the temperature inside the incubator (

                     ) in the neutral thermal environment, the system tends to a stable equilibrium with the core temperature of the baby in the range of thermal stability. However for some initial conditions the core temperature can stay out the ideal range for a very large period of time (see Table 5), which may damage the health of the baby. Therefore we want to minimize this time interval. To do this, we minimize the mean square deviations of the normalized values

Note that the functional does not set the thermal stability criterion. The functional minimizes the distances to ideal values for central and peripheral temperatures. However, these ideal values are far from each other in less than 1°C and we will see in numerical examples that a similar result is obtained for the functions

                     , which we hereafter simply refer as system (56a) and (56b). We say that a linear system of the form (53a) is stabilizable if there is a matrix Q such that if we take control U as U=Qx, then the trivial solution of the system is asymptotically stable. It is well known (see [2]) that if (53a) is controllable, then it is also stabilizable. From the results shown above we know that (56a) is stabilizable and is also observable with respect to the output (56b). For this reason we propose to stabilize system (56a) using controls of the form

                              q

Finally, for the thermal management of premature newborns we can proceed in two ways: (a) maintain a constant temperature inside the incubator and equal to 34.7°C or (b) modify the internal temperature according to (92). Below there are tables comparing the two situations. The tables show, based on initial distribution of some average temperatures

                      and

                      of the baby, how long the child remains in the risk range or outside the ideal range. Also, the temperature variations inside the incubator are monitored and we show how long the temperature is outside the neutral thermal environment which is strongly recommended by neonatologists.

What we see in general is that, although the babies are at a temperature in the ideal range when starting the treatment, their temperatures always fall to values lower than ideal. Once the temperatures rise again, they are successfully kept in the ideal range.


                     Table 6
                      shows what happens when the initial temperatures lie in the ideal range. In the second and the third table we display other cases when initial temperatures are based on an acceptable range. Tables 7 and 8
                     
                      correspond to cases where the initial temperature is at risk. Remember that the goal of the treatment in the incubator is to take the child to the ideal range of core temperature in the shortest time possible and keep him or her within this range ensuring that the ambient temperature is maintained in the range of neutrality.

                      represent the time during which the ambient temperature is outside the recommended ranges. It is important to note that our model describes only the changes in temperature in the child body but not in the environment and that this temperature must be precisely controlled. A major problem that must be addressed in subsequent studies is to answer the question of how hot air entering into the incubator should be controlled in order to produce the given ambient temperature in (92).

In order to explain the obtained results in the tables, we consider one example that is to observe the first two lines of Table 6. The results are interpreted in the following way: The newborn is put into the incubator with an axillary temperature of 36.8°C, a temperature in the blood of 36.325°C and a sole of the foot temperature of 35.85°C. The temperature in the interior of the incubator can be kept constant, which is shown in the first line with q=0, or it can vary according to (92), in this case it is represented in the second line of the table: 
                        q
                        =
                        −
                        2.8
                     . The results of the table show that if q=0 then the central temperature of the baby is out of the ideal range during 287.77min out of which 16.58min are out of the acceptable range; that is, the baby is likely to suffer from hypothermia. This occurs when leaving the ambient temperature fixed to 34.7°C (average point of the neutral thermal environment). The case that the additional linear control (
                        q
                        =
                        −
                        2.8
                     ) is considered decreases the time in which the temperature of the baby is out of the ideal range which is equal to 131.44min out of which only 0.1min are kept in risky temperatures. In this case, the temperature of the environment ranges between the interval of 34.7 and 36.04°C keeping out from the ideal and recommended interval for 
                        
                           
                              T

                      approximately 84.58min. This shows that it is convenient to consider the linear component of the control although it is necessary to maintain the surrounding temperature in ranges above neutrality for a time. It can be observed in Table 6 that in the first three cases, it is more efficient to use the control with the linear term. Moreover, while the central temperature increases and the gradient (

In Table 7 we consider the acceptable temperatures under the range of the ideal temperatures and we observe that the control is more efficient with the linear term. In Table 8, we show the results for the initial temperatures above the range of ideal temperatures. It can be observed that for such initial temperatures, the temperature of the environment can even be fixed at 34.7°C. This is because the times that are out of the ideal (

The results that correspond to the cases in which the baby is under thermal stress are also divided into two parts (Tables 9 and 10). The tables represent the case in which the baby suffers from a simple hypothermia to a moderate one. The results of Table 9
                      show that the control is more efficient if we consider the linear part. From the results shown in Table 10
                     , we conclude that in the cases of moderate hypothermia it is convenient to use the control with a linear component.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The physiological changes involving the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life defy the respiratory, central nervous, circulatory, thermoregulatory, and immune system. All the problems of newborns, in some way or other, include different adaptation mechanism to survive.

In the low-weight premature and/or sick newborns, such problems exacerbate even more to put their health at serious risk. It is important to warm up the surrounding space. This measure fairly decreased newborn health problems keeping him or her in save and stable conditions. Vital body functions depend on constant body temperature within its normal range. In the case of newborns the World Health Organization states values between 36.8 and 37.5°C as a normal level for the core temperature. However, we are interested in keeping the newborn in an even narrower thermal stability range, with an environment temperature between 36.8 and 37.3°C, which we call ideal range.

The purpose of this study was to determine the values of temperature average inside the incubator and the incubator walls to stabilize a premature newborn in thermal stability in the shortest time possible. We propose a model that describes the variation of temperatures center-weighted average (can be estimated by the temperature in the armpit), peripheral (it can be estimated by the temperature of the sole) and blood.

Associated with this thermal model we propose a functional for minimizing the time the core temperature stays out the thermal stability range. Both the model and the functional are valuable assets to solve the controlling problem applying a linearization of the system. We test the results in the original nonlinear model for comparison. To simplify the task we assume that the baby׳s body consists of a single compartment with three components: core, blood and skin. We assume that the blood exchanges heat with the skin and the core. The model incorporates the main mechanisms to quantitatively describe physiological and physical mechanisms of heat generation and its exchange, in particular basal metabolism, heat flow between the kernel and surface, the contribution of blood circulation, respiratory losses, lost extra glandular and the processes of heat exchange with the atmosphere (conduction, convection, radiation).

The estimates for each term as well as their coefficients were taken from the literature. Some of the parameters in the model depend directly from the newborn and can be modified in each case. Among these parameters are birth weights, weight during the period of the simulations, the consumption of oxygen, relative humidity, air velocity inside the incubator, the number of breaths per minute. The model reproduces what happens when a newborn is exposed to room temperature (20°C). In that case the temperature of the body may decrease and stabilize at a temperature close to the room temperature, outside the acceptable range.

Moreover, the model describes the fact that when we maintain the temperature inside the incubator in the range of neutral thermal environment then the baby is in thermal stability. This demonstrates the important influence of the environment variables which are reflected in the professional recommendations of pediatricians and neonatologists. However, in practice, the desirable state of baby׳s temperatures requires a couple of hours, which constitutes a precious time, that can even be detrimental for the child. It obviously becomes a necessity to incorporate an additional control to achieve the ideal body temperature of the baby in a much shorter time.

Although the model does not describe the dynamics of environment temperatures, we can treat the thermal behaviour through numerical solution to regulate the temperature inside the incubator to stabilize the baby׳s body temperature in even shorter periods of time than before and without leaving the recommended ranges for the baby׳s safety.

Inspecting the results it seems that monitoring the baby׳s axillary temperature is sufficient because it reflects all the variation of the core, peripheral and blood temperatures. Besides, incubator temperature management could imply to be a major technological challenge when it comes to its real-life electronic implementation to achieve the aforementioned goals to stabilize the baby thermal situation as quickly as possible.

As the most valuable asset, the present work can not only be extended and applied to other time intervals as well as groups of premature babies but it can also handle other input values for the given parameters.

Future studies, as a straight-forward continuation may extend the present one-compartment model to develop multi-compartment models where the human body will be divided into more realistic areas of defined biological activities. This can be achieved by mathematical approaches based on our model.
