                  This paper proposes an efficient and Feature-preserving Locally Optimal Projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction. Our operator is bilateral weighted, taking both spatial and geometric feature information into consideration for feature-preserving approximation. We then present an accelerated FLOP operator based on the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE), which produces reconstruction results close to those generated using the complete point set data, to within a given accuracy. Additionally, we extend our approach to time-varying data reconstruction, called the Spatial–Temporal Locally Optimal Projection operator (STLOP), which efficiently generates temporally coherent and stable feature-preserving results. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient and robust for feature-preserving geometry reconstruction on both static models and time-varying data sets.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Reconstructing the geometry from raw scanned data has been an active research topic over the last two decades. Although various reconstruction methods have been proposed [1–8], many problems still remain to be addressed due to geometry shape complexity and noise (outliers), in addition, with high accuracy reconstruction requirements and newly arisen applications. Surface reconstruction methods (e.g., [2,4,5,9–11]) work well only for input point set data that is densely sampled and from which the orientation of the points can be accurately deduced. Point Set Surfaces (PSS) defined by local moving least squares (MLS) approximations of the point set data [10,12] have been proven to be a powerful approach. However, due to the employment of plane fit operation, PSS is highly unstable in regions of high curvature where the sampling rate usually drops significantly.

To avoid using local surface approximation and normal estimation, Lipman et al. [7] develop a parameterization-free Locally Optimal Projection operator (LOP) for geometry reconstruction. This method is robust to noise and outliers of raw scanned data. However, the LOP method encodes only the spatial relationship between input points while completely ignoring underlying surface geometry. It thus might fail to capture geometric features (Figs. 1 and 2
                     
                     ). In addition, LOP is computationally expensive for reconstructing large point set data, while large data is commonly generated using laser and structured light scanners.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient and Feature-preserving Locally Optimal Projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction. We first develop a bilateral-weighted local optimal projection operator for preserving features, which works by taking both spatial and geometric feature information. Adaptive local-support parameter determination is exploited for robust projection. We then present an accelerated FLOP, which is based on the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) [14] for the original point-set data. We show that reconstruction results by the accelerated FLOP are close to those generated using the complete point set data, to within a given accuracy, while time complexity is reduced significantly. Finally we show how FLOP can be extended for efficient and robust reconstruction of time-varying data.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 
                        
                           •
                           Developing a feature-preserving locally optimal projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction (Section 3.2).

Proposing a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) based random sampling technique to accelerate local optimal projection (Section 3.3).

Introducing a fast spatial–temporal locally optimal projection operator (STLOP) for reconstructing time-varying data (Section 4).

Although the proposed FLOP algorithm is referred to as a “reconstruction” algorithm, it can also be considered as a filtering/denoising algorithm. It is very useful for the preprocessing for the following methods, such as MLS [10], APSS [8], RBF [11], MPU [4], and Poisson surface reconstruction [5], since these methods require relatively clean input. In this sense, our FLOP is complementary with these methods.

Many surface reconstruction methods have been proposed in recent years [1–4,10,5,7,8,15,16]. Among them the Point Set Surface (PSS) representation which is defined by the local moving least squares (MLS) projection operator [12,10] has been proven to be a powerful surface representation for point set data. The initial Levin’s definition [12] and PSS definition [10] are relatively expensive to compute. Although significant progress [2,17,18] has been made to design simpler and more efficient definitions, the central limitation of the robustness of PSS is the required plane fit operation that is highly unstable in regions of high curvature where the sampling rate drops below a threshold. Recently, Guennebaud et al. [8,15] propose an algebraic point set surfaces (APSS) framework to locally approximate the data using algebraic spheres. Compared with MLS approximations, this strategy exhibits high tolerance with respect to low sampling densities while retaining a tight approximation of the surface.

Lipman et al. [7] develop a parameterization-free locally optimal projection operator (LOP) for geometry reconstruction, which originates from the multivariate 
                        
                           
                              L

                      median [19]. LOP works well on raw data without relying on any local parameterization of the points or their local orientation, and is thus robust to noise and outliers of raw scanned data. However, this method suffers from high computational cost for local optimal minimization and fails to preserve geometry features well. Recently, by incorporating adaptive density weighting into LOP, Huang et al. [13] modify the LOP operator to handle point sets with non-uniform sampling, which they call WLOP. They also present a robust normal estimation method based on priority-driven normal propagation and orientation-aware PCA, which is adopted for normal estimation in our current system.

Using range scanning techniques such as structured light [20] and spacetime stereo [21], it is now possible to capture detailed 3D geometry nearly at real-time rates, which though is often corrupted with heavy noise. Several methods have been proposed to reconstruct time-varying data sets. For example, to obtain smooth and temporally coherent filtering results, Schall et al. [22] extend the non-local image denoising method [23] to 3D geometry. This method is essentially a filtering method and thus cannot work as a re-sampling tool like the LOP operator. Furthermore, such a method is time-consuming since it has to compare regions of the surface. Instead, our method reconstructs clean time-varying surfaces by an efficient local optimal projection operator, which is more robust for surfaces with outliers. Furthermore, using our method, the number of reconstructed points can be deliberately different from that of the original time-varying surfaces, which is useful for producing time-varying surfaces with different resolution (sampling). Wand et al. [24] provide a system for reconstructing the topology, shape, and dense correspondences from unstructured time-varying point clouds. However, this method suffers from large computational cost, and the employed iterative assembly heuristic for inferring the discrete 4D topology does not always guarantee finding a good solution. Mitra et al. [25] present an approach for registration of point clouds of moving and deforming objects. Without computing correspondence, this method exploits the underlying temporal coherence in the data and directly computes object motion from the raw scanner for geometry registration.

A shorter version of this paper appeared in [26].

In this section, we first briefly review the original method of local optimal projection (LOP) [7]. A bilateral weighted LOP, which we call FLOP, is then presented for feature-preserving geometry reconstruction. Finally we introduce an acceleration technique for FLOP, which benefits from the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate.

Although LOP is an effective approach to reconstruct complex geometry, this method has the following drawbacks. First, when processing complex point set data with sharp features, the geometry features may not be preserved well, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Second, 
                           h
                         is an important parameter which plays a major role in the application of LOP, but it has to be manually adjusted by trial and error to achieve satisfied results. Third, since the computational complexity of this method is superlinear in the number of input points, it is computationally expensive for large point set data. In this section, we try to address the above problems.

We observed that the multivariate

                                 1

                              )
                           
                         is defined as the sum of weighted Euclidean distances to the data points but does not consider geometry features of the underlying point-set surface. This is why LOP cannot successfully capture geometric features, causing sharp features such as edges and corners blurred. Motivated by the geometry bilateral filtering [27,28] and the ellipsoidal weigh function used in [29], we propose a bilateral weighted LOP operator for feature-preserving geometry approximation.

To this end we integrate a feature preservation weight

                         incorporates the normal information, it needs no consistent normal information, that is, it does not require that all the normals point inside or outside. As our projected points are computed in an optimization procedure, unlike the geometry bilateral filtering [27,28] which move the point along its normal direction, thus unoriented normals can be used in our method. This is very important since consistently orienting the normal information is a difficult problem, especially for a very noisy point set [1,13]. The state-of-the-art feature-preserving surface reconstruction methods, such as point set surface (PSS) [10], robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) [33], algebraic point set surfaces (APSS) [8,15], and Poisson surface reconstruction (PSR) [5], require consistently oriented points as input, which makes them not robust for models with heavy noises. However, since our method can use unoriented normals, thus our method is less susceptible to issues of robustness than PSS methods. We shall show later that although our formulation involves normal estimation, it performs robustly even for very noisy data.

                         which produces locally regular point distribution. Local adaptive density weights [13] can also be easily incorporated into Eq. (2) to make the projected points more uniformly distributed, thus avoiding excessive projected points in feature regions. Practically, the iteration procedure tends to converge in a very small number of steps, typically around 10. In Figs. 1 and 2, we compare FLOP with LOP [7] and WLOP [13]. Clearly, our proposed method preserves the features better.


                        Normal estimation. Although our method incorporates normal information, it does not need consistent normal information. In our experiments, we use PCA to compute the normal for each projected point and produce pleasing results. Classical PCA relies on Euclidean distances between points. In this paper, PCA relies on not only distances between points, but also bilateral weights between points. Note that the normal must be re-estimated for every iteration (Eq. (2)). For models with heavy noise and/or outliers, to produce a clean point set, meanwhile preserving the features, at first several iterations (one or two iterations), we set a large value as

In Fig. 3
                         we show the robustness of FLOP under different noise levels, and compare with the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods. The Gaussian noise is added manually in this example. With the noise level gradually augmenting, our method still reconstructs the features well. This is possibly because FLOP is an optimization process and thus the inaccurate intermediate reconstruction results can be gradually rectified by our alternating iterative algorithm (i.e., alternating between normal estimation and reconstruction). Compared to LOP and WLOP, our method preserves the features better even for models with the least noise (Fig. 3(e) and (f)). We also give the comparison results with PSR [5], RIMLS [33], APSS [8,15], which requires consistently oriented points as input. For fairness, the same consistent normal estimation is used for these methods, the reconstructed surfaces are densely sampled and rendered using the same point-based rendering pipeline. It is easily noticeable that our method outperforms these methods for models severely corrupted by noise and generates comparable results for the case of slight noise.

                            in the LOP operator has important influence on the quality of reconstruction results. Too large a value of 
                              h
                            might cause over-smoothed results (see the ears of the bunny in Fig. 4
                           (f)). In contrast, if the value of 
                              h
                            is too small we cannot achieve desired results either (e.g., Fig. 4(d)). However, such an important parameter is manually specified by trial and error in the existing literature [7,13]. In addition, we found that having a global uniform parameter 
                              h
                            is often insufficient for models with spatially varying features. These observations motivated us to automatically deduce optimal values of 
                              h
                            from the data itself, which are adaptively determined with respect to local features.

The basic idea is to use small 
                              h
                            in regions with high curvature to better capture geometric features, while we use relative larger 
                              h
                            in flat regions. We employ a bilateral weight average algorithm to decide 
                              h
                           , which is robust for reconstructing models with heavy noises.

                            is the diagonal length of the bounding box of the input point set. Note that such a default value 
                              R
                            has already been used in [13] for their setting of uniform parameter

                           Figs. 4 and 5
                            show the effectiveness of our bilateral weighted average algorithm to decide local support radius 
                              h
                           . In Fig. 4, for an input model with heavy noise, our method using adaptive support radius 
                              h
                            preserves the feature better than that using uniform support radius 
                              h
                           . We also present comparison results with LOP that uses uniform support radius 
                              h
                            with different values. In Fig. 5, we show the robustness of the bilateral weight average algorithm for the same model with different sampling densities, which are received by random sampling. Note that the adaptive support radius 
                              h
                            works well for these models.

                           P
                         [19]. Therefore, it is computationally expensive to process large point set data. In this subsection, we show how FLOP can be greatly accelerated with little sacrifice of reconstruction quality.

                        . As the computational complexity of the sampling operator is linear 
                           O

                        , thus, the whole optimization procedure is greatly accelerated.

To better emphasize the benefit of such a sophisticated KDE selection, Fig. 6
                         shows the reconstruction comparison results with a naive point set subsampling, that is, a pure stochastic selection method. Both methods subsample the original 1,354,321 points into 15,000 points. As illustrated in Fig. 6(b) and (d), the subsampled point set using random sampling of KDE is smoother, uniformly distributed, and is more feature-preserving. Based on these two subsampling results, we apply FLOP to reconstruct the original noisy data using 160,320 points, respectively. The results show that the reconstruction result generated on the KDE-based samples is smoother and preserves the features better.

The proposed acceleration method significantly reduces the computational cost while obtaining almost the same geometry reconstruction results as the FLOP method using the complete data. As illustrated in Fig. 7
                        , even with a very high sampling factor such as 
                           
                              |

                           /
                           
                              |
                              K
                              |
                           
                           =
                           16
                        , the reconstruction results are still visually pleasing. For the example of the Stanford armadillo in Fig. 6, the original point set with 1,354,321 points is first downsampled to 84,646 points, which we use for geometry reconstruction with 32,431 points. The computational time is significantly reduced from 1901 to 17 s.

                         can be approximated in a similar way for acceleration. Although this naive method will reduce the accuracy of the reconstruction, it is an alternative method to process extremely large data.

To reconstruct surface geometry from time-varying data, a naive method would be to apply FLOP to individual frames. However, such independent application of FLOP to frames would easily lead to the problem of temporal incoherence, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9
                     
                     . It would also bring the problem of separate parameter tuning for different frames, which is time consuming. To address the problems, we introduce a fast Spatio-Temporal Locally Optimal Projection operator (STLOP) for faithful reconstruction of time-varying data.

The problem can be formally formulated as follows: given the input time-varying data

                        =

Simply constraining temporally adjacent points into the optimization is usually insufficient, especially for models involving large deformations or captured under low FPS, since surface patches from different frames in the neighborhood may be very different. Instead, we should respect surface features and require temporally adjacent points with similar features to be processed in a coherent manner. Thus we employ approximately invariant signature evaluation based on surface matching to produce spatially-continuous and temporally-coherent results.

In order to enable efficient matching for point set surfaces in the animated object, we endow each point with a signature that is invariant to rigid/scaling transformation [34,35]. To compute the signature, we first build a multi-scale representation

                         to define a 24-dimensional signature vector, which is found enough to capture the approximately invariant information. As signature vector 
                           ϖ
                         is invariant to rigid/scaling transformation [34,35], thus it enables efficient matching for the surfaces in the animated object. To make the signature vector 
                           ϖ
                         more robust for noisy surface, we usually compute the

Similar to the spatial domain, we want points from distant frames to contribute less to the new point position. Therefore we introduce the temporal distance factor

                        . In addition, we can weigh the points in the neighboring frames based on point matching similarity. Points from frames with a higher similarity can contribute more to a smooth solution and should thus have a higher weight.

Similar to the acceleration of FLOP, STLOP can be accelerated based on the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) of the time-varying data. The sampling can be either performed on each frame independently, or conducted in the spatio-temporal point set domain. For the latter case, it is usually sufficient to sample the points from the current frame and the frames right before and after the current frame. Note that to make a convenient implementation, and to keep the results temporally consistent and projected points fairly distributed, we sample each frame using the same sampling factor

As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the proposed STLOP operator successfully produces temporally stable and consistent results. Another example is presented in Fig. 13. As our method considers neighboring point registration into the optimization, it performs well even in cases of large deformations or low FPS capturing. Besides, using the point registration based on approximately invariant signature, we do not necessarily need to compensate for motion between frames as the similarity of the temporal neighborhood is evaluated. In this way, our approach also automatically accounts for scene changes.

Our methods have been evaluated on models with various shape complexity and noise level. They have been also compared to the state-of-the-art works [7,13] on both performance and quality.

In Fig. 1, we give reconstruction comparison results on the dragon model containing little noise. Our result is compared to those by the LOP method [7] and the WLOP method [13]. As shown in Fig. 1(f) (g), the sharp features cannot be preserved well using these two methods [7,13].

In Figs. 2 and 10
                     , we give our reconstruction results from the noisy raw scanned data, together with comparisons with [7,13]. Compared to LOP [7], our method preserves features better, and the projected points are distributed more fairly. Although the WLOP operator [13] achieves better point distribution than LOP, WLOP still cannot preserve the features well. We also present comparison results with [7,13] on fewer projected points in Fig. 2.

In Figs. 4 and 5 we show the effectiveness of the uniformly local support radius 
                        h
                     . In Fig. 4, the bilateral weighted average algorithm is automatically selected to estimate the adaptive support radius 
                        h
                     . As shown in Fig. 4, both FLOP results using uniform support radius 
                        h
                      and using adaptive support radius 
                        h
                      preserve features better than the LOP method [7]. However, the FLOP result using adaptive support radius 
                        h
                      is the best. Using uniformly 
                        h
                     , when 
                        h
                      is small, the LOP method cannot filter out the noise effectively. In contrast, when 
                        h
                      is large, the features cannot be preserved well, as illustrated in Fig. 4(d)–(f), where we give results of LOP with increasing uniform support radius 
                        h
                      values, respectively. Fig. 5 illustrates the robustness of the bilateral weight average algorithm for the same model with different sampling densities.

In Fig. 3, we show the robustness of the proposed FLOP under different noise levels, and compare it with the state-of-the-art feature-preserving surface reconstruction methods, PSR [5], RIMLS [33], and APSS [8,15]. All these three methods require consistently oriented normal information. In this example, the noisy models are reconstructed with the same number of points as that of the input models. For a fair comparison, we apply the MeshLab developed by The Visual Computing Group [37] to perform the implementations of [5,33,8,15]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, for input model with slight noise, the reconstructed results using these methods are comparable with our FLOP method. With the noise level gradually augmenting (the noise is added manually), even with extremely heavy noise, our method reconstructs the features much better. For RIMLS [33] and APSS [8,15], it is difficult to preserve the features while filtering the heavy noise simultaneously. PSR [5] formulates the surface reconstruction as a spatial Poisson problem. This method is resilient to noise, however, it blurs the features of the model with heavy noise. As these methods require consistently oriented normal information, however, it is well known that it is difficult to compute required normals for very noisy models, this also influences their reconstruction results. Note that we tune the parameters provided by MeshLab [37] to give the best reconstruction results for these methods.


                     Figs. 6, 7 and 11
                      show the FLOP acceleration results and compare them with other methods. Fig. 6 presents the reconstruction comparison results with a naive point set subsampling method, the results confirm that our KDE-based subsampling is a much better approximation method, and based on this subsampling result, we can produce much better reconstruction results using FLOP. Fig. 7 gives the results by the accelerated FLOP, under different sampling factors. It is shown that even with a very high sampling factor like

                        /

                        16
                     , the reconstruction results by the accelerated FLOP are still satisfactory, with well-preserved features and fairly distributed points, while the computational cost is significantly reduced. Our acceleration technique is particularly suitable for processing massive point set data, where performing LOP on the complete set of the data is impractical on common PCs due to too high a time complexity. Fig. 11 gives another example using the accelerated technique. There are 463,245 points in the original point set. In Fig. 11(c), we first sample it into 65,345 points and reconstruct it using 25,365 points. In Fig. 11(e), we sample it in 25,313 points and reconstruct it using 8365 points.


                     Figs. 8 and 12
                      give the reconstruction results of noisy time-varying data. As indicated in Fig. 8, our STLOP method produces a faithful reconstruction. This example consists of 201 frame surfaces. The time interval among 201 frame surfaces is 42,342 s. The number of points in each frame is not identical, and the averaged number of points in each frame is 97,489. We also present reconstructed results using the accelerated STLOP method in the fourth row, where the average point number of each frame is 5386. The average 13,000 samples per frame are used for reconstruction. Note that in this example, as the involved deformation is not large, we do not employ the surface registration techniques. As shown in Fig. 8, in the second row, results by independent application of FLOP to individual frames are not temporal-coherent (see the accompanying Video). In addition, using the same parameters for each frame, there exist small holes in some of the reconstructed frames since no parameter is suitable for all frames. Using our STLOP method, the results are much better. Fig. 12 gives reconstruction results from the scanned noisy data. We obtain the scanned noisy data using a Kinnect. This example consists of 201 frame surfaces, and the averaged number of points in each frame is 67,359. Using the STLOP method, the results are temporal-coherent and the features are preserved well.


                     Figs. 9 and 13 present the reconstruction results of noisy time-varying data with large deformation. Since these examples involve low FPS capturing and/or large deformations, we have to employ the surface registration to produce spatially-continuous and temporally-coherent reconstruction results. By intergrading the surface matching results [34] into the STLOP operator, the features of the time-varying surfaces are reconstructed better than the results reconstructed by performing LOP for each frame independently. As shown in Fig. 9, the trunk is better reconstructed. The time-varying data consists of 201 frame surfaces, and the averaged number of points in each frame is 181,367.

                      shows the timing statistics for several models. Our accelerated method shows greater advantage when processing large data sets that cannot be efficiently processed for complete sets of data. For example, it takes less than 2.1 s to downsample 181,367×201 points on a CPU using

                     , and the average projected points for each frame are 12,256. However, the reconstruction results are still satisfactory even with such a high sampling factor, as shown in Fig. 9.


                     Limitations: Compared with parameterization-free LOP [7], one limitation of our method is that, to define a bilateral weighted LOP operator, we need the normal information. Even if the methods [1,13,30] make good normal estimation, it is still difficult to compute accurate normal vectors for sparsely sampled models with sharp features and heavy outliers. Fortunately, unoriented normals can be used in our method. This is very important and it mitigates the limitation that needs normal information, since computing the normal direction is a quite easy task compared to consistently orienting them.

Another disadvantage of requiring normal estimation on projected points for feature-preserving reconstruction is the reliance for the well-distributed initial projected points. In other words, our FLOP method cannot simply project any set of points in space onto the input point set, which is a notable feature of LOP and WLOP.

For sparsely sampled models with heavy outliers, it might be difficult to completely smooth out the outliers while preserving the sharp features perfectly. As illustrated in Fig. 14
                     , although the features are preserved well, the reconstructed results are not smooth enough. In this case, we have to make leverage between feature-preserving results and smooth results with outliers smoothed away. Compared with our results, the results of the LOP method are smoother, while the features are not preserved well.

In this paper, we present an efficient and feature-preserving locally optimal projection operator (FLOP) for geometry reconstruction. It is based on a bilateral-weighted LOP, considering both spatial and geometric feature information. We show that FLOP can be greatly accelerated by using the random sampling of the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) and can be extended for efficient and faithful reconstruction of time-varying surface reconstruction.

In the future, we would like to find a novel method for more robust normal estimation to handle heavily noisy surfaces. It would be interesting to explore solutions (e.g., based on [38]) to further accelerate the bilateral weighted LOP. Other possible future work is to perform geometry completion based on the local minimization LOP, and appropriate user interaction may be incorporated to generate desirable results. Finally, for more compact representation, we are interested in producing adaptive geometry reconstruction using the LOP method, where samples are adaptively distributed with respect to features.
