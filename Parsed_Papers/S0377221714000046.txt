                  In this paper we study an inexact steepest descent method for multicriteria optimization whose step-size comes with Armijo’s rule. We show that this method is well-defined. Moreover, by assuming the quasi-convexity of the multicriteria function, we prove full convergence of any generated sequence to a Pareto critical point. As an application, we offer a model for the Psychology’s self regulation problem, using a recent variational rationality approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The method described by (Burachik, Graña Drummond, Iusem, & Svaiter, 1995) for a continuously differentiable optimization problem generates a sequence with the property that any accumulation point of it is a critical point for the objective function. It is the steepest descent method with Armijo’s rule, which was later generalized by (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000) for multicriteria optimization, in the case where the objective function is a vectorial function. The result of full convergence is assured when the objective function is convex, provided that the problem’s solution set is non-empty, see (Burachik et al., 1995), or in a more general way, when the objective function is quasi-convex; see (Bello Cruz & Lucambio Pérez, 2010; Kiwiel & Murty, 1996). Graña Drummond and Svaiter (2005) generalized this result for convex vectorial optimization and (Bento, Ferreira, & Oliveira, 2012) generalized it for quasi-convex multicriteria optimization, see also (Bello Cruz, Lucambio Pérez, & Melo, 2011). See (Miglierina, Molho, & Recchioni, 2008) for a computational approach of a gradient like method in the context multiobjective. For extensions of other scalar optimization methods to the vectorial setting, see (Bonnel, Iusem, & Svaiter, 2005; Ceng, Mordukhovich, & Yao, 2010; Fliege, Graña Drummond, & Svaiter, 2009; Villacorta & Oliveira, 2011) and references therein.

As far as we know, (Bento et al., 2012) were the first ones who presented a result of full convergence of the exact steepest descent method, with Armijo’s rule, for quasi-convex multicriteria optimization – a work that includes contributions in both Euclidean and Riemannian contexts. In the present paper, we study the method proposed by (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000), which is the inexact version of the method presented in (Bento et al., 2012). Relative errors on the search directions are admitted in this method, that is, an approximation of the exact search direction is computed at each iteration. Specifically, we present the global convergence of any sequence generated by this method to a Pareto critical point (resp. weak Pareto optimal point) of the multiobjective optimization problem in the quasiconvex case (resp. pseudo-convex case).

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the self regulation problem under the context of Psychology; In Section 3, the multicriteria problem and the first order optimality condition for it are presented, along with some basic definitions; In Section 4, the inexact steepest descent method used to find a solution for multicriteria problems is stated and the well-definition of the sequence generated by it is established; In Section 5, a result for partial convergence of the method is presented without any additional assumption on the objective function. Moreover, assuming that the objective function is quasi-convex and that the Riemannian manifold has non-negative sectional curvature, we present a result for full convergence; Finally, Section 6 offers a “distal-proximal” model of self regulation in Psychology, using a recent variational rationality approach; see (Soubeyran, 2009 – Variational rationality, a theory of individual stability and change: worthwhile and ambidextry behaviors), (Soubeyran, 2010 – Variational rationality and the unsatisfied man: routines and the course pursuit between aspirations, capabilities and beliefs), (Soubeyran, 2012a – Worthwhile to change course pursuits and behavioral traps) and (Soubeyran, 2012b – Variational rationality: a course pursuit between desired ends and feasible means), which models behaviors as an approaching or avoidance process, a course pursuit between “desired enough” ends and “feasible enough” means.

In this section, devoted to applications, we will focus our attention to the so-called “multiple goals self regulation problem”, in the field of behavioral sciences. Our paper extends the steepest descent method of (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000) to the quasi-convex case in multicriteria optimization. We will show a strong link between our research and the “variational rationality” approach of Soubeyran’s “theories of change” (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010, 2012a, 2012b). Change problems consider “why, how, and when” it is worthwhile to move from a bad or not so favorable situation

                      that could be known or unknown. There is a number of different formulations that depend on the context, but in general the limit case of full rationality is an optimizing one, and the case of bounded rationality is a better one.

The variational rationality approach examines two kinds of “change problems”: (i) adaptive choice problems, such as the problem of “selecting the context to choose from”, that is, the formation of sets to be taken in consideration; (ii) transformation problems, such as creation and destruction, invention and innovation, or problems involving evolution of institutions, dynamic interactions, and changes of different nature, as health, behavioral, organizational and cultural. It has its applications in Economics, Decision Theory, Management, Psychology, Artificial Intelligence, Philosophy, Sociology, and Applied Mathematics (e.g., Variational Analysis, Optimization and Variational Inequalities). In this variational context, our present paper shows how useful it is to set together distal and proximal goals in order to reach a distal goal. This variational approach emphasizes, each step of the process, two main variational principles: a “satisfactory, but not too much sacrificial” principle and a “worthwhile to change” principle. Since the space of situations is the Euclidian space

the choice, for each step, of a “worthwhile change” principle.

The notions of self regulation and goal are discussed now. Self regulation considers the systematic activities or efforts that are made to direct thoughts, feelings, and actions towards the accomplishment of someone’s goals (Zimmerman, 2000). A goal is a conscious or unconscious mental representation of some future objective (to approach or to avoid), and it can be distal or proximal, abstract or concrete, vague or precise, long term or short term, extrinsic or intrinsic, high or low in commitment, more or less desirable, and more or less feasible. Related to its feasibility aspects we list importance, priority, urgency, direction, intensity, difficulty, and measurability.

Self regulation has two aspects, a positive and a negative one. The positive side of it considers purposive processes where agents are engaged in goal-directed actions. It examines goal setting, goal striving and goal pursuit processes.
                           
                              (a)
                              Goal setting is the mental process of moving from the consideration of distal goals to the formation of more proximal goals. Distal goals are desired future ends (visions, futures plans, etc.), either promotion aspirations (such as ideals, fantasies, dreams, wishes, hopes or challenges) or prevention aspirations (as duties and obligations). They represent desirable but quite unrealistic and vague ends (higher order goals). Proximal goals can be wants, intentions, task goals, i.e. much more feasible but less desirable intermediate ends (sub goals).

Goal striving (goal implementation) examines the transition phase between setting a distal goal and reaching it.

Goal pursuit (goal revision) focuses on the final phase, after reaching the given goal or failing to reach it. It examines the role of feedbacks (self evaluations of successes and failures, including the revision of causal attributions and self efficacy beliefs; see (Tolli & Schmidt, 2008)) in order to revise goals.

Our paper considers only the positive aspect of self regulation. It focuses on proximal goal setting activities, examines some aspects of goal revision activities, and refuses to consider goal striving activities.

The famous basketball player Michael Jordan wrote the following about goal setting in his book (Jordan & Miller, 1994), “I approach everything step by step …. I had always set short-term goals. As I look back, each one of the steps or successes led to the next one. When I got cut from the varsity team as a sophomore in high school, I learned something. I knew I never wanted to feel that bad again …. So I set a goal of becoming a starter on the varsity. That’s what I focused on all summer. When I worked on my game, that’s what I thought about. When it happened, I set another goal, a reasonable, manageable goal that I could realistically achieve if I worked hard enough …. I guess I approached it with the end in mind. I knew exactly where I wanted to go, and I focused on getting there. As I reached those goals, they built on one another. I gained a little confidence every time I came through …”.


                           Bandura (1997) argued that people possess multiple systems of goals, hierarchically arranged from proximal goals to extreme distal goals. Goal proximity defines “how far goals are conceptualized into the future”. A goal hierarchy interconnects at least three levels of goals: peak goals (higher order goals, such as visions, dreams, fantasies, aspirations, ideals, wishes, hopes), distal goals (challenges, wants, intentions), and task goals. A subset of task goals can be subordinate to distal goals which can be subordinate to peak goals. Hence, the proximal goal distinction is relative to the interconnected network of goals. Other goal is providing the temporal context. The main point to be emphasized here is that distal goals and proximal goals are used for different and complementary functions connected to cognition, affection, motivation and conation related to goal difficulty, goal commitment and psychological distance.
                              
                                 (i)
                                 distal goals define desired ends (enduring aspirations) that attract individuals;

proximal goals regulate immediate cognitive and functions, which provide the ways to find and follow a path of step by step changes moving from the initial situation to approach the desired end or avoid an undesirable end. In this context it is important to distinguish task goals and strategies. Task goals define what is to be accomplished, and strategies define how it should to be accomplished (Wood & Bandura, 1989).

In this section, we present the multicriteria problem, the first order optimality condition for it and some basic definitions.

The previous method was proposed by (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000) and becomes the classical steepest descent method when 
                              
                                 m

                           . Other variants of Method 4.1 can be found in (Fukuda & Graña Drummond, 2013; Graña Drummond & Svaiter, 2005).

Next proposition ensures that the sequence generated by the Method 4.1 is well-defined.

                           generated by the steepest descent method with Armijo’s rule is well-defined.
                        

The proof follows from item ii of Lemma 4.3 combined with the fact that F is continuously differentiable. See (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000) for more details. □

In this section, we present a partial convergence result without any additional assumption on F besides its continuous differentiability. In the sequel, assuming quasi-convexity of F and following the ideas of (Bento et al., 2012; Graña Drummond & Svaiter, 2005), we extend the full convergence result presented in (Graña Drummond & Svaiter, 2005) for quasi-convex multicriteria optimization. It can be observed that, if Method 4.1 terminates after a finite number of iterations, then it terminates at a Pareto critical point. From now on, we will assume that

From the previous proposition follows that pseudo-convex functions are quasi-convex. The reciprocal is naturally false. Next proposition provides a sufficient condition for a differentiable quasi-convex function to be pseudo-convex.

                               is not pseudo-convex. However, since H is quasi-convex and each Pareto critical point of H is a weak Pareto optimal point for H, it follows from last proposition that H is pseudo-convex.

We know that criticality is a necessary condition, even though not sufficient, for optimality. In (Bento et al., 2012) the authors proved that, under convexity of the vectorial function F, criticality is equivalent to the weak optimality. Next we prove that the equivalence still happens if F is just pseudo-convex.

                              But this contradicts the fact that x is a Pareto critical point of H, and the first part is therefore concluded. The second part is a simple consequence of the fact that F is differentiable with the definitions of Pareto critical point and weak Pareto optimal point.

This section offers a “distal-proximal” model of self regulation in Psychology, using a recent variational rationality approach (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010, 2012a, 2012b) which models behaviors as an approaching or avoidance process, a course pursuit between “desired enough” ends and “feasible enough” means.

Variational rationality (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010, 2012a, 2012b) is a theory about an endless unsatisfied man, who, refuses to satisfy some of his unsatisfied needs, and at the same time aspires to accomplish some others. We can summarize some of the main points of this variational approach of the self regulation problem, based on cognition (knowledge), motivation (desires) and affection (feelings and emotions) as follows:
                              
                                 (i)
                                 the agent, focusing his attention on the unsatisfied needs he has chosen to satisfy, considers desired ends. He forms aspirations (distal goals). Setting aspirations goals is a way to know what he really wants among all his wishes, without considering if they are realistic or not;

then, the agent starts to consider feasible means (defined as the means he must find, create, build, gather and use);

given the difficulties for gathering such feasible means the agent chooses to partially satisfy his aspirations.

Next, the agent self regulates all his goal-oriented activities:

goal setting: setting proximal goals is a way for him to assess the difficulties in order to better know what his real possibilities are. This allows him to make a balance between “desired enough” ends and “feasible enough” means;

goal striving: it represents the path (way of doing, strategy) the agent chooses to follow and the obstacles he must overcome to attain his successive proximal goals and partially satisfies them;

goal pursuit: it is the revision of the goals, using the feedback that comes from successes and failures.

This variational approach is progressive (adaptive). The step by step joint formation of distal (global) and proximal (local) goals and related actions is a process that includes a lot of interactions, tatonnements and adjustments that are driven by inexact perceptions, evaluations and judgments.

Among several variational principles, three of them are worth mentioning in the present paper:
                              
                                 –
                                 the “satisficing with not too much sacrificing” principe and the “worthwhile to change” principle (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010);

the “tension reduction–tension production” principle (Soubeyran, 2012a, 2012b).

In our context of inexact multicriteria proximal algorithms, we are modeling the main motivational concepts of the variational Soubeyran’s approach (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010). They include:
                              
                                 (a)
                                 
                                    The map of unsatisfied needs (the needs system). An agent has two ways to perceive, judge and estimate a situation, either in terms of unsatisfaction or in terms of satisfaction. Usually an agent deals with a lot of unsatisfied needs which depend of his present situation

These aspirations levels represent desirable (but perhaps unrealistic) ends. Lewin (1951) defines aspiration levels as desirable ends, with some being unrealistic in a near future, and others not.

                           The main problem is to know how the agent sets all these levels, step by step (progressively).

A “goal system” (Kruglanski et al., 2002) comprises: (i) a cognitive network of mental representations of goals and means which are structurally interconnected by several somewhat strong cognitive links, (ii) in the short run, a subset of limited available resources (physiological, material, mental, social means), because means are scarce and difficult to obtain, (iii) an allocation process where goals compete for the use of these limited available resources, and (iv) a motivational process of goal setting, goal commitment, goal striving and goal pursuit (using affective feedback engendered in response to success and failure outcomes, goal revision including persistence of pursuit, means substitution and the management of goal-conflict). In our specific case the goal system is the satisfaction map

                           . These means can represent actions, resources and capabilities “to be able to do” them see (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010). The fact that outcomes compete for restricted means can be modelized as follows: we decompose the given x into the sum

In terms of variational rationality, the (Fliege & Svaiter, 2000) steepest descent method appears to be an “aspiration driven local search proximal algorithm”. In situation

The variational concept of “worthwhile changes” is related to the famous (Lindblom, 1959) “muddling through” economizing principle where agents make small steps (incremental changes, choosing the step size in our context) and successive limited comparisons (balancing pro and cons).
                           Remark 6.2
                           Our paper considers quasi-convex (or quasi-concave) payoffs. In terms of variational rationality, this case is very interesting, because it allows large flat portions that can be very costly to explore (quadratic exploration costs are “large in the large”). Hence, in this case, convergence is a very nice result.

The goal of this paper was to provide conditions of convergence for a path of change towards a Pareto optimal in a multicriteria optimization setting. The variational concept of a behavioral trap (Soubeyran, 2009, 2010) appears in this context at the local level of the consideration (say exploration) process. More precisely, we will say that

                         is Pareto critical, then

                         is a local exploration trap.

We proved the full convergence of each sequence generated by the inexact steepest descent method to a Pareto critical point associated to quasi-convex multicriteria optimization problems. We also showed a striking result, namely, the strong connection of such an inexact proximal algorithm with the self regulation problem in Psychology. Further researches can be made in this direction.
