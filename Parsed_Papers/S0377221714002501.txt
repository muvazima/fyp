                  Deriving accurate interval weights from interval fuzzy preference relations is key to successfully solving decision making problems. Xu and Chen (2008) proposed a number of linear programming models to derive interval weights, but the definitions for the additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation and the linear programming model still need to be improved. In this paper, a numerical example is given to show how these definitions and models can be improved to increase accuracy. A new additive consistency definition for interval fuzzy preference relations is proposed and novel linear programming models are established to demonstrate the generation of interval weights from an interval fuzzy preference relation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was proposed by Saaty (1980), it has been widely studied and applied to decision making problems. However, because of the complexity of real life decision making problems, it is often difficult for decision maker to estimate exact preferences, so normally these are expressed using interval numbers, which is known as a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). In decision making, both the interval fuzzy preference relation (IFPR) and the interval reciprocal preference relation (IRPR) are useful when expressing a decision maker’s uncertain preference. However, when determining these relations, interval consistency and an accurate generation of the interval weights are important. Xu and Chen (2008) first defined the IFPR’s additive and multiplicative consistency and established several models to derive the interval weights. The purpose of this note is to highlight the inaccuracies in Definitions 3 and 4, (M-1) and (M-2) using an example, and to present modified Definitions and Models. The definitions and models in Xu and Chen (2008) are briefly discussed.

                     Definitions 3 and 4 define the additive consistency of an IFPR, and (M-1) and (M-2) can assist in generating the lower and upper bounds of the weights. However, some additive consistent IFPRs may not satisfy the conditions for Definitions 3 and 4. At the same time, the feasible region in (M-1) and (M-2) for the additive consistent IFPR may be empty. In the following section, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate this situation.

                      is not an additive consistent IFPR.

When solving (M-1) and (M-2), no feasible solution can be found, this indicates that

                      is not an additive consistent IFPR.

However, according to Definition 2, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 R

                           R
                        
                      is an additive consistent FPR. This indicates that, the Definition 3 is able to take an additive consistent IFPR as the additive inconsistent IFPR. In this case, the concept of the additive consistent IFPR needs to be improved. In the next part, an improved definition for the additive consistent IFPR is proposed.

In this section, an improved concept for the additive consistent IFPR is proposed and several models based on this new additive consistency definition are established to derive the interval weights.
