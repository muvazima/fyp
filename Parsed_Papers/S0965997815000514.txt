                  Numerical models for computing low-frequency electromagnetic fields can contain spatial 2D finite elements, which are numerically most demanding due to problem of singularity. In this paper, an advanced time-harmonic quasistatic surface charge simulation method for computation of scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution is presented. Subparametric spatial 2D finite elements with an arbitrary number of nodes for description of surface charge density distribution are developed. The problem of singularity that occurs in the double 2D integration over these elements is solved using an originally developed advanced numerical integration based on 2D Gaussian quadrature. Self and mutual coefficients of spatial 2D finite element nodes are numerically computed and included in the system of linear equations for surface charge density distribution computation. The accuracy of the computer program, based on the presented model, is shown in the chosen numerical example with known analytical solution. Numerical model and advanced integration presented herein could be easily extended to non-homogeneous regions and multilayer problems using the image method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

High voltage air-insulated switchyards, substations and power lines feature complex three-dimensional (3D) layout of metallic conductors. Large time-harmonic currents and charges cause low-frequency (50/60Hz) electromagnetic fields, wherein electric field intensity in their vicinity can exceed reference values prescribed by ICNIRP guidelines [1].

In numerical models for computing low-frequency electromagnetic fields, the problem can be considered as quasistatic [2–5]. Quasistatic fields vary slowly with time and therefore, attenuation and phase shift of these fields can be neglected. Numerical algorithms for computing electromagnetic fields in electric power substations are 3D algorithms [5–9]. Numerical algorithms for computing overhead power line electromagnetic fields are mostly two-dimensional (2D) [10,11], although in a certain number of real cases more sophisticated 3D algorithms can be taken into account [12,13].

Applied methodologies for computing low-frequency electromagnetic fields range from the method of moments (MOM) [14], finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD) [15,16], finite element method (FEM) [17], boundary element method (BEM) [18], charge simulation method (CSM) [19,20], surface charge simulation method (SCSM) [21], to name a few. Theoretical basis of each method, its advantages and limitations in comparison with other solution techniques are well-known [22].

In a wider time-harmonic quasistatic surface charge method for computing low-frequency electromagnetic fields of power lines and substations [23], thin-wire cylindrical segments of active and passive conductors, conductive metallic spheres and spatial 2D finite elements are included and all of these components are capacitively coupled. The foundation of the developed method is application of finite element technique to an integral equation formulation in the frequency domain. In this paper, time-harmonic quasistatic charge simulation method [23] is reduced to surface charge simulation method, i.e. to use of spatial 2D subparametric finite elements. Spatial 2D finite elements are numerically most demanding due to problem of singularity which occurs in the double 2D integration when they are taken into consideration [24,25]. Therefore, in this paper, discussion is limited only to these elements. Hence, subparametric spatial 2D finite elements, with an arbitrary number of nodes for a description of surface charge density distribution, are developed. Expressions for self and mutual coefficients of these spatial 2D finite element nodes are derived using the Galerkin–Bubnov method, which gives symmetric system of linear equations. The problem of singularity that occurs in the double 2D integration over spatial 2D finite elements is successfully solved using originally developed advanced algorithm for double 2D numerical integration based on Gaussian quadrature. In the numerical example, due to simplicity, existence of analytical solutions and comparability, equipotential circular metal plate in a homogeneous unbounded dielectric medium (air) is chosen. It is therefore a good example to verify the accuracy of the algorithm developed in this paper, focusing on the accuracy of the advanced double 2D numerical integration over spatial 2D finite elements. Presented algorithm is developed for AC fields, but can be easily reduced to DC fields if phasors of all input data have phase angles equal to zero.

In the finite element terminology, some conductive passive parts of electrical substations and towers of overhead power lines can be described by spatial 2D finite elements. In Fig. 1
                     , spatial 2D finite element with 9 nodes for geometry mapping and 25 nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution is shown.

In this model, for geometry mapping of spatial 2D finite element, a quadrilateral reference 2D finite element with four, eight or nine nodes can be used. There are no limitations for the geometrical shape, which can be arbitrary, and only suitable number of nodes has to be chosen. In the Fig. 2
                     , quadrilateral reference 2D finite element with eight nodes for geometry mapping is shown. Furthermore, the surface charge density distribution over the quadrilateral reference 2D finite element is described by linear combination of shape functions joined to the element nodes. Number of nodes is arbitrary and coefficients of the linear combination are potentials of element nodes. In the developed model, there are more nodes for approximation of the surface charge density distribution than nodes for geometry mapping, thus the spatial 2D finite elements are subparametric.

Mapping functions of the quadrilateral reference 2D finite element with four, eight or nine nodes are equal to product of 1D Lagrange polynomials or serendipity polynomials for each coordinate axis in the local coordinate system (u,
                     v) [26,27]. Partial derivatives of these functions along local axes can be obtained easily. In the special case, quadrilateral reference 2D finite element can be mapped into a triangular finite element (Fig. 3
                     ).

Numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution over a reference 2D finite element can be written as:

                      is a total number of local nodes of the i-th spatial 2D finite element.

Continuity of the surface charge density at the spatial 2D finite element boundaries is not required. Consequently, local nodes of different spatial 2D finite elements cannot be joined to the same global node. For each subparametric spatial 2D finite element, global coordinates of local nodes for geometry mapping are input data. In such a way spatial 2D finite element mesh is defined. According to usual procedure, using nodal connectivity matrix each spatial 2D finite element local node is shown to correspond to some global node number.

A two-layer medium is observed in which the first layer (half-space) is air and the second layer is homogeneous earth. Air is characterized by vacuum permittivity ɛ
                     0 and permeability μ
                     0, whereas earth is characterized by relative permittivity ɛr
                     , permeability μ
                     0 and electrical conductivity κ.

By adopting limitation that the surface charge is placed on the surfaces of NP spatial 2D finite elements (i.e. surfaces), scalar electric potential distribution at the arbitrary field point T (x, y, z) in the air of the observed two-layer medium can be written as:

In Eq. (8), integration over the surface image of the j-th spatial 2D finite element is transformed to integration over the surface of the j-th spatial 2D finite element. Double 2D integral over the j-th spatial 2D finite element described by Eq. (8) is solved using an advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature algorithm, which is a special case of numerical procedure explained in Appendix A.

                     Two local nodes may belong to different spatial 2D finite elements or to the same spatial 2D finite element. Their self and mutual coefficients can be numerically computed by solving double 2D integrals from Eq. (9). In this paper, these integrals are solved using an advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature algorithm, described in detail in Appendices. Procedure explained in Appendix A refers to the case when local nodes belong to different spatial 2D finite elements, whereas procedure from Appendix B refers to the case when local nodes belong to the same spatial 2D finite element.

On the basis of the presented theory, a FORTRAN program for computation of the rms values of the scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution was developed.

In this numerical example, a thin equipotential circular metal plate of radius a
                     =2.5m, at the potential of 1kV in homogeneous unbounded dielectric medium is observed (Fig. 7
                     ).

If the metal plate is observed in the two-layer medium, the image method has to be applied, but then analytical solution does not exist. Therefore, this example is convenient to verify the accuracy of the computer program based on proposed algorithm for approximation of equipotential surfaces using subparametric spatial 2D finite elements, i.e. to verify accuracy of the advanced double 2D numerical integration over spatial 2D finite elements.

The entire model is presented in thesis [23], where two-layer medium is observed, and also, elements of the more complicated geometry are taken in consideration. In [23], e.g. towers of the overhead power lines are approximated using thin-wire cylindrical segments of passive conductors and also using subparametric spatial 2D finite elements.

Observed metal plate will be approximated by different number of subparametric spatial 2D finite elements and by different number of local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution. Scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution of the circular metal plate will be computed in the arbitrary number of points along a straight line in the vicinity of the metal plate. Moreover, normalized surface charge density distribution on both sides of metal plate will be presented and compared to known analytical solution.

For this case, it is convenient to use cylindrical coordinate system (r, z) due to the fact that the scalar electric potential is cylindrically symmetrical with respect to the z-axis.

                     The observed circular metal plate is approximated by four subparametric spatial 2D finite elements (Fig. 8
                      left). For geometry mapping of each finite element, eight nodes were chosen and total number of local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution along local axes is NU
                     =
                     NV
                     =5.

Circular metal plate can also be approximated by a single subparametric spatial 2D finite element (Fig. 8 right) with eight nodes for geometry mapping.

Surface charge density distribution tends to infinity on the edge of a circular metal plate, which significantly complicates their high accurate numerical approximation and, consequently, the electric field intensity distribution. Normalized surface charge density distribution on both sides of the metal plate, according to Eq. (21), with regard to analytical solution is presented in Fig. 9
                     . Metal plate is approximated, according to Fig. 8, by a single and by four subparametric spatial 2D finite elements with 5 nodes along local axes u and v, i.e. with total 25 local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution.


                     Fig. 10
                      presents the comparison of numerical and analytical rms values of the scalar electric potential distribution along the observation profile r parallel to the metal plate, approximated, according to Fig. 8, by a single and by four subparametric spatial 2D finite elements, starting from the center of the plate up to a distance r
                     =5m from the center.


                     Fig. 11
                      presents the comparison of numerical and analytical rms values of the scalar electric potential distribution along the observation profile r parallel to the metal plate, approximated by four subparametric spatial 2D finite elements (Fig. 8 left), starting from the center of the plate up to a distance r
                     =10m from the center. Results of the scalar electric potential distribution are shown for three cases, on the surface of the plate (z
                     =0m) and at the distances z
                     =0.5m and z
                     =1m from the surface of the plate along the observation profile r.

By comparing obtained results of the scalar electric potential distribution shown in Figs. 10 and 11, very good agreement can be seen between the proposed model and the exact analytical results, even on the surface of the plate and in the case of the plate discretization by only a single subparametric spatial 2D finite element.


                     Figs. 12–14
                     
                     
                      present comparisons of numerical and analytical rms values of r- and z-components and total electric field intensity distribution along the observation profile r parallel to the metal plate, at the distances z
                     =0.5m and z
                     =1m from the surface of the plate.

In the numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution, infinite value is not possible, and, therefore, in Figs. 12–14, it can be seen a deviation between numerical and analytical results of the electric field intensity distribution in the close vicinity of the plate surface. It should be emphasized here that in practical problems results of the electric field intensity distribution are commonly observed at the distances of at least 0.5m from the surface of the plate (or surface of any passive conductive component in the substation). At these distances, error is negligible.

Normalized surface charge density distribution on both sides of the metal plate, with different number of local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution along local axes, according to Eq. (21), with regard to analytical solution is presented in Fig. 15
                     .

In the Table 1
                     , percent errors (p.e.) of r- and z-components and percent errors of total electric field intensity distributions along the observation profile with respect to analytical solutions were shown. These errors are obtained with regard to different number of local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution.

As can be clearly seen from Fig. 15 and Table 1, the lowest percent error (i.e. the highest accuracy of the numerical approximation) occurs in the case with 5 nodes along local axes u and v, i.e. with total 25 local nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution. The largest error of electric field intensity is at r
                     =2.2m, where computed value is 389.50V/m, whereas the analytical solution is 361.12V/m, so percent error is 7.86%. Further increasing the number of nodes has no influence to computational cost but generates greater error, which was also confirmed in the examples of the overhead power line towers approximation, shown in [23]. Therefore, the optimal total number of nodes for numerical approximation of the surface charge density distribution is 25.

In this paper, an advanced time-harmonic quasistatic surface charge simulation method for computation of scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution is developed. A presented surface charge simulation method is limited to use of subparametric spatial 2D finite elements, which are numerically most demanding due to problem of singularity that occurs in the double 2D integration over finite element surfaces. The problem of singularity that occurs in the double 2D integration over spatial 2D finite elements is solved with highly accurate and robust new advanced algorithm for double 2D numerical integration based on Gaussian quadrature. There are no limitations for the geometrical shape of the spatial 2D surface, which can be arbitrary, and only suitable number of nodes for description of surface charge density distribution has to be chosen. Therefore, presented algorithm can be used in all cases which include singularity problems in double 2D integration over 2D surfaces. Self and mutual coefficients of spatial 2D finite element nodes are numerically computed using this advanced double 2D numerical integration. This integration, with some modifications in the model presented herein, could be applied directly to multilayer problems. Accuracy of developed model for computing scalar electric potential and electric field intensity distribution is confirmed in numerical example of circular metal plate in homogeneous unbounded dielectric medium, which is approximated by subparametric spatial 2D finite elements. Moreover, sufficiently accurate numerical results for potential and electric field intensity distribution are obtained with only single spatial 2D finite element.

In the general case, observed p-th and q-th local nodes belong to different spatial 2D finite elements (Fig. 6). Their mutual coefficients can be numerically computed by solving double 2D integrals from Eq. (9) with an advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature algorithm [23]:

                     In numerical realization, there are 5×5=25 integration points on the i-th spatial 2D finite element. However, integration in Eq. (A.1) over the j-th spatial 2D finite element is solved numerically using an advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature algorithm. Thereat, for each particular Gauss integration point of the i-th spatial 2D finite element, j-th spatial 2D finite element is subdivided into ND integration parts with regard to the point Tn(un
                     ,
                     vn
                     ). Point Tn is located on the surface Sj
                      and it is the nearest point to the considered integration point of the i-th spatial 2D finite element. Accordingly, there is no overlapping of integration points, their coordinates and integration weights can be easily computed and problem of singularity is avoided. If the point Tn is located in one of the four peaks of the j-th spatial 2D finite element (Fig. A1
                     ), then ND
                     =1. If the point Tn is located in one of the four edges of the j-th spatial 2D finite element (Fig. A2
                     ), then ND
                     =2. If the point Tn is located within the j-th spatial 2D finite element (Fig. A3
                     ), then ND
                     =4.

Hence, according to [23], the following expression for advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature over the j-th spatial 2D finite element can be written:

                     Double 2D integral in Eq. (A.22) over the i-th spatial 2D finite element is numerically computed using an advanced double 2D Gaussian quadrature algorithm, as in Appendix A. For each of 5×5=25 integration points of the second 2D Gaussian quadrature over the surface Si
                      which has coordinates (ui
                     , vj
                     ) and integration weights (HUi
                     , HVj
                     ), surface is subdivided into four integration parts with regard to exactly that point. In each of integration part there are 5×5=25 new integration points of the first 2D Gaussian quadrature. Therefore, with regard to each integration point of the second 2D Gaussian quadrature, reference 2D finite element is subdivided into ND
                     =4 integration parts with a total of 25×4=100 integration points. Their local coordinates and integration weights are given in Eqs. (A.14)–(A.21).

The final expression for solving the double integral in Eq. (A.22) can be written, according to [23], as follows:
