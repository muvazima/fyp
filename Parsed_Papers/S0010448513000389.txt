                  When end milling free-form surfaces using a torus milling cutter, the notion of cutter effective radius is often used to address the procedure for removal of material from a purely geometrical perspective. Using an original analytical approach, the present study establishes a relation enabling the value of this effective radius to be easily computed. The limits of validity of this relation are then discussed and precisely defined.
                  By way of an illustration, an example of how this relation can be used to generate a numerical tool for analysis of the possibilities for machining free-form surfaces on multi-axis machine-tools is also presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

End milling of free-form surfaces is essentially used to manufacture moulds and dies where it is often extremely costly in terms of production time consumed. From a purely geometrical standpoint, precise modelling of the movements of the cutter and its positioning in relation to the surface are indispensable to be able to propose improvements to boost productivity. From this perspective, an approach commonly adopted is based on notions of effective radius and/or sweep curve. Indeed, good knowledge of these geometrical entities paves the way for a precise analysis of the trace left by the cutter in the workpiece, and through that, the quantity of material actually removed.

Tool path planning, optimisation of cutter positioning and non-interference issues are often the focus of research conducted in the field of free-form surface machining on multi-axis machine tools [1]. Among these works, many studies refer to the notion of cutter effective radius. The first to introduce this concept were Vickers and Quan in 1989. In [2], they show how a flat-end mill tilted to the front can be more productive than a ball-end mill. To do so, they introduce the notion of effective radius in the case of the flat-end mill: 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       
                                          eff
                                       
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       sin
                                       
                                          (
                                          ϕ
                                          )
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         where 
                           R
                         is the cutter radius and 
                           ϕ
                         is its tilt angle in the plane formed by its feed direction and axis of rotation.

The relative efficiency of flat-end mills and ball-end mills is also analysed in [3–5]. These works are also based on the effective radius concept to show that, all other parameters being equal, flat-end cutters, when correctly used, produce a lower scallop height than that produced by ball-end cutters. In [4,5], the authors also show that flat end mills leave pronounced marks in the feed direction leading to a greater roughness of the surfaces obtained (for the same feed per tooth).

Following these works a number of authors have argued in favour of using torus cutters when milling free-form surfaces. Indeed, torus mills allow a significant effective radius to be retained while avoiding the sharp and unsightly marks left in the workpiece by flat-end mills [6]. Many studies arrive at the same conclusions, whether they adopt a procedure to optimise the cutter position [7,8] or seek rather to eliminate interference [9,10].

Among the works that address the cutter effective radius concept, those most frequently encountered in the literature utilise the envelope curve concept. For a given cutter position, the envelope curve materialises the trace left by the cutter in the material. In [11], it is approximated, for a torus milling cutter, by the projection of a circle in a plane normal to the feed. In [12], it is given in the implicit form for an APT cutter. Within the scope of machining simulation [13], many studies use this concept to determine the volume of swarf actually removed by the cutter, but most of these works [14–16] address this issue numerically, which does indeed allow the swept volume to be computed, but precludes an analytical study of the effective cutter radius. The sweep curve and effective cutter radius notions are also largely used in works addressing constant scallop height machining planning. This tool path planning technique was initially introduced in [17,18] using a ball-end cutter. Subsequently it was adapted for a flat-end mill [19,20] and for the torus milling cutter [21,22], tools for which the effective radius assumes its full significance.

Analysis of the main studies published in the field shows that most works covering the effective radius of the torus milling cutter rely on geometric approximations (with non-negligible consequences) or use a numerical approach that, compared with an analytical approach, proves to be less flexible and much more time-consuming in computation.

The present article will introduce a new study of the torus milling cutter effective radius. Its originality lies in its totally analytical approach that nevertheless refrains from any geometric approximation. The main result of this work is the definition of a relation authorising an analytical calculation of the effective cutter radius.

This study is also accompanied by an analysis of this relation and its limits, thus allowing the scope for its validity to be clearly determined.

This is followed by an example in which it is shown how this relation can be used to define numerical tools potentially useful within the scope of end milling of free-form surfaces on multi-axis machine tools. The aim with this example is not to define a complete procedure to plan tool paths, but simply to emphasise the possibilities offered by using an analytical formula where numerical procedures are usually applied.

The article concludes with a reminder of the main results obtained and some remarks on forthcoming works on this subject.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It will be shown how it is possible to calculate analytically, at the point of cutter/workpiece contact, the effective radius of a torus milling cutter machining a free-form surface on a multi-axis NC machine tool. This calculation is based on two mathematical demonstrations that will be introduced prior to the computation itself.

A torus milling cutter defined by 
                           R
                         and 
                           r
                           ,
                           R
                         being the outer radius of that cutter and 
                           r
                         being its torus radius, is considered. The trace left by that cutter in the material at a given instant is a curve that will be referred to as the envelope curve. It is the succession of such envelope curves that forms the envelope surface generated by the cutter movement in the material. At each instant, the envelope curve is defined by

                                    t

                           =
                           0
                        , where 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                         is a vector in the cutter feed direction and 
                           
                              n
                           
                         a vector normal to the surface of the cutter.

In what follows in the present study, the vector 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                           
                         will be assumed to be constant for all points of the cutter; this is equivalent to asserting that the cutter moves in translation, at least locally. Moreover, only the part of the envelope curve of the cutter contained in the torus part of the cutter will be considered. Indeed, the great majority of torus milling cutters used in industry are round insert cutters and only that part is active. Also, studying the parts of the envelope curve contained in the cylindrical and discoid portions of the cutter is unproblematic and, even in the case of solid torus milling cutters, these parts of the cutter are normally inactive when removing material, especially when conducting finishing operations.

The two lemmas on which the calculation is based are as follows:

                           Lemma 2
                           
                              The radius of curvature of a plane offset curve is equal to the radius of curvature of the original curve augmented by the offset value.
                           

It will thus be shown initially that the projection of the cutter envelope curve in a plane normal to the feed direction 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    F

                         can be defined by an ellipse augmented by an offset equal to the cutter torus radius (Section 2.2).

It will then be shown that the radius of curvature of an offset to this ellipse is equal to the radius of curvature of the original ellipse augmented by the offset value (Section 2.3).

Based on these results, it will then be possible to calculate analytically the effective radius of the cutter

                         considering the radius of curvature of the ellipse 
                           
                              E

                         to which is added the cutter torus radius (Section 2.4).

All these calculations were verified using the algebraic computation software Maxima [23].

                            is considered and then an offset by 
                              r
                            of the ellipse defined by the projection of the torus major radius circle of the cutter (centre of the torus tube) in the same plane (Figs. 1 and 2
                           
                           ).

The purpose of this demonstration is to show that these two curves coincide.

Within the scope of the present study, the cutter is defined within its own reference frame, the axis coinciding with its axis of rotation. As the cutter is a surface of revolution, whatever the movement of translation driving it, the envelope curve resulting from this movement, defined by 
                              
                                 F

                              =
                              0
                           , admits a plane of symmetry containing the axis 
                              z
                            of the reference frame. Furthermore, a projection 
                              P
                            in a plane normal to the feed 
                              
                                 F
                              
                            is considered. This projection thus corresponds to a vector contained within the plane of symmetry of the envelope curve. The problem is thus axisymmetric. Consequently, the results obtained in the case of a particular projection (i.e. in a given radial direction) are true whatever the projection 
                              P
                            considered, meaning whatever translation movement drives the cutter. It can thus be considered that the results obtained in the case of a projection along a vector contained in the plane 
                              x
                              =
                              0
                            (or 
                              y
                              =
                              0
                           ) can be extended to the general case.

                                    .
                                 
                              
                           
                        

In what follows in the present demonstration, 
                              b
                              ≠
                              0
                            and 
                              c
                              ≠
                              0
                            will be considered. Indeed, instances where 
                              b
                              =
                              0
                            and 
                              c
                              =
                              0
                            correspond to horizontal or vertical cutter paths that constitute special cases that will be addressed in Section 3.2.

Furthermore, as vector 
                              
                                 F
                              
                            is unitary, it can be asserted that 
                              
                                 
                                    b
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              +
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                           .

Also, in so far as the focus is on curves projected orthogonally in a plane normal to the milling direction, any plane normal to that direction can be chosen without impairing generality. To simplify computation, a plane 
                              P
                            passing through the origin is chosen, that is a plane with equation 
                              b
                              
                              y
                              +
                              c
                              
                              z
                              =
                              0
                           . This gives 
                              d
                              =
                              0
                           .

Taking these considerations into account, Eq. (2) for a curve transformed along projection 
                              P
                            becomes

Analysing these equations, it clearly emerges that the last two, (10) and (11), are equivalent. Indeed, by multiplying each term of Eq. (10) by 
                              −
                              b
                              /
                              c
                           , Eq. (11) is obtained.

To show that the two curves are equal, all one needs to do is find a change in variable linking 
                              t
                            and 
                              v
                            such that the equation of one of the two curves can be transformed into the equation of the other curve.

To do so, the terms on 
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                            and 
                              r
                            between the first equation (9) and one of the two others (for example (10)) are identified member by member.

From Eq. (9), identifying the terms on

                            coincide. As the problem is axisymmetric, what is true in this instance is also true whatever the plane of projection, provided that the projection is made along a normal to that plane. In the case of a translation movement, the curve resulting from the projection plane of the trace left by the cutter thus coincides with the curve parallel to the ellipse, located at a distance 
                              r
                            outside the latter that itself results from the projection of the torus centre circle.

This demonstration’s objective is to show that the radius of curvature of a plane offset curve is equal to the radius of curvature of the original curve augmented by the value of the offset.

In the case of a plane curve

                        , the radius of curvature of an offset to 
                           
                              C
                           
                         is equal to the radius of curvature of 
                           
                              C
                           
                         reduced by the algebraic value of the offset. It can therefore be concluded that in the case of an offset remoter from the centre of curvature of the original curve, the radius of curvature of the offset curve will be equal to the radius of curvature of the initial curve increased by the absolute value of the offset.

                                 2
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              α
                              )
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 sin

                              α
                              )
                           
                        . It can thus be asserted that all other parameters being equal, the value of the effective radius is the same for values 
                           α
                         and 
                           α
                           +
                           π
                        . This is equivalent to saying that for a given point, the values of the effective radius are the same whether up milling or climb milling in a diametrically opposite direction. This result is unsurprising in so far as the study of the effective radius is based on a projection in a plane normal to the machining direction.

Moreover, analysis of relation (30) shows that for 
                           α
                           =
                           ±

                                 2
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 
                                    eff
                                 
                              
                           
                           =
                           r
                         obtains, which constitutes the minimum value of the effective radius for a torus milling cutter. Its maximum value, which is theoretically infinite (horizontal machining) is approached when 
                           α
                         tends towards 0 and when 
                           S
                         tends towards 0.

Relation (30) affords an analytical calculation of the effective radius of the cutter at the cutter/workpiece point of contact when machining a free-form surface with a torus milling cutter. It should, however, be recalled here what precisely is the framework of validity for this relation. First, this relation is only valid at the cutter/workpiece point of contact. Indeed, many relations established during computation–(20) and following–are only valid at this point.

The framework of validity of relation (30) is also bounded by the hypotheses adopted during calculation. The most restrictive of these hypotheses is that the feed vector 
                           
                              F
                           
                         is constant at any point of the cutter. As stated previously, this means that locally at least, the cutter is moved by simple translation. Application-wise, this is always true on 3-axis NC machines. For 4- and 5- axis NC machines, this may be true for portions of the paths but this relation cannot be used systematically. In particular, when the axes of rotation of the machine are activated, the relative movement of the cutter in relation to the workpiece comprises a translation and a rotation. In this case, the feed rate cannot be represented by the same vector 
                           
                              F
                           
                         for all points of the cutter.

During the demonstration, restrictions were stated as to the value of components 
                           b
                         and 
                           c
                         of the feed vector 
                           
                              F
                           
                         (Section 2.2.3), on the value of parameter 
                           v
                         (Section 2.2.4) and the values of angles 
                           S
                           ,
                           α
                         and 
                           ψ
                         (Section 2.4). Thus, relation (30) is only demonstrable if 
                           b
                           ≠

                        . Analysis of the mathematical and technological context shows that these different exceptional cases overlap. Indeed, these special cases correspond to quite specific machining configurations. Each of these special configurations will now be analysed, bearing in mind that in all cases, it was possible, during the demonstration, to postulate that

The hypotheses adopted during calculation thus correspond to borderline cases that can be managed regardless of the effective radius. While it is appropriate to take them into account when developing tools based on relation (30), this should not be an obstacle to implementation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Determining the effective radius of the cutter at the cutter/workpiece point of contact through a simple analytical formula as with the one established in relation (30) offers many advantages. Indeed, despite the imposed limits established in Section 3.2, this result offers the perspective of multiple applications that will be further developed in forthcoming publications. Using an analytical formula is always rapider than a numerical procedure. Calculation of the effective radius by an analytical formula instead of the numerical procedures generally used means that applications that were hitherto considered to be hard to contemplate can be developed. For example, thanks to the relation established in (30), an application was readily developed providing a detailed mapping of the effective radius of the tool over the entire surface almost instantaneously.

This mapping tool was then used to conduct a study into the comparative effectiveness of a ball end mill and a torus milling cutter with the same radius when machining a free-form surface from an industrial environment on a 3-axis NC machine tool.

This surface, related to a boat propeller measuring 393 mm in diameter (Fig. 5
                        ), is the extrados of the blade (Fig. 6
                        ).

Whatever the tool path planning strategy envisaged (parallel planes, isoparametrics, and iso-scallop) the step over distance (defined in Section 4.2) must respect the maximum scallop height.

First, it should be recalled that, the step over distance at a point is directly related to the cutter effective radius and, for a given scallop height, that distance has a significant impact on productivity. In what follows, it will be shown how, compared with the results obtained using a ball-end mill, using a torus end cutter can be advantageous in some areas of the workpiece and disadvantageous in others. It will also be seen how the simplicity of the expression established in (30) allows this analysis to be conducted in an extremely short time.

Whatever the tool path planning strategy used, in order to position the cutter so as to respect the maximum scallop height at a given point of the tool path, the distance 
                           d
                         defining its position in the plane perpendicular to the feed direction must first have been calculated (Fig. 7
                        ). Subsequently, the step over distance 
                           
                              
                                 s
                              
                              
                                 o
                                 d
                              
                           
                         can be readily determined as it is directly related to 
                           d
                         by angle 
                           γ
                         characterising the local inclination of the surface in a plane normal to the machining direction. Showing that the step over distance is directly related to the cutter effective radius is thus equivalent to showing that distance 
                           d
                         depends directly on that effective radius.

                         is indeed directly related to the effective radius

                        , especially considering that

                         can be neglected in relation to the other magnitudes. The step over distance

                         thus depends directly on the effective radius

                        . Now, for a given scallop height value (the acceptable tolerance on the surface), the increase in step over distance allows for significant gains in productivity. Consequently, it can be said that this increase in the effective radius of the cutter has a direct impact on productivity.

As seen previously (Section 3.1), the effective radius value can vary between the torus radius

                         in the case of a path perpendicular to the direction of the greatest slope and a value that tends to infinity for horizontal milling. Given the relation between effective radius cutter and step over distance, it is clear that where the effective radius equals 
                           r
                        , using a ball-end cutter instead of a torus milling cutter will allow for greater productivity. However, the closer the path becomes to being horizontal in the direction of the greatest slope, the more the torus milling cutter will prove to be more effective as compared with a ball-end mill of the same diameter. It therefore seems useful to be able to determine, for a given surface, the zones where the torus milling cutter is more effective than the ball-end cutter and vice-versa.

For the ball-end cutter, the effective radius is always equal to its nominal radius 
                           R
                        , whatever may be the feed direction and slope of the surface.

For the torus milling cutter, calculation of the effective radius with the formula established in (30) requires knowledge of the slope of the surface at the point considered and the angle formed by the direction of the greatest slope and the feed direction. To pursue this analysis, a machining direction first needs to be defined that will be parameterised by the angle 
                           θ
                         its projection makes in the plane 
                           
                              (
                              
                                 X
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 Y
                              
                              )
                           
                         with the axis 
                           
                              X
                           
                         of the machine. Then a meshing of the parametric space comprising 256×256 tiles is considered. In the centre of each tile thus constituted, the effective radius of the torus milling cutter can be readily calculated using relation (30). The value of the effective radius thus obtained is then associated with a corresponding colour from a scale of colours varying linearly from 
                           r
                         (blue) to 
                           2
                           R
                         (red). The grid of colours is then applied as texture to the 3D representation of the surface to generate graphic images like those shown in Figs. 8–11
                        
                        
                        
                        .

The entire procedure (calculation and visualisation) was developed using the Java programming language.

                        . In the regions that are predominantly blue, 
                           
                              
                                 R

                           R
                         applies. It can thus be said that in these regions the ball-end mill is more effective than the torus milling cutter. Conversely, in mainly red and green regions, the effective radius of the torus milling cutter is greater than the nominal radius of the ball-end cutter (
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 
                                    eff
                                 
                              
                           
                           >
                           R
                        ); as a result, it can be said that in these regions, the torus milling cutter is more effective than the ball-end cutter.

The calculation time needed to conduct the entire analysis procedure (computation and display) for all the tests conducted always took less than one second. This rapidity in calculation is essentially due to the simplicity of expression of the effective radius (relation (30)).

This simplicity of expression means that tools for analysis, like the one introduced here, can be defined to provide precious help in choosing a machining strategy.

When end milling of free-form surfaces with a torus milling cutter, the effective radius concept is essential to analyse the machining procedure in purely geometrical terms.

The study presented in the present publication enabled the effective radius of a torus milling cutter milling with a translation movement to be expressed. Adopting an original approach, this expression was determined in analytical form without having to resort to geometric approximation. This relation was also analysed and the limits to its validity were studied.

As the expression was relatively simple, it should pave the way for applications that it would be impossible to implement in a reasonable time frame using a numerical approach. As an example, a tool for numerical analysis was presented that could prove useful in pre-project analysis of a procedure for free-form machining using parallel planes.

The possibilities offered by the relation established in the present study are, however, far from being limited to the example adopted here. Due to it being so easy to implement, the analytical formula defined here to compute the effective radius may readily be integrated into recently developed “intelligent CAM” processes [24,25].

In forthcoming publications it will be seen how analytical expression of the cutter effective radius can find many different applications in studies into the machining of free-form surfaces with a torus milling cutter that adopt a geometric approach.
