                  Ion channels are integral membrane proteins that are responsible for controlling the flow of ions across the cell. There are various biological functions that are performed by different types of ion channels. Therefore for new drug discovery it is necessary to develop a novel computational intelligence techniques based approach for the reliable prediction of ion channels families and their subfamilies. In this paper random forest based approach is proposed to predict ion channels families and their subfamilies by using sequence derived features. Here, seven feature vectors are used to represent the protein sample, including amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, correlation features, composition, transition and distribution and pseudo amino acid composition. The minimum redundancy and maximum relevance feature selection is used to find the optimal number of features for improving the prediction performance. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 100%, 98.01%, 91.5%, 93.0%, 92.2%, 78.6%, 95.5%, 84.9%, MCC values of 1.00, 0.92, 0.88, 0.88, 0.90, 0.79, 0.91, 0.81 and ROC area values of 1.00, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.95, 0.99 and 0.96 using 10-fold cross validation to predict the ion channels and non-ion channels, voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels, four subfamilies (calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride) of voltage gated ion channels, and four subfamilies of ligand gated ion channels and predict subfamilies of voltage gated calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride ion channels respectively.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Ion channels are membrane proteins that are responsible for electrical signaling by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane. These are the prominent component of nervous systems. Ion channels are classified by gating that is used for opening and closing the channels. The voltage gated ion channels are open and close based on the voltage gradient across the cell membrane, while ligand gated ion channels open and close based on the ligand binding of the ion channels. The voltage gated ion channels play an important role in generation and propagation of the nerve impulse and in cell homeostasis (Bezanilla, 2005). The dysfunction of ion channels plays an important role in the development of various diseases such as hypertension, defective insulin secretion, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological diseases such as epilepsy and even developmental defects such as osteopetrosis (Jentsch et al., 2004). So it is necessary to know about the structure and function of the ion channels to develop a new drug for these diseases. Ion channels play an important target for antiepileptic drug design, antihypertensive and antipsychotics disorder such as schizophrenia (Abernethy and Schwartz, 1999; Yogeeswari et al., 2004). Currently, there are various computational intelligence techniques based approaches that have been proposed to predict membrane proteins (Shen et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2007; Chou and Shen, 2007a; Zhao and Ding, 2008; Wang and Yang, 2010; Huang et al., 2014). Similarly various computational intelligence techniques based approaches have been proposed to predict nuclear receptor (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004a; Cai and Li, 2005; Gao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012; Wang and Xiao, 2014) and G-protein coupled receptor (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004b, 2005; Gao and Wang, 2006; Gu et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2010).

However, few papers reported computational intelligence techniques based methods to predict ion channels and their types. The authors of the papers (Willett et al., 2007; Pourbasheer et al., 2009) have proposed computational intelligence techniques based method to predict the activity of ion channel proteins. In the paper (Liu et al., 2006) a support vector machine based method has been proposed to predict five types of voltage gated potassium channels and obtained accuracy of 98%. The authors of the paper (Saha et al., 2006) have proposed a support vector machine based method to predict four types of voltage gated ion channels by using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition and obtained overall accuracy of 97.78%. In the paper (Chen and Lin, 2012) a support vector machine based method has been proposed to predict voltage gated potassium channel subfamilies by using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition and obtained overall accuracy of 93.09%. In the paper (Lin and Ding, 2011) the authors proposed a support vector machine based method to predict ion channels and their types by using dipeptide mode of pseudo amino acid composition and obtained overall accuracy of 86.6% to discriminate ion channels from non-ion channels, overall accuracy of 92.6% to classify voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels and an overall accuracy of 87.8% to predict four types of voltage gated ion channels.

In this paper a random forest based method has been proposed to predict ion channels and their types by using sequence derived properties of a protein. In this paper 857 sequence derived features with seven features vectors such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, correlation, and composition, transition and distribution and pseudo amino acid composition are used to predict the ion channels and their types. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) based feature selection is used to improve the predictive accuracy. In this paper the proposed method used four level strategies to predict ion channels and their types. First, it is determined that protein sequence is ion channel or non-ion channel. Second, if protein is classified as ion channels then the method classify the protein into two groups viz voltage gated ion channels or ligand gated ion channels. Third, it is classified into the subfamilies of voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels. Fourth, it determines the subfamilies of calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride voltage gated ion channels. The two parameter of random forest the size of random subset of features (mtry) and the number of trees in the forest (ntree) are used to decrease the error rate. Therefore each of the four levels is developed using a random forest classifier with optimized value of ntree and mtry.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

In this paper the sequence of the ion channels is extracted from the Uniport (http://www.uniprot.org), ligand gated ion channels database (http://lenoverelab.org/LGICdb/LGICdb.php), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein), voltage-gated potassium channels database (http://vkcdb.biology.ualberta.ca/) and KChannelDB (http://www.receptors.org/KCN). Here all the 722 non-ion channels proteins are selected from Uniport database with the keyword NOT ion channels. The CD-HIT (Huang et al., 2010) server is used to exclude those protein/peptide sequences from the benchmark datasets that had ≤50%, ≥40% or ≥25% pairwise sequence identity to any other sample in the same subset. However; if such a stringent criterion deduces that number of proteins would be too few to have statistical significance (Chou and Shen, 2007b; Zhu et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2008). The description of the datasets is shown in Table 1
                     .

In this paper, to fully characterize protein sequence seven feature vectors are used to represent the protein sample, including amino acid composition (AAC), dipeptide composition (DC), correlation factors (CF), and composition, transition and distribution (CTD) of physiochemical properties and pseudo amino acid composition (PAAC) with total of 857 features are extracted from the PROFEAT server (Rao et al., 2011) for the classification of ion channels and their types. The brief descriptions of these prominent features are given as follows:

The amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid in the protein sequence. It is effectively used by various authors of the papers for the prediction of nuclear receptor (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004a), subcellular localization (Hua and Sun, 2001; Wang et al., 2005) and enzyme functions (Nasibov and Kandemir-Cavas, 2009).

Total 20 features are calculated corresponding to each amino acid.

An amino acid composition provides only sequence information but ignore the sequence order information so dipeptide composition of a protein is used to transform a variable length protein sequence to a fixed 400 feature vectors. It is effectively used by various authors of the papers for the prediction of ATP binding sites (Mbah, 2014), subcellular localization (Garg et al., 2005; Huang and Li, 2004) and prediction of G-protein coupled receptors (Bhasin and Raghava, 2005).

For a given protein sequence a correlation features are defined by using the distribution of amino acid properties along the sequence. It is effectively used by various authors of the papers for the classification of G-protein coupled receptors (Li et al., 2010) and DNA binding proteins (Fang et al., 2008). In this paper the normalized value of eight sequence properties: hydrophobicity, average flexibility, free energy of solution in water, polarizability, residue accessible surface area in tripeptide, residue volume, steric parameter and relative mutability are used to calculate these features. The normalized correlation features can be calculated by using

So in this paper total 8×30=240 correlation features will be calculated.

These features are effectively used by various authors of the paper (Li et al., 2010) for the classification of G-protein coupled receptors. For calculating these features the 20 amino acid of a protein sequence is divided into three groups: polar, neutral and hydrophobicity by using the seven physiochemical properties: hydrophobicity, normal Vander Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, charge secondary structure and solvent accessibility. So for each property value every amino acid is represented by three indexes 1, 2 and 3 according to one of three groups. The composition, transition and distribution features are calculated by using

It calculates the distribution of each property for 1st residue, 25% residue, 50% residue, 75% residue and 100% residue respectively for each group in the amino acid sequence.

So in this paper total 7×3=21 composition features, 7×3=21 transition features and 7×3×5=105 distribution features are calculated.

It is effectively used by various authors of the papers for the prediction of nuclear receptors (Gao et al., 2009), DNA binding sites (Lin et al., 2011a), subcellular localization (Shi et al., 2007; Li and Li, 2008; Ma and Gu, 2010), enzyme functions (Wang et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2006) and G-protein-coupled receptors (Gao and Wang, 2006; Gu et al., 2010). In this paper the pseudo amino acid composition is calculated by using the three properties: hydrophobicity (H
                           1), hydrophilicity (H
                           2) and side chain mass (M) of each 20 amino acid to represent the sequence order correlation between all of residues which are separated by 1–30 residues. Here the first 20 components reflect the effects of the amino acid composition and the remaining 30 components reflect the effect of sequence order. The correlation between these three properties is calculated as

In this paper, the mRMR (Peng et al., 2005) a filter method is used to select a feature subset. It has been already used by the authors of the paper (Peng et al., 2010) for the classification of G-protein coupled receptors. The brief description of mRMR feature selection is as follows:

The minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection method select a feature subset in which each subset of feature has the minimal redundancy with other features and maximal relevance with target class. In this method the subset of features is obtained by calculating the mutual information between the features themselves and between the features and the class variables. For binary classification the class variable ck
                         is 1 or 2. The mutual information MI(x,y) of two features x and y is calculated as

For the classification of ion channels and their types, here a random forest based classifier available in Weka 3.7.11 (Hall et al., 2009) software tool has been used. Random forest classifier (Breiman, 2001) used an ensemble of random trees. Each of the random trees is generated by using a bootstrap sample data. At each node of the tree a subset of feature with highest information gain is selected from a random subset of entire features. Thus random forest used bagging as well as feature selection to generate the trees. Once a forest is generated every tree participates in classification by voting to a class. The final classification is based on the majority voting of a particular class. It has been already used by the authors of the paper (Nagao et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2011b) for the prediction of enzyme function and DNA binding proteins respectively.

The error rate of random forest depends on the strength of each tree in the forest and the correlation between any two trees. Therefore increasing the strength of each tree and reducing the correlation between the trees may necessary to decrease the error rate of the forest. The two parameter of random forest the size of random subset of features (mtry) and the number of trees in the forest (ntree) are used to decrease the error rate. Increasing the value of ntree reduces the out-of-bag (OOB) error rate of random forest as well as correlation between trees but possibilities of over-fitting. The mtry value should be much smaller than total number of features. So it is necessary to obtain an optimal value of mtry and ntree to obtain the lowest out-of-bag error and higher accuracy. In this paper we have optimized the values of ntree and mtry at every level to improve the prediction accuracy.

In this paper, the proposed method used four level strategies to predict ion channels and their types. The complete procedure of the proposed method with optimized parameter for the prediction of ion channels and their types is illustrated in Fig. 2 and the steps are as follows:

Step 1. Produce seven feature vectors with 857 features that represent a protein sequence.

Step 2. Select optimal number of features with minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithms.

Step 3. Apply random forest classifier with optimized value of ntree and mtry for each of the four levels for the prediction of ion channels families and their subfamilies are as follows: firstly, it is discriminated that protein sequence is ion channel or non-ion channel. Secondly, if protein is classified as ion channels then the method classify the protein into two group viz voltage gated ion channels or ligand gated ion channels. Thirdly, it classifies the subfamilies of voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels. Finally, it also determines the subfamilies of calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride voltage gated ion channels.

In this paper, 10-fold cross validation is used to measure the performance of random forest classifier. In K-fold cross validation the dataset of all proteins is partitioned into K subsets where one subset is used for validation and remaining K-1 subsets are used for training. This process is repeated for K times so that every subset is used once as a test data. Here, 3-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold cross validations are used to predict the ion channels and non-ion channels, voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels, subfamilies of voltage gated ion channels, and ligand gated ion channels and predict subfamilies of voltage gated calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride ion channels respectively and it is observed that the in most of the cases the minimum variance in accuracy is obtained by using 10-fold cross validation (see Fig. 1
                     
                     (a–g)).

In this paper accuracy (ACC), receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) are used to measure the performance. Accuracy is measured by the following formulae.

The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) is a graph that shows the performance of a classifier by plotting TP rate versus FP rate at various threshold settings. Area under ROC curve (AUC) of a classifier is the probability that the classifier ranks a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance.

In this paper, a random forest classifier is proposed to be used for the prediction of various ion channels and their subfamilies. The parameters ntree and mtry to be used by the random forest classifier are chosen experimentally in such a manner that minimizes the out-of-bag (OOB) error. The OOB is calculated with different values of ntree and mtry and it is observed that the random forest classifier is associated with minimum OOB error for ntree values of 200 and mtry values of 15 for the discrimination between voltage gated and ligand gated ion channels. For the classification of subfamilies of voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels the ntree and mtry values are 150 and 07 respectively. For the classification of subfamilies of voltage gated calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride ion channels the ntree and mtry values are 150 and 15 respectively (see Figs. 3–6
                     
                      
                     
                     ). For partitioning of the datasets into train and test sets and evaluating the performance of the proposed model the 10-fold cross-validations are used. In subsequent subsections the results and performance analysis of the proposed model for the prediction of ion channels and their types are presented and discussed. The performance analysis of the proposed model is proposed for different chosen features of the original datasets for each cases as well as for the reduced datasets for each cases after selecting minimum redundant and maximal relevant features after apply mRMR feature selection method.

To predict the ion channels and non-ion channels, a random forest is evaluated with different combination of feature vectors and it is observed that the performance of the classifier is improved by using the combination of features vectors (see Table 2
                        ). Further, the accuracy and MCC are evaluated for different number of features selected by mRMR algorithms and it is observed that the 100% accuracy is obtained with best 50 features for discrimination between ion channels and non-ion channels (see Table 2). The best 50 features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm are used with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Naïve Bayes classifier to discriminate ion channels and non-ion channels. The accuracy, MCC and ROC area are evaluated for different classifiers with best 50 features for prediction of ion channels and non-ion channels (see Table 2). The complete analysis of results is shown in Table 2.

From the analysis of Table 2 it is observed that the performance of random forest classifier is improved by using the mixture of the feature vectors. The proposed method provides accuracy of 100%, MCC of 1.00 and ROC area of 1.00 for the prediction of ion channels and non-ion channels with the best 50 features selected by mRMR algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper random forest based approach has been proposed to predict ion channels families and their subfamilies by using sequence derived features. The minimum redundancy and maximum relevance feature selection was used to find the optimal number of features for improving the prediction performance. The results show that the mRMR feature selection algorithm reduces the number of input feature vectors by selecting the important features and improve the overall accuracy and MCC. In the 10-fold cross validation the proposed method has achieved an overall accuracy of 100%, 98.01%, 91.5%, 93.0%, 92.2%, 78.6%, 95.5%, 84.9%, MCC values of 1.00, 0.92, 0.88, 0.88, 0.90, 0.79, 0.91, 0.81 and ROC area values of 1.00, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.95, 0.99 and 0.96 to predict ion channels and non-ion channels, voltage gated ion channels and ligand gated ion channels, four types (calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride) of voltage gated ion channels, ligand gated ion channels and predict subfamilies of voltage gated calcium, potassium, sodium and chloride ion channels respectively. The high accuracies, MCC and ROC area values indicate that the proposed method may be useful for the prediction of ion channels families and their subfamilies.
