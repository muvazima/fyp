@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of extracting speech signals from noisy observations has been firstly studied in [1] and [2] for stationary and non stationary signals, respectively. These last studies have given solutions that lead to the resolution of many practical problems in many applications, such as automatic speech recognition, speech enhancement, hand-free telephony, and teleconferencing [3,4]. The problem of separating non-stationary signals cannot be resolved for a single microphone without further information of the signal and noise properties [5]. Furthermore, if the spectrum of speech and noise are overlapping, then cancelling the noise will introduce important distortions in the enhanced signals [6,7]. It was shown that when two or more microphones are used, further information on signal and noise properties can improve their separation [8]. For example, when two microphones configuration is used, a classical adaptive noise canceller (ANC) scheme with noise reference signal is often employed [9]. This is not the real situation, because in practise, the noise microphone also gets the signal as well as the noise and the automatic noise canceller ends up removing the desired signal with the noise [10,11]. The loosely spaced microphones configuration does not progress any more the situation, because very long filter lengths are needed and this leads to excess mean square error (MSE) [12,13].

There are a number of applications (i.e., where there is a natural acoustic barrier for sound signals) between microphones that the basic adaptive filtering method will work, but these situations are not so commonly met in daily office or outdoor situations [14,15].

Over the last few years, several speech signal enhancement and acoustic noise reduction algorithms have been proposed [16]. A particular attention has been reserved to the situation when significant leakage of the primary signal occurred onto the noise reference, this is mainly due to the primary and reference microphone spacing [17]. This problem decreases the efficiency of the noise cancellation and also generates alteration of the signal components in the output speech signals that are processed by these algorithms. It is proven in [18], that the highest signal to noise ratio (SNR) obtained at the output of such a noise reduction algorithm is equal to the noise to signal ratio present on the reference input. However, some enhancement is achievable if the primary signal is alternating and the filter is adapted only during periods when the primary signal is not present, but this relies on an efficient detection of the primary signal [19]. Newly, the blind source separation structure have been also used to optimally separate speech signal and noise from a noisy observation than can be in most general case convolutedly mixed [19]. These techniques of BSS have been used in fullband and subband configurations and in time-domain and frequency-domain also. Furthermore, much adaptive and non adaptive techniques and algorithms have been proposed with the BSS structure to improve convergence speed of removing the acoustic noise components, the excess steady state values, and the quality of the enhanced speech signal, and often used to improve the intelligibility of the corrupted speech signal [20]. We recall here that two suitable types of blind separation (BSS) structures named forward and backward, are frequently used in the last decade to overcome the problem of signal leakages [5,21].

In this work, we focus our interest on the forward BSS (FBSS) and we propose a new frequency domain symmetric adaptive decorrelation (FD-SAD) algorithm to estimate and suppress coherent noise components from very noisy observations. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the used simplified mixing model for generating the test signals. In Section 3, we describe the FBSS structure and its optimal resolution. In Section 4, we present the formulation of our proposed algorithm. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm and its time domain version (TD-SAD) are presented in Section 5, and, finally, we conclude this work in Section 6.

In this section, we present the full acoustics echo path that generate the convolutive mixing signals, then the simplified model of this convolutive mixing signal will be presented.

In Fig. 1
                        , we present a full two-channel convolutive mixing model with two punctual signals, g
                        1(n) and g
                        2(n), and two microphones that generates two noisy signals m
                        1(n) and m
                        2(n). The functions f
                        11, f
                        12, f
                        22 and f
                        21 present the impulse responses (IR) of each channel. In this model, the functions f
                        11 and f
                        22 are called the direct IR paths, and f
                        12 and f
                        21 are the cross-coupling effects between the two channels. In addition, η
                        1(n)  and η
                        2(n)  are a diffuse noise components at the noisy observation m
                        1(n) and m
                        2(n), respectively [5].

According to Fig. 1, the noisy observation m
                        1(n) and m
                        2(n) are measured as follows:

In this paper, we use a simplified version of this model that is consistent with the physic and represent adequately the microphones spacing as in actual situation. This model is presented in the next sub-section.

In the full mixing model of two-channel that is presented above, we suppose that the source signal number are smaller or equal to the microphones number, and the original signals are statistically independent [5]. In this paper, we consider the particular situation of two sources and two microphones. The simplified mixing model that we adopt in this paper is shown in Fig. 2
                         and generates the mixing signals m
                        1(n) and m
                        2(n). This simplified convolutive mixing model is validated in theory and practice [5]. In this paper, we suppose that the sources are a speech signal

                        21(ω) represent the cross-coupling effects between the channels. The simplified model is given by Fig. 2.

In practice, the cross-filters w12(n) and w21(n) are updated by using adaptive algorithms. In the steady state when the two adaptive filters tend asymptotically to the theoretical solutions, the two post-filters P1(ω) and P2(ω) lead to the same ideal solution:

For the computation of these post-filters, it is proposed in [19] techniques that estimate theses post-filters directly and adaptively. In this paper, the post-filters are discard from the study, and since we are interested in the reduction of the speech distortion, we focus only on the output u
                        1(n) that corresponds to the enhanced and denoised speech signal.

In Fig. 4
                     , we show a block diagram of the proposed frequency domain symmetric adaptive decorrelation (FD-SAD) algorithm. In this Figure, we show that the observation m
                     1(n) and m
                     2(n) are firstly transformed in the frequency domain by a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) at each frame k and then we obtain the frequency observation versions M
                     1(ω, k) and M
                     2(ω, k). These two observations are used to compute the STFT of the filtering error U
                     1(ω, k) and U
                     2(ω, k) that are given as follows:

As it is shown in Fig. 4, this technique is implemented with the forward BSS structure. The new proposed algorithm is based on a frequency domain implementation of the adaptive filters W
                     12(ω, k) and W
                     21(ω, k), which is updated by an adaptive algorithm on a frame-by-frame basis. To update the coefficients of the cross-adaptive filters W
                     12(ω, k) and W
                     21(ω, k), we have used the frequency domain LMS algorithm (FLMS) [21]. For each frame k, we propagate the following equation:

From Fig. 4, we can well see that the signals at the outputs of the proposed algorithm are obtained within a permutation. However, one can get the useful signal at the appropriate output by taking advantage of the non-stationary of speech, which is basically an intermittent signal [5,20]. In this work, in order to get the enhanced speech signal at the output U
                     1(ω, k), and the noise components at the output U
                     2(ω, k), we have used a voice activity detector (VAD) that controls, in the frequency domain, the convergence of the two cross-adaptive filters. The control is done by the use of a voice activity detector (VAD) to control the adaptation of the filters: i.e., the filter W
                     21(ω, k) is adapted during noise-only periods, whereas the filter W
                     12(ω, k) is adapted only during voice activity periods. This VAD-controlled adaptive scheme yields de-noised speech at the output u
                     1(n), and achieves good convergence of the adaptive algorithms. During noise-only periods, the structure controlled by the VAD behaves as an ANC, as described in [20].

Relations (18), (19), and (20) show clearly that the adaptive filters W
                     12(ω, k) and W
                     21(ω, k) are updated alternatively. This alternation mechanism of adaptation allows extracting speech signal from the output u
                     1(n) and the noise at u
                     2(n).

As we are interesting only on the speech enhancement signal, we will focus only on the output u
                     1(n). The last step of the proposed algorithm is the restoration of the time domain version of the speech signal, we have used an overlap-add technique to reconvert the frequency domain version of the enhanced speech signal U
                     1(ω, k) to the time domain [21–23], i.e. u
                     1(n). The proposed algorithm scheme is given in Fig. 5.
                     
                  

In order to evaluate the performances properties of the proposed algorithm which is presented in the previous Section, we have done intensive experiments in terms of the following objective criteria:

                        
                           (i)
                           The segmental signal to noise ratio (SegSNR),

The cepstral distance (CD),

The segmental mean square error (SegMSE),

The system mismatches (SM).

Furthermore, we compare our proposed algorithm with the following algorithms of the state of the art:

                        
                           (i)
                           The time domain symmetric adaptive decorrelation (TD-SAD) algorithm, which is the time-domain version of our proposed algorithm [9].

The two-channel variable-step-size forward adaptive (2C-VSSF) algorithm [10].

The two-sensor Gauss–Seidel fast affine projection (TS-GSFAP) algorithm [11].

The comparison is done in the configuration of very noisy observations and two loosely spaced microphones. To represent appropriately the effect of the distance between the two microphones on the characteristics of the signals, we have used the specific model proposed in [5,19] which yields simulated impulse responses f12 and f21 [The sampling frequency is fs=8kHz; the corresponding reverberation time is 30.8ms; the length of the impulse responses is 
                        
                           L
                           =
                           256
                        
                     ]. The punctual speech signal is a sentence of about 40 seconds; the punctual noise source is a USASI (United State standard institute now ANSI), this noise type is stationary with speech like spectrum that we usually used to test the convergence speed of algorithms.

These two punctual sources are taken form AURORA data-base. For the input signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), it is selected to be equal to 0dB at the two observations m
                     1(n) and m
                     2(n). We recall here that this proposed specific model in [19] highlights the physical phenomenon of microphones spacing and allow representing the behaviour of the BSS algorithms in real situations. In all simulations, we have considered the case of loosely spaced microphone where the post-filters effect is neglected [19].

This simulation is done to show the time evolution of the output speech signal s
                        1(n) obtained by the four algorithms, i.e. (i) TD-SAD, (ii) TC-VSSF, (iii) TS-GSFAP, and (iv) the proposed frequency-domain symmetric adaptive decorrelation (FD-SAD) algorithm. The simulation parameters of each algorithm are summarized in Table 1
                        . In this experiment, the real impulse responses f
                        12(n) and f
                        21(n) have been constructed with a random noise variance of 0.5 according to the proposed model in [19]. The time evolution of the source signals, the mixtures, and the obtained output speech signals with the TD-SAD, 2C-VSSF, TS-GSFAP, and the proposed FD-SAD algorithm are given by Fig. 6.
                        
                     

From this result, we can only say that the four adaptive algorithms behave very well and allow to remove fully the noise at the output u
                        1(n). Also, we conclude that our proposed algorithm have successfully applied in the field of acoustic noise reduction and speech enhancement application.

In the following Sections, we will quantify the performances of each algorithm in terms of: (i) the System Mismatch (SM), (ii) Segmental Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SegSNR), the Segmental Mean Square Error (SegMSE), and the Cepstral Distance (CD) criteria. Note that this result was obtained thanks to the use of a manual voice activity detector (VAD) system as explained before.

In order to quantify the adaptive behaviour of the proposed FD-SAD algorithm in comparison with the TD-SAD, 2C-VSSF, and the TS-FSFAP algorithms, we have used the system mismatch (SM) criterion which is evaluated for each algorithm according to the following expression:

                        21 are the adaptive and real filters of the Forward BSS structure, ‖.‖ symbolizes the Euclidian norm, and log is the logarithm of basis 10. This experiment is carried out in terms of SM criterion. This simulation uses the same parameters of each algorithm as given in Table 1, except for the adaptive and real filters that is taken equal to L
                        =256 coefficients. The obtained results of the SM criterion for each algorithm are reported on Fig. 7
                        . From this figure, we note a faster convergence speed of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the other ones in the transient regime especially when the adaptive filters length is selected high, i.e. L ≥ 256 coefficients. However, we have also noted a similar weak steady state of the TS-GSFAP and the proposed FD-SAD algorithms in comparison with the TD-SAD and the 2C-VSSF ones. The good behaviour of the 2C-VSSF algorithm in the steady state regime allows to conclude that the variable stepsize techniques can also be used to improve the behaviour of the TS-GSFAP and the proposed FD-SAD algorithm. In conclusion, the proposed FD-SAD algorithm have shown the best convergence speed performance thanks to the frequency conversion of the algorithm and has also shown a poor steady states values that can be improved by the use of a frequency variable step-sizes, this point could be developed in further work on this same proposed FD-SAD algorithm.

To quantify the noise reduction performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with its temporal version, i.e. TD-SAD, and 2C-VSSF, TS-GSFAP algorithms, we have evaluated the segmental SNR (SegSNR) given by (22), where s(n)and u
                        1(n) represent respectively the original speech signal and the enhanced one. The parameter Q is the mean averaging value of the SegSNR, i.e.

The simulations parameters of each algorithms are given in Table 1, with L=256 coefficients. We have used five types of reel noises, i.e. USASI (United state of America standard institute, now ANSI), white noise, street noise, babble noise, and F16 aircraft noise. All these noises are taken from AURORA database, sampled at 8kHz and coded on 16bits. The input SNRs at each algorithm are selected to be equal to −6dB, 0dB, and 6dB.


                        Table 2
                         and Fig. 8
                         show the obtained results of the SegSNR criterion values with the four algorithms, i.e. TD-SAD, 2C-VSSF, TS-GSFAP, and the proposed algorithm. From this result, a good behaviour of the FD-SAD algorithm, in comparison with the other algorithms is noted. However, this good performance of the proposed algorithm is motivated by the fact that this algorithm has the faster convergence speed performance, which allows reaching high SegSNR values.

However, in the steady state regime, we have noted a slight degradation of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the other algorithms. This problem can be resolved by using a frequency variable step-size that depends especially on the SNR values.

We propose to use a segmental mean square error (SegMSE) criterion to show the behaviour of the proposed frequency domain FD-SAD algorithm in comparison with its time domain version, i.e. TD-SAD algorithm, 2C-VSSF, and the TS-GSFAP algorithm in acoustic noise cancellation aptitude. As the output speech signal u1(n) is controlled by the adaptive filters w21(n), we concentrate on the evaluation of the SegMSE criterion calculated on the output of adaptive this filter, i.e. w21(n) for each algorithm. This SegMSE criterion is given by the following relation:

We note that D represent the time averaging frame length of the output s1(n). The presence of the voice activity detector (VAD of relation (20)) in the update relation (19) of the adaptive filter w21(n) for each algorithm means that the SegMSE criterion is estimated only in the absence speech periods, or alternatively, it is estimated only when the acoustic noise components are presents alone thanks to the intermittence property that of the speech signal.

The simulation parameters of each algorithm are summarized in Table 1, except for the adaptive filter length that is taken equal to L=256 coefficients. We have carried intensive experiment with the four algorithms by using the same simulations parameters that are given in the previous Section 5.4, i.e. four noise types, taken from AURORA data-base, three input SNRs, i.e. - 6dB, 0dB, and 6dB. The obtained results of these intensive experiments are summarized in Table 3
                        , and shown in Fig. 9
                        . According to the obtained results of Table 3 and Fig. 9, we can easily see that the proposed FD-SAD algorithm behaves more efficiently the other algorithms. This is true for all of the other noise types that we have used in simulations. However, we have noted that the 2C-VSSF algorithm have shown very competitive performances that are very close to those obtained with the proposed algorithm. In the other hand, the time domain TD-SAD algorithm has shown good the smallest performance in comparison with the other ones. For the TS-GSFAP algorithm, its performances are best than that of the TD-SAD, but very close to that of the 2C-VSSF algorithm. All these remarks lead us to thank to can improve the proposed algorithm by using frequency variable step-sizes to enhance the mean square error (MSE) behaviour.

We have evaluated the distortion of the output speech signal of the proposed algorithm by the use of the Cepstral Distance (CD) performance criterion. This CD is estimated by the log-spectrum distance between the original speech signal s(n) and the output of the proposed algorithm u1(n). It is given by the following relation:

In this Section, we have evaluated the CD criterion for the four algorithms, i.e. TD-SAD, 2C-VSSF, TS-GSFAP, and the proposed one under the same simulation conditions than those used in the two above sections i.e. Sections 5.3, and 5.4. The obtained results of this simulation for four noise types and four algorithms, and three input SNRs, are summarized in Table 4
                        , and shown by Fig. 10
                        . We can see from the results analysis of Table 4 and Fig. 10 that the proposed frequency domain algorithm have shown the best performance in term of CD values, this means that the intelligibility of processed the output speech signal is more improved (more intelligible) than the output speech signals obtained with the others algorithms. Also, this results confirm that the frequency implementation of the proposed algorithm doesn't improve only the output segmental SNR and the MSE but also improve the intelligibility of the signal in term of the cepstral distance. This good behaviour also show that the frequency domain algorithms distorted less the speech signal when the aliasing between the frames is small. This result shows well that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms, and the enhanced output speech signals, obtained with the proposed algorithm, sound much clearer with much less speech distortion than the other ones. This good property makes of the proposed algorithm a good adaptive algorithm alternative for this type of application, i.e. acoustic noise reduction and speech quality and intelligibility enhancement.

In this paper, we have proposed a newly frequency symmetric adaptive decorrelation (FD-SAD) algorithm for speech enhancement and noise reduction applications. The comparison between the proposed algorithm and its time domain (TD-SAD) version, the variable step-size forward (2C-VSSF) algorithm, and the two-sensors Gauss-seidel fast affine projection (TS-GSFAP) algorithm, has shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the system mismatch in the transient regime, the segmental SNR (SegSNR), the segmental mean square error (SegMSE), and the cepstral distance (CD) criteria. All of these objective criteria have proven the efficiency and the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the other state of the art algorithms. However, we have noted that the proposed algorithm behaves poorly in terms of the system mismatch criterion. This poor behaviour is the only drawback of the proposed algorithm that leads to a degradation of its steady state values when the adaptive filters length is selected high. Also, through the presented results, we have noted that the variable step-size forward (2C-VSSF) algorithm has shown a very close performance to our proposed algorithm in terms of SegSNR, SegMSE, and CD criteria, but it has a small convergence speed performance with the system mismatch (SM) criterion. In conclusion, the combination of the variable step-size techniques that is used in the TD-SAD algorithm can be a good solution of the small steady-state of the proposed algorithm. As a perspective for this work, we can propose in a future work a variable step-size frequency version of our proposed FD-SAD algorithm. In conclusion, we can say that the proposed FD-SAD algorithm in this paper can be a good alternative solution to the existing noise reduction algorithms when the length of the adaptive filters is selected high.
