                  During a mass casualty incident (MCI), to which one of several area hospitals should each victim be sent? These decisions depend on resource availability (both transport and care) and the survival probabilities of patients. This paper focuses on the critical time period immediately following the onset of an MCI and is concerned with how to effectively evacuate victims to the different area hospitals in order to provide the greatest good to the greatest number of patients while not overwhelming any single hospital. This resource-constrained triage problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program, which we call the Severity-Adjusted Victim Evacuation (SAVE) model. It is compared with a model in the extant literature and also against several current policies commonly used by the so-called incident commander. The experiments indicate that the SAVE model provides a marked improvement over the commonly used ad-hoc policies and an existing model. Two possible implementation strategies are discussed along with managerial conclusions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Effective disaster management has gained the attention of the public due to numerous recent natural catastrophes. However, in order to succeed at achieving effective disaster management, the definition of the term “disaster” must first be agreed upon. Surprisingly, experts in the disaster management field disagree on an exact definition of the term. However, several common elements appear in most definitions. This paper utilizes the definition of a mass casualty incident (MCI) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the terms disaster and MCI are used interchangeably throughout. The WHO defines a mass casualty incident (MCI) as “an incident which generates more patients at one time than locally available resources can manage using routine procedures” (WHO, 2007). Examples of MCI include disasters due to natural hazards (e.g., floods, earthquakes, etc.) or manmade disasters such as a bioterrorism attack.

Effective response to a disaster, whether man-made or natural, follows a cyclical, four-step process. These steps include:
                        
                           1.
                           Preparedness.

Response.

Recovery.

Mitigation.

Preparedness refers to the actions taken before the disaster to allow effective response. Response refers to the emergency actions taken just before, during, and just after the onset of a disaster to reduce casualties, damage, and disruption. The actions taken after a disaster to repair, rebuild, and restore community life to normalcy is the recovery stage. Mitigation refers to the actions taken both after one disaster and before another to reduce the physical impacts of hazards on a community.

The focus here is on the critical time period immediately following the onset of an MCI. After victims have been rescued from immediate danger, they must be triaged and evacuated to a definitive care facility, such as a hospital. The focus of care must be on the population as a whole rather than the individual, providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people (Frykberg, 2005). Triage plays a vital role during this process. It is the process of assigning treatment and evacuation priorities to victims of an MCI and is used to guide the allocation of the limited health care resources. In effect, it helps determine who will be transported to which hospital. (For more details on the principles and practice of triage see Frykberg (2005).)

Once the casualties have been triaged, the orderly distribution of victims among different hospitals must take place. However, managing the patient load during a disaster presents a major challenge to hospitals and disaster response managers. Patient allocation decisions are typically made by the so-called “Incident Command” based on resource availability, situation details (mechanism of injury, etc.), and triage data. In urban areas, the possibility of sending victims to one of several hospitals adds an additional layer of complexity to the decision process. Initially the goal is to move all victims out of the immediate vicinity of the disaster scene to a casualty collection area. The location of the casualty collection area should be situated away from the disaster scene due to the dangers it can pose to both health care providers and the survivors (Frykberg, 2002). Patients sent to the casualty collection area are triaged, treated for immediately life threatening injuries, and transported to area hospitals.

In practice, managing patient allocation across a group of hospitals is challenging. Often the nearest hospitals are quickly overloaded. There are at least two reasons why the nearest hospitals become overwhelmed. First, critically injured patients require medical intervention as soon as possible. In many cases this necessitates that these patients go to the nearest hospital. Second, decisions regarding the allocation of patients are complex and response managers do not have the ability to dedicate large amounts of resources to that task. An easy allocation scheme for the incident commander is to continue to send victims to the nearest hospital until that hospital says it can no longer accommodate new patients.

In order to avoid this geographic effect, a systematic method of distribution of casualties from the casualty collection area among available hospitals should occur in a manner that avoids overloading any single facility. One suggested approach within the urban setting is “leap-frogging” of hospitals by sequential loads of transported casualties (Jacobs, Goody, & Sinclair, 1983). For example, send every third victim to a specific more remote hospital. The problem with this type of allocation scheme is that it is often implemented in a static fashion as given in the example. However, all disasters are dynamic in nature. As new information concerning the disaster and the supporting hospitals becomes available, the allocation mechanism should adjust to this new information.

No matter the mechanism, allocation of victims to several facilities will depend on the overall objective. The overriding theme within both the disaster management literature and the disaster management community is to “do the most good for the most number of people”. This objective is not precise. The two prevailing methods that attempt to operationalize this vague objective are START (simple triage and rapid treatment) and SALT (sort, assess, life-saving interventions, treatment and/or transport). Both START and SALT label victims into four broad categories which are intended to be indicative of the how quickly a victim should receive care. Green/Minor victims are considered ambulatory and care can be delayed for hours. Yellow/Delayed victims generally cannot self-evacuate and the goal is for care to begin within an hour. Red/Immediate victims have life-threatening injuries and require care immediately. Black/Deceased victims are mortally wounded and no care is required. One major drawback to both of these triage methodologies is that the prioritization and resource allocation within the Immediate and Delayed categories are often subjective. Researchers have looked at the effectiveness of START (Kahn, Schultz, Miller, & Anderson, 2009) and compared the two methodologies (Cone et al., 2009; Lerner et al., 2008). Both triage methods are deficient in terms of not precisely defining what is meant by “the most good for the most people”. The limitations of the current triage methods motivated the development of the Sacco Triage Method (STM) (Sacco et al., 2005). The STM work does provide a precise definition for the objective and operationalizes it as the expected number of survivors. The work presented here builds upon and enhances the STM model.

The proposed model, which we call the SAVE (Severity-Adjusted Victim Evacuation) model, provides several major contributions. First, SAVE explicitly considers multiple hospitals while recommending evacuation decisions. Second, it handles the deteriorating condition of victims and hence the increased care time for them as the disaster unfolds. SAVE also takes into account the treatment capacities at the hospitals. When these limited resources are free to accommodate new victims is based on both the timing and the severity of the victim sent. The explicit consideration of ambulance availability based on when and where the transport was sent is also a contribution of the SAVE model. As is shown in the experimental section of the paper, all of these contributions lead to a better outcome when using SAVE to help manage the disaster. That is, the expected number of survivors from an MCI increases with the use of SAVE.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A literature review, highlighting papers relevant to decision making during the response stage of disaster management is provided in the next section. Section 3 describes the resource constrained triage problem, highlights the STM model, and describes the SAVE model as a way to solve the problem. Section 4 provides the explicit formulation of the SAVE model. The SAVE model is compared to several heuristics currently used in the field in Section 5. Potential implementation strategies are discussed in Section 6. The final section concludes with a discussion of the managerial and policy implications of using the SAVE model.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There has been a great deal of research devoted to the general topic of disaster response. Not surprisingly, the bulk of this research has been conducted by researchers in the fields of emergency medicine, emergency response, and public policy. While an abundance of useful clinical and applied knowledge has been obtained from these studies, this literature review is focused on disaster response literature that supports the decision-making process of the incident commander and stems from the operations management literature.

Due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the resources required to respond to a specific mass casualty incident, a great deal of research has been focused on issues specific to certain types of disasters such as earthquakes (Barbarosoğlu & Arda, 2004; Fiedrich, Gehbauer, & Rickers, 2000; Özdamar, Ekinci, & Küçükyazici, 2004), floods (Shim, Fontane, & Labadie, 2002), industrial accidents (Jianshe, Shuning, & Xiaoyin, 1994; Kourniotis, Kiranoudis, & Markatos, 2001; Mould, 2001), nuclear events (French, 1996; Hobeika, Kim, & Beckwith, 1994; Papamichail & French, 1999), and terrorism (Reshetin & Regens, 2003; Wright, Liberatore, & Nydick, 2006).

There has also been much research focused on supporting decision-making and interactive methods to aid response and relief efforts. Barbarosoğlu, Özdamar, and Çevik (2002) developed an interactive approach for the hierarchical analysis of helicopter logistics for disaster relief operations. Brown and Vassiliou (1993) studied real-time allocation and assignment of response units in the context of disaster relief, allowing the human decision maker to intervene in the underlying optimization and simulation processes. The integration of simulation and geographic information systems to develop spatial decision support tools to aid in recovery operations was studied by de Silva and Eglese (2000). Other research is again specific to the problems that arise in the context of certain types of disasters. For example, Lee, Maheshwary, Mason, and Glisson (2006a, 2006b) develop a decision support system that evaluates facility layout and staffing allocations for emergency large-scale dispensing of pharmaceuticals following a disease outbreak.

Response logistics has also seen a fair amount of research. These types of decisions include, among other things, transportation and evacuation after a mass casualty event occurs. The article by Barbarosoğlu et al. (2002), which explores helicopter logistics, falls into this category. The work by Jotshi, Gong, and Batta (2009) investigates dispatching and routing emergency vehicles with the support of data fusion during the aftermath of an earthquake. Christie and Levary (1998) model the transportation of the critically injured patients to hospitals as a multi-server queuing system and show that the length of time that patients wait for an ambulance increases rapidly with the increase in the inter-arrival rate of patients to the initial treatment/waiting area. A more exhaustive list of OR/MS research in disaster operations management up until 2004 can be found in Altay and Green (2006). A more recent comprehensive literature review of optimization models in emergency logistics can be found in Caunhye, Nie, and Pokharel (2012). Their review is broken into three parts: facility location, relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations.

The work presented here is inherently related to the broader area of scheduling. Rather than review the volumes of work surrounding scheduling, the interested reader may wish to consult the following books: Baker and Trietsch (2009), Pinedo (2009), and Leung (2004).

The very definition of an MCI (WHO, 2007) implies a resource-constrained environment. In particular, the major resources that must be considered are availability of transportation (e.g., ambulances) and the capacity for the various severities of casualties at each of the hospitals. For simplicity, throughout the paper definitive care facilities are referred to as “hospitals”. Similarly, the hospital capacity is referred to as “beds” even though there are numerous inter-related resources that go into treating and stabilizing a victim of an MCI, such as X-ray and MRI equipment, emergency and operating rooms, the number of physicians and nurses. To reference a transportation vehicle, the term “ambulance” is simply used.

In order to make effective evacuation decisions, triage is first used to separate victims into distinct categories, classes, or groups. The term “victim class” and “score level” are used interchangeably throughout the paper and indicate the classification scheme used to delineate the differences between the multiple victims of an MCI. The decisions are how many of each victim class to send from the casualty collection area to which specific hospital at each decision point. Similar to the STM model (described below), the objective of doing the most good for the most people is operationalized as maximizing the expected number of survivors. In particular, the goal is to maximize the expected number of survivors with respect to restrictions on the timing and availability of ambulances needed for transport and the treatment resources available at the hospitals.

In order to calculate the expected number of survivors from an MCI, both an estimate of the survival probability and how that survival probability deteriorates over time are needed. One way to accomplish this is to assign each victim a “score” that is indicative of his current condition, and this score deteriorates with time as victims wait to be transported. In general, a victim’s initial severity and type of injury directly influences his deterioration rate.

The time horizon for the decision-making environment starts after the immediate onset of the MCI and ends when all the victims have been evacuated. The type of disaster dictates the length of the time horizon. This paper focuses on a disaster that results in blunt trauma victims, but the overall process and methodology can be used for any type of disaster.

The setting for this paper, and experiments developed within, takes place at an airport. The motivation for the setting stems from the authors’ collaboration with a local airport and their disaster management and response teams. The MCI is an airplane running off the end of a runway when landing at the airport, resulting in blunt trauma victims. The management of such a disaster would involve a centralized command-and-control. The details of the flight would also provide a very good estimate for the number of victims. In short, this type of setting is very amenable to the SAVE model.

One paper that attempts to address the resource-constrained problem with a specific objective is the work by Sacco et al. (2005). Their main motivation is to provide a mixed integer programming model and process that addresses how to specifically articulate the oft-cited objective of “do the most good for the most people”. One of their main contributions is the recommendation to use a “score”, which can be computed based on a victim’s severity and is predictive of his survival probability, as the basis to quantify the objective. They suggest using the “RPM” score, which includes the respiratory rate, pulse rate, and motor response. They show that by using RPM scores and associated survival probabilities for blunt injured victims, the STM model performs better than the traditional START method used for triage in all of their simulations, with marked improvements as the resources to transport are tightened.

Overall, the STM can be viewed as a “static macro” model. For example, the model assumes up front that the decision maker knows how many resources will be available for transporting victims for each time period, independent of how many victims may have been transported in the previous period, thus implicitly assuming that each to and from trip takes one period. Therefore the model can be solved as a simple assignment model – assigning victims to each period of evacuation, given limited transport resources that are known at the beginning of the planning and are static. However, if multiple hospitals are involved, the time it takes to evacuate casualties will depend on which ambulances are sent to specific hospitals in each period. These decisions influence the number of ambulances available in each subsequent period because some ambulances may still be in transit due to traveling to a more distant hospital. The STM approach would work if only one hospital exists and the ambulances will be back by the next decision epoch.

The decisions from the STM model are not specific; they simply identify the number of victims in each class to treat. Instead, the SAVE model presented here considers sending patients to multiple hospitals and prescribes 
                           where
                         to send each victim of the various victim classes at each decision period. The STM model does not take into account the hospital capacity for the different victim classes and when those hospital resources become reusable for treating another victim. The SAVE model uses score-based treatment estimates as they relate to the timing of the decision. It also explicitly considers available hospital and transportation capacity when recommending evacuation decisions.

Explicitly taking into account the capacity at the hospital can alter evacuation decisions and improve the expected number of survivors. This, however, is just one aspect that the SAVE model improves. In our approach, four major enhancements are added to the STM model.
                           
                              1.
                              Multiple hospitals are considered.

The time needed to treat/process a victim at a hospital varies depending on the severity of the injury to the victim. Care times for a particular victim will increase as his score decreases (gets worse).

Treatment capacities of the area hospitals are explicitly considered.

The availability of ambulances for evacuating victims depends upon where and when it was sent.

The first enhancement is logical progression over the STM model for making more realistic evacuation decisions. The second enhancement is also straight-forward. As a victim waits at the casualty collection area for evacuation, his condition will worsen (according to some deterioration rate). As his condition worsens, more resources and time will generally be needed to stabilize the patient once he arrives at the hospital. While the STM model does consider deterioration rates of patients, it uses them only for calculating the appropriate objective function coefficients.

The treatment capacities for each score at each hospital are considered explicitly in the SAVE model. The decision methodology must be cognizant of the ability of the hospitals to be able to accept and process victims at a score-based level. In particular, it ensures that a hospital has the capacity to accept a patient with his updated score level before sending the patient to that hospital. Recall that a patient’s condition deteriorates over time, meaning that he will switch score levels as time progresses. The SAVE model makes sure that the hospital can accept a patient with the updated score at the decision point rather than a patient with the initial score. One way to accomplish this is by building it into the underlying logic of the software used to implement the SAVE model (as was done in for this study). The implementation must understand the deterioration rates and increased care times for each patient class and then build the model properly. The STM model does not include treatment resources.

The final enhancement of the SAVE model considers how available ambulances affect recommended decisions and vice versa. Because multiple hospitals are considered, an ambulance that travels to a “remote” hospital will be unavailable longer than one sent to a “local” hospital. Resources for evacuation of victims are handled differently in the STM model. There, they simply assume a fixed number of ambulances and that all of the vehicles return by the next decision epoch. (They use 30-min decision epochs.)

The objective function expressed in (1) indicates the goal of maximizing the number of expected survivals from the MCI. Constraint (2) enforces the restriction that more victims than ambulances cannot be sent to hospitals. To ensure that the capacities of the hospitals are not violated, constraint set (3) is used. Constraints (4) and (6) simply set the initial values of the “state”. The availability of ambulances at each time period beyond the initial period is defined by (5). Similarly, (7) defines the capacity availability of the hospitals during each time period beyond the first one. It should be noted that the way (7) is formulated implicitly assumes that a bed is reserved at the hospital once the decision is made to send a victim there. This is expressed in the final term and the second subscript on the x variable:

                        . The Dh
                         expresses the time it takes the ambulance to get to the hospital and is added to the care time at that hospital, forcing the bed to remain “in use” during that time. Constraint (8) ensures that victims of a particular score sent to the hospitals are less than the number that actually exists. Finally, integer restrictions are expressed in (9).

A comparison of the STM and SAVE models is depicted in Fig. 1
                        , indicating an increased number of expected survivors by using the SAVE model. To understand how these improvements are possible and to help motivate the use of the SAVE approach, an illustrative example is now provided. As described earlier there are several deficiencies with the STM model. This example, however, focuses on the issue that STM does not explicitly take into account the capacity for each victim class at the hospital. To provide an objective comparison between the two approaches, a single hospital is used and we assume an ambulance can make a roundtrip between the casualty collection area and the hospital within a single time period. This assumption allows us to focus on the hospital capacity as the sticking point when comparing the two methods.

Assume there are a total of 45 victims, fifteen each falling into one of three victim classes, and a single hospital. For simplicity, the three victims classes are described as red, yellow, and green, where red is the most severely affected and green the last. (This categorization scheme was chosen to mimic the START triage method.) Each model is run until all victims have been evacuated. Table 1
                         shows the survival probabilities of each victim class as time progresses. For simplicity, after 15 time periods, the survival probability is assumed to be stable. Table 2
                         shows the care times for each victim class. Again, for time periods greater than fifteen, the care time is assumed constant. Fig. 1 shows the comparison between the two models when holding the hospital capacity fixed at five beds for each victim class and varying the ambulance capacity.

Looking at Fig. 1, focus on the final point in the two series. Here there are five ambulances available at the beginning of the time horizon and they are all dedicated to evacuating victims from this MCI until all victims have been transported. Each victim class has an initial capacity of five beds at the hospital. Running the STM model on this data, we get the following results shown in Table 3
                        . Because the STM model does not take into account the capacity constraints at the hospital, it will send five more victims during the second time period, even though there are no available resources at that time to accommodate them. In reality, this situation would manifest itself as a build-up of victims at the hospital. Because of this, to calculate the objective function the resulting evacuation decisions are treated as a queuing problem with the probability of survival being added when the each victim is actually treated. The objective function results in 25.450 expected survivors. Using the SAVE model on the same data, the objective function improves to 28.889 expected survivors, a 13.51% improvement. The corresponding decisions for the SAVE model are shown in Table 4
                        .

Based on the set-up, the improvement stems from the STM’s shortcoming of not considering treatment resource availability. In contrast, the SAVE model explicitly handles this situation. As the results above indicate, the SAVE model may help increase the number of survivors. In order to get an idea of the possible improvement by using the SAVE model rather than the STM model, a small experiment was conducted. To get a better picture of how SAVE reacts in various settings, the number of available ambulances and the capacity levels were varied. The number of available ambulances was incrementally changed from two to five and the capacity levels for each score level ranged from two to five beds at the hospital. To provide a fair comparison, a single hospital is used and it is assumed that an ambulance can make the roundtrip from the casualty collection area to the hospital route within a single time period. (Note that these restrictions are in place because of the drawbacks to the STM model mentioned earlier. As shown later, the SAVE model overcomes these deficiencies.) The SAVE model’s objective function was then compared to the STM model. Over these 16 comparisons (four levels of bed capacity at the hospital and four levels of ambulances), the SAVE model demonstrates an increase in the expected number of survivors, as we expected a priori. The overall average improvement of the SAVE model over the STM model is 17.26%. The full results of the improvement SAVE provides over the STM model are shown in Table 5
                        .


                        Fig. 2
                         provides a look at how the models react when holding one variable constant and varying the level of the second. The graph on the left fixes the capacity of the hospital to four beds and varies the number of ambulances between two and five. The rightmost graph holds the number of available ambulances constant at four and varies the hospital’s capacity from two to five beds.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

One point of interest is to determine how well the SAVE model does in comparison to several heuristics that are currently used in real life. Three of the most common “rule of thumb” approaches used in practice are:
                           
                              1.
                              Closest-first – send as many victims as possible to the closest hospital first. When that hospital reaches capacity, send victims to the next closest hospital.

Furthest-first – send as many victims as possible to the furthest hospital first. When that hospital reaches capacity, send victims to the next furthest hospital.

Cyclical – send victims in a round-robin fashion to the area hospitals.

The logic behind using the closest-first heuristic is to evacuate those victims which have been triaged and shown to be the most severely afflicted to a hospital as quickly as possible to receive treatment. The furthest-first heuristic is also used at times. It is known that victims deteriorate over time. If a large number of severely injured casualties is expected, then the first ones found (often the ones with less severe injuries) are sent to the furthest hospital because the assumption of the incident command is that these victims can survive the longer transport distance. After some time passes the next batch of casualties will have deteriorated and the “reserved” capacity at the closer hospital is a benefit because those victims could not survive the wait and an extended travel time. The final common heuristic considers sending victims in an alternating fashion to the different area hospitals. The benefit of this heuristic is that some “breathing room” is provided for each hospital. That is, it essentially assumes that no victims will get effective care if a hospital is overwhelmed by incoming patients, impairing its ability to respond.

Each of these heuristics can be implemented several ways. The most common implementation in use is to evacuate the most critical, non-expectant victims first. Intuitively, this seems like the best approach. However, as is shown below, this may not result in the best outcome if the measure is the total number of expected survivors. In direct contrast, another implementation possibility is to transport the least critical victims first, leaving the most severely injured patients for transportation later. Obviously, these are the two extremes and various other schemes could be used.

The cyclical heuristic has even more flexibility in terms of implementation possibilities. When alternating between different area hospitals, how many victims are sent to each hospital before switching the destination to a different hospital is one way to vary how the heuristic is implemented. For example, it could prescribe sending one victim to the first hospital, the next victim to the second hospital, etc. Alternatively, it could be implemented to send the first two victims to the first hospital, the next two victims to the second hospital, and so on. Again, there exist many different ways to implement the cyclical heuristic.

While certain restrictions had to be placed on the setting when the SAVE model was compared to the STM model in Section 4.3, they can be relaxed now when comparing the SAVE model to commonly used heuristics. One of the contributions of the SAVE model is that it explicitly considers multiple hospitals when recommending evacuation decisions. Therefore, we consider two hospitals for all of the following experiments. It should be noted, that while two hospitals are used for illustrative purposes, the SAVE model is capable of handling many more. We are now also able to take into account round-trip times for ambulances that are longer than the length of a time period.

For all of the experiments the following setup is used. The basis of the experiment comes from conversations stemming from a current research collaboration project with an airport to implement the SAVE model. As described earlier, the setting of a landing airplane over running the tarmac is amenable to the SAVE model. This type of disaster is mostly self-contained, results in blunt-trauma victims, and the airport’s disaster response team utilizes a centralized command-and-control approach to manage the disaster. The experimental setup also follows Sacco et al. (2005) in several regards. For victim scores, the “RPM” score, which includes the respiratory rate, pulse rate, and motor response (Sacco & Champion, 1983), is utilized. The RPM score is the sum of coded values for the three categories/rows as shown in Table 6
                        . Additionally, it is assumed that the MCI caused blunt trauma victims. This assumption allows the utilization of both the survival probabilities and the victim deterioration rates derived by Sacco et al. (2005). The survival probabilities are shown in Table 7
                         and the deterioration rates based on 30-min intervals are shown in Table 8
                        .

One of the enhancements of SAVE over STM is that care time is directly related to the current status (i.e., RPM score) of the victim. The care times used in these experiments are shown in Table 7. The care time is measured in minutes. It represents an estimate of how long it would take to stabilize a patient with the associated score, thus freeing the resources to be used on another victim. As mentioned earlier, for simplicity and exposition purposes, this paper refers to these resources simply as “beds” even though there are many other intertwined resources involved.

A fixed time horizon of 6h after the onset of a MCI is considered. It is assumed that victims are gathered at a common collection area from which emergency medical vehicles depart to evacuate the victims to a hospital. This assumption is consistent with both the discussion in the introduction and with the way a MCI would be attempted to be handled by a centralized command-and-control at an airport. Another assumption is that both the number of victims and their associated distribution are known at the beginning of the time horizon. Three different distribution patterns of victims that are awaiting transport are investigated: a uniform distribution, a left-skewed distribution, and a right-skewed distribution. See Fig. 3
                         for a pictorial representation of the victim distributions. Each distribution considers the same number of overall victims: 130. This is approximately the number of passengers on jet airliner from the Airbus A320 family.

Transit time between each hospital is also considered. The assumption that the transit time is deterministic, known, and the same for both the outbound and inbound directions is used. Four different levels for the number of ambulances are examined. Two hospitals are considered: a “local” hospital and a “remote” one. Both hospitals have the same technology resources and are capable of treating each victim class. Additionally, both hospitals treat the victims in the same amount of time. Each of the hospital’s capacity and the distance of the remote hospital from the casualty collection area are varied. Table 9
                         shows the different levels considered. Altogether 384 different design settings are investigated. The models were solved using the Gurobi solver.

The logic behind using the closest-first heuristic is to get critically injured victims needed care as quickly as possible. This approach seems intuitive: see if it is possible to provide the most badly injured victims help in time for them survive. However, when we quantify the probability of survival and want to maximize the overall number of expected survivors, the low-score-first heuristic may fall short of its intended outcome. Instead, this objective may indicate that a high-score-first approach should be used when making transportation decisions. Using the experimental setting described above, an exploration of which circumstances lead to use of the low-score-first heuristic versus the high-score-first approach is conducted.

In the experimental design, victims with RPM scores of 0 and 1 would most likely be dead or expected to die. Therefore, in reality these victims would not be considered when making evacuation decisions. This narrows the victim classes to consider down to those with RPM scores of 2 and higher. The closest-first heuristic is implemented as low-score-first and compared to a high-score-first implementation. The lowest score considered varies from 2 to 6. The results showing the percentage of the time the low-score-first is at least as good as the high-score-first, in terms of the objective function, are displayed in Table 10
                        . That is, if there is a tie, the low-score-first is considered the “winner”. Percentages for each of the individual distributions are based on the 128 runs for that particular distribution. The overall percentage (last column) is over all 384 runs.


                        Table 10 shows that whether a low-score-first implementation is better depends on both the underlying distribution of victims and which RPM score values are considered. For example, when considering an RPM score of 2 as the lowest score with a right-skewed distribution, only 11.7% of the runs showed a better objective function (i.e., the expected number of survivors) using a low-score-first approach instead of a high-score-first implementation.

It is also of interest to see how well the SAVE model performs against the commonly used heuristics. As discussed earlier, each heuristic can be implemented in numerous ways. The cyclical heuristic is implemented in three specific ways: switch hospitals after each patient, switch to a different hospital after two patients have been sent to the current hospital in row, and switch to the other hospital after sending three victims to the current one. A simplistic random heuristic is also implemented for comparison purposes. For each time period, if an ambulance is available, the random heuristic first picks the hospital with a simple flip of a fair coin. Based on the destination hospital, it then randomly picks one of the awaiting scores for which the destination hospital has capacity. This random heuristic is included to show that the performance improvements of the SAVE model are not due to chance. The results showing the average improvement of the SAVE model over each heuristic are shown in Fig. 4
                        . Both the high-score first and the low-score first implementations for the heuristics are displayed. (Note that the random heuristic chooses which score to evacuate in a probabilistic manner eliminating the possibility for high-score versus low-score, so the two bars in the graph are the same height.) As is evident from the graph, the SAVE model handily outperforms the heuristics when they utilize the low-score first approach. For this reason, the following analysis and Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         only show a high-score-first implementation for each heuristic, giving a conservative estimate of the improvement of the SAVE model over each heuristic.

Other attributes about the problem were varied to determine how the SAVE model compares to the various heuristics in different settings. First, the capacity at each hospital is held constant at six beds and the number of available ambulances varies. The results are depicted in Fig. 5. Next, the number of available ambulances is fixed at 15, the capacity at the remote hospital is set to six beds, and the capacity at the local hospital is varied. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Of the cyclical heuristics, only the cyclical-1 is shown and compared to the SAVE model in order to avoid cluttered graphs. As indicated by Fig. 4, the cyclical-1 heuristic is very representative of the other two cyclical heuristics when using the high-score first implementation.

Using the SAVE model in practice may be challenging. Even though the STM model has been around for several years, the authors are not aware of any real-world disaster response implementations of it. Perhaps the primary challenge to implementation stems from the fact that the techniques used by the SAVE and STM models are generally quite foreign to incident commanders in charge of MCI response. Two possible strategies are discussed to help overcome the possible challenges of implementing the SAVE model.

One implementation strategy involves using the SAVE model as a basis and dynamically incorporating events as they unfold. The SAVE model could be re-solved each time new information pertinent to the model is gathered, updating the recommendations for evacuation decisions. For example, if the travel time for an ambulance is longer than anticipated, this information could be folded into the model and it could be solved again. This implementation strategy requires more coordination among the disparate information sources. Such an implementation could be integrated within a decision support system that utilizes information from sources such as the hospitals (for capacity information), emergency medical technicians in the field responding to the disaster (for victim information), and ambulances (for transport availability information). Collecting and combining all of this data is technically possible, but new systems (hardware, software, processes, procedures, etc.) would have to be developed and agreed upon by the various involved parties. This rolling solving of an information-aware SAVE model would provide one way to handle unforeseen disruptions. The authors are currently working in collaboration with an airport on a proof-of-concept system to help them with their MCI training sessions. It should be noted that this approach is a viable option because the underlying MIP can be solved quickly and efficiently using a commercial solver. In the experiments for this study, Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization & Gurobi optimizer reference manual, 2013) was used to solve the MIPs consisting of 3067 constraints and 3869 variables in an average of less than three seconds on a 2GHz Windows machine with 4.00GB of RAM.

A secondary challenge facing implementation of the SAVE model is the perception that using the SAVE model may be too “involved” for the incident commander. Remember, he is accustomed to using the “rule of thumb” heuristics discussed in the previous section. Generally, these simple rules are easy to implement. One strategy is to have the SAVE model produce beforehand “cheat sheets” that provide similar guidelines for the incident commander to help him make evacuation decisions. These graphical cheat sheets can be generated for any number of different possible disaster response scenarios for a particular geographic area in anticipation of an actual MCI. Fig. 7
                      below depicts one possible cheat sheet. Similar graphical guidelines could be produced for any number of situations.

The situation considered in Fig. 7 is with blunt trauma victims resulting in a left-skewed distribution (as shown in Fig. 3). There are initially five ambulances with the capacity of both the local and remote hospitals set at two victims per score level. The one-way travel distance to the local hospital is 5min and it is 8min to the remote hospital.

The most commonly used current triage methods of START and SALT do not provide specifics on how to “provide the most good to the most people”. The STM model filled this gap by quantifying survival probabilities of victims and suggesting the use of the overall number of expected survivors as a quantifiable objective in order to capture the idea of “most good to most people”. However, the STM model is a static macro model. The work presented here suggests that the SAVE model provides four major enhancements to the STM model. It was shown that the SAVE model is better suited to recommending evacuation decisions when the hospital capacity is explicitly considered and multiple hospitals are available to send victims to during an MCI. An experimental design setting is provided which allows testing of various in-use heuristics. In particular, it was shown that the effectiveness of using a low-score-first implementation of the closest-first heuristic depends upon the underlying victim distribution and which RPM score value was the lowest considered. Also investigated was how well the SAVE model performs in comparison to several heuristics that are currently used in real life. The SAVE model was tested against the heuristics that used a high-score-first implementation. Although, most evacuation heuristics use a low-score-first approach rather than a high-score-first approach, we compared the SAVE model to the high-score-first heuristics providing a more conservative estimates of the improvement measures. The SAVE model outperforms all of the heuristics on the order of 10–30% on average. While this percentage of improvement may not seem significant on the surface, the objective function is measured in human lives; even a minuscule improvement should be celebrated.

As the number of available ambulances varies but the hospital capacities remain constant, the improvement of the SAVE model over the closest-first heuristic stayed relatively stable at approximately 10%. Not surprisingly, as more ambulances are added, the cyclical heuristics performance improves. However, the SAVE model still performs better but the improvement gap between models starts to level off. Another investigation kept the number of available ambulances and the remote hospital’s capacity constant, while increasing the capacity at the local hospital. This experiment shows the performance gap between the SAVE model and the heuristics as remaining steady after having reached a capacity of four beds at the local hospital.

Some related research that the authors are currently pursuing includes a proof-of-concept decision support system for the rolling-horizon approach discussed in Section 6. This work is being conducted in collaboration with an airport. The authors are also developing new models that build stochasticity directly into the SAVE model. Another interesting extension would be to include modeling of the hospitals’ downstream resources. After a victim has been stabilized, he will often be admitted to an inpatient unit of the hospital. How does the increase of inpatients stemming from an MCI affect the overall patient flow of a hospital? Yet another avenue for future research is to investigate the option of using some ambulances to transfer existing inpatients to a “farther” hospital in order to “make room” for the incoming victims of the MCI. Exploring such an option does have interesting legal aspects to it.
