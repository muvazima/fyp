                  Background and objective
                  This article presents a multimodal analysis of startle type responses using a variety of physiological, facial, and speech features. These multimodal components of the startle type response reflect complex brain–body reactions to a sudden and intense stimulus. Additionally, the proposed multimodal evaluation of reflexive and emotional reactions associated with the startle eliciting stimuli and underlying neural networks and pathways could be applied in diagnostics of different psychiatric and neurological diseases. Different startle type stimuli can be compared in the strength of their elicitation of startle responses, i.e. their potential to activate stress-related neural pathways, underlying biomarkers and corresponding behavioral reactions.
               
               
                  Methods
                  An innovative method for measuring startle type responses using multimodal stimuli and multimodal feature analysis has been introduced. Individual's multimodal reflexive and emotional expressions during startle type elicitation have been assessed by corresponding physiological, speech and facial features on ten female students of psychology. Different startle eliciting stimuli like noise and airblast probes, as well as a variety of visual and auditory stimuli of different valence and arousal levels, based on International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images and/or sounds from International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) database, have been designed and tested. Combined together into more complex startle type stimuli, such composite stimuli can potentiate the evoked response of underlying neural networks, and corresponding neurotransmitters and neuromodulators as well; this is referred to as increased power of response elicitation. The intensity and magnitude of multimodal responses to selected startle type stimuli have been analyzed using effect sizes and medians of dominant multimodal features, i.e. skin conductance, eye blink, head movement, speech fundamental frequency and energy. The significance of the observed effects and comparisons between paradigms were evaluated using one-tailed t-tests and ANOVA methods, respectively. Skin conductance response habituation was analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparison tests with the Dunn–Šidák correction.
               
               
                  Results
                  The results revealed specific physiological, facial and vocal reflexive and emotional responses on selected five stimuli paradigms which included: (1) acoustic startle probes, (2) airblasts, (3) IAPS images, (4) IADS sounds, and (5) image-sound-airblast composite stimuli. Overall, composite and airblast paradigms resulted in the largest responses across all analyzed features, followed by sound and acoustic startle paradigms, while paradigm using images consistently elicited the smallest responses. In this context, power of response elicitation of the selected stimuli paradigms can be described according to the aggregated magnitude of the participants’ multimodal responses. We also observed a habituation effect only in skin conductance response to acoustic startle, airblast and sound paradigms.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  This study developed a system for paradigm design and stimuli generation, as well as real-time multimodal signal processing and feature calculation. Experimental paradigms for monitoring individual responses to stressful startle type stimuli were designed in order to compare the response elicitation power across various stimuli. The developed system, applied paradigms and obtained results might be useful in further research for evaluation of individuals’ multimodal responses when they are faced with a variety of aversive emotional distractors and stressful situations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Startle stimuli represent various sudden and intense events that cause defensive responses, like a quick muscle contraction, activation of various facial and skeletal muscles within a few milliseconds, leading to a whole body reflex that serves to protect the back of the neck and eyes [1]. Three different components of the startle response should be distinguished [2]. First, muscle contractions protect vulnerable structures, like the neck or the eye ball. Beyond this immediate physical protection, a brief surge in activation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and endocrine response prepares the individual for a flight-or-fight response. This vegetative component of the startle response is reflected in a number of physiological signals, such as blood pressure [3], heart rate [3], skin conductance [4] and respiration [4]. Finally, ongoing cognitive processes are disrupted and attention is rapidly reoriented to the threatening stimulus [5,6].

Multimodality in startle type stimulation refers to a variety of visual stimuli, like images and video clips, and narratives with high arousal and application-specific associative contexts and semantics, which are superimposed on traditional startle stimuli. Such composite stimuli create more complex multimodal emotion elicitation with relatively high evoked response potentiation, referred to as elicitation power [7]. Such stimulation simultaneously targets several somatosensory cortex regions, including auditory, visual and tactile areas, and results in the broadest activation of different neural networks associated with potential traumatic events and experience. With such comprehensive semantically specific stimuli, a subject's potential deficits regarding his/her cognitive personal appraisal or hidden traumatic associative memories can be better assessed. Multimodality in the startle type response refers to reflexive and emotional reactions which can be captured by characteristic multimodal response signatures, like increased skin conductance, heart rate, contraction of the neck muscles, eye blink and laryngeal reflexive reactions, as well as emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses.

This paper presents an integrated multimodal analysis of responses to startle type stimuli via selected physiological, speech and facial features, unlike previous research works that typically focus on a single modality in combination with standard electromyogram (EMG) measurements of the eye blink startle response via the orbicularis oculi muscle. For example, in the physiological modality, Alpers and colleagues have conducted simultaneous analysis of orbicularis oculi, heart rate and electrodermal activity [8]. In the speech modality, the fundamental frequency (F
                     0) startle response analysis was proposed and studied by Sapir and colleagues [9], who compared F
                     0 to invasive EMG measurements of the laryngeal muscle response. In the facial modality, there have been a few studies of startle responses focused on automated eyelid detection and tracking in high-speed videos [10,11], as well as motion tracking of head and upper-body startle response with comparison to EMG measurements of the orbicularis oculi 
                     [12]. In comparison with previous papers, startle responses in this paper were analyzed simultaneously via dominantly expressed physiological, speech and facial features, i.e. skin conductance, speech fundamental frequency, speech energy, eye blinks and head movement. Additionally, we have designed and evaluated a series of elicitation paradigms for startle type responses using visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli, as well as their combination, which has not been done previously.

The concept of the system for generation of various startle type stimuli and multimodal analysis of associated startle type responses by measuring physiological, vocal and facial reactivity is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The system is built around Lenovo S30 Workstation with Intel Xeon Processor E5-2620 v2 (15M Cache, 2.10GHz), 32GB of memory, and nVidia Quadro K200D graphics card, running Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro operating system. Four system displays are related to: a display for supervisor system management, such as stimuli specification and specification of channels for multimodal data acquisition; two displays for stimuli presentation to the participants as well as experimenters; and a display for real-time visualization and tracking of selected multimodal response features like skin conductance, speech energy and fundamental frequency, eye blink, head translation etc. Systems for multimodal data acquisition include: Nexus-10 mark II device with 10 channels including skin conductance, electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration, skin temperature, blood volume pulse, EMG, as well as Biopac MP150 unit with ECG100C, RSP100C, EMG100C, GSR100C and SKT100C modules for physiology acquisition; voice acquisition system headset Sennheiser PC 360 and throat microphone Telex TM750R; video acquisition system Logitech C920 webcam.

The basic building blocks for stimuli generation are:
                        
                           •
                           The acoustic startle module which generates 108dB (A) Sound Pressure Level (SPL) 40ms white-noise bursts with 0ms rise and fall times, delivered by a Samson audio amplifier and Sennheiser PC 360 professional audio headphones.

The airblast delivery module [13,14] which includes Messer air tank, solenoid valve, camelback with nozzle attached to hose and solenoid controller. The 140p.s.i. airblast is triggered by Measurement Computing DIO24 PCI Card.

Elicitation of emotion based on images and/or sounds [15] which includes a variety of audio and visual databases like International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [16], International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) [17], NimStim Face Stimulus Set [18] and Nencki Affective Picture System [19].

Short highly arousing and negatively valenced visual stimuli and sounds may potentiate the emotional effects of acoustic startle elicitation paradigm. To enhance power of response elicitation in composite paradigms, highly arousing aversive IAPS video images and IADS sounds can be combined with 250ms 140p.s.i. airblast probes delivered to the participant's occiput. Additional aversive stimuli that can be delivered include highly irritating but not painful 500ms electric shocks ranging from 0.5 to 5.0mA, using electrodes attached to the fourth finger of the non-dominant hand. The goal of multimodal emotion elicitation is to provide a variety of stimuli, which are capable of eliciting broadband emotional startle type responses, in order to analyze the participant's vulnerabilities or robustness to complex aversive visual, auditory and tactile distractions.

Multimodal reactivity to startle type stimuli has been analyzed through five test paradigms which were designed and presented to ten female students, whose multimodal responses were captured via skin conductance, speech fundamental frequency and energy, as well as eye blinks and head movement. The paradigms contained established startle stimuli as well as their augmentation with the visual and auditory context and semantics which may elicit more complex multimodal physiological, facial and vocal responses, reflecting interactions of higher cognitive cortical structures, the brain stem and the emotional limbic system. For this purpose, IAPS images of unpleasant scenes, such as scenes of fear, disgust and mutilation, were selected with congruent sounds. Specifically, each of the five test paradigms is described below:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              Acoustic Startle Probes: Acoustic startle probes were simple white noise stimuli without any audio context and semantics. The acoustic startle reflex is elicited by auditory stimuli greater than 80dB [20]; the current study used 108dB.


                              Airblast Stimuli: Airblasts are aversive auditory and tactile stimuli, which also elicit startle response. Airblasts are usually directed to the larynx [21], but in this paper they were pointed to the occiput, due to interference with the participants’ phonation and throat microphone (laryngophone) sensor.


                              IADS Sounds: Sudden and loud sounds based on IADS database were used as startle stimuli as well. These stimuli, unlike acoustic startle probes and airblasts, have specific semantics which additionally elicit emotional responses.


                              IAPS Images: Image context and semantics predominantly elicit emotional responses, rather than startle responses. Image-based emotional elicitation included a variety of visual databases, as described in the previous section.


                              Composite Stimuli: More real-world startle type stimuli included a combination of multimodal effects, i.e. sounds, images, tactile sensing. Specifically, in this paper a combination of airblast with unpleasant IAPS/IADS images and sounds was used.

Ten female students recruited from the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences participated in the study. The selected participants were physically and mentally healthy, without any cardiovascular medical conditions, 18–19 years of age. All participants completed PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version (translated to Croatian), and their scores were below the cut-off level 30 for PTSD [22]. Two additional inclusion/exclusion criteria were used: the score on the emotional expressivity questionnaire [23] and the score on the anxiety sensitivity questionnaire [24,25]. Participants had to reach a high score on the emotional expressivity questionnaire (score≥57) in order to select those with more intense emotional reactions. Assessment of students’ anxiety sensitivity was added to eliminate participants for whom stimuli and physiological reactions (such as increased heart rate) could provoke panic attacks. Participants were required to have relatively low scores in the anxiety sensitivity questionnaire (score≤40).

@&#PROCEDURE@&#

After being screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and signing the informed consent form in advance, on the day of the experiment the participants were familiarized with the laboratory setting. They were seated on a height-adjustable chair in front of a 75cm-high table with 24″ Lenovo ThinkVision monitor (1920×1200 resolution). The distance between the participant's eyes and the monitor was approximately 60–70cm. Electrodes were attached and the participant was instructed to sit quietly, keep her eyes in the direction of the screen and neither move nor speak during the delivery of stimuli paradigms.

After the initial trials, participants underwent five elicitation paradigms (illustrated in Fig. 2
                        ): (1) acoustic startle white-noise probes lasting 40ms, with intensity of 108dB (A) SPL; (2) airblasts to the occiput lasting 250ms, using air pressure of 140p.s.i.; (3) loud aversive IADS sounds lasting 1s; (4) aversive IAPS images lasting 2s; and (5) simultaneous combinations of aversive airblasts, IADS sounds and IAPS images with the same properties as in the prior respective paradigms. Each paradigm lasted 120s and included three pseudo-randomly ordered time intervals with a stimulus presentation and three when stimuli were omitted. In order to capture the impact of stimuli on speech responses, the participants were given on-screen visual reminders to start sustained phonation of vowel ‘a’, immediately after onset of a white screen with a fixation cross ‘+’. All participants underwent the same paradigms in the same order, 1 through 5, with approximately 3-min breaks between successive paradigms. To evaluate the participants’ perception of each elicitation paradigm, subjective ratings were collected regarding unpleasantness, stimuli intensity, overall self-assessed reactivity, and aversiveness ranking of the applied paradigms.

The experimenter verbally informed the participant regarding the beginning of each paradigm, and when the paradigm was finished. Each paradigm started with the black screen, which was followed by the first appearance of the white screen with fixation cross ‘+’. The white screen indicated that the participants should start sustained phonation of vowel ‘a’ until the black screen would reappear again 5s later. During each paradigm lasting 120s, there were 6 occurrences of the white screen with the fixation cross, which included in pseudo-random order: 3 No Stimulus (NS) conditions, in which the onset of white screen was only followed by reappearance of black screen 5s later; and 3 Stimulus (S) conditions which included delivery of a specific startle type stimulus at t
                        =3s after the onset of the white screen. The recorded physiological, speech and facial features were statistically analyzed in MATLAB for response differences between Stimulus and No Stimulus conditions within each paradigm, and response differences between the various paradigms.

The timing diagram of all stimuli paradigms, and skin conductance responses of a single participant on acoustic startle probes, airblasts, IADS sounds, IAPS images, and composite stimuli is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 also illustrates the skin conductance habituation as a form of non-associative learning which decreases skin conductance response magnitude after repeated presentation of the same stimulus. It is also evident that habituation was stimulus specific [26] and different among all five paradigms. The habituation analysis was important because it can be disrupted in patients suffering from different mental health and neurodegenerative diseases [27]. Also, conditioned responses during the No Stimulus period can be observed in the increased skin conductance to the fixation cross which was associated with increased probability of the occurrence of an aversive stimulus.

Participants’ behavioral reactions can be monitored in real time by selected physiological, speech and facial variables, like: skin conductance, fundamental frequency, energy, eye blink and movement of the participant's head. During the experimental measurements, all relevant multimodal input/output variables, sampling periods, time stamps, types of stimuli, time intervals of Stimulus and No Stimulus periods were continuously recorded for comprehensive off-line analysis. Therefore, any segmentation of recorded data could be easily examined in after-action analysis and review. More detailed analyses of selected physiological, speech and facial features are presented in the following sections.

Skin conductance level is one of the most robust non-invasive physiological measures of ANS [28]. It is used as a measure of arousal in many anticipatory anxiety studies and therefore was used as an important measure of startle type responses in our study. Laboratory studies have also found that skin conductance response varies linearly with arousal ratings regardless of the valence ratings [29].

Skin conductance and other physiological signals, like ECG, blood volume pulse, respiration, and skin temperature, were measured with Nexus-10 mark II physiology acquisition equipment wirelessly connected to the system by Bluetooth with a sampling frequency of 256Hz for all channels. The physiology acquisition software was based on Nexus API and software for signal processing, feature computation and recording. Numerous physiological features described in [30] were calculated from physiological raw signals, and off-line analysis was conducted using MATLAB.

In the current study, startle type response was predominantly expressed using skin conductance level. Before feature computation, skin conductance signals were normalized on the basis of the minimum and maximum of the signal in all five stimuli paradigms, as recommended in [31]. To find minimum and maximum for each participant, we linked together skin conductance signals over the acoustic startle, airblast, sound, image and composite paradigms (Eq. (1)). From this data set, we computed normalized skin conductance signals (normSC) for each paradigm (Eq. (2)).

Normalized skin conductance signals for each paradigm are shown in Fig. 3
                        , averaged across all participants in the Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 stimulus trials) vs. No Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 trials without stimuli). As shown in Fig. 3 the difference between skin conductance responses in the No Stimulus and Stimulus conditions is highest for the composite paradigm (red circles). Relatively high differences were also achieved with acoustic startle, airblast and sound paradigms, while minor difference was achieved with image paradigm.


                        Fig. 4
                         illustrates the differences between the magnitude(normSC) calculated when startle type stimuli occurred and the magnitude(normSC) when no startle type stimuli occur. In each paradigm, the magnitude(normSC) was computed from the participant's average normSC signal across 3 Stimulus conditions and, likewise, across 3 No Stimulus conditions. The greatest median differences occurred in the composite paradigm, followed by sound, acoustic startle and airblast paradigms, and, finally, image paradigm. Therefore, the median differences indicate that the composite paradigm had the highest response elicitation power for magnitude(normSC). It is also evident that, across all paradigms, participant 6 most consistently exhibited the lack of skin conductance responses.

Additionally, to take into account the variability of responses between participants, an alternative measure of response elicitation power was computed for each paradigm from the individual participants’ data plotted in Fig. 4. This alternative measure was the effect size, computed as Cohen's d

After applying one-tailed one-sample t-tests to the data from each paradigm in Fig. 4, the greater-than-zero effects of stimuli were statistically significant (p
                        <0.05) for all paradigms. Repeated measures ANOVA rejected the null hypothesis of no difference in responding to various stimuli at 0.05 level of significance (p
                        =0.0098).

Skin conductance responses to startle type stimuli were also tested for habituation, by comparison of the magnitude(normSC) between the first, second and final third occurrence of startle type stimulus in each paradigm. Generally speaking, participants habituated to stimulation within the paradigms as shown in Fig. 5
                        . It can be seen that there was a continuous negative trend in responses within all paradigms, except for composite stimuli. Repeated measures ANOVA found statistically significant (p
                        <0.05) differences among responses to the first, second and final third occurrence of startle type stimulus in the acoustic startle, airblast and sound paradigm, but not in the image and composite paradigm. Post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn–Šidák correction showed that there were significant differences between responses on the first and second, and the first and third stimulus in the acoustic startle and airblast paradigm, and that there were significant differences between responses on the first and third stimulus in the sound paradigm. There were no significant differences between responses on the second and third stimulus within any paradigm.

The startle response in laryngeal muscles has not been explored as much as the eye blink response, but a few studies have shown that EMG response can be recorded from several laryngeal muscles when presenting startle stimuli. For example, EMG response was measured on cricothyroid muscle of the larynx during acoustic startle probe [9]. Contractions of the cricothyroid muscle elicited by an acoustic startle probe cause the reflexive vocal folds elongation, which consequently results in rapid short-term increase in fundamental frequency (F
                        0) response magnitude. Other studies somaesthetically elicited EMG responses on the laryngeal vocalis and interarytenoid muscles that are similar to those of the orbicularis oculi auditory startle response [33], while similar results for laryngeal muscle innervations in the case of an airblast [34], and electrical stimuli [35] are also presented.

The main advantage of acoustic analysis of startle responses vs. EMG analysis of laryngeal muscles is in the fact that it is more practical; however it requires sustained phonation from the participant during the startle elicitation.

The F
                        0 startle response analysis was in its basic form proposed by Sapir and colleagues [9]. It was compared to laryngeal muscle response (the cricothyroid muscle), which was measured with invasive EMG electrodes. Stimuli intensity used in this research was in the range of 25–85dB (A) SPL, but according to the 2005 eye blink guidelines [36], the recommended intensity of acoustic startle stimulus is 100dB (A) SPL or higher. Also, in [37] was shown that eye blink occurs only in about 50% cases when intensity of a startle stimulus is set to 85dB (A) SPL. For EMG eye blink reaction, generally an increase in the intensity of stimulus causes an increase of the response magnitude and the probability of a reaction, as well as a decrease of response latency [38]. In our previous work [39,40], acoustic startle stimuli were distributed in the range of 55–105dB (A) SPL and similar conclusions on F
                        0 response were found. In this experiment, stimulus intensity was set up to 108dB (A) SPL and F
                        0 analysis of the startle type response was extended with an energy (intensity) analysis.

Real-time computation of speech features like F
                        0 and energy was done by openSMILE v2.0 toolkit [41]. Sampling frequency of the raw speech signal was 8kHz, monaural, with 16 bits per sample. Fundamental frequency and energy of speech were computed using a frame-based analysis (hamming window) where frame size was set to 25ms and frame step to 10ms. During initial testing, it was observed that sounds from headphones and airblast were recorded by the headset microphone, which would preclude analysis of the participant's speech features for airblast, sound and composite paradigms. Therefore, Telex TM750R throat microphone (laryngophone) was used to capture only the participant's raw speech signal.

Fundamental frequency was measured using ACF (autocorrelation function)/Cepstrum based method obtained directly from openSMILE v2.0 toolkit. Sustained phonation of the vowel ‘a’ by each participant provided fundamental frequency approximately as a steady state F
                        0 contour. Therefore, any change in the contour that occurred as a response to the stimuli presentation could be easily detected. We assumed that the time interval (1.5s, 3.0s) after the onset of the white screen with fixation cross ‘+’ represented a clear phonation, since in this period the influence of the initial breath and the turbulence at the beginning of the phonation were mainly eliminated. The response interval was taken immediately after the stimulus onset, i.e. (3.0s, 3.5s). The magnitude of F
                        0 for each phonation was calculated as a ratio of maximum F
                        0 values in time intervals (3.0s, 3.5s) vs. (1.5s, 3.0s):

Energy (intensity) of speech signal was measured using a root-mean-square method obtained from openSMILE v2.0 toolkit. In this case, a slowly decreasing contour was expected during the phonation, and its changes due to stimuli presentations were relatively easy to detect. The baseline interval of speech energy contour was (1.5s, 3.0s), while the response interval was (3.35s, 4.5s), i.e. 3.35s after the onset of the white screen and 0.35s after the stimulus onset in the case of stimulus event. The first 350ms after the stimulus onset were avoided due to transmission of the airblast sound to throat microphone in a few cases. In these paradigms, airblast was presented within the first 250ms after the stimulus onset, while an additional 100ms (350ms in total) were added to exclude all possible delay effects. The magnitude of energy (E) for each phonation was calculated as a ratio of maximum E values in (3.35s, 4.5s) and (1.5s, 3.0s) time intervals:

Time segments of F

                        , averaged across all participants in the Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 stimuli) vs. No Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 trials without stimuli). Responses are evident in the interval (0s, 0.5s) for F
                        0 and in the interval (0s, 1.5s) for speech energy E after the onset of startle type stimuli in all paradigms except the image paradigm (e.g. see red circles for illustration). It must be noted that all the utterances were taken into account despite the fact that some utterances contained halving and doubling effects of F
                        0, short discontinuities in F
                        0 contour after the stimulus onset (in the case of unvoiced speech or silence, followed by phonation again), as well as short drops to zero in energy contour after the stimulus onset (a short silence interval, followed by phonation).


                        Fig. 7
                         shows speech F
                        0 and energy magnitude differences between the Stimulus and No Stimulus conditions. In each paradigm, both features were computed from the participant's average F
                        0/energy contours across 3 Stimulus conditions and, likewise, across 3 No Stimulus conditions. The largest median difference of the magnitude(F
                        0) occurred in the airblast paradigm, followed by the composite, sound, acoustic startle and image paradigms. The median differences indicated that the airblast paradigm had the highest response elicitation power for magnitude(F
                        0). It is evident that, across all paradigms, participant 8 most consistently exhibited F
                        0 responses to aversive stimuli, while participants 4 and 9 most consistently exhibited a lack of F
                        0 responses. On the other hand, the largest median difference of the magnitude(E) occurred in the composite paradigm, followed by sound, airblast, acoustic startle and image paradigms. In this case, the composite paradigm had the highest response elicitation power. Across all paradigms, participant 8 again most consistently exhibited responses to aversive stimuli, while no particular participant exhibited a lack of energy responses.

The results of the Cohen's d
                        
                           z
                         effect size measure (Eq. (4)) for speech features are shown in Table 2
                        . For the magnitude(F
                        0), the ranking of paradigms was the same as for median difference: (1) airblast – highest; (2) composite; (3) sound; (4) acoustic startle; (5) image. On the other hand, the ranking of paradigms was slightly different than the median difference in the case of the magnitude(E): (1) composite – highest; (2) airblast; (3) sound; (4) acoustic startle; (5) image. Only the airblast and sound paradigms switched between 2nd and 3rd places in this case.

After applying one-tailed one-sample t-tests to the data from each paradigm in Fig. 7, the greater-than-zero effects of stimuli were statistically significant (p
                        <0.05) for all paradigms except the image paradigm (p
                        =0.106 for magnitude(F
                        0), p
                        =0.094 for magnitude(E)). Repeated measures ANOVA rejected the null hypothesis of no difference in responding to various stimuli at 0.05 level of significance (p
                        =0.012 for magnitude(F
                        0), p
                        =5.7×10−10 for magnitude(E)).

Furthermore, it should be noted that speech energy E had a longer time response than the F
                        0 (Fig. 6). The reason for such different transient response lies in different phenomenology of these two speech features and the Lombard effect, i.e. the involuntary tendency of a speaker to increase the loudness, pitch, rate and duration of his/her voice when speaking in a loud noise environment [42,43].

While facial video capture has been previously used in manual analysis of startle responses [44], there are only a few papers that address automated analysis of startle response videos. Bernard and colleagues proposed a novel method for automated eyelid detection and tracking in the context of eye blink startle response measurements [10]. Derakshani and Lovelace introduced their method of eyelid tracking in high-speed videos together with classification of eye blink startle responses based on support vector machines [11]. Vousdoukas and colleagues proposed stereo-vision motion tracking system for various body parts, like head, chest and shoulders, rather than individual facial features, which has been validated by comparisons with surface EMG measurements of eye blink startle response [12]. Our approach, however, leveraged state-of-the-art general-purpose facial feature tracking technology for simultaneous tracking of facial and head movements related to startle and emotional responses.

In the current study, a low-cost off-the-shelf digital video camera, Logitech C920, was used for detection of facial components of the startle response instead of traditional EMG recordings of orbicularis oculi activity. While low-cost video cameras do not have time resolution of the EMG signal, video recordings of the facial expressions of the startle response can also be done with high-speed cameras (e.g. see [10]) enabling better time resolution of the orbicularis oculi response without the need to attach EMG electrodes to the participant's face. Therefore, in situations where the use of EMG electrodes is inconvenient, low-cost off-the-shelf digital video cameras represent a promising alternative for multimodal analyses of startle responses.

Video streams of the participants’ faces acquired by the camera were processed by the state-of-the-art image processing visage|SDK FaceTrack software package (
                           http://www.visagetechnologies.com/products/visagesdk/
                        ). The facial features tracked by visage|SDK FaceTrack engine are aligned with the Face and Body Animation part of the MPEG-4 International Standard (ISO14496). The visage|SDK FaceTrack engine also tracks head translations in x, y and z direction, rotations around x, y and z axis, eye gaze in x and y direction, as well as eye closure. Furthermore, the engine computes a variety of Action Units from the Facial Action Coding System [45], like eye blinks, lid tighteners and raisers, brow raisers and lowerers, lip stretchers, raisers and corner pullers, yaw drops, chin raisers, etc. The engine has been extensively tested on the publicly available Boston database (
                           ftp://csr.bu.edu/headtracking/
                        ), as well as on the internal test database containing 86 video sequences that amount to more than 1h of video [46]. The reported eye closure detection sensitivity is 88.57% and specificity is 98.26%, which is directly relevant for eye blink detection in the context of the acoustic startle reaction.

All tracked facial, head and eye features were computed in real time for each of the five stimuli paradigms from the video stream acquired by 640×480 resolution and frequency of 25Hz. At the completion of each paradigm, the computed features were stored into the participants’ database for subsequent off-line analysis. Among the variety of facial, head and eye features, startle type responses were the most evident in: eye blinking, lid tightening, head movement to-and-from camera, i.e. z-translation, and vertical eye gaze direction. Features that contained information regarding eye blinks and head movement were selected for more detailed analysis, because prior startle research using blank pistol shots [47] found that eye closures and head movements occurred most reliably during startle responses.

Eye blinks were measured as a binary eyeBlink time series obtained directly from the visage|SDK FaceTrack engine. It contained values 0 and 1, where 0 indicates open eye, and 1 indicates closed eye at a particular time instant. Therefore, rapid changes in eyeBlink time series from 0 to 1 and back to 0 indicated eye blinks. Head movement in the direction of the camera was obtained directly from the visage|SDK FaceTrack engine as z-translation time series. Z-translation actually indicated the distance of the participant's head from the camera, which was positioned at the top of the screen in front of the participant; therefore, larger values of z-translation indicated that the participant's head was farther away from the camera. The distance values were reported approximately in meters, as computation depends on each participant's interpupillary distance, which was not measured. Measure of the startle response in eye blinks and z-translation was defined as the range, i.e. difference between maximum and minimum value, during the interval (0s, 0.5s) after the onset of the startle stimulus, which is the same as the interval (3s, 3.5s) after the appearance of the white screen with fixation cross ‘+’.

Segments of eyeBlink and z-translation time series for each paradigm are shown in Fig. 8
                        , averaged across all participants in the Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 stimuli) vs. No Stimulus condition (10 participants×3 trials without stimuli). Responses are evident immediately after the onset of startle type stimuli in all paradigms except image paradigm (e.g. see red arrows for illustration). Averaging of binary values of eyeBlink time series across all 30 trials computed the proportion of eye blink occurrences on a scale from 0 to 1.

In order to illustrate the impact of startle type stimuli, Fig. 9
                         shows differences between each participant's eyeBlink/z-translation range when the stimuli occurred (Stimulus conditions) and the corresponding range when the stimuli did not occur (No Stimulus conditions). In each paradigm, the range was computed from the participant's average time series across 3 Stimulus conditions and, likewise, across 3 No Stimulus conditions. The largest median difference for eyeBlink range occurred in the airblast paradigm, followed by composite, acoustic startle, sound and image paradigms. Therefore, the median differences indicate that the airblast paradigm had the highest response elicitation power for eye blinks. It is also evident that, across all paradigms, participant 8 most consistently exhibited eye blink responses to startle type stimuli, while participants 4, 6 and 9 most consistently exhibited a lack of eye blink responses. The largest median difference for z-translation range occurred in the composite paradigm, followed by airblast, acoustic startle, sound and image paradigms. Therefore, the median differences indicate that the composite paradigm had the highest response elicitation power for z-translation. It is also evident that, across all paradigms, participant 8 most consistently exhibited the largest z-translation responses to startle stimuli, while participants 4, 6 and 10 most consistently exhibited the smallest responses.

                        . For eyeBlink range, the ranking of paradigms according to Cohen's d
                        
                           z
                         was the same as for median difference: (1) airblast – highest; (2) composite; (3) acoustic startle; (4) sound; (5) image. For z-translation range, the ranking of paradigms according to Cohen's d
                        
                           z
                         is: (1) acoustic startle – highest; (2) composite; (3) airblast; (4) sound; (5) image. The obtained ranking was therefore somewhat different in comparison to median difference as a measure of the response elicitation power of the paradigms.

After applying one-tailed one-sample t-tests to the data from each paradigm in Fig. 9, the greater-than-zero effects of stimuli were statistically significant (p
                        <0.05) for all paradigms except the image paradigm (p
                        =0.171 for eyeBlink range, p
                        =0.052 for z-translation range). Repeated measures ANOVA rejected the null hypothesis of no difference in responding to various stimuli at 0.05 level of significance (p
                        =0.0017 for eyeBlink range, p
                        =0.0020 for z-translation range).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The system for evaluation of startle type responses based on multimodal analyses of predominant physiological, acoustic and facial features was developed and tested on a sample of first-year female students of psychology. Subjects with higher emotional scores were selected in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system and experimental paradigms for multimodal response elicitation and analysis of startle type responses. Among physiological features, skin conductance response revealed the largest differences between Stimulus and No Stimulus conditions. The most evident Stimulus vs. No Stimulus differences in speech features were observed in fundamental frequency (F
                     0) and root-mean-square energy. The most significant differences in facial features occurred in eye blinks and forward-backward head movement. Among the five selected paradigms, the composite paradigm composed of airblast and congruent aversive images and sounds induced more stress in comparison with other paradigms causing higher activation of the sympathetic nervous system. At the same time, the paradigm containing only aversive image stimuli exhibited the lowest sensitivity, i.e. it was the paradigm in which startle response was not observed at all. The largest effect size for Stimulus vs. No Stimulus conditions across all paradigms and participants was observed for speech energy, followed by eye blink, skin conductance, z-translation and F
                     0. It was also evident that, across all paradigms, some participants were more sensitive responders to the startle type stimuli, while other participants were less sensitive responders. Even in a relatively homogeneous group with statistically relevant similarities between individuals, there were visible individual differences, which might indicate more or less individual resiliency/vulnerability to aversive startle type stimuli. Different dynamics of specific response channels were visible from the multimodal analyses of startle type response; e.g. eye blink exhibited a short response time vs. the longer response time of skin conductance.

Decreased or attenuated skin conductance startle type responses over time were an indication of decreasing sympathetic activation. However, it could be expected that different startle modulations as well as different order of presented paradigms might also have influence on overall startle type responses and response habituation. All together, it means that emotional and attentional factors may strongly interfere with reflexive response, making the overall net effect of startle response either more or less intense.

Overlaying aversive stressors on basic startle stimuli warrants more exploration in applied research regarding human resilience or vulnerability to stress. In this paper, a composite paradigm which includes congruent negatively valenced and highly arousing IAPS images/IADS sounds superimposed on airblasts showed the highest response elicitation power. These superimposed emotional contents could increase or decrease startle response, i.e. modulate physiological [48] and other multimodal variables. Therefore, enhancing power of response elicitation by semantically and contextually specific stimuli, as well as cross-correlation analysis of context and semantics of selected startle type stimuli with individually relevant context and semantics, deserves more attention in future work, particularly in broader research on cognitive regulation of emotion [49,50]. Other viable research directions may address generalizability of findings obtained in this paper, by multimodal analyses of startle type responses in males vs. females or in different age groups. Likewise, these analyses can be applied in clinical research setting, e.g. with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients and healthy controls, which is the specific focus of our ongoing research collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Center Zagreb. Outlined research directions are compatible with the developed research system demonstrated in this paper, which has been designed as a general purpose test-bed for analysis of startle type responses, as well as multimodal emotion elicitation and analysis.
