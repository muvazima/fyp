                  We investigate the make-buy decision of a manufacturer who does not know its potential suppliers’ capabilities. In order to mitigate the consequences of this limited knowledge, the manufacturer can either perform in-house or audit suppliers. An audit reveals the audited supplier’s capability such that the manufacturer can base the make-buy decision on the audit outcome; the manufacturer might also learn from the audit and update its beliefs about the capabilities of the unaudited suppliers. Interestingly, using a very general model we find that the manufacturer’s decision can be independent of both the number of available suppliers and of the mechanism it uses to update its beliefs after an audit. We illustrate our general model by considering a possible application, where a manufacturer is making the outsource-audit decisions when the suppliers are more cost effective. However, when outsourcing to supplier, the manufacturer would face the uncertainty of whether or not the delivered task can integrate well with the other parts of the project.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Consider a manufacturer that needs to complete a task and must decide whether or not it should outsource the task. Outsourcing allows the manufacturer to benefit from a supplier’s expertise or cost advantage. However, the consequences of contracting with an incompetent supplier can be substantial. To reduce the production cost of the Dreamliner, Boeing outsourced 70% of the manufacturing of the plane. The development of the rear fuselage was outsourced to Dallas-based Vought Aircraft Industries, who turned out to be incapable of performing the assigned project, resulting in production delays and multi-million dollar losses. In order to regain control over its supply chain, Boeing ultimately purchased Vought’s North Charleston plant (Lunsford, 2007; Sanders, 2009). Currently, Airbus is in the process of developing the A350, a plane that is designed to compete with the Dreamliner. Similar to Boeing, it “expects to outsource production of substantial chunks of the A350 to places as far-flung as China and Russia”, so Airbus also faces the challenge of finding suppliers that “have the technical know-how and manufacturing capacity to deliver what Airbus needs” (Matlack, 2008).

Other manufacturers face similar problems with their suppliers. Faulty speed sensors by airplane supplier Thales contributed to the crashing of an Airbus in June 2009, illustrating the importance of ensuring the quality of each outsourced part. Sprint was disappointed that its supplier IBM “failed to live up to expectation” (Jones, 2009), and it later rehired its former workers to perform the task in-house (Hepher, 2009); Toyota also found out that the suppliers that produce the most critical parts were not as reliable as it had originally thought (Nikoofal & Gumus, 2013). The Sprint and Toyota examples demonstrate that even outsourcing to presumably competent suppliers does not eliminate these risks, and manufacturers rather perform in-house than contract with incompetent suppliers. It is often difficult to assess a supplier’s capability, and recent work by Hasija, Pinker, and Shumsky (2008) suggests that future research should “examine the impact of information asymmetry in the reliability of the vendor”.

In this paper, we consider a scenario where a manufacturer needs to complete a task, and it must decide whether to perform the task in-house, or to outsource its completion to a supplier. In preparation of performing a task, firms often need to make substantial investments in capacity and employee training. If the associated costs are non-recoverable, switching suppliers might be prohibitively expensive. In addition, at times outsourcing requires the sharing of highly sensitive information. Finally, bringing back production in-house might be difficult once a firm has decided to outsource that task and has lost its in-house capabilities. In this paper, we assume that, once taken, a manufacturer will not reconsider the decision to outsource. The potential suppliers can either be of high type or of low type, where contracting with a high-type supplier is more profitable than contracting with a low-type supplier. Each supplier has private information about its type, and the manufacturer has a priori beliefs that any given supplier is of high type. There are two main problems when the manufacturer does not know what type of supplier it is facing. First, the manufacturer may only benefit from outsourcing if contracting with a high-type supplier, so the manufacturer cannot make the most profitable make-buy decision without knowing the suppliers’ type. Second, the supplier could leverage its private information to obtain higher profits, at the expense of the manufacturer. In order to mitigate these problems, the manufacturer could audit the supplier. An audit reveals the type of the audited supplier, providing the manufacturer a better basis for its make-buy decision. The manufacturer might also infer some information about the composition of the pool of unaudited suppliers. We consider a generalized updating technique where an audit of a low-type supplier reduces the manufacturer’s beliefs regarding the proportion of high-type suppliers in the remaining supply pool. Our research questions can be stated as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           When a manufacturer does not know the capabilities of its potential suppliers, should it perform the task in-house, outsource the task without knowing the suppliers’ capabilities, or audit any of the suppliers?

How is the manufacturer’s decision affected by how it updates its beliefs after an audit?

We develop a game theoretical model to solve the research questions.
                        2
                        We refer the reader to Fudenberg and Tirole (1991) for a detailed introduction to the concepts and terms of game theory.
                     
                     
                        2
                      We have three primary findings. First, one might expect that, if the manufacturer does not update its beliefs, the manufacturer’s decision should not be affected by the number of suppliers in the pool. We find that this intuition may not be true. In particular, we find that the manufacturer can follow the same strategy (auditing) for all but the last supplier. However, after auditing all but the last supplier, the manufacturer may find it optimal to outsource without auditing this supplier. Second, when the manufacturer updates its beliefs after an audit, we anticipate two opposing drivers that affect when the manufacturer performs in-house without auditing any supplier. On one hand, one might expect that performing in-house should become less attractive as the number of available suppliers increases as the manufacturer might find it more likely that one of the suppliers is of high-type. On the other hand, the more pessimistic the manufacturer becomes after negative audit outcomes, the less profitable the audit strategy is going to appear, increasing how often the manufacturer finds it optimal to perform in-house. Interestingly, we find that the probability with which the manufacturer finds it optimal to perform in-house is affected neither by the number of available suppliers, nor by how the manufacturer updates its beliefs. Lastly, when the manufacturer becomes more pessimistic about the proportion of high-type suppliers in the remaining supply pool, it may find outsourcing without knowing the suppliers’ capability more attractive.

This paper is structured as follows. We review the related literature in the next section. Section 3 describes the mathematical model. Section 4 presents the results for the general model for the case where the manufacturer does not update its beliefs regarding the composition of the supplier pool. In Section 5 we analyze the case where the manufacturer updates its beliefs after each audit. We suggest an application of the general model and thereby illustrate our results in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7 with a discussion of our findings and of potential areas for future research. Details of the game sequence of the application discussed in Section 6 and the derivation of the equilibrium solutions are given in Appendix A. Appendix B provides the proofs for all results given in the text.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is a stream of research that investigates a manufacturer’s use of inspections to reveal the contribution of a supplier in a moral hazard environment (e.g., Baiman, Fischer, & Rajan, 2000; Balachandran & Radhakrishnan, 2005; Hwang, Radhakrishnan, & Su, 2006). In our paper the suppliers’ capability are private information (adverse selection), and the manufacturer can audit the supplier to reveal its type. There is also research that studies the value of information when the supplier’s capability is not known, where the capability can involve inventory holding cost (e.g., Corbett, 2001), capacity cost (e.g., Cachon & Zhang, 2006) or the supplier’s reliability (e.g., Yang, Aydın, Babich, & Beil, 2009). The problems studied in this literature are similar to our problem, where the manufacturer decides between outsourcing without knowing the supplier’s type and basing the outsourcing decision on the audit outcome. However, this stream of research does not examine the make-buy decision.

There are several studies that investigate the make-buy decision under information asymmetry, examining a similar tradeoff as that studied in our paper between performing in-house and outsourcing without knowing the supplier’s type. Richmond and Seidmann Andrew (1992) consider the case where an internal staff (user group) knows the value of effort, but not its cost; an external firm (external development group), on the other hand, knows the cost of effort but not its value. Assuming that the internal staff is paid a fixed salary while the external firm is paid according to the outcome, they show that the internal staff is not as motivated to exert effort as the external firm. When performing in-house, we assume that the upper management knows the capability of its employees and can properly motivate them to exert the desired effort. Hence, for equal capabilities, the firm is better off performing in-house. Sridhar and Balachandran (1997) consider the case in which the internal and external agents are equally cost effective and uncertainties originate from the task environment, about which the internal employee has more information than the external employee. In a software development setting, Wang, Barron, and Seidmann (1997) investigate a firm’s outsourcing strategy in the presence of information asymmetry regarding user valuation and developer costs. They find that the manufacturer should outsource only if the external developer has a significant cost advantage. In our paper, the concept of capability can entail various dimensions, such as cost and how well the individual component can integrate with the product. The manufacturer then may outsource even if its suppliers are less cost effective.


                     Nikoofal and Gumus (2013) compare the effectiveness of the incentive- and audit-based approaches under information asymmetry. Auditing allows the manufacturer to control the supplier’s effort and to provide more information about the supplier’s type. They find that auditing is optimal when the supply chain partners’ incentives for improving the system’s reliability are not aligned, or when the degree of information asymmetry is high. Wan and Beil (2009) study the audit decision under the availability of an outside option, e.g., performing in-house. They examine how much the manufacturer should audit the supplier, assuming that all suppliers are identical ex ante, and the manufacturer and the suppliers are equally unsure about the probability that any given supplier is qualified. In our paper, we examine whether or not the manufacturer should audit, and the suppliers are privileged with additional information about their own types.

There is also research that studies the operational implications of learning about suppliers’ capabilities. Valluri and Croson (2005) consider the supplier selection problem when the manufacturer does not know the capabilities of its available suppliers, and how to motivate the capable suppliers. They use reinforcement-based models, assuming that the suppliers do not know which action to take in any given state and find the long-run profit maximization decision through learning. However they do not consider the make-buy decision. Using a Bayesian approach to update beliefs, Tomlin (2009) investigates how the uncertainty regarding a supplier’s reliability affects the manufacturer’s sourcing and inventory strategies. However he does not consider the possibility that the manufacturer can learn a supplier’s type through an audit.

Consider a manufacturer M that needs to perform a task. There are N suppliers, which are arbitrarily numbered from 1 to N. We use a game theoretic approach and the game consists of up to N stages. Without loss of generality, we assume the manufacturer considers the suppliers in the order of their indices, and define stage 
                        
                           i
                           (
                           1
                           ⩽
                           i
                           ⩽
                           N
                           )
                        
                      as the stage where the manufacturer is at the point of considering supplier i. Each supplier is either of high type or of low type, and we assume that a high-type supplier is more capable than a low-type supplier, such that for any given contract, a high-type supplier can derive a better payoff than a low-type supplier. The suppliers are not identical, but since the manufacturer has limited information about the suppliers, ex ante the manufacturer believes that all suppliers are equally likely to be of high type. Given the outcome of an audit at stage 
                        
                           i
                           -
                           1
                        
                     , after updating the manufacturer believes that supplier i is of high type with probability 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     . At any given stage, the manufacturer must decide whether to (1) produce in-house, (2) outsource, or (3) audit the supplier under consideration. Similar to Wang et al. (1997), we assume that once the manufacturer has made the decision to outsource, it commits to this decision because sensitive information may have been shared or as adjustments would be prohibitively costly.

We assume that, under such complete information, the manufacturer is always better off outsourcing to a high-type supplier than to a low-type supplier:

                      is large, the manufacturer is relatively more capable and performing in-house becomes more profitable. The concept of capability can entail various dimensions, such as inventory holding cost, capacity cost or the suppliers’ reliability. We normalize

                              )
                              .
                           
                        
                     
                  

Alternatively, the manufacturer can outsource the task at stage i without knowing the supplier’s type (Strategy O), earning a profit of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 π
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           (
                           O
                           ,
                           ϕ
                           )
                        
                     . The manufacturer might disclose sensitive information (such as the specification of the design) during the process, so we assume that the manufacturer will present a contract that guarantees the supplier’s participation. However, since the supplier has private information about its type, it might sometimes earn a profit that exceeds its participation constraint, such as is the case for a high-type supplier under a two-part tariff contract. Note that we do not restrict our analysis to a particular contracting structure, so our results apply under a take-it-or-leave-it or a bargaining model, and under various contract types, such as a two-part tariff or a fixed payment scheme. The manufacturer profit under strategy O is independent of the capability of the manufacturer 
                        
                           ϕ
                        
                      because it does not perform the task under strategy O, i.e.,

                                    ∂
                                    
                                       
                                          π
                                       
                                       
                                          i
                                       
                                    
                                    (
                                    O
                                    ,
                                    ϕ
                                    )
                                 
                                 
                                    ∂
                                    ϕ
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0

Finally, the manufacturer has the option of auditing the supplier at stage i at a fixed cost K and making its decision based on the audit outcome. Since we focus on cases where 
                        
                           ϕ
                           <
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                              
                                 ¯
                              
                           
                        
                      (cf. Eq. (6)), when the audit shows that the supplier is of high type, the manufacturer will outsource. On the other hand, when the audit shows that the supplier is of low type, the manufacturer may either (1) perform in-house, (2) outsource to this low-type supplier, or (3) consider an un-audited supplier (if available) and repeat the strategy choice, i.e., move to stage 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                     . The manufacturer’s profit when outsourcing without knowing the supplier’s type is always higher than its profit when outsourcing knowing that the supplier is of low type (cf. Lemma A1 in Appendix B). Therefore, when the audit shows that the supplier is of low type and there is at least one unaudited supplier, the manufacturer will never find it optimal to contract with this low-type supplier. When the audit shows that the supplier is of low type and all suppliers are audited, the manufacturer should perform in-house, if it is sufficiently more capable 
                        
                           (
                           ϕ
                           >
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                              
                                 ̲
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , and outsource to the low-type supplier otherwise (cf. Eq. (5)).

When the manufacturer chooses to perform in-house or outsource at stage i, the game never reaches stages 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           N
                        
                     . When the manufacturer chooses to audit at stage i and if the audit outcome shows that the supplier is of low type, the game continues to stage 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                     , if there is at least one un-audited supplier 
                        
                           (
                           i
                           <
                           N
                           )
                        
                     ; the manufacturer either performs in-house or outsources to this supplier if all suppliers are audited 
                        
                           (
                           i
                           =
                           N
                           )
                        
                     .

Assume the manufacturer has capability level 
                        
                           ϕ

                           1
                        
                      to N. The manufacturer then decides which strategy

                           ∈

We are using backward induction to solve the game. Specifically, we first consider the optimal decision at the last stage, thus anchoring the induction (Lemma A2). We then use mathematical induction over i to show that, if the result is true at stage i, it must also hold at the previous stage

In this section, we present the results for the case where the manufacturer does not update its beliefs after an audit. This scenario is a benchmark and a building block used in deriving the results for the model with updating. Throughout this section, since the manufacturer believes that all suppliers are ex ante identical, we drop the subscript i and use

One might expect that if the manufacturer does not update its beliefs, the manufacturer’s decision should not be affected by the number of potential suppliers. However, we find that this intuition may not be true. Consider the case where the manufacturer’s capability is sufficiently low and the audit cost is intermediate (i.e.,

                     ). When there are at least two unaudited suppliers, the manufacturer audits because it is still possible to contract with a high-type supplier even if the audit reveals that the supplier is of low type. However, when there is only one unaudited supplier (stage N), the only option after a negative audit outcome (then implying that none of the suppliers is of high type) is to perform in-house or to outsource to a low-type supplier. Since the manufacturer’s capability is relatively low and the audit cost is non-trivial 
                        
                           (
                           K

                           )
                        
                     , the manufacturer should outsource without auditing the last supplier to take advantage of the supplier’s higher expected capability and to save the audit cost.


                     Corollary 1 considers the special case when there are infinitely many suppliers. Besides being illustrative, this can be taken as an approximation to the scenario where the manufacturer makes the outsourcing decision for a simple task such that there are many potential suppliers.

Even when there are infinitely many suppliers, the probability with which the manufacturer finds it optimal to perform in-house or to outsource without auditing any of the suppliers does not change (cf. Corollaries 1a, b). However, Corollary 1c states that if the manufacturer audits, it always audits until encountering a high-type supplier. This implies that when the manufacturer is not very capable and the audit cost is intermediate (i.e.,

                     ), the manufacturer may never learn the type of a supplier before employing it when the number of suppliers is limited (finite), whereas it will always find out the contracted supplier’s type when the number of suppliers is very large (infinite). When the number of suppliers is small (limited) and when there is only one unaudited supplier, the only option after a negative audit outcome is to perform in-house or to outsource to a low-type supplier. Hence the manufacturer should outsource without auditing the last supplier to take advantage of the supplier’s higher expected capability and to save the audit cost (cf. Discussion around Proposition 1d). However, when the number of suppliers is large (infinite), there always is another unaudited supplier. Hence, when the audit cost is not too high, the manufacturer will always audit until finding a high-type supplier.

In this section, we investigate the case where the manufacturer adjusts its beliefs based on the audit outcomes. When an audit shows that the current supplier is of low type, the manufacturer turns more pessimistic regarding the capabilities of the remaining (unaudited) suppliers. Rather than restricting our analysis to a particular updating technique (e.g., Bayesian updating), we consider a general model where the manufacturer reduces its estimated proportion of high-type suppliers in the remaining supply pool

                     . Clearly it is not possible to completely characterize the optimal strategy, but we derive some interesting structural properties in Proposition 2. Throughout this section, we focus on how belief updating affects the manufacturer’s decision, and we use the results from Section 4 as a benchmark for our discussion. We use the terms “increase” and “decrease” in the weak sense.
                        Proposition 2
                        
                           Updating beliefs affects the manufacturer’s decision at stage 1 as follows:
                           
                              
                                 a.
                                 
                                    The manufacturer performs in-house with belief updating if and only if it performs in-house without belief updating.
                                 


                                    If the manufacturer outsources without updating, then it also outsources with updating.
                                 


                                    If the manufacturer audits with updating, then it also audits without updating.
                                 

Since the manufacturer decreases its beliefs after auditing a low-type supplier, and since the profit under the audit strategy depends on the future values of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     , the manufacturer expects auditing to be less profitable than under the scenario where the manufacturer does not adjust its beliefs. Moreover, at the first stage the manufacturer expects the same profits from performing in-house and from outsourcing as in the case without updating, because the manufacturer starts with the same beliefs 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . Consequently, one might expect that the manufacturer would more often find it optimal to perform in-house or to outsource without auditing any supplier. This intuition holds for the cases where the manufacturer outsources without auditing any supplier (Proposition 2b). Interestingly, however, Proposition 2a states that whether the manufacturer adjusts its beliefs or not does not affect the relative profitability of performing in-house without auditing any supplier compared to the other two strategies. Consider the parameter settings where

                     , for which the manufacturer performs in-house without auditing any supplier when it does not update its beliefs after auditing a low-type supplier. The fact that the manufacturer reduces its beliefs does not change its expected profit for strategies I and O, but decreases its expected profit for the auditing strategy at the first stage (cf. Lemma A3 in Appendix B); hence the manufacturer continues to perform in-house even when it updates its beliefs. When

                     , the manufacturer’s capability is lower and the manufacturer prefers outsourcing to performing in-house at the first stage, irrespective of whether it updates its beliefs or not. Finally, note from Lemma A2 in Appendix B that the manufacturer deploys the audit strategy when 
                        
                           K
                           <
                           
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 ̃
                              
                           
                           (
                           ϕ
                           )
                        
                      for the single-supplier scenario. Having multiple suppliers to select from makes the audit strategy more profitable without changing the profitability of performing in-house. Therefore, the manufacturer in this case would not perform in-house for the multiple-supplier scenario, either. Consequently, together with Proposition 1, we show that if the manufacturer performs in-house or outsources when it is not updating beliefs in multiple supplier scenarios, it would perform the same strategy regardless of how many suppliers are available and regardless of whether it updates its beliefs after audits.

At the first stage, auditing becomes less attractive under belief-updating (cf. Proposition 2c) as outsourcing becomes more attractive and the attractiveness of performing in-house remains the same.

Recall that, for the case where the manufacturer does not update its beliefs, it would never perform in-house or outsource without knowing the supplier’s type, except at the last stage. This is because the manufacturer has no reason to gather information (through audits), if this information is not going to be used at a later stage. However, when the manufacturer updates its beliefs on the probability of contracting with a high-type supplier after a negative audit outcome, the manufacturer not only knows the type of the audited supplier but also learns something about the composition of the unaudited pool of suppliers. Assume the manufacturer audits at stage i. After a negative audit outcome, the manufacturer becomes more pessimistic that the remaining (unaudited) suppliers are of high type. Recall that the profit for the auditing strategy is a function of (1) the profit when outsourcing to a high-type supplier under complete information, and (2) the profit for stage 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                      (cf. Eq. (8)). On one hand, since the manufacturer decreases its beliefs 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      and the profit when outsourcing to a high-type supplier under complete information is larger than the profit for stage 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                     , we find that the profit for the auditing strategy is decreasing from stage i to stage 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                     . On the other hand, from stage i to 
                        
                           i
                           +
                           1
                        
                     , the manufacturer expects the same profit from performing in-house, and its expected profit under outsourcing decreases at a slower rate than the expected profit of auditing. Hence, at stage i, we find that the manufacturer may either perform in-house, outsource without knowing the supplier’s type or audit.

In this section, we illustrate our key results by applying our model to a specific example. Note that the following is just one of many possible interpretations and applications of our model. Generally, our results apply, as long as contracting with a high-type supplier is more profitable than contracting with a low-type supplier (e.g., a high-type supplier may have lower cost, higher return on effort, lower variability, etc.).

Consider the case where the manufacturer has

                                 e

                           4

                           )
                        
                     . The manufacturer’s payoff is proportional to the effort exerted into performing the task. For example, training initiatives to achieve expertise (employee training) or production process improvements (e.g., infrastructure investment) are all associated with costly effort and enable increases in the quality of the output. The manufacturer then benefits from larger effort. Various industry certifications can provide information about the cost effectiveness of the suppliers, so we assume that the suppliers’ costs are common knowledge and the manufacturer only consider suppliers that have lower production costs than the manufacturer. In particular, we assume that

                     , the superior the suppliers are in terms of cost effectiveness compared to the manufacturer.

When the manufacturer performs the task in-house, this task can seamlessly integrate with the manufacturer’s other existing tasks. However, when outsourcing to a supplier, the manufacturer faces uncertainty of whether or not the delivered task can integrate well with other parts of the project. To motivate this uncertainty in integration capability, consider the Boeing example. It is reasonable to expect that Boeing outsourced to Vought because of Vought’s lower cost. However, one reason for the resulting problems is that the components delivered by Vought did not integrate well with Boeing’s other parts, forcing Boeing to incur substantial rework cost. In this application, when outsourcing to a supplier, the manufacturer incurs a rework cost 
                        
                           
                              
                                 y

                      due to such integration issues. We assume that the high-type suppliers are those that are committed to perform the tasks in a way that allow seamless integration with the other parts of the project 
                        
                           (

                           0
                           )
                        
                     , while the low-type suppliers’ deliveries require rework 
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 y
                              
                              
                                 L

                           1
                           )
                        
                     . Moreover, we assume that initially the manufacturer has no information about the supplier’s type and therefore assumes that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        
                     . The manufacturer audits suppliers specifically to evaluate their integration capabilities. A manufacturer who audits and updates its beliefs then can be interpreted as one who is looking beyond the suppliers’ mere cost advantage to integration ability.

Assume that the manufacturer offers a take-it-or-leave-it contract as a Stackelberg leader. A supplier only participates if its payoff under participation is expected to be no smaller than its reservation payoff, which we normalize to zero. When the manufacturer knows the supplier’s type and outsources, it presents a two-part tariff that guarantees the supplier’s participation. When the manufacturer outsources without knowing the supplier’s type, it proposes a menu of two two-part tariffs that guarantees the supplier’s participation and self-selection. This menu of two two-part tariffs reveals the supplier’s integration capability, as a contract designed for a high-type supplier would only be attractive to a high-type supplier and not acceptable to a low-type supplier, thus avoiding the scenario where the supplier falsely signals high integration capabilities. Under any contract, a high-type supplier would have a larger payoff than a low-type supplier.

The detailed game sequences, payoff functions and the derivation of the equilibrium are given in Appendix A. The complete characterization of the optimal solution is given in Appendix B.

The results of Proposition 3a imply that the attractiveness of auditing the first supplier decreases when the manufacturer updates its beliefs after observing the outcome of an audit, as belief updating increases the attractiveness of outright outsourcing, but does not affect the probability of performing in-house.

Assume that the manufacturer has audited the first supplier and has found this supplier to be of low type. Without belief updating, the manufacturer then would never perform in-house (cf. Proposition 1). When the manufacturer updates its beliefs, a negative audit outcome makes the manufacturer more pessimistic regarding the second supplier’s capabilities, and it lowers its expectations regarding the payoff associated with outsourcing or with auditing this second supplier. Interestingly, the result of Proposition 3b implies that the attractiveness of outsourcing to the second supplier can increase under incomplete information even if the manufacturer is pessimistic that this supplier is of high type. One possible explanation is as follows. Recall that we use the Bernoulli distribution to describe the beliefs on the supplier’s type, such that supplier i is of high type with probability

                      measures the uncertainty in the manufacturer’s beliefs regarding a supplier’s type. Initially, the manufacturer is least certain about the supplier’s type because 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           50
                           %
                        
                     . Then, at the second stage, updating brings the manufacturer’s beliefs further away from 
                        
                           50
                           %
                        
                     , such that it decreases the manufacturer’s uncertainty regarding the supplier’s type. When the manufacturer outsources to the second supplier without knowing its type, the supplier can collect information rent (i.e., the supplier collects more than its reservation payoff): the manufacturer has to offer the high-type supplier a more favorable contract, resulting in a lower manufacturer payoff. However, if this effect is sufficiently small, the manufacturer might find it more attractive to outsource to a supplier of unknown capability to avoid the audit cost.

This application illustrates the two dimensions (cost effectiveness and integration capability) that the manufacturer should consider when making its outsourcing and auditing decisions. A manufacturer that focuses only on the suppliers’ cost advantage may outsource to a supplier whose products do not integrate well with other existing parts, implying potentially substantial extra costs for reworking the components from this supplier.

Our results might provide one possible explanation for the observation that motivated our research. Boeing outsourced the development of the rear fuselage to Vought because it focused on Vought’s lower manufacturing cost. However, it later became clear that the parts that Vought delivered were not integrating well with the other components. After this negative experience of contracting with a supplier, Boeing became more pessimistic regarding the remaining suppliers’ integration capabilities, so it brought back in-house a substantial portion of the tasks to eliminate exposure to the suppliers’ uncertain capabilities. Airbus now is at the stage of making a similar outsourcing decision. Our research suggests that if they focus on their suppliers’ cost advantage without considering their integration capability, they might inherit the same costly problems that Boeing experienced.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We investigate a manufacturer’s sourcing decision when the manufacturer does not know the capabilities of its potential suppliers. Not knowing a supplier’s type prevents the manufacturer from making the optimal make-buy decision, and it might allow the supplier to obtain a higher profit at the expense of the manufacturer. To mitigate these issues, the manufacturer can conduct audits to reveal the supplier’s type and to make inferences about the capabilities of the remaining suppliers. We find that the manufacturer’s strategy can be independent of the number of potential suppliers and of the mechanism it uses to update its beliefs after audits. Specifically, when the manufacturer does not update its beliefs, its optimal strategy is not affected by the number of available suppliers. Interestingly, when the manufacturer updates its beliefs after an audit, the settings for which performing in-house is optimal are not affected by how the manufacturer adjusts its beliefs or by the number of available suppliers. Our findings provide the following possible interpretation of Boeing’s experiences. When outsourcing to Vought, Boeing focused on cost aspects, but neglected the importance of other capabilities, for example, the ability of Vought’s deliverable to integrate well with the other components. The outcome of this supply-chain partnership thus did not turn out as well as Boeing hoped it would. After the negative experience Boeing turned more pessimistic regarding the remaining suppliers’ capabilities, so Boeing decided to perform the task in-house to avoid exposure to other suppliers’ uncertain capabilities. Our research suggests that if Boeing had not only focused on cost aspects, but also on the suppliers’ integration capability, it might have avoided the substantial costs it eventually incurred.

Our research is based on a stylized model, which allows us to structure the problem and derive clean analytical insights. Applying the insights derived from this stylized approach to the context of Boeings Dreamliner production, we illustrate that investments into seemingly tedious activities like auditing can actually be quite important. Nevertheless, relaxing some of our assumptions can provide interesting problems for future research. We assume that the suppliers are either of high type or of low type. One possible extension is to consider the scenario where the suppliers can be of multiple types and where the manufacturer decides how often to audit. We also assume that audits are perfect such that an audit always correctly identifies the type of a supplier. Baiman et al. (2000) suggests that firms may not be able to detect with certainty that a bad product is bad, so it could be interesting to consider an alternative model, where a high-type supplier may incorrectly be identified as a low-type supplier, and vice versa. For mathematical tractability, we assume that the manufacturer’s payoff from outsourcing is exogenous and fully determined by the supplier’s type. A possible avenue for future research is to consider the suppliers’ strategic reactions as well as supplier competition. Moreover, since the primary objective of our research is to study the impact on the manufacturer’s outsourcing strategy when the suppliers have private information about their capabilities, we abstract away from explicitly capturing that the characteristics of the task might be unknown to the suppliers. We consider a single period game, where the manufacturer does not have full information about the capabilities of the suppliers at the beginning of the game. We leave studying the issues that might arise when the manufacturer might lose the capability to perform the task if it has outsourced in an earlier period or when firms, in the contracting stage, take into account future partnership opportunities with the supplier as potential future research areas. Lastly, we do not capture the scenario where the manufacturer can exert effort to change the supplier’s capability or invest in reducing the cost of auditing. We suggest these problems for future research.

Details of the game sequence and the derivation of the equilibrium solutions are given in Appendix A. The logic of the proof is as follows. First, we define thresholds that characterize the relationships between profits under the different strategies. Then we consider the intersections of these thresholds. Lastly, we combine the insights on the different thresholds to prove the statements in the Proposition.

                              . This means that the manufacturer finds outsourcing more attractive at the first stage when

                               decreases.

Lastly, since the attractiveness of performing in-house remains the same and the attractiveness of outsourcing increases, the attractiveness of auditing decreases as
