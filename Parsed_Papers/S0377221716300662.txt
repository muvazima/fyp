                  We study incentive issues seen in a firm performing global planning and manufacturing, and local demand management. The stochastic demands in local markets are best observed by the regional business units, and the firm relies on the business units’ forecasts for planning of global manufacturing operations. We propose a class of performance evaluation schemes that induce the business units to reveal their private demand information truthfully by turning the business units’ demand revelation game into a potential game with truth telling being a potential maximizer, an appealing refinement of Nash equilibrium. Moreover, these cooperative performance evaluation schemes satisfy several essential fairness notions. After analyzing the characteristics of several performance evaluation schemes in this class, we extend our analysis to include the impact of effort on demand.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Today’s global organizations consolidate their manufacturing and supply chain operations to benefit from assembly, inventory pooling, commonality, substitution and resource flexibility strategies. In these global organizations, local markets are supported by global manufacturing and supply chain activities and the local functions are limited to supportive secondary activities such as sales and marketing, finance, local logistics, warehousing and custom operations. These organizations rely on their regional business units to connect with their local markets. Regional business units know their customers’ needs and local market conditions as well as how to run the local operations. This local market knowledge is important for a wide range of globally controlled decisions such as global planning of capacity, production and inventories. Setting the right incentive mechanisms for the local units to reveal the local market information truthfully is essential for global planning of operations and performance of the whole supply chain. In this paper, we study this issue.

The decentralized structure of local demand management coupled with global manufacturing and planning is typical for telecommunication equipment manufacturers. The primary customers of these firms are the major service providers in each country. As the customers and their buying behavior show large differences over different countries and drastic changes within each country, the firms often segment their business units according to the countries and each business unit has a special sales force focusing on the major service providers in the country. Standard forecasting techniques are not capable of forecasting the buying behavior of these big customers and the firms mainly rely on the insider information of the regional units to forecast future demand. On the manufacturing side, it is typical that final products require customer specific customization and calibration before it can be delivered. Once the products are assembled for a specific customer they cannot be used to satisfy the demand of another customer. For effective resource allocation and responsive order fulfillment, the manufacturing is mainly performed in two stages. The capacity build-up, material procurement and component production are done make-to-stock (MTS) fashion whereas final assembly of customer specific products are performed assemble-to-order (ATO) fashion after exact orders arrive from the customer. Component commonality, resource flexibility and production postponement are the common production strategies employed by these firms to move MTS-ATO boundary for cost reduction and delivery performance improvement. The effective management of the MTS part of these manufacturing systems heavily relies on the accuracy of the forecasts provided by the business units. To motivate the business units to collaborate in these activities, it is important to provide incentives that make sense economically and to ensure the business units that they are treated fairly. This setting is not specific to telecom industry and it can be observed in other industries in which the companies are selling to big customers having hard to predict buying behavior. An example is a computer manufacturer like Dell selling to big corporations.

We consider a model in which a firm sells a group of products that require the same production technology and share resources (i.e., components and production capacity) through multiple regional business units. The demand in each region is stochastic and best observed by the regional units. The firm is engaged in global planning and manufacturing activities and relies on the regional units’ forecasts for planning of capacity investment and component manufacturing, i.e., common resources (MTS part of the manufacturing system). In this decentralized setting, the firm faces several possible problems. Firstly, the information asymmetry, i.e., the regional units have superior information about the demand in their region, can create an adverse selection problem. If the firm does not have the right incentive structure that motivates the regional units to reveal their private information truthfully, global planning won’t be effective because of poor forecasts, and the firm’s profit drops. A common incentive scheme seen in practice is that the regional units are compensated proportionally to regional book profits. Although at first sight it may seem direct and reasonable, such mechanisms can create conflicts between individual units’ goals (achieve the maximum local performance) and the company’s goal (maximize the total system profit) if the company cannot find a way to effectively allocate the cost of undedicated resources which requirement is assessed based on regional forecasts. Perceiving that the available units will depend on their forecasts, business units usually inflate their forecasts to ensure adequate supply for their customers (see Mentzer and Moon, 2005, page 158). This behavior is well observed in many companies performing global planning activities. As a common reaction, the global planners try to estimate and incorporate this bias in business units’ forecasts in their final forecast for global planning. However, this results in constant gaming between the business units and the global planners. Secondly, business units should be treated fairly while being motivated for cooperative actions. This is especially important because unfair treatment might create wrong incentives and even result in irrational behavior among the business units. Although fairness can have different interpretations in different contexts, in our global planning context, basic expectations of the business units include that they are not worse of by being involved in global planning activities and no business unit has an a priori advantage, i.e., all business units should be treated the same. This is hard to guarantee every planning period under information asymmetry and fluctuating market conditions from one period to another. Finally, a moral hazard problem may arise. When the demand can be improved by extra effort of the business units, the firm would like the business units to exert an appropriate level of effort to stimulate demand. Without knowing the market conditions, the firm cannot effectively judge how much effort is put by the business units to achieve total customer orders. Hence, the effort level cannot be observed directly, nor indirectly via the communicated demand information. Many direct mechanisms are open to business units’ forecast manipulation who would like to signal bad market conditions and high effort level. A good design of mechanism should overcome all these problems.

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a mechanism to calculate regional book profits, to which regional business units’ compensation (or performance evaluation) will be tied. This mechanism has the following properties: It

                        
                           •
                           induces business units to share their private information truthfully (overcome adverse selection problem);

induces business units to exert costly effort appropriately (overcome moral hazard problem);

satisfies basic fairness requirements expected by the business units;

is descriptive: it can be communicated with the business units at the start of the planning period without announcing any parameters based on any prior beliefs;

does not require any external examiner or market maker;

uses the information available for the global planning activities only.

Mechanisms based on observed system status only (e.g., demand, revenues and costs) would usually fail to create right incentives because collective system performance is hard to be separated from individuals’ real contributions in this way, e.g., allocation of the cost of common resources. We develop and propose a class of performance evaluation schemes (called cooperative performance evaluation schemes, CPES for short) to do the job. The proposed mechanisms are inspired by cooperative game theory that deals with similar problems in different settings. We show that CPES’s based on the Shapley value and Equal Surplus Division satisfy all the basic characteristics we listed above. Another important property of these CPES’s is that they turn the business units’ demand revelation game into a potential game in which truth telling is the potential maximizer, an appealing refinement of the Nash equilibrium concept. We also derive a set of sufficient conditions for a CPES to have this property. Moreover, we show that if the business units’ effort improve the demand in an additive way, CPES’s based on the Shapley value and Equal Surplus Division create the right incentives for the business units to work at least as hard as they would when working by themselves.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a brief literature review. In Section 3, we present the newsvendor networks. This is followed by Section 4, which considers the global planners problem after receiving the business units’ signal about the demand. In Section 5, we present the business units’ demand revelation game under a given performance evaluation scheme. The proposed performance evaluation schemes are introduced in Section 6 where we also analyze in detail the characteristics of these schemes. In Section 7, we extend our analysis to the setting with effort-dependent demand. We conclude in Section 8 with a summary and discussion of the results. The proofs are given in an online technical appendix together with an introduction to both cooperative and noncooperative game theory.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Firms perform global planning and manufacturing activities in order to benefit from inventory pooling, component commonality, resource flexibility and substitution strategies. Potential benefits of these strategies have been extensively studied in operations management literature, e.g., see (Chang & Lin, 1991; Chen & Lin, 1989; Eppen, 1979) and (Robinson, 1993) for inventory pooling; Gerchak and Henig (1989) and Van Mieghem (2004) for component commonality; Van Mieghem (1998) and Rudi and Zheng (1997) for flexible manufacturing, and Bassok, Anupindi, and Akella (1999) and Netessine and Rudi (2003) for substitution. Van Mieghem and Rudi (2002) provide a unified framework (called newsvendor networks) to study these strategies in a stylized model and establish the structures of optimal inventory and capacity investment policies. We use their framework in this paper. This literature assumes central control under full information about the underlying demand process. In our study, we specifically study the adverse selection problem where the central controller (global planner in our case) does not have full information about demand processes but relies on the feedback from regional units.

Our research falls into a scarce but growing body of research in the area of “marketing-operations interface”. Conflicts and incentive issues between marketing and manufacturing have been reported and discussed in early operations management literature (see Ackoff, 1967; Groves and Loeb, 1978; Shapiro, 1977 and Hausman & Montgomery, 1985). This is followed by papers studying incentive problems in detail and designing incentive mechanisms to coordinate effort in decentralized functions (e.g., marketing and production). There are two modeling approaches pursued in the literature. The first body of literature employs principle-agent models in which the firm acting as the principal sells it’s products through the agent and pays for this service. Dearden and Lilien (1990) study a firm’s problem of designing incentive plans to promote early sales to benefit from the production learning effect and improve costs in the subsequent periods. Porteus and Whang (1991) consider a multi-product newsvendor model with multiple marketing managers and one manufacturing manager. The paper focuses on two incentive plans and discusses their respective effects on the chosen effort levels of the managers and the owner’s profit. Kouvelis and Lariviere (2000) generalize the model of Porteus and Whang (1991) and propose a coordination mechanism in which the principal acts as a market maker and determines the coordinating transfer payments. Chen (2000) studies the salesforce’s effort and its effect on demand variability. The proposed compensation mechanism is shown to smooth the demand process, and hence, improve sales and costs by giving correct incentives to the salesforce to exert their effort accordingly. More recent papers also study incentive issues resulting from information asymmetry. In a production and inventory planning setting, Chen (2005) analyzes a firm’s problem of how to provide incentives to the salesforce such that they disclose their demand information truthfully and work hard, hence, addressing both adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The proposed solution is a menu of linear contracts. In the second modeling approach, the firm acting as a global coordinator would like to maximize the firm’s profit and similar incentives issues (between manufacturing and sales channels) are dealt with via appropriate bonus schemes. Mallik and Harker (2004) study capacity allocation problems in the semiconductor industry and propose a rewarding mechanism for the manufacturing managers and product manufacturers to reveal their true forecast about random capacity and random demand, respectively. In a similar setting but under deterministic capacity, Karabük and Wu (2005) devise a two-part tariff mechanism, where the side payments are a function of production managers revealed forecasts. In this study, we follow the latter modeling approach, which is more appropriate for our global planning setting as the global planner and business unit managers are employees with fixed salaries and it is assumed to be their bonuses tied to their performances that determine their strategic behavior. However, our work is different in several directions from this literature. In terms of modeling assumptions, this literature assumes fixed capacities whereas in our global manufacturing setting, capacity is a decision variable of the global planner. In terms of proposed solutions, we follow a completely different approach and we propose cooperative performance evaluation mechanisms.

Although the motivation of studying our problem comes from a firm’s internal operations (marketing and productions)
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        This problem is observed by one of the authors while he was working for a major telecom equipment manufacturer
                     , the resulting model is relevant to study incentive issues for coordination of decentralized supply chains. Similar mechanisms based on concepts borrowed from cooperative game theory have been proposed to study such problems. Anupindi, Bassok, and Zemel (2001) consider a decentralized supply chain of multiple retailers without information asymmetry. In their model, retailers place their orders competitively and then make cooperative transshipment decisions. Inspired by the concepts in cooperative game theory, they derive a profit-allocation mechanism, based on dual prices in the transshipment problem, that leads to core allocations. However allocation based on dual prices does not guarantee first best solution, i.e., does not induce equilibrium order quantities that are optimal for the entire system. They show that a fractional allocation mechanism with transfer payments based on realized demand can achieve first best as well as results in a core allocation for the second stage cooperative game. Granot and Sošić (2003) extend their model by considering an intermediate stage in which the retailers decide how much of their excess inventory/demand they want to share with others. After showing that the mechanisms based on dual prices might not induce the retailers to share their entire excess inventory/demand, they show that the Shapley value and the fractional rule have this property, however, only fractional rule can guarantee the first best solution. Although we consider a slightly different supply chain setting, achieving first best solution in this setting is equivalent to achieving truth telling under information asymmetry, that is why any fractional allocation also induces truth telling in our model with information asymmetry. However, satisfying individual rationality by determining correct fractions is problematic under information asymmetry. Therefore, this paper contributes to this body of literature by identifying an allocation mechanism to achieve first best under information asymmetry while satisfying individual rationality for a slightly different supply chain setting. There is a growing literature studying inventory cooperation in newsvendor settings (Hartman, Dror, & Shaked, 2000; Müller, Scarsini, & Shaked, 2002; Özen, Erkip, & Slikker, 2012a; Özen, Fransoo, Norde, & Slikker, 2007; Özen, Sošić, & Slikker, 2012b; Slikker, Fransoo, & Wouters, 2005) and inventory cooperation with joint replenishment (Anily & Haviv, 2007; Drechsel & Kimms, 2011; Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, & Mosquera, 2015; Meca, Timmer, García-Jurado, & Borm, 2004). Dror and Hartman (2011) and Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011) provide recent reviews of cooperative inventory models. This body of literature mainly focuses on the benefit allocation problem using cooperative game theory. This research also contributes to the cooperative newsvendor literature by identifying mechanisms that can induce effective information sharing.

Designing mechanisms that provide incentives for effective information sharing are also studied in decentralized supply chain settings that are different than ours. Cachon and Lariviere (1999) consider a decentralized supply chain in which the retailers have private demand information and the supplier has limited capacity. They show that truth-inducing mechanisms, which allocate the scarce capacity, can harm the whole supply chain. Özer and Wei (2006) analyze contracts that can induce successful forecast sharing. Recently, the effects of reputation building and behavioral factors like trust are studied by Ren, Cohen, Ho, and Terwiesch (2010) and Özer, Zheng, and Chen (2011), respectively.

Finally in this paper, we also study moral hazard problem if demand depends on effort. Building on the economics literature that studies moral hazard problem, e.g., Shavell (1979), Harris and Raviv (1978), Harris and Raviv (1979), Holmström (1979) and Holmström (1982), the sales force compensation problem has been widely studied in marketing literature e.g., Basu, Lal, Srinivasan, and Staelin (1985), Lal (1986), Lal and Staelin (1986), Rao (1990) and Raju and Srinivasan (1996) (see Coughlan, 1993 for a literature review). Different from this literature, we are dealing with adverse selection and moral hazard problems simultaneously in a production environment.

Consider a firm selling a group of products that require the same production technology and share resources (i.e., components and production capacity) through multiple (regional) business units. The demand in each region is stochastic and best observed by the regional units. The firm and the regional units interact in a leader-follower setting. The firm is the leader who designs and announces a performance evaluation scheme to evaluate the performance of regional units at the end of the planning period and performs global planning and manufacturing activities. The regional units are the followers who have private demand information and decide what to reveal as their demand forecasts, which will be used for global planning within the firm, to achieve high performance.

The global planning and manufacturing activities are managed by a global planner. We model the global planner’s problem as a newsvendor network as introduced by Van Mieghem and Rudi (2002). We refer to Van Mieghem and Rudi (2002) for a detailed discussion on newsvendor networks. Newsvendor networks are two-stage stochastic models with recourse. There are l different resources that consume m inputs (components) to produce n outputs (products). The manufacturing is done via p processing activities whereas the stocks are replenished by m ordering activities. We assume that the output of each processing activity is one type of product. As in the classical newsvendor problem, a global planner makes the capacity and ordering decision for the resources and components respectively receiving the demand forecast (demand distribution). Once the actual demand is known, the processing activities are chosen and end products manufactured to satisfy the demand. In the remainder of the paper, we assume that each business unit sells its own product type. This could be quite different products or could be interpreted as customer’s customization requirements on the same family of product. Note that this setting encompasses for example a multiple newsvendors setting, i.e., multiple business units selling one single product, which can be seen by considering a processing activity per business unit, where all the processing activities are identical except for the (label of the) end product.

We introduce newsvendor networks using the same notation as Van Mieghem and Rudi (2002).

Under information asymmetry, D is not fully observable to the global manufacturer and Di
                      is only fully known by business unit i. At the start of each planning period, each business unit reveals a demand distribution 
                        
                           
                              D
                              ¯
                           
                           i
                        
                      to the global planner. The global planner follows a standard procedure, which is known by every business unit, to make capacity and ordering decisions for the resources and components using the revealed distributions 
                        
                           
                              D
                              ¯
                           
                           i
                        
                     . After the demands are realised, the final production and sales also take place according to a publicly known procedure. The business units can strategically choose to lie and not to reveal their true demand distribution if they think that telling the truth will hurt their performance evaluated based on the performance evaluation scheme announced by the firm. In this setting, the following two conditions should be satisfied to maximise the firm’s expected total profit; (i) the production planning procedure that the global planner follows maximises the total expected profit given the business units reveal their true demand distributions, (ii) performance evaluation mechanism gives the right incentives such that the business units reveal their true demand information (i.e., distribution) and feel that they are treated fairly. The production planning procedure that satisfies the first condition is a well studied optimization problem and it is presented in Section 4. However, it is not easy to find a performance evaluation scheme that satisfies the second condition, which we study in this paper.

In each planning period, the sequence of events is as follows: (1) the firm announces a performance evaluation scheme; (2) the business units observe their private demand distributions and individually decide to what distributions to reveal to the global planner; (3) following the standard production planning procedure, the global planner makes the capacity and ordering decisions for the resources and components; (4) the actual demand is observed by the firm’s global planner and business units; (5) the global planner determines the levels of all processing activities according to the standard procedure and actual sales occur; (6) the performance of the business units is evaluated according to the pre-announced scheme.

The following example considers a typical global planning situation and we will revisit this example to demonstrate how the concepts and methods work throughout the paper.

                            for each business unit. Assume that D
                           1 and D
                           2 are independently distributed. Each product requires 1 unit of input material at a cost of 1. Each business unit sells its product at price 3 and there are no processing costs. Moreover, holding cost for an unused material is 0.5 and penalty cost of missing to satisfy a demand is 2.

We remark that the business units can reveal any type of distribution but for the sake of simplicity, we assume that they reveal only a normal distribution. However they can choose to lie and reveal a mean and a standard deviation that are different than μi
                            and σi
                           . Having only this information on hand, the global planner can only use the revealed information while making global planning decisions.

Next, we will study the global planner’s production planning procedure and business units’ problems in more detail.

The global planner’s objective is to maximize the expected total supply chain profit. First, consider the complete group of business units N. The planner first chooses capacity

The global planner uses the revealed demand distributions by the business units for ex-ante capacity and inventory decisions by maximizing Eq. (2). The realization of the actual demand is also observable by the global planner and he/she optimally chooses the ex-post processing activities by solving the optimization problem in (1). We remark that, for capacity K and inventory S, the real system expected profit is given by π
                     
                        N, D
                     (K, S), i.e., evaluated via true underlying demand D rather than revealed demand 
                        
                           D
                           ¯
                        
                     . Therefore the optimal decisions that maximize the firms expected total profit can only be taken by the global planner if the business units reveal their true demand distributions.

                      be the set of possible demand realization vectors. Then, a performance evaluation scheme (PES) can be defined as a function 
                        
                           g

                      that assigns a performance level to each business unit for the execution of ex-post and ex-ante decisions based on their revealed demands and the demand realization vector. This framework allows for a wide variety of performance evaluation schemes including for example: every business is assigned its own revenue or joint profit is split according to revenue per business unit, etc.

Next, we will study the business units’ problem under a given PES and discuss in detail the requirements that a firm expects from a PES to be satisfied.

Once a PES is communicated with the business units then, for every vector of distributions, the business units can compute their expected performance. This naturally leads to the definition of the class of noncooperative newsvendor games with demand revelation. Preliminaries on noncooperative game theory can be found in Appendix A.2.

In this game, payoff functions are the expected performance level under the pre-announced performance evaluation scheme. As being subject to the global planning activities, the business units strategically reveal their private information to achieve a maximum expected performance level. In this situation, determining the performance evaluation scheme plays a crucial role to motivate the business units to reveal their private demand information truthfully. This is also the main property that we expect every PES satisfies. We remark that this property is in fact a property of not only the PES g, but of noncooperative game Λ

Because of financial and operational reasons, in many organizations the cost centers (manufacturing and logistic operations) and revenue centers (sales and marketing) are operating under separate units and evaluated individually. In such organizations, a natural way of measuring the performance of a business unit performing sales activities is to use the revenue or margin generated directly in the region.

However, such mechanisms can create wrong incentives for the business units knowing that the resources are limited and they are not kept responsible for the cost related consequences of their communicated sales projections (forecasts). Shortage gaming type of behavior in which business units overstate their anticipated demand seems to be inevitable. To overcome this issue, a performance evaluation scheme could take the costs into account as well as revenues. For this purpose, a natural way would be to asses the contribution of each business unit to the total system profit efficiently at the end of the planning period. Therefore, we expect that each PES satisfies the following efficiency property:

A performance evaluation scheme is called efficient if it satisfies Property B.

Another important factor that is needed to be taken into account is fairness, i.e., the performance evaluation scheme should be able to evaluate the performance of the business units in a fair manner. Fairness can have different interpretations. In our global planning setting, we are especially interested in the following notion: being included in global planning activities, the business units should be able to achieve a higher performance than what they could have achieved if the global planner plans for them separately. In our global planning setting, this can be interpreted as a participation constraint. The global planner plans for joint resources (i.e., capacity and components) for efficient use of these resources. If the business units think that they are treated unfairly and have doubt about their performance measurement, they can always ask for individual planning for dedicated resources and exclude themselves from global planning activities. This argument poses a natural requirement (what we call participation constraint) on the performance evaluation scheme. We formally describe the participation constraint as Property C below.

                        Property C
                        The performance evaluation scheme should guarantee higher performance assignment than the business units could achieve if they are planned separately. In other words:

We remark that Property C poses a constraint for the true demand distribution D only since we are interested in truth inducing performance evaluation schemes. Moreover, the optimization problem on the righthand side of Eq. (5) represents the maximum expected profit for business unit i if the global planner plans for dedicated capacity and component inventory using the true demand distribution and charges all relevant costs to business unit i at the end of the planning period. We remark that this participation constraint does not guarantee better performance for each demand realization but guarantees that the business units wont be worse off in the long run, i.e., they will be better off in expectation.

                        Example 3
                        Consider our previous example. Firstly, we discuss the efficiency requirement of PES. Suppose that the firm announced PES g to evaluate business units’ performances. Moreover, suppose that the business units reveal their true demand distributions, i.e.,

If we only focus on Property A without the participation constraint in Property C, the set of schemes that induce truth telling is quite extensive. Any linear scheme, i.e., a scheme that divides the joint profit according to some fixed rates, would be truth inducing. For example, distributing the total performance of the system evenly among the business units would suffice. However, such a scheme is not necessarily practical and fair. The main issue is that how one can determine fair rates that would represent the upcoming contributions of the business units to the system performance. It is even hard to satisfy the participation constraint, possibly leading to complaints and even irrational behavior by the business units. Some realistic or fair rates could be determined by an external examiner, who evaluates up-front the potential contributions of the business units to the total system performance. However, in doing so, a cyclic reasoning is applied since to obtain these rates demand info is needed, whereas to obtain the demand information, the rates will be applied. To escape this cyclic reasoning, we require an effective performance evaluation scheme to do this profit allocation by itself.

On a high level, we can separate effective performance evaluation into a revenue and a cost part: (i) how to assess the individual revenue contributions of the business units to the system revenues; (ii) how to assess the individual cost impacts of the individual decisions (revealed forecasts in our case) of the business units. As for revenues, a natural way seems to be to look at direct sales materializing in each region. However, if resources are limited then regions serving secondary markets may well be assigned less resources implying that it is an imperfect way to measure the real performance in this way. From the cost side, a natural way of assigning the direct cost of production and components would be to the finished goods, specifically to the business units where the sale is materialized. However, it is not obvious how to assign the costs of unused capacity and component inventory to the business units. Summarizing, it is difficult to evaluate business units’ performances based on the realized demand or sales and total inventory only. The PES’s that we propose in the following section provide an answer to this difficulty.

As allocation is a central theme in cooperative game theory we will incorporate allocation rules and appealing properties from this literature. Appendix A.1 provides necessary preliminaries on cooperative game theory.

The difficulty of designing the required performance evaluation schemes based on the observed system status (e.g, demand, revenues, and costs) is that it reflects the collective system performance, which cannot be further separated to individuals’ real contributions. The same problem of how to assign the collective performance to individuals is also studied in cooperative game theory. Cooperative game theory provides several answers to this problem by considering the alternative coalitions as reference points. In this way, a cooperative game is constructed. The same approach can be used in our setting. Such an approach would work as follows: (1) while the global planner makes the capacity and inventory decisions for the system after receiving the business units’ demand distributions, he/she also determines coalition dependent capacity and inventory quantities for subcoalitions as if he/she is only planning for this subset of business units separately; (2) after the real demand is realized, these coalition dependent decisions can be used to calculate (fictive) performance levels for all coalitions. This what-if type approach provides good reference points for evaluating the contribution of each business unit and, hence, helps with evaluating the true performance level of each business unit. Next, we will discuss in detail how this approach can help us to design the required performance evaluation schemes.

Consider a nonempty collection of business units R ⊆ N, which will be called a coalition. Suppose that the global planner is only planning for the business units in coalition R. The planner first chooses capacity

                        Going back to our example. Suppose that the firm decide to use a CPES. In this example, we demonstrate how a demand realization game can be constructed to evaluate the business units performances per demand realization. In this two business unit situation, there are three possible coalitions:

Once the realization game is constructed, the firm can apply an allocation rule in cooperative game theory to assign a performance level to each business unit. Next we will study which allocation rule will help us to construct a CPES that has the required properties.

As we have already argued in the previous section, the selection of a CPES changes the demand revelation game the business units are playing. The firm is to design such a CPES that it would induce the business units to reveal their private information truthfully. Inducing the business units to play a particular strategy profile requires that: (i) the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium for the demand revelation game and (ii) in case there are multiple equilibria, that strategy profile is an appealing one (i.e., a refinement of Nash equilibrium). In many situations, selecting one from multiple equilibria is not obvious.

Potential games constitute a special class of games in strategic form with an appealing refinement of Nash equilibrium. A game in strategic form is a potential game if there exists a real-valued function on the strategy space, which exactly measures the difference in the payoff that accrues to a player if he unilaterally deviates. Potential games are defined by Monderer and Shapley (1996) as follows:

Potential games have nice properties that help in identifying Nash equilibria of the game. Moreover, these games have a natural refinement called the potential maximizer. The potential maximizer selects the set of strategy profiles that maximize the potential function P. As discussed by Monderer and Shapley (1996), this set is a subset of all Nash equilibria and a natural refinement.

The appeal of truth telling strategy profile being a potential maximizer can be explained as follows: (i) potential maximizer maximizes the potential function P, which can be seen as a common objective for the players. Hence, truth telling strategy becomes a natural selection (i.e., an appealing refinement) among possible equilibrium strategies. (ii) Truth telling equilibrium can be played in one shot as the players don’t need to know the other players strategies to calculate their best response. For example, consider an equilibrium in which each player shares an untruthful demand distribution. To be able to know the best untruthful distribution, each player needs to know what the other players’ untruthful distribution would be. On the other hand, to play the truth telling equilibrium, the players only need to know that others are telling the truth regardless what that truthful distribution is.

We will derive that ‘truth telling’ is a Nash equilibrium, even a potential maximizing strategy profile, in any newsvendor game with demand revelation in which the Shapley value is applied as cooperative performance evaluation scheme. First we need the following lemma.

Using realization games, we can restate the efficiency condition in (4) as:

Using the expected profit games, we can restate the participation constraint (Property C) as: For all i ∈ N,

                        Since the Shapley value satisfies individual rationality together with Lemma 1, (7) holds naturally for CPES based on the Shapley value. Following the same argument, (7), and hence Property C, holds under any allocation mechanism that satisfies linearity and individual rationality.

                           Example 5
                           Reconsider our example. Suppose that the firm decide to use a CPES based on the Shapley value. In the previous example, we demonstrated how to construct demand realization game for a demand realization. Suppose that the demand realization appears to be 
                                 
                                    d

                                       d
                                       1

                              . Then CPES based on the Shapley Value will evaluate the performance of the business unit i by the following formula:

                              As demonstrated here, using CPES based on the Shapley value, the firm can assign a performance level for each business unit for each demand realization. Moreover, it is easy to check that these assignment are efficient.

                               summarises the business units expected performances under four strategy profiles.

As seen in Table 2, revealing the true demand information is the Nash equilibrium since none of the business units can improve their expected performance by deviating from telling the truth unilaterally. Moreover, the participation constraint is satisfied, i.e.,

In the previous subsection, we showed that under a CPES based on the Shapley value allocation: (i) the truth telling strategy is a Nash equilibrium and (ii) it is even a potential maximizing strategy profile of the demand revelation game. Similar results can be obtained under different allocation mechanisms. We will first focus on (i). The following theorem gives sufficient conditions on an allocation rule for truth telling to be a Nash equilibrium in the resulting demand revelation game (recall that preliminaries on cooperative game theory can be found in Appendix A.1).

Next to the Shapley value, also the equal division (ED) rule and the equal surplus division (ESD) rule, described in Appendix A.1, satisfy not only efficiency and symmetry, but also coalitional monotonicity and linearity. The following theorem states that they satisfy the truth-telling condition as well.

We conclude that results for the Shapley value from the previous section can be derived for two relatively simple allocation rules, namely ED and ESD, as well. However, among these three rules, only the Shapley value and ESD have linearity and individual rationality together and, hence, satisfy participation constraint (7). However, (7) does not necessarily hold under ED, which does not have individual rationality.

The proposed performance evaluation mechanisms have the following practical implications. It is a common practice in many industries including Telecom that there is a target compensation level and target profit level that the business units are expected to achieve. The business units are compensated proportionally to the realised profit vs target profit level of the unit. The traditional way that the realized profit is calculated only accounts for the direct revenues and costs. However, direct accounting would give the wrong incentives to the business units in a global planning environment. Here, our results show that mechanisms that can account for the indirect contributions of the business units can give the right incentives to the business units to cooperate in a global planning framework. We propose that the business units are compensated proportionally to the chosen CPESs rather than the realized profit. Calculating a CPES brings additional accounting and record keeping. However, it also helps creating a collaborative environment by aligning the firm’s and business units’ incentives.

In the following section we will put the issue regarding which of the rules satisfies required fairness properties aside and start analyzing the three rules in a setting with effort-dependent demand.

In the previous section we discussed newsvendor games with demand revelation. We investigated several cooperative performance evaluation schemes that can induce the business units to share their private information truthfully. In this section we discuss how our results can be extended to the cases where the final demand depends on the business units’ effort.

We consider a setting as before except for an additional strategic action of a business unit. An effort level ai
                      is assumed to be chosen by a business unit i, having two effects. First, demand is increased and local costs are increased. This effort level is assumed to be determined decentrally and is not visible for the global planner. We incorporate this in the following definition.

                     . We remark that even though ai
                      seems to be an input (as it is called effort) in fact it could perhaps better be interpreted as an output, namely the effect of additional actions on demand. As demand cannot be increased ad infinitum by additional actions taken we incorporate a bound on this effect, 
                        
                           a
                           i

                              a
                              x
                           
                        
                     . We could see several types of behavior in our cost function si
                     . For example the marginal contribution of the effort to the demand might be increasing at low effort levels because of a cumulative effect of effort, leading to additional demand. This is in line with concave behavior of si
                     . For higher effort levels it might be harder and harder to obtain extra demand. This is in line with convex behavior of si
                     . We allow all such behaviors and require only continuity of si
                     .

In each planning period, the following events take place: (1) the firm announces a performance evaluation scheme; (2) the business units observe their private demand distributions and individually decide on the effort levels and what distributions to reveal to the global planner; (3) following the standard production planning procedure, the global planner makes the capacity and ordering decisions for the resources and components; (4) the business units exert their efforts and the actual demand is observed by the firm’s global planner and business units; (5) the global planner determines the levels of all processing activities according to the standard procedure and actual sales occur; (6) the performance of the business units is evaluated according to the pre-announced scheme.

To be able to analyze newsvendor networks with effort-dependent demand we need to extend several definitions to this richer setting. For capacity decision K, inventory levels S and a demand realization dN

The main results in the setting without effort dealt with potential maximizing strategy profiles. A necessary requirement for such results is that the underlying games are potential games. The following theorem shows that having added effort into our model does not take us outside the class of potential games.

Having established that our strategic form games are potential games, the next issue will be to identify potential maximizing strategy profiles. However, before doing so, we need a benchmark to evaluate the effort decisions of the business units. For demand revelation we have used truth-telling as a benchmark. For effort, an optimal effort level seems natural, but optimality of effort levels will, because of interaction effects in the newsvendor network, generally depend on the coalition under consideration. Having possible global pooling effects in mind in settings with higher demand, while costs of effort are local it might be too much to ask for a global optimum, but at the same time it seems reasonable to aim for effort levels at least equal to optimal individual effort levels. This is captured in the following definition.

                     depends continuously on ai, K, S. As expected revenues are bounded because of finiteness of E[D
                     0] and compactness of 
                        
                           E
                           ,
                        
                      expenses on K and S will stay below these maximum expected revenues as well. This naturally results in compact sets for K and S containing optimal choices for all effort levels. Consequently, the optimal effort level in Definition 10 is well-defined.

Consider a newsvendor network with effort-dependent demand Γ and any i ∈ N. This business unit may have several possibilities to produce, each with its own costs and benefits. We assume that each business unit has a profitable method to produce that is optimal, from a cost as well as a revenue perspective. This is captured in the following definitions and the subsequent assumption:

From the previous lemma it can be concluded that extra effort has a linear effect on the revenues of a coalition with one business unit. The following lemma states that the expected extra revenues for an arbitrary coalition are at least equal to the sum of the corresponding individual extra revenues as described in the previous lemma.

                            in Definition 10 would be chosen among the profit maximizing effort levels according to an arbitrary publicly known tie-breaking rule rather than as the minimal a weaker variant of Theorem 8 would result. As the strict inequality in the proof should then be replaced by a weak inequality one could only conclude that there exists a potential maximizing strategy profile having larger effort levels than the individual optimal ones. We also note that in a setting in which optimal effort levels are unique it holds that independent of the tie-breaking rule, 
                              
                                 a

                            is automatically the minimal optimal one, implying that all potential maximizing strategy profiles have larger effort levels than the individual optimal ones.

The following theorems deal with the other two cooperative performance evaluation schemes, equal surplus division and equal division. Both end up in potential games in a setting with strategic effort choice combined with demand revelation. However, where for equal surplus division it holds in line with our result for the Shapley value that optimal effort levels are at least equal to individual optimal effort levels, this is not true for equal division.

The results in this section have important interpretations. Due to the property in Lemma 5, we know that the optimal effort levels in the global planning environment are greater than or equal to optimal individual effort levels. The analysis in this section shows that the CPES’s based on the Shapley value and ESD provide incentives in the right direction (i.e., increasing effort levels compared to individual effort levels similarly as the optimal levels) whereas the CPES based on ED might lower the incentives of the business units to exert any effort to improve sales as demonstrated in Example 6. This observation indicates that CPES’s based on the Shapley value and ESD are more suitable for global planning environment with effort dependent demand than the CPES based on ED, although the chosen effort levels under them are not guaranteed to be optimal (i.e., they can be higher or lower than the optimal levels under global planning). Nevertheless, there are many open questions waiting to be answered in this respect and it is an important future research direction to study performance evaluation schemes that induce truth telling and optimal effort levels.

We study a demand revelation game in which firms perform global production and planning, while demand management is organized locally. Being in close contact with their customers, the business units have the most accurate information on the local markets and the firm relies on the forecast provided by the business units to globally manage production, capacity and inventories. In this decentralized setting, one common issue is how to align the incentives of the business units with the firms’ incentives and motivate them to reveal their private information truthfully.

We develop a group of performance evaluation mechanisms, called cooperative performance evaluation mechanisms, inspired by solution concepts from cooperative game theory. The proposed mechanisms do not require any parameter calculation based on prior beliefs at the start of the planning period, nor any external examiner or market maker. Moreover, they only use the information available for global planning activities. The effectiveness of these mechanisms is driven by the fact that they can evaluate and allocate the cost and revenues resulted by the forecasts provided by the business units efficiently, keep them responsible for their action, and align their incentives with the firm’s incentive. Under the proposed performance evaluation schemes, the demand revelation game of business units becomes a potential game and truth telling strategy is the potential maximizer, which is an appealing refinement of the Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the mechanisms based on the Shapley value and Equal Surplus Division motivate the business units to exert a higher effort level than they would do by not being involved in global production and planning. Although these two mechanisms achieve the same result for aligning the incentives of the business units, there exist differences if we consider computational effort required and other properties they satisfy. In terms of computational effort, the Shapley value requires computational effort that is growing exponentially with the number of business units whereas, for Equal Surplus Division, it increases linearly. On the other hand, the Shapley value is the only allocation satisfying efficiency, linearity, symmetry and zero player properties at the same time (Shapley, 1953), whereas Equal Surplus Division does not satisfy zero player properties but the others and some more (Moulin, 1987). While choosing among these mechanisms, priorities should be selected.
