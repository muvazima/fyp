                  Kansei evaluation plays a vital role in the implementation of Kansei engineering; however, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate customer preferences of a product’s Kansei attributes as such preferences involve human perceptual interpretation with certain subjectivity, uncertainty, and imprecision. An effective Kansei evaluation requires justifying the classification of Kansei attributes extracted from a set of collected Kansei words, establishing priorities for customer preferences of product alternatives with respect to each attribute, and synthesizing the priorities for the evaluated alternatives. Moreover, psychometric Kansei evaluation systems essentially require dealing with Kansei words. This paper presents a Kansei evaluation approach based on the technique of computing with words (CWW). The aims of this study were (1) to classify collected Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes by using cluster analysis based on fuzzy relations; (2) to model Kansei preferences based on semantic labels for the priority analysis; and (3) to synthesize priority information and rank the order of decision alternatives by means of the linguistic aggregation operation. An empirical study is presented to demonstrate the implementation process and applicability of the proposed Kansei evaluation approach. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed approach are also discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Successful new products contribute to financial and market performance measures and open up new opportunities for business. In today’s highly competitive and uncertain market environment characterized by short product life cycles, new product strategies have transformed from a product-push type to a market-pull model [1]. Companies must develop every aspect of product quality to satisfy customer requirements and maintain market success. Previous research has argued that a better understanding of the process that designers use to incorporate customer requirements into a product design is needed [2]. However, customer requirements and preferences for a product often vary. More specifically, different groups of customers have different requirements, and even customers in the same target group frequently have distinct preferences. Customer preference is often referred to as the degree to which an individual likes a product, and is considered a psychological construct that might be composed of perceptive, affective, and behavioral dimensions [3]. Consequently, it is a challenge for companies to devise ways to identify and measure the elements of such preference decisions with any accuracy and reliability [4]. Further confounding this challenge, the psychological preferences a customer responds to are conceptually vague with uncertainty determined by his/her inner perceptions and frequently presented in linguistic forms. However, perceptions are not readily observable using external tools, and so how to precisely extract preference patterns from linguistic data as well as objectively evaluate such data is an important issue for both academia and industry.

The term “Kansei” is a Japanese word that covers the meanings of sensibility, impression, and emotion. It is related to a customer’s physiological and psychological feelings and refers to the cognitive processes of human perception. Kansei engineering has been developed as a consumer-oriented technique to better understand customers’ emotional responses and further translate them into the design elements of a product [5]. This technology has been widely employed in various design fields over the past few decades [6–8]. Kansei evaluation is an important step in determining and substantiating the degree of customer preferences prior to the utilization and application of Kansei engineering. Many studies have conducted Kansei evaluation in which statistical analysis associated with the semantic differential (SD) method is widely employed to quantify human perception and establish an understanding of Kansei preferences [9–12]. Conventional statistical analysis methods used with Kansei evaluation (e.g., correlation coefficient analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis) assume that customer preferences increase or decrease linearly as improving or worsening product attributes. However, in many cases, these preferences can be a non-linear pattern due to uncertain, imprecise, or incomplete data caused by human error, recording error, or arbitrary guesses which may ultimately yield unreliable results. This non-linear behavior requires specific analytical techniques to identify the different effects that variations in Kansei attributes may have on customer preferences. To deal with the quantitative measures of perceptual information, a number of non-linear inference techniques have been developed and employed for modeling Kansei evaluation systems, including neural networks [13,14], fuzzy logic [15–17], and genetic algorithms [18–20].

Kansei evaluation is a systematic determination of customer preference significance using criteria against a set of Kansei attributes, where Kansei attributes refer to the criteria of emotional connotations. In practice, Kansei evaluation consists of three main operations, namely attribute classification, preference modeling, and priority analysis. A basic principle in Kansei evaluation is that valid results depend on justifying the classification of Kansei attributes extracted from a set of collected Kansei words, establishing priorities for the customer preferences of product alternatives with respect to each attribute, and synthesizing the priorities for the evaluated alternatives. Previous research has indicated that the main problem in constructing customer preference models with good predictive performance is how to deal with the inherent nonlinear correlations between product attributes [15]. Kansei preferences refer to a non-quantifiable, subjective, and affective-based process involving the human perceptual interpretation of Kansei responses, which inevitably involves some imprecision or vagueness in terms of individual perceptual confidence. For example, the perceptual intensity of “very comfortable” is more than that of “comfortable”, but by how much is unknown. Moreover, respondent bias occurs when customers are unable or unwilling to provide accurate answers in a Kansei evaluation survey. Fortunately, fuzzy set theory offers a powerful tool to deal with concepts and rules with uncertainty, imprecision, and non-linearity. This theory is based on the premise that the key points in human thinking are not numbers, but linguistic terms or labels of fuzzy sets [21]. Fuzzy logic incorporating computing with words (CWW) involves computers being activated by words, which are converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets. These fuzzy sets are then mapped by means of a CWW engine into another fuzzy set, after which the latter is converted back into a word [22]. Over the last decade, CWW has been regarded as a very flexible technique for dealing with decision-making problems and evaluating human perceptions, and many different approaches for CWW using fuzzy sets have been proposed and used in the literature [23–28]. According to Wang and Hao [29], these approaches can be classified into three categories: (1) the Extension Principle based models, which operate on the underlying fuzzy set models of the linguistic terms using the Extension Principle [30]; (2) the symbolic model, which makes computations on the indices of the linguistic terms; and, (3) the 2-tuple representation based model, which is an improvement over the symbolic model. Franco et al. [24] indicated that CWW explores the brain’s ability to handle and evaluate perceptions by means of the linguistic representation of information and knowledge. It can be used as a paradigm for developing reasoning mechanisms to improve solving processes of perception-based problems dealing with uncertainty, imprecision, and subjective vagueness [31–33]. The CWW paradigm deals with Kansei preferences through qualitative semantics instead of numbers. For Kansei evaluation situations in which customer preferences cannot be assessed precisely in a quantitative manner but can be approximated via a qualitative one, the use of the CWW paradigm is very appropriate.

With regard to existing Kansei evaluation approaches, Huang et al. [34] proposed a Kansei clustering method for Kansei attribute classification that combines the design/dependency structure matrix (DSM) with Pearson correlation analysis to measure the perceptual similarity of customers between the meanings of Kansei words. However, their method does not provide internal consistency verification for the customers’ Kansei correlation matrix and also requires a heavy cognitive load to manage Kansei subsets. Although most Kansei evaluation studies have used quantification theory type I (QT1) to synthesize Kansei priority information [35], there are clear statistical limitations that can influence the synthesis results [18,36]. Based on the multi-attribute fuzzy target-oriented decision analysis, Yan et al. [17] proposed a Kansei evaluation model to improve the strength of Kansei evaluation systems. Their model uses a prioritized aggregation operator to aggregate the partial degrees of satisfaction for the evaluated alternatives. However, the prioritized aggregation includes three complex calculation processes for priority analysis and the OWA-based operator is a scoring type that focuses on the aggregation of crisp numbers rather than fuzzy numbers. Zhou et al. [37] argued that fuzzy numbers provide an efficient way of knowledge representation and can be applied to human preference modeling using linguistic terms. Accordingly, this paper presents a Kansei evaluation approach based on the CWW technique. The aims of this study were (1) to classify collected Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes by using cluster analysis based on fuzzy relations; (2) to model Kansei preferences based on semantic labels for the priority analysis; and, (3) to synthesize priority information and rank the order of decision alternatives by means of a linguistic aggregation operation. This approach can be used to assist evaluators in assessing customer Kansei preferences of a product. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical fundamentals of Kansei preference modeling, Kansei clustering, and linguistic aggregation. Section 3 describes the proposed Kansei evaluation approach, while Section 4 presents an empirical study to demonstrate the implementation process and applicability of the proposed approach. A discussion is given in Section 5 and conclusions and recommendations for further research are offered in Section 6.

In this section, some important fundamentals used in the proposed approach (see Section 3) are addressed. These fundamentals include Kansei preference modeling for the priority analysis, Kansei clustering for classifying collected Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes, and linguistic aggregation for synthesizing Kansei priority information.

Kansei preferences are defined as customer preferences on a specific Kansei attribute of a product. In modeling such preferences, respondents are customarily asked in a questionnaire to indicate their appropriate choices from a set of self-report inventories. Likert-based and semantic differential-based scorings are two commonly used scales to quantify human perceptual interpretations. A Kansei attribute refers to a criterion of emotional connotation (e.g., elegant-positive feeling or inelegant-negative feeling) associated with different levels of intensity descriptors (e.g., very inelegant, inelegant, neutral, elegant, and very elegant) for quantifying customer preferences. To quantify Kansei preferences, the semantic differential (SD) method is often used. An SD consists of a number of scales, each of which is a bipolar adjective pair. Since the SD method requires cognitively positive and negative interpretations, one drawback is the increased cognitive demand, which can introduce errors in scores [38]. Although Likert-based scales contain only positively worded items and are conceptually proper for human psychological constructs, their use suffers from the bias of acquiescence in which respondents to a Kansei evaluation survey have a tendency to agree with all the questions or to indicate a positive connotation [38–40].

For human preference modeling, a 7-point labeled scale is commonly used to gather respondents’ ratings for each perceptual item. Many researchers consider the psychometric rating scales as ordered-categorical data rather than interval-level data since one cannot assume that respondents perceive all pairs of adjacent levels as equidistant [41]. As shown in the linguistic format scale of Fig. 1
                        , for example, a respondent perceives a product as medium but somewhat inelegant. In such a situation of response, what is the fundamental difference between “medium elegant” and “somewhat inelegant”? In Likert format, this perceptual interpretation may be approximately classified into “Neutral” preference with a numerical value of “0.5”, while in SD format, the number “0.44” can perhaps more precisely indicate the value for the perceptual preference. Be that as it may, both numerical values do not exactly represent such a perceptual interpretation as human perceptual interpretation of Kansei responses involves inherent imprecision or vagueness to a certain extent, as mentioned above.

Fuzzy sets are a generalization of crisp sets for representing imprecision or vagueness in everyday life. The use of fuzzy sets is central to computing with words or labels as they provide a means of modeling the vagueness underlying most natural linguistic terms [22,42]. A fuzzy set is defined by its membership function, and the value of the membership grade indicates the degree to which the element belongs to the fuzzy set. A fuzzy set A is called normalized when at least one of its elements attains the maximum possible membership grade (i.e.,

In this paper, Kansei preferences are modeled by positively worded items with 7 levels of semantic labels to indicate respondents’ perceptual intensity. As shown in the lower section of Fig. 1, Kansei preferences K in the semantic space S are characterized by triangular membership functions that associate each semantic element s of S with a real number,

                              s
                              )
                           
                        , in the interval [0,1]. The

                        -cut of a Kansei preference represented by a semantic label is a crisp set (interval) that contains all elements of the semantic space S that have a membership grade in the Kansei preference greater than or equal to the specified value of 
                           
                              α

                              ,
                              1
                              ]

                        . The above example of perceptual preference is thus interpreted as the degree of 0.64 (the value of the upper membership grade) belonging to the “Medium” preference and the degree of 0.36 (the value of the lower membership grade) belonging to the “Moderately Low” preference. A Kansei preference can be classified as a fuzzy number since it is a convex and normalized fuzzy set whose membership function is piecewise continuous defined on 
                           
                              R
                           
                        . Since triangular membership functions are a uniformly distributed ordered set of Kansei preferences in a semantic space, they provide an intuitive way to capture the vagueness of Kansei information. Each Kansei attribute comprises 7 sets of semantic terms to indicate perceived preferences and perceived importance, as defined in Table 1
                        .

These semantic terms allow customer Kansei preferences to be described and quantified with corresponding fuzzy numbers. The Kansei preferences K can also be crisp sets via interval numbers at 
                           
                              ∝
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         or cardinal numbers at 
                           
                              ∝
                              =
                              1
                           
                         based on a norm of [0,1]. In establishing priorities of preference relations, cardinal numbers confer a numerical value to the corresponding 7 semantic labels of the Kansei attribute for which the mean of the respondents’ linguistic judgments (data points) is mapped into a corresponding interval number (interval line). Interval numbers are used to fuzzify the linguistic judgments into fuzzy numbers (symmetric triangular membership functions), thereby taking into account the fact that all respondents’ judgments have some degree of inherent uncertainty. These fuzzy numbers are then used as fuzzy variables for the CWW engine to aggregate priority information. The CWW process based on the Kansei preference modeling is shown in Fig. 3
                        .

Kansei clustering is an important process to justify that a set of much fewer selected Kansei words can be used as Kansei attributes to represent the whole meaning of all Kansei words collected from the customers [34]. Cluster analysis based on fuzzy relations has been widely studied and employed in the literature [45–47]. Moreover, it can be used as a mining technique to extract Kansei data by dividing a given set of Kansei words into an appropriate set of Kansei attributes for the evaluation.

Any relation between two sets X and Y is known as a binary relation. Similarly, fuzzy relations are fuzzy subsets of

In Kansei attribute classification, human subjectivity provides important information. The measure among respondents’ perceived preferences is a binary relation (a set of respondents and a corresponding set of their perceived preferences), which may be represented by a proximity relation. A measure of subjective similarity can be a fuzzy proximity relation that satisfies the properties of reflexivity and symmetry, but excludes the transitivity property [47,50–52].

                         to create a crisp equivalence relation that represents the presence of similarity between the elements. Each of these equivalence relations forms a partition that represents the presence of similarity between the given Kansei words.

Determining the best number of clusters in a data set remains the most important application of cluster validity [53–57]. Once the partition is derived, the validity function can help verify whether the grouping accurately represents the data structure.

Cluster validation refers to the quantitative evaluation of the clustering solution quality. The proposed CVI is based on the concept that elements (Kansei words) should be classified into appropriate clusters (Kansei attributes) with a low inter-group relation (discriminability of groups), where each cluster should have a high intra-element relation (homogeneity of elements). The former is achieved through weakening the extreme clusters on both sides of the hierarchy

Aggregation operations on fuzzy sets are operations by which several fuzzy sets are combined in a desirable way to produce a single fuzzy set [43]. There are numerous computational models available for linguistic aggregation that have been investigated in the literature [25,58]. Since Kansei evaluation essentially requires synthesizing linguistic descriptors, this study used a linguistic aggregation model as a CWW engine to aggregate priority information and rank the order of decision alternatives.

                     Step 2. Collect a set of Kansei words and construct a preference matrix.
                  

According to customer feelings toward the sample products, evaluators collect as many emotional adjectives as possible from various sources such as magazines, academic literature, product manuals, product test reports, expert reviews, user opinions, and customer interviews. Through a preliminary analysis, a set of Kansei words is determined as

Any valid metric can be used as a measure of similarity between pairs of objects (Kansei words). The choice of which clusters to merge or split is determined by a linkage criterion, which itself is a function of the pairwise distances/correlations between objects. Fuzzy clustering based on distance similarity measures has widely been used in the literature [62–64]. The concept of membership grades is used as a linkage criterion to indicate the similarity between data sets, and is substantiated by the definition and interpretation of fuzzy sets. Different membership functions may produce different clusters since the membership function is usually assumed as an indicator to form a partition of unity [65]. However, it is difficult to determine an appropriate membership function to fit the data properties and construct a rational fuzzy relation. Grey relational analysis (GRA) has been one of the most practical analytical tools to investigate order relation of given objects of data sets with similarity [66,67]. In this step, topology-based grey relational analysis (TGRA) is used as an indicator function to derive a set of relational grades for constructing a fuzzy proximity matrix.

It can be regarded as a fuzzy proximity matrix that satisfies both reflexivity (

                     Step 4. Establish priorities for obtaining Kansei variables.
                  

According to the classified Kansei attributes, evaluators establish priorities for both the Kansei attributes and preferences for each alternative product with respect to each Kansei attribute. The evaluation scales are based on the Kansei preference modeling for the CWW process given in Section 2.1. After completing the priority analysis, two fuzzy linguistic sets of Kansei variables (
                        
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 ∼
                              
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 W
                              
                              
                                 ∼
                              
                           
                        
                     ) are obtained.


                     Step 5. Synthesize the priority information and rank the order of the alternative products.
                  

By substituting the two sets of Kansei variables into Eq. (8) to perform the linguistic aggregation operation, the resultant membership functions of the evaluated alternatives can be obtained. Eq. (9) is then used to defuzzify these fuzzy numbers and subsequently rank the alternative products by their quantitative values. The higher the value is, the stronger the Kansei preferences of the alternative product.

A USB flash drive is a data storage device that combines flash memory with an integrated Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, and is one of the most popular computer peripherals available today. In addition to storage capacity and data transfer speed, the Kansei quality is a vital consideration for customers when purchasing a USB flash drive. In this section, USB flash drives are used as sample products to illustrate the implementation process and applicability of the proposed Kansei evaluation approach. The aim of the illustrative case is to evaluate the most desirable alternatives from a set of selected USB flash drives in terms of the target customers’ Kansei preferences. The empirical study consisted of two parts: (1) a pilot study to classify relevant Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes; and, (2) the Kansei evaluation for the selected USB flash drives.

This Kansei evaluation research involved 7 Ph.D. students (3 females and 4 males, with an average age of 33.4years) who majored in Industrial Design and had at least 3years of practical experience in product design. Based on the positively-worded formula for modeling Kansei preferences, the research team members collected as many emotional adjectives as possible in the domain of USB flash drives from the aforementioned sources. After completing the preliminary analysis, a total of 26 adjectives were selected as Kansei words (see Table 2
                        ) for assessing USB flash drives. In the pilot study, a reference product (Kingston DTSE9 USB drive) was used for deriving a set of Kansei attributes. This reference product received a Red Dot Design Award in 2012 and an iF Product Design Award in 2013. The 7 team members evaluated the product according to their perceived preferences against the 26 Kansei words. The evaluation scale was based on the 7-level semantic labels using cardinal numbers. The results are given in Table 2, with the Kansei data classified as the preference matrix presented in Eq. (16).

Subsequently, a class of equivalence relations was created via the 
                           
                              α
                           
                        -cut operation. The Kansei words were then classified into groups according to their similarity based on the evaluators’ perceived preferences toward the reference product. The classification under different 
                           
                              α
                           
                        -cut levels was further analyzed using the cluster validation indices. As shown in Table 3
                        , the top five partitions are P5, P9, P8, P4, and P7 in descending order. In this case, most researchers may tend to select P9 (g
                        =5) as the appropriate set of Kansei attributes for the Kansei evaluation; however, the CVI value of P5 (g
                        =12) is greater than that of P9. Further analysis of the results reveals that the discriminability of P9 clusters

In this part of the experiment, 10 USB flash drives were selected to test the proposed approach for evaluating customers’ Kansei preferences on these product alternatives. The product features of the selected USB flash drives are listed in Table 4
                        . Since university students are an important group that purchase and use USB flash drives, they were regarded as the target customers for the Kansei evaluation in this empirical study. Twenty university students majoring in Product Design were recruited as experimental subjects to evaluate the product alternatives. These subjects consisted of 10 females and 10 males, ranging in age from 18 to 22years (Mean=20.1, SD=1.1); each was rewarded with a Transcend 8GB USB drive for his/her effort in responding to the questionnaire.

The questionnaire consisted of two phases according to the CWW process detailed in Section 2.1. In the first phrase, each subject was asked to provide his/her perceived importance to each Kansei attribute, the purpose of which was to establish attribute priorities. Subsequently, the second phase required subjects to scrutinize each of the 10 USB flash drives and insert/remove it into/from a laptop (HP PowerBook 4331s). After completing the tests, each subject indicated his/her perceived preferences according to the given Kansei attributes to establish priorities for the perceived preferences of each product alternative. The frequency distributions of the original linguistic judgments for Kansei importance and Kansei preferences are shown in Appendix A. The two sets of Kansei variables, expressed as the following 2 fuzzy linguistic matrixes, were categorized and are listed in Table 5

By substituting the two sets of Kansei variables into Eq. (8) to perform the linguistic aggregation operation and further defuzzifying the resultant membership functions using Eq. (9), 10 sets of quantitative values as well as ranked product alternatives were derived. The final results of the Kansei evaluation are listed in Table 6
                        . According to the evaluation results, the ranking of the product alternatives is

                        . In terms of the target customers’ preferences on the Kansei attributes, the best example was Alternative 9 and the worst was Alternative 3. Alternative 9 has a tiny metallic design with a refined gold-plated casing, while Alternative 3 has a soft appearance of cotton candy with a rubberized casing. The results are reasonable and credible as customers prefer such a USB flash drive as a unique fashion accessory to a cute one in terms of university students’ Kansei preferences. In comparison with the results derived from the traditional weighted average operation using crisp numbers, Alternative 9 is still the best example, with the exception that Alternative 2 and Alternative 6 are ranked in reverse order. Further analysis of the differences indicated that subjects gave divergent judgments on Alternative 2 against Kansei attributes

The results imply that the proposed linguistic aggregation model based on triangular fuzzy numbers is more valid and practical than the traditional weighted average method using crisp numbers. This is because the proposed model is able to handle psychometric Kansei evaluation problems involving uncertain and imprecise data likely caused by customers’ arbitrary guesses, recording errors, or respondent biases.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Kansei evaluation aims to systematically determine the significance of customers’ preferences of a product using criteria against a set of Kansei attributes. As Kansei evaluation involves human perceptual interpretation with subjectivity, uncertainty, and imprecision, quantitatively evaluating customer preferences on Kansei attributes of products is inherently difficult. In this paper, a Kansei evaluation approach based on the technique of CWW is proposed. Compared to existing Kansei evaluation methods, the proposed approach has distinct advantages in Kansei attribute classification, Kansei preference modeling, and Kansei priority analysis. The theoretical and practical implications of the Kansei evaluation approach are discussed in the following.

Conventional Kansei evaluation approaches rely heavily on the intuition that designers/engineers use to cluster the Kansei words; however, such classifications may be inconsistent with customer opinions as they are evaluated by designers/engineers rather than customers themselves. In order to derive a customer-consistent classification result, Huang et al. [34] proposed a Kansei clustering method based on a design structure matrix (DSM). This method breaks the Kansei words up into a number of subsets so that each participant deals with only a portion of the collected Kansei words. Pearson correlations are used to establish the distances among the Kansei words, and the subsets are then integrated by merging the identical correlation pairs for deriving an overall Kansei clustering result. The Pearson correlation coefficient is mainly sensitive to a linear relationship (linear dependence) between two variables; however, customer perception on Kansei preferences can manifest as a non-linear pattern, as mentioned above. Huang et al.’s proposed method does not provide internal consistency verification for the customers’ Kansei correlation matrix, for which they assume the meaning of a Kansei word is a crisp set with no overlap between any two Kansei words. Their method requires a heavy cognitive load to manage Kansei subsets and also lacks a cluster validation test to verify whether the Kansei clusters accurately represent the data structure. The proposed Kansei evaluation approach applies cluster analysis based on fuzzy relations to classify collected Kansei words into a set of Kansei attributes. In this approach, topology-based grey relational analysis (TGRA) is used as an indicator function to derive a set of global relational grades for constructing a fuzzy proximity matrix. This matrix is based on the measure of subjective similarity among respondents’ perceived preferences of the reference product and satisfies the properties of reflexivity and symmetry. With respect to the application of pairwise correlations, “transitivity” is a critical requirement for deriving an equivalence relation which ensures that all respondents’ judgments are consistent in the preference matrix. By use of the n-step procedure of max–min compositions [52], a fuzzy equivalence relation matrix can be derived. The Kansei words are then classified into clusters via different values of 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cuts. Based on the formulation of high discriminability of clusters (Kansei attributes) and high homogeneity of elements (Kansei words), a cluster validation index (
                        
                           CVI
                           )
                        
                      is also proposed to assist evaluators in determining the best number of clusters and extracting an appropriate set of Kansei attributes for the Kansei evaluation.

In modeling Kansei evaluation systems, the semantic differential (SD) method is often used as a measure to quantify human perception for an understanding of Kansei preferences [10,11,71]. The use of the SD method is based on the premise that any two products can be differentiated semantically by a set of a limited number of emotional antonym scales [72]. However, some emotional adjectives are difficult to match with an exclusively corresponding antonym and some Kansei attributes are difficult to define absolutely with a bipolar pair of Kansei words, since the semantics of emotional adjectives may not have clearly distinguishable connotations of emotions in the contexts of different languages like Japanese, Chinese, and English. A drawback with the SD format is the increased cognitive demand, which could introduce errors in scores and weaken the psychometric Kansei evaluation quality [38]. The SD method includes three basic dimensions of response, namely evaluation, potency, and activity (EPA); however, almost all applications of the SD method to Kansei evaluation have relied only on evaluation measurements, particularly on the evaluation of positive Kansei preferences. For example, customers tend to prefer perceiving how beautiful a product is to how ugly the product is in terms of the bipolar pair of Kansei words “Beautiful-Ugly”. To facilitate the Kansei evaluation implementation, Kansei preferences are modeled by positively worded items with 7 levels of semantic labels. The 7-point label scale renders judgments easier and more intuitive, allowing respondents to feel more confident about giving their perceptual interpretations in the form of semantic terms rather than numerical ratings. Nevertheless, a limitation is that the semantic scale is a pattern of bipolar intensity descriptors, measuring either a positive or negative response to a Kansei preference. Consequently, it may be subject to distortion from several uncertain causes, such as central tendency bias, acquiescence bias, or social desirability bias. To overcome this, the proposed approach treats the semantic scale as 7 semantic label sets described by triangular membership functions. These semantic label sets are defined respectively by fuzzy numbers, interval numbers, and cardinal numbers according to different 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cut levels. Different defined numbers are used for different processes to establish priorities of preference/importance relations for the CWW engine, while simultaneously taking into account the inherent uncertainty and imprecision of Kansei responses in the Kansei evaluation.

Most Kansei evaluation studies have used quantification theory type I (QT1) to synthesize Kansei priority information [35]. QT1 is a technique of multiple regression analysis used to summarize Kansei data as well as model the functional relationships between quantification and characterization of Kansei research. However, a multiple regression model has several shortcomings: for instance, it imprecisely assumes that all predictors are linearly related to each other, and also has a statistical limitation on the number of explanatory variables [18,36]. As aforementioned, customer Kansei preferences refer to non-quantifiable, subjective, and affective-based processes, involving human perceptual interpretations with some uncertainty and imprecision. To improve the strength of Kansei evaluation systems, Yan et al. [17] proposed a Kansei evaluation model based on multi-attribute fuzzy target-oriented decision analysis and prioritized aggregation. In their model, Kansei attributes are based on the bipolar pairs of Kansei words derived from the SD method. They are intuitively assessed by respondents’ voting statistics and are represented as linguistic variables using triangular fuzzy numbers. Customer preferences are modeled by three types of fuzzy targets used as fuzzy numbers to derive the degrees of satisfaction for the evaluated products through the 
                        
                           α
                        
                     -cut operation. Besides, Yan et al.’s model uses a prioritized aggregation operator to aggregate the partial degrees of satisfaction for the evaluated product alternatives. The operator is a scoring type based on Yager’s OWA operator [73], and the prioritized aggregation includes three complex calculation processes for priority analysis. However, Zhou et al. [37] indicated that Yager’s OWA operator focuses exclusively on the aggregation of crisp numbers, and also suggested that fuzzy numbers provide an efficient way of knowledge representation which can be applied to human preference modeling using linguistic terms. Kansei evaluation essentially requires synthesizing linguistic descriptors. In addition to the improvement in Kansei attribute extraction and Kansei preference modeling, the proposed Kansei evaluation approach has other advantages over Yan et al.’s model. Based on computing with words, the proposed approach uses a linguistic aggregation model as a CWW engine to synthesize priority information and rank the order of decision alternatives. This approach can be regarded as an Extension Principle based model [29] that enables fuzzy numbers to be aggregated through the four arithmetic operations on closed intervals. The Kansei preference and Kansei importance variables are fuzzified into fuzzy numbers represented by 7-level semantic labels. These two sets of Kansei variables are aggregated by means of the linguistic aggregation operation. The resultant fuzzy numbers are then defuzzified to derive the corresponding quantitative values for the evaluated product alternatives. As a whole, the use of the CWW technique allows for the incorporation of unquantifiable information, incomplete information, non-obtainable information, and partially ignorant facts into a decision model; hence, this approach is capable of capturing customers’ ambiguous appraisals and is valid for dealing with psychometric Kansei evaluation problems.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Kansei studies refer to an interdisciplinary research field that focuses on understanding what Kansei is, how the Kansei process works, and how designers/engineers can apply valid domain knowledge to relevant Kansei implementation. This study aimed at implementing the psychological measures of Kansei responses via a mathematical model. In this paper, a Kansei evaluation approach based on computing with words (CWW) was presented to assess customer Kansei attribute preferences of products. Kansei preferences were modeled by positively worded items with 7 levels of semantic labels defined by fuzzy, interval, and cardinal numbers for establishing Kansei priorities. Kansei attributes were extracted from a set of collected Kansei words using fuzzy relation-based clustering associated with a cluster validation index (
                        
                           CVI
                           )
                        
                     . A linguistic aggregation model was used as a CWW engine to synthesize Kansei priority information and rank the order of product alternatives. The implementation process and applicability of the proposed Kansei evaluation approach were illustrated through a product evaluation example of USB flash drives.

In conclusion, this study contributes to our domain knowledge by using fuzzy cluster analysis associated with CWW in Kansei evaluation research areas. It also introduces a cluster validation index for determining the best number of clusters. Kansei refers to a cognitive function, for which the Kansei process begins with gathering human sensory functions such as feelings, emotions, and intuitions via vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Further research could focus on developing a physiometric Kansei evaluation system for measuring customer Kansei responses to a product by means of physiological measurement technologies such as heart rate and blood pressure, eye tracking, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
