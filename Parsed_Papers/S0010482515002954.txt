                  Among the many factors influencing the effectiveness of cardiovascular stents, tissue prolapse indicates the potential of a stent to cause restenosis. The deflection of the arterial wall between the struts of the stent and the tissue is known as a prolapse or draping. The prolapse is associated with injury and damage to the vessel wall due to the high stresses generated around the stent when it expands. The current study investigates the impact of stenosis severity and plaque morphology on prolapse in stented coronary arteries. A finite element method is applied for the stent, plaque, and artery set to quantify the tissue prolapse and the corresponding stresses in stenosed coronary arteries. The variable size of atherosclerotic plaques is considered. A plaque is modelled as a multi-layered medium with different thicknesses attached to the single layer of an arterial wall. The results reveal that the tissue prolapse is influenced by the degree of stenosis severity and the thickness of the plaque layers. Stresses are observed to be significantly different between the plaque layers and the arterial wall tissue. Higher stresses are concentrated in fibrosis layer of the plaque (the harder core), while lower stresses are observed in necrotic core (the softer core) and the arterial wall layer. Moreover, the morphology of the plaque regulates the magnitude and distribution of the stress. The fibrous cap between the necrotic core and the endothelium constitutes the most influential layer to alter the stresses. In addition, the thickness of the necrotic core and the stenosis severity affect the stresses. This study reveals that the morphology of atherosclerotic plaques needs to be considered a key parameter in designing coronary stents.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Coronary stents are tubular scaffolds used to restore blood flow in a stenosed artery. However, the incidence of restenosis is high in arteries and occurs when blockage reforms around the stent, usually in the form of a neointimal hyperplasia [1]. Though the incidence of instent restenosis is substantially reduced if drug-eluting stents are used. Several studies relate the neointimal formation to the vessel wall injury caused during the stenting procedure due to the high stresses generated around the stent when it expands [2–11]. The vessel wall undergoes radial compression toward the stent and creates a wall protrusion because of its elasticity [2,3]. This deflection of the tissue between the struts of the stent (called ‘tissue prolapse’ (TP)) has been used as a potential measure of the propensity of stent to cause restenosis [12]. The word prolapse refers to lumen loss due to the vessel wall protrusion. The association between TP and post-stented complications has been reported in several clinical studies [13–15]. On the other hand, Pericevic et al. [16] showed the importance of the plaque type in terms of the potential injury to a stented artery, which may have significant implications for in-stent restenosis. Moreover, TP is also linked to the morphology and composition of the plaque/wall tissue [17].

High mechanical stresses in the thin fibrous cap during the expansion can cause rupture if they exceed the ultimate strength. The stress magnitude and distribution are determined based on the loading conditions, the plaque and vessel wall geometries, and the material properties of the plaque and vessel wall constituents [18–20].

Computer modelling is widely accepted and used as a reliable approach to simulate experiments as realistically as possible. The finite element method puts forward a unique way to investigate the mechanical implications associated with the stenting procedure. Numerous computational studies have investigated the stent–artery interaction [7,12,16,21,22]. The majority of these studies have concentrated on stent design parameters. Prendergast et al. [12] carried out a finite element analysis of the prolapse in different cardiovascular stents and proposed a way to compare different stent designs and the likelihood of restenosis. They reported TP and arterial wall stresses simulated in only one repeated unit of each stent design. Capelli et al. [22] analysed the influence of different stent designs on the wall stresses and TP of the vessel wall within the stent units. However, how the presence of plaque may affect the risk of restenosis has not been investigated to date.

The current study will investigate the effect of plaque morphology on wall deformation and stresses in stented coronary arteries. These characteristics are vital as they influence local haemodynamics and provoke the progression of in-stent restenosis [23]. Finite element simulations are performed to model the atherosclerotic plaque as a multi-layered structure.

@&#METHODS@&#

Three-dimensional computer simulations are applied to study the mechanical characterises of the stent–plaque–artery model. The goal is to analyse the stress distribution and TP in a single unit of the stent that is fully expanded in a stenosed coronary artery. 
                        Fig. 1 demonstrates the full stent and the unit used in the present study. The balloon-expanded coronary stent has the final internal diameter, ds
                        , of 2.8mm. The stent strut has a thickness, ts
                        , of 0.1mm, and the entire stent has a total axial length, ls
                        , of 10mm. The diameter of the lumen, d
                        l, is 3mm [22,24,25]. Ten models are developed, corresponding to the plaques with different morphologies. The inner surface of each model is the green surface marked in Fig. 1a. Four volume sub-domains presenting the fibrous cap (FC), necrotic core (NC), fibrous (F), and arterial wall (AW) are created by extruding the green surface in the outward direction in each model, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The AW is modelled as a single homogenous layer. The thickness of the AW layer is 0.5mm [12,22]. The FC, NC, and F layers are also assumed to be homogeneous media.

Two eccentric plaques with initial degrees of stenosis of 51% (P1) and 36% (P2) are considered. The percentage of blockage is calculated based on the areas occupied by the plaque in the luminal area corresponding to the lumen diameter (3mm) of a healthy coronary artery. These plaques are classified as fibro-atheroma type, each having a plaque burden greater than 40% [26,27]. The percentage of the plaque burden was calculated as the plaque cross-sectional area plus the AW cross-sectional area, divided by the total cross-sectional area (plaque+AW+lumen area) multiplied by 100. In eccentric plaques, the mass of plaque is distributed asymmetrically around the wall circumference, resembling a crescent-like shape. In the present model, the stent unit (Fig. 1) represents the thickest side of plaque, which includes the entire mass of the NC. This stent unit is one of the three units repeated circumferentially. The initial lumen diameters of the stenosed arteries are 2.1mm and 2.4mm for P1 and P2, respectively. After the expansion, both arteries reach to the lumen diameter of 3mm. The mean thicknesses of plaques P1 and P2 reached 0.54mm and 0.40mm after stent expansion, respectively. Plaque P1 has a relative NC area to plaque cross-sectional area of 10% to 14%, whereas for plaque P2 they are 8% and 11% [28]. The thickness of the FC has been considered in the range between 0.070 and 0.230mm according to Finet et al. [29], who reported FC thicknesses from typical in-vivo intravascular ultrasound images of three fibro-atheromatous plaques. 
                        
                        Tables 1 and 2 represent the thicknesses of the NC and FC layers in different cases modelled in the current study.

The AW, FC, and F layers of the plaque are assumed to be incompressible hyperelastic materials that are modelled using a 5-parameter, third order Mooney–Rivlin hyperelastic constitutive equation. This model has been widely used to characterize the non-linear stress–strain relationship of the arterial tissue [12,21]. The strain energy density function,

The corresponding non-linear analysis is performed using the Newton–Raphson method. The derivative of the strain energy density function (Eq. (1)) with respect to the strain components gives the corresponding components of stress. The VMS is calculated by:

Finite element simulations are carried out under static conditions using the structural module (Mechanical APDL with implicit solver) of ANSYS Workbench v14.5 (ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA). A cylinder with a lumen diameter of l
                        
                           d
                        =3mm is subtracted from the geometry of an expanded stent as shown in Fig. 1a. As a result, a single unit (Fig. 1b) is extracted from the entire geometry of the stent. The other units exhibit a similarity due to the periodicity and symmetry. This surface is extruded outwards to create the plaque and AW layers with the thicknesses defined in Tables 1 and 2. The current model presents the ultimate geometric condition of stent and arterial tissue in the final expanded state.

Due to the deformability of the hyperelastic arterial tissue, it displaces with the stent, which acts as a scaffold within the vessel. It has been suggested that the maximum pressure sustained in vivo by the stent is approximately 60kPa (~450mmHg) [12,33]. Thus a pressure value of 60kPa is assigned as a baseline value in the formulation proposed by Tambaca et al. [34], which estimates the exterior pressure load exerted on the stent by arterial tissue.

An internal pressure of 13.3kPa (~100mmHg) denoted by pi
                            (
                           Fig. 2a) is applied to the luminal surface, representing the pressure maintained by the blood flow. This surface appears in orange in the view of the model geometry from luminal side (Fig. 2b). The exterior side of the vessel wall is subject to a pressure load, denoted by p
                           0, presenting the normal stress imposed by an expanded artery on the stent. Note that the transmural pressure (p
                           0−pi
                           ) across the arterial tissue for various models is obtained as presented in 
                           Table 4. The above-mentioned model of a stented artery is constructed in Gambit v2.4.6 (ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA) by extruding the inner surface by different values to obtain the layers of given thicknesses in each plaque (Fig. 2b). Then, it is exported to ANSYS Workbench v14.5 for performing the calculations. The edges of the stent–plaque–artery model along the (inner) periphery are subjected to a zero displacement boundary condition. These edges determine the contact line existing between the stent and the plaque, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. The boundary condition of the luminal surface is set to the displacement permitted only in the radial direction, and the other remaining surfaces (denoted by B in Fig. 2a) are subjected to zero displacement in the normal direction.

The entire computational domain is discretized using mixed (hexahedral and prism) element types in the meshing module of ANSYS Workbench v14.5. To ensure mesh independence, two separate grid-sensitivity analyses are conducted. Five different meshes are created by increasing the number of grid divisions (elements) along the entire wall thickness from 15 to 51 for plaque P1 and from 12 to 42 for plaque P2. The total number of elements in meshes of P1 model was in the range of 11250–38250 and in the range of 9750–31500 for P2 model. The total number of nodes in meshes of P1 was in the range of 57479–172571 and in the range of 51085–143798 for P2 model. In plaque P1 because a high stress concentration exists in the plaque layers, the number of elements within the FC, NC, and F layers is taken to be twice that in the AW layer. In the thinner plaque P2, this distribution of the elements is increased along the thickness of the plaque by 1.25 times that of plaque P1. The volume weighted average of VMS is calculated over each layer of the plaque and AW as:

The mesh densities finer than 24 elements for P1 and 21 elements for P2 (along the thickness of the vessel wall) show negligible differences of less than 1%. Therefore, the mesh consisting of 24 (P1) and 21 (P2) elements along the vessel wall is chosen for calculations. These meshes correspond to a total number of approximately 22,000 (P1) and 18,000 (P2) volumetric elements. Fig. 2d displays the mesh used in the simulations corresponding to Case 5 introduced in Table 2.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

During the stent insertion procedure, the deformation of the vessel wall is closely linked to the prolapse of the arterial tissue within the stent struts [22]. The changes associated with the local stress at the diseased zone initiate cell proliferation [24]. These potential risk factors may lead to the activation of the restenosis mechanism. 
                     Fig. 3 presents the displacement and VMS across the arterial tissue in a sectional plane (dashed line in Fig. 2b) along the longitudinal direction (z-axis). As expected, the largest displacement of tissue (Fig. 3a) is observed midway between the stent struts. The distribution of VMS (Fig. 3b) varies significantly between the layers of the atherosclerotic artery. The stiffer layers (FC, F) display higher stresses of approximately 2400kPa, where as low stresses are observed in the softer layers (NC, AW) with values up to 42kPa. The maximum VMS (2462kPa) occurs in the vicinity of the edges of the stent strut in the FC layer.

The performance of the current model is compared with a previous study on a single repeating unit of a similar stent by Prendergast et al. [12]. Four distinct stents were applied in their study, where the Tetra (Tetra stent, Guidant) design is used to show the performance of the current model due to its geometric similarity to our studied stent. Prendergast et al. [12] applied only the AW layer in their model, and the presence of the plaque was ignored. We generated a model consisting of only an AW layer with a similar wall thickness and material properties to the ones used by Prendergast et al. [12]. The model is discretized using 7680 hexahedral mesh elements with 8 elements across the wall thickness. The corresponding data of the test and the reference models are displayed in 
                     Table 5. Because the two stents are not exactly the same, the differences between the length of periphery and the area of expanded stent are 11% and 21%, respectively. The maximum prolapse and the maximum prolapse per unit area differ by 10% and 13% between the two stents. However, the maximum prolapse per unit length of our model is in good agreement with the model used by Prendergast et al. [12] with a variation of only 1%.

The main results of this study are presented in three sections. In Section 3.1, the maximum TP is reported and discussed. In Section 3.2, the distribution of VMS in stented coronary artery in various plaque structures is presented. Finally, in Section 3.3, the limitations of the current work are presented.

The degree of TP protruding in the lumen is a vital factor in altering the extent of the recirculation zones created by the stent struts. A certain extent of TP is also desirable for resisting restenosis as it reduces the arterial tissue area exposed to critically low wall shear stress [35]. In general, a high value of TP leads to more reduction in the free lumen area and thus it could be related to the lower scaffolding capability of the stent [22].

The maximum values of TP corresponding to the arterial tissue (luminal surface) in the post-stenting stage are shown in 
                        Fig. 4a and b for several model cases. The presented TP is obtained as the maximum radial displacement of the inner tissue layer (FC) that lines the lumen. For a fixed thickness of NC, the thickness of FC introduces a variation of 10% to 20% in the value of TP for plaque P2 (Fig. 4b), while it is almost unchanged (below 3%) for plaque P1 (Fig. 4a). The values of TP could considerably differ between the two NC thicknesses with the same FC thickness, e.g., by 15% (cases 1 and 3), or by 12% (cases 2 and 4) corresponding to plaque P1. TP varied by 10% and 16% from thin to thick FC for the two NC thicknesses in cases (5–7) and cases (8–10) corresponding to plaque P2. Fig. 4a and b indicates that the obtained values of TP are typically higher in the plaque P1 (Cases 1–4) than in the plaque P2 (Cases 5–7, 8–10), which may show the linkage between stenosis severity and the deformation of the arterial tissue after stenting. NC is the weaker layer, which can contribute in increasing the prolapse in plaque P1 (with thinner FC). If FC gets thicker as in plaque P2, NC cannot contribute in increasing the prolapse. Thus FC thickness can be considered as a resistive factor against prolapse.

In addition to the morphology of vessel wall, the TP can be influenced by other factors such as the stent design and the mechanical properties of the arterial tissue [12,21,22], which are not the subjects of this study.

High stresses are indicative of the likelihood for tissue damage. It has been widely accepted that the human atherosclerotic plaque ruptures if stresses exceed 300kPa [36]. The maximum stress and stress gradient across the wall varies significantly with the thickness of the plaque [24]. In this study, the effect of the multi-layer plaque thicknesses will be investigated. Various thicknesses of plaque layers (FC, NC, and F) are considered to present various plaque morphologies reported in the literature. 
                        Fig. 5 illustrates the distribution of VMS along the radial direction in different layers of stented arterial tissue. Fig. 5(a–d) and (e–j) presents VMS distribution radially through various cases for plaques P1 and P2, respectively. The calculated values of VMS indicate its significant variation between the layers. Higher stresses are observed in the FC layer in the range of 100–200kPa. However, the VMS drops substantially in the NC layer (softer than the FC and F layers) to the range of 5–20kPa. Stress is relatively high in the F layer ranging from 8 to 40kPa. The outermost layer of the AW tolerates the lowest stress values lesser than 10kPa.

Moreover, the stresses substantially depend on various plaque morphologies, especially when the thickness of the FC changes. The FC layer also presents the largest variation for its stresses as the morphology changes. For the plaque P1, two different thicknesses of FC have been introduced via Case 1 and Case 2, which have the same thickness for the NC. Stress is significantly elevated in the plaque with the thinner FC (Case 1). In Fig. 5, the maximum stresses in all the simulated cases are observed at the radial position of 1.5mm. This position corresponds to the luminal side of the FC layer, which is in direct contact with the stent strut inhibiting the displacement of the tissue in contact. A similar trend can be observed between Case 3 and Case 4, in which Case 3 (the thinner FC) tolerates higher stress. For the plaque P2, Cases 5 to 7 present different thicknesses of the FC with the same thickness for the NC. Stresses in these cases decline as the FC gets thicker, which is the same for Cases 8 to 10, presenting the same NC thickness but different than that of Cases 5 to 7. In addition to the FC thickness, the thickness of the NC affects the stress. The thicker NC results in lower stresses in the NC layer but elevated stresses in the FC layer. These results are in good agreement with previous computational studies [18,29,20], although they were performed in geometries without a stent. In plaque P1 (Fig. 5(a–d)), the VMS values vary in the range from 120 to 190kPa, which are mainly higher than the values obtained in plaque P2 (Fig. 5(e–j)). In plaque P2, the VMS values mainly range in an interval from 100 to 150kPa. This indicates that different degrees of stenosis related to plaques P1 and P2 display different ranges of VMS values. These VMS values correspond to the FC layer.


                        
                        Fig. 6 demonstrates the mean distribution of VMS obtained for different layers of atherosclerotic plaque. The volume-weighted average of VMS is calculated for each layer defined by Eq. (3). Fig. 6(a–d) presents the average VMS for the layers of the FC, NC, F, and AW for the plaque P1 while Fig. 6(e–h) demonstrate VMS for the plaque P2. Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates that the stress varies through different layers of diseased arterial tissues. It can be observed that the average value of VMS decreases as the FC or NC becomes thicker with exception for the data in Fig. 6a and d. The maximum value of average VMS is observed in the plaques with the thinnest FC and NC.

The NC layer grows in size and becomes calcified and stiff as the plaque advances to severe stenosis. Note that, in the current study, the mechanical properties of the NC are assumed to be similar for plaques P1 and P2. There are other limitations in this study to be mentioned. The initial stresses existing prior to the expansion of stent and wall are not considered in the simulations. Future attempts will be devoted to extending the current simulations to a full stent that also includes blood flow within the artery.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study introduces a computational model to identify the deformation of the multi-layered atherosclerotic arterial tissue, as well as the stress distribution in the post-stenting stage within a coronary artery. The finite element method is implemented to simulate 10 different morphologies of stented stenosed coronary arteries. The diseased artery includes a multi-layered plaque and AW incorporated within a single unit (closed area) of a fully expanded stent. This study reveals the important role of plaque morphology in the post-stenting stage of an atherosclerotic coronary artery.

Plaques with a severe degree of stenosis and thinner FC layers present higher values of TP. The thickness of the NC layer affects the TP slightly. The stress analysis is consistent with the earlier finding that the severe stenosis yields higher arterial stresses [24]. The maximum amount of stress is observed in the FC layer, regardless of the severity of the plaque, the size of the NC and the thickness of the FC. This study reveals the large influence of the FC layer in the stress and deformation achieved in the post-stenting phase. The stress drastically drops in the NC layer, which is softer than its neighbouring layers. It is observed from the present simulations that stresses in all layers are regulated by changing the morphology of the plaque. The thickness of the FC layer has the highest impact on the magnitude and distribution of the stresses. Plaques with the thinnest FC significantly elevate the stress levels.

The results of this study reveal that the morphological characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque affect the post-stenting events. This aspect needs to be considered in designing the stents to prevent post-stenting complications effectively.
