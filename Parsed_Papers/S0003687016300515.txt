                  Nowadays, working in an office environment is ubiquitous. At the same time, progressively more people suffer from occupational musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to analyse the influence of back pain on sitting behaviour in the office environment.
                  A textile pressure mat (64-sensor-matrix) placed on the seat pan was used to identify the adopted sitting positions of 20 office workers by means of random forest classification. Additionally, two standardised questionnaires (Korff, BPI) were used to assess short and long-term back pain in order to divide the subjects into two groups (with and without back pain). Independent t-test indicated that subjects who registered back pain within the last 24 h showed a clear trend towards a more static sitting behaviour. Therefore, the developed sensor system has successfully been introduced to characterise and compare sitting behaviour of subjects with and without back pain.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Many people in Western industrial nations suffer from back pain, with a prevalence of up to 90% within their lifetime (Airaksinen et al., 2006; Breivik et al., 2006). Chronic low back pain (LBP) has an international prevalence of 23% and is thereby the most common form of chronic pain (Airaksinen et al., 2006; Balague et al., 2012). Numerous psychosocial and physical aspects may be responsible for its development, as well as its progression into a chronic condition (Kröner-Herwig, 2011). However, literature clearly linking causation to any specific factor is lacking. In combination with these aspects, static loading, physical and psychological stress, are additional pressures present in the office environment (Chou and Shekelle, 2010). It therefore comes as no surprise that prolonged static sitting is also thought to be associated with an increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders in the back, neck, shoulders, arms and legs (Naqvi, 1994; Winkel and Jorgensen, 1986). However, recent literature reviews (Hartvigsen et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 2011; Lis et al., 2007; Roffey et al., 2010) have failed to find evidence of a causal relationship between sitting and the presence of LBP and therefore concluded that a sedentary lifestyle alone is not able to increase the risk of LBP.

According to May and Lomas (2010), the lack of a connection between sitting and LBP is a result of the insidious nature of back pain, since LBP is a highly multifactorial condition that can hardly be localised precisely. Furthermore, in their systematic review, Kwon et al. (2011) emphasised the difficulty of establishing causation of LBP, but also identified several methodological weaknesses that likely contributed to the inability to find an inter-relationship between occupational sitting and LBP. Nevertheless, Lis et al. (2007) suggested that the combination of an awkward sitting position and/or body vibration (as might occur during long-distance driving) with a prolonged static sitting behaviour increases the likelihood of suffering from LBP. Despite controversial discussion in the literature, it is conceivable that discomfort or low levels of comfort caused by unfavourable or un-ergonomic sitting positions, sitting behaviour or working conditions, is able to lead to musculoskeletal complaints such as LBP (Vink and Hallbeck, 2012).

The optimal occupational sitting position and sitting behaviour has been extensively discussed in the literature in recent years. The long-standing doctrine of an ideal sitting position that is “as upright as possible” has been strongly questioned (Marx and Wirth, 1996) and has been slowly replaced by the concept of “Dynamic Sitting”, where sitting positions are continuously altered (Lueder, 1983; van Dieen et al., 2001). A literature review conducted by Pynt et al. (2001) suggests that there is no ideal sitting posture. According to these authors, regular movements and a seated posture with preferred lumbar lordosis is essential for preventing LBP. Changing the sitting position is able to alter spinal geometry (Baumgartner et al., 2012; Zemp et al., 2013) as well as to change lumbar disc pressure (Andersson and Ortengren, 1974; Wilke et al., 1999, 2001). Therefore, a dynamic sitting behaviour is able to vary the loading conditions of spinal segments, which induces an effective pump mechanism in the vertebral discs (Grandjean and Hunting, 1977). This mechanism is thought to be critically important for intervertebral disc nutrition as well as resistance against degenerative changes (Krämer, 1973). Therefore, it could be concluded that office workers should move more during their working hours. However, overly frequent movements are maybe also an indication of discomfort and instability, but a suitable range of movement quantity has yet to be established (Graf et al., 1995). On the other hand, recent systematic reviews have indicated that there is no evidence that dynamic sitting alone has a positive effect on the management of LBP (O'Sullivan et al., 2012), but also that dynamic sitting does not significantly alter trunk muscle activity (O'Sullivan et al., 2013). Hence more scientific studies are clearly needed before a full understanding of the possible influences of dynamic sitting on the human body can be gained.

Sitting behaviour has been analysed by means of different methods such as force (Yamada et al., 2009; Zemp et al., 2015a) and pressure distribution sensors (Arnrich et al., 2010; Dunk and Callaghan, 2005; Mota and Picard, 2003), accelerometers (Ryan et al., 2011), optoelectronic motion analysis (Dunk and Callaghan, 2005), human observation (Graf et al., 1995), activity diary (Womersley and May, 2006), video analysis (Womersley and May, 2006), rachimeter (thin and flexible goniometer with a small inclinometer) (Vergara and Page, 2002) as well as actigraphy (Telfer et al., 2009). Previous studies that have investigated pressure mats for classification of sitting position reported accuracies of up to 87.6% (Mota and Picard, 2003) and 98.9% (Kamiya et al., 2008) for dynamic and static assessments respectively. Therefore, pressure distribution measuring systems as well as force sensors integrated within the seat pan and the backrest seem to be an accurate and reliable way of investigating static sitting positions as well as dynamic sitting behaviour (Mutlu et al., 2007; Zemp et al., 2015a). Furthermore, compared to other systems, pressure mats are relatively cheap, easily applicable and have almost no influence on the individual's adopted sitting position (Zemp et al., 2015b), and therefore offer a practical solution for examining a subject's behaviour.

Subjects with LBP or perceived lumbar discomfort have been reported to adopt a more static sitting behaviour with less frequent micro-movements and infrequent but large shifts in posture (O'Sullivan et al., 2012; Telfer et al., 2009; Vergara and Page, 2002). Consequently, subjects with LBP sit for longer periods of time in an uninterrupted sitting position (Womersley and May, 2006).

Since subjects with back pain are known to sit in a less dynamic manner than their more healthy counterparts, a vicious circle can ensue where the frequent movements associated with preserving spinal health are absent. However, we are not aware of any study that has addressed the sitting behaviour of subjects with and without back pain using an objective measuring method, and it remains unclear whether a relationship exists between sitting behaviour and LBP. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to lay the foundations for comparing the sitting behaviour of subjects with and without back pain by means of dynamic pressure distribution measurements.

Sitting behaviour was analysed by means of our in-house developed SIT-CAT (Sitting Categorisation Technology). SIT-CAT consists of a textile pressure sensor mat (PST04, SensingTex, Barcelona, Spain) with an 8 × 8 sensor matrix (size 35 × 35 cm), a data acquisition/transmission unit (SDK DEMO KIT, SensingTex) and a mobile phone (Nexus 5, Google, LG, Seoul, Korea) with an appropriate application to receive as well as to store the pressure data using Bluetooth technology (Fig. 1
                        ). The textile pressure mat was laterally fixed using two elastic straps around the seat pan with two Velcro strips fastened around the backrest in order to prevent the pressure mat from sliding during the measurement period. Pressure data were recorded at 5 Hz and a resolution of 12 bits.

Twenty complete sitting behaviour data sets of voluntary subjects working in an office chair were recorded each during one working day. All subjects (7 females and 13 males) with an average age of M = 45 years (27–57 years), a height of M = 1.75 m (1.60–1.89 m) and a weight of M = 71 kg (50–105 kg) provided written informed consent to participate in this pilot study, which was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Potsdam (no. 42/2014) and confirmed by the local ethics committee of the ETH Zurich. The measurements were carried out with employees of the Swiss accident insurance company SUVA (Luzern, Switzerland) at their own workplace.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

Prior to the beginning of the working day, the subjects' office chairs were each equipped with SIT-CAT (Fig. 1) and the pressure data recording was started. The subjects performed their usual VDU work with a minimal working time of 3 h including a 15-min-break in the morning, with a similar schedule in the afternoon, resulting in a working and measurement time of at least 330 min. After the working day, data acquisition was stopped and calibration measurements for the detection of the sitting positions were performed. To do so, subjects were asked to sit four times in seven different sitting positions (upright, reclined, forward inclined, laterally tilted right/left, crossed legs right over left/left over right; Zemp et al. (2015a)). The examiner started the 1-s calibration measurements after subjects had comfortably adopted the particular sitting position. The subject-specific office chair settings were maintained for both the sitting behaviour as well as the sitting position classification measurements in order to ensure consistency in the execution of the sitting positions.

Subjects also received a standardised questionnaire, which consisted of two sections measuring long (von Korff et al. (1992)) and short-term (BPI; Radbruch et al. (1999)) pain outcomes. The von Korff inventory was chosen as it is a reliable, valid and widely used tool (Hawker et al., 2011) to assess long-term pain. Furthermore, the von Korff inventory consists of fewer items compared to most of the similar tools within the same range of reliability such as the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, Fairbank and Pynsent (2000)) or the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ, Muller et al. (2004)). In addition, we specifically complemented the von Korff inventory with the BPI questionnaire due to its ability to assess back pain within the last 24 h, which is expected to have a high influence on the current sitting behaviour.

Firstly long-term chronic pain was assessed using the von Korff inventory that distinguishes between the intensity of pain (subscale: Korff Pain Intensity), scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain possible) and impairment throughout pain (subscale: Korff Disability) in the last three months (scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (“I wasn't able to do anything”)). For example, one question for the determination of the pain intensity subscale was: “During the past three months on the average how intense was your pain on a scale from 0 to 10?”. Regarding the Korff disability subscale, an example question was: ”In the last three months, how strongly did back pain impair your leisure time activities and activities with friends and family on a scale from 0 to 10?” (Klasen et al., 2004). The two subscales for pain and impairment show good internal consistency in the sample with Cronbach's alpha of 0.79 for pain intensity and 0.88 for pain disability.

Secondly 24hr pain was assessed by the German Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) that consists of 13 questions (similar to the Korff questionnaire, but looking at the last 24 h), and investigates pain intensity (subscale: BPI Severity; e.g.: “Please rate your pain (0–10) at its worst in the past 24 h”) and pain-related interference with function (subscale: BPI Interference; e.g.: “Circle the one number (0–10) that describes how, during the past 24 h, pain has interfered with your normal work”). Once again, these two subscales show good internal consistency in the sample with Cronbach's alpha of 0.90 for pain severity and 0.95 for pain interference.

The questionnaire was used to create four dichotomous variables dividing the subjects four times into two groups:
                           
                              
                                 Korff
                                 
                                    Pain
                                 : Subjects with a Korff pain intensity of 0 were allocated to group A (no pain in the last three months) and all others to group B.

                                    Severity
                                 : Subjects with a BPI pain severity score of 0 were allocated to group A (no pain in the last 24 h) and all others to group B.

                                    Interfer
                                 : Subjects with a BPI interference score of 0 were allocated to group A (no interference in the last 24 h) and all others to group B.

Raw pressure data were transferred from the mobile phone to a computer where the data analysis was performed using MATLAB (vR2014a, MathWorks Inc., Natick, USA).

In order to determine the sitting position of a certain time point during the one day pressure distribution measurements, random forest classification was used (Breiman, 2001). A previous study has shown that the random forest classification approach is a suitable and accurate method to classify different sitting positions (Zemp et al., 2015a). We therefore performed supervised learning using a random forest classifier, where the subject-specific sitting position classification algorithm was trained with the 64 median pressure values of the 1-s calibration measurements. An ensemble of 500 decision trees with between two and fifteen variables to select at random for every decision split was used (MATLAB's parameter name: NVarToSample), while all other parameters were kept at MATLAB's default level. A leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation was performed for every subject individually to quantify the reliability of the sitting position classification as well as to find NVarToSample providing the highest classification accuracy. As a result, the data of all sitting position measurements except one was used as training data and the remaining measurement was used for validation. The predicted seating position was then identified as correctly or wrongly classified. This procedure was repeated for every sitting position measurement (28 times), all NVarToSample values as well as for every subject. Afterwards, NVarToSample with the highest classification accuracy was selected to be used to classify the sitting positions in the dynamic pressure measurements for the corresponding subject.

In order to identify time periods at which subjects were transient from one sitting position to another (transient period), raw pressure data were analysed as follows: Firstly, the raw pressure data of the 64 pressure sensors were zero-phase low-pass filtered. In order to do so, the pressure data were both forward and backward processed using a first order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency fc of 0.2 Hz. Then, the first order derivatives of the filtered signals were calculated and a threshold value tdiff defined as 0.35% of the maximal pressure in the upright sitting position during the 1-s calibration measurements was calculated. If more than two-thirds of the loaded sensors showed a higher absolute change in the pressure value than tdiff, the corresponding time points were specified as a transient period. If a time gap between two transient periods was shorter than 3 s, the two periods were connected and considered as one longer transient period (Fig. 2
                           ). All remaining time points were classified as stable time periods.

The sitting positions during the stable time periods were categorised by means of the created random forest ensemble of decision trees for the corresponding subject. Using this approach, the sitting position of the frame was classified 1 s after the onset of a stable period. The identified sitting position was then assigned to the whole stable period. This approach allowed the one-day subject's measurements to be allocated to the seven different sitting positions, to transient periods as well as to periods where the chair was not used (no pressure sensor loaded).

To analyse the influence of back pain on the sitting behaviour the following sitting behaviour parameters were calculated:

Here, the correlation matrix method was applied to extract the principal components. The factor score of the first principal component (SitBePar) was calculated by means of a least squares regression approach.

In order to analyse how the different characteristics of pain impact sitting behaviour, a linear mixed model analysis of variances (ANOVA) was performed. The dependent variable in the ANOVA was the representative sitting behaviour (SitBePar) while the independent variables were the various pain related groupings for the participants, namely Korff

                        ).

The results of the analysis of the 1-s calibration measurements demonstrated an overall classification accuracy of 82.7% that varied between 63.8% (upright) and 96.3% (forward inclined) for the different sitting positions. The overall classification precision was 82.7% with a range between 67.1% (reclined) and 95.1% (forward inclined; Table 2
                        ). The random forest classification algorithm showed the best subject-specific performance with NVarToSample values between two and six for 17 out of the 20 subjects (Fig. 3
                        ).

The two most adopted sitting positions were the upright and forward inclined sitting positions with an average occurrence of 24.4% and 25.3% of the whole sitting time. Half the subjects clearly preferred one sitting position with 45% or more of their time spent in that position (Fig. 4
                        ).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Occupational musculoskeletal disorders (especially chronic LBP) are ubiquitous and modern office jobs require prolonged periods of static sitting (Reinecke et al., 2002; Vink and Hallbeck, 2012). Prolonged static sitting is thought to be associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders (Naqvi, 1994; Winkel and Jorgensen, 1986). However, since clear causality as well as the exact effects of dynamic sitting are yet to be established (O'Sullivan et al., 2012; O'Sullivan et al., 2013), the aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between back pain and specific sitting behaviour parameters.

With regard to the results of the back pain questionnaire, it is important to note that only the influence of slight pain/interference on the subjects’ occupational sitting behaviour were analysed within the current pilot study. Nevertheless, it was possible to divide the subjects into two groups based on each of the four pain related questionnaire groupings (Korff
                        
                           Pain

                           Interfer
                        ), and compare against sitting behaviour.

The achieved overall sitting position classification accuracy (82.7%) was comparable with the results of previous studies using pressure sensor mats to detect different sitting positions that reported accuracies of 79% (Tan et al., 2001), 87.6% (Mota and Picard, 2003), and 85.9% (Xu et al., 2013). However, the studies of Tan et al. (2001) as well as Mota and Picard (2003) used additional sensors on the backrest, whereas Xu et al. (2013) solely based the classification on a seat pan pressure mat with four times the resolution of sensors (256-sensor-matrix) than we used in the current study. Therefore, the classification accuracy achieved in this study, solely based on a 64-sensor-matrix placed on the seat pan, was remarkably high, possibly due to the use of tuned random forest algorithms for accurate subject specific sitting classification. Interestingly, the slightly lower accuracy values for the upright and reclined sitting positions can be explained by the fact that most of the participants fixed their backrest in an upright position during their working time. Therefore, for these subjects, the upright sitting position was almost the same as the reclined one. Thus, the upright position was often misclassified as the reclined position sitting and vice versa. If these two positions would have been considered as one and the same, the classification accuracy would have increased up to 88.8% for the corresponding six sitting positions.

Most of the investigated subjects largely performed their work in an upright and a forward inclined sitting position, whereas the reclined position was hardly used. This finding suggests that the subjects were often working in a screen-based, forward-oriented position. The distribution of the adopted sitting positions (Fig. 4) showed a very high inter-individual variability and therefore the use of average metrics to describe sitting behaviour has to be considered carefully. Furthermore, due to the fact that there is no ideal ergonomic sitting position (Pynt et al., 2001) that should be maintained for longer periods of time, but also since a dynamic sitting behaviour is important to maintain the health of the back (Krämer, 1973), the investigation of the dynamics of the sitting behaviour is much more important than the analysis of the used sitting positions themselves.

                         was able to capture almost 70% of the variance in the data and therefore proved to be a characteristic value for describing sitting behaviour. As a result, SitBePar was used to analyse the influence of the three related grouping variables on general sitting behaviour. The corresponding ANOVA revealed that the grouping that considers the degree to which pain interferes with function in the last 24 h (BPI
                        
                           Interfer
                        ), although not significant, has a strong influence on the sitting behaviour. On the other hand, the groupings based on pain severity within the last 24 h (BPI
                        
                           Severity
                        ), chronic pain intensity (Korff
                        
                           Pain
                        ), and level of disability within the last three months (Korff
                        
                           Dis
                        ), had almost no influence on the subjects’ sitting behaviour. This indicates that not the acute (previous 24 h) or chronic pain by itself, but rather the influence of acute pain on the functionality is able to alter occupational sitting behaviour. It is therefore plausible that people with back disorders but without any acute interference may not presently be aware of any pain, whereas subjects interfered by their pain are constantly reminded and therefore may adapt their sitting posture.

                           P

                        ). These findings are in agreement with previous studies (O'Sullivan et al., 2012; Telfer et al., 2009; Vergara and Page, 2002; Womersley and May, 2006), which reported that subjects with LBP or lumbar discomfort exhibited a more static sitting behaviour, including less micro-movements, but also sat for a longer period of time uninterrupted. However, in the present study these trends could only be clearly demonstrated for the grouping variable BPI
                        
                           Interfer
                         and not for either short-term pain severity (BPI
                        
                           Severity
                        ), or longer-term pain intensity (Korff
                        
                           Pain
                        )/disability (Korff
                        
                           Dis
                        ) as assessed over the period of three months, which is the typical cut-off time to be considered chronic. One key reason for this result could be the fact that the investigated subjects exhibited almost no chronic back pain, as well as an insufficient degree of non-chronic back pain to allow investigation of these effects in the other pain related groupings. If one consults the mean parameter values of the grouping variables BPI
                        
                           Severity

                           Pain
                         (Table 3), however, the trend towards a more static sitting behaviour for subjects with back pain is indicated by almost all sitting behaviour parameters.

A clear limitation of the current study is the low number of subjects analysed and that the spectrum of back pain levels in the subjects was low. As a result, the groupings should be considered carefully. However, as a pilot study, this investigation now provides clear indications as to the required direction of future studies for improved understanding of the relationship between sitting behaviour and back pain. Furthermore, pain intensity as well as disability scales have not often been used to divide subjects into different pain related groups, but are rather normally used to provide continuous dimensions (Von Korff, 2011; Von Korff et al., 2014). However, investigating the influence of the different continuous pain scales on sitting behaviour parameters was not feasible in the current study due to the low levels of pain intensity and disability within the analysed subjects. Nonetheless, we were able to illustrate the influence of back pain on sitting behaviour, even with low levels of back pain as well as a low number of subjects. As a result, it is reasonable that the relationship between back pain and sitting behaviour would be far more pronounced in subjects with more severe discomfort. Future studies should therefore specifically recruit subjects with higher pain levels, but possibly also analyse the influence of the exact location of back pain on different sitting behaviour parameters.

It has been shown that breaks in sitting time, regular changes between different sitting positions, as well as changing from a sitting to a standing working position all have a positive effect on the human body (Adams et al., 2006; Healy et al., 2008, 2011; Pynt et al., 2001). However, office workers often use only a few sitting positions, as it is very difficult to be aware of the sitting position/behaviour during concentrated working (Daian et al., 2007; Haller et al., 2011; Phillips, 1999). In order to increase awareness, sitting behaviour monitoring and feedback devices can be used, which could help preventing as well as detecting discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders at an early time point (Haller et al., 2011). However, musculoskeletal disorders and especially LBP are multifactorial in nature and therefore the whole biopsychosocial spectrum has to be considered to ensure thorough analysis and treatment (O'Keeffe et al., 2013). With this in mind, sitting behaviour is one of the factors that can be easily adapted and improved. Since, we are not aware of any product currently available on the market that is able to accurately monitor and analyse sitting behaviour and provide feedback to office chair users, SIT-CAT can offer users a suitable monitoring tool for personal feedback on sitting behaviour.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The introduced in-house developed SIT-CAT technology could successfully be used to classify different sitting positions with an accuracy higher than 80%. Although only subjects without or with mild back pain participated in this study, we were able to investigate differences in the sitting behaviour based on pain related groupings. Indeed, subjects slightly affected by back pain within the last 24 h exhibited a more static sitting behaviour compared to subjects without any discomfort. In the future, a feedback system could be integrated into the introduced SIT-CAT technology in order to increase awareness of sitting position and behaviour.
