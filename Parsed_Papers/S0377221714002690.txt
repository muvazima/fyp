                  We investigate the value of accounting for demand seasonality in inventory control. Our problem is motivated by discussions with retailers who admitted to not taking perceived seasonality patterns into account in their replenishment systems. We consider a single-location, single-item periodic review lost sales inventory problem with seasonal demand in a retail environment. Customer demand has seasonality with a known season length, the lead time is shorter than the review period and orders are placed as multiples of a fixed batch size. The cost structure comprises of a fixed cost per order, a cost per batch, and a unit variable cost to model retail handling costs. We consider four different settings which differ in the degree of demand seasonality that is incorporated in the model: with or without within-review period variations and with or without across-review periods variations. In each case, we calculate the policy which minimizes the long-run average cost and compute the optimality gaps of the policies which ignore part or all demand seasonality. We find that not accounting for demand seasonality can lead to substantial optimality gaps, yet incorporating only some form of demand seasonality does not always lead to cost savings. We apply the problem to a real life setting, using Point-of-Sales data from a European retailer. We show that a simple distinction between weekday and weekend sales can lead to major cost reductions without greatly increasing the complexity of the retailer’s automatic store ordering system. Our analysis provides valuable insights on the tradeoff between the complexity of the automatic store ordering system and the benefits of incorporating demand seasonality.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The main challenge in managing retail inventory is to match replenishment and demand, that is providing items on the shelf justified by an upcoming shopper demand. Economies of scale in supply, inadequate store execution and demand variation often lead to out-of-stocks and excess inventory. While store execution and retail out-of-stocks have received considerable attention in academia and business practice (see Aastrup & Kotzab, 2010), the impact of demand variation has largely been overlooked (Bijvanc & Vis, 2011).

Demand in retailing is known to vary depending on the day of the week and time of year, around important holidays such as Christmas, and the seasons. For example, ice cream is in higher demand in the summer months. Demand is also generally not evenly distributed within the day. For instance, in business districts more customers shop just after working hours on weekdays. Retailers can, to some degree, reduce demand variation, for instance by reducing promotions or offering “everyday low prices”. However, customer buying habits, like shopping on weekends, limit a retailer’s ability to completely smooth demand variations. This creates the need for retailers to account for seasonality in their inventory control and shelf inventories, in (partial) synchronization with the demand pattern (Aviv & Federgruen, 1997).

Not accounting for demand seasonality leads to systematic mismatches in demand and supply at the item-store level, resulting in higher than needed costs. For example, Gruen and Corsten (2008) show that out-of-sync replenishment and demand lead to recurring out-of-stocks in retail stores on specific days of the week. Yet, from our conversation with retailers, it appears that many of them lack the capabilities or skills to incorporate demand seasonality into their store ordering and shelf replenishment systems. Six medium-sized European retailers reported to us that their automated store ordering (ASO) systems do not have the technical capabilities to account for demand seasonality within the week. Similarly, two of Europe’s largest retailers told us that even though their ASO system allows for different yearly seasonality patterns for each item, they currently refrain from using refined seasonality pattern analysis because of the added level of complexity. We also spoke to a company which sells forecasting and ERP-type software for retailers. They reported that their program has the technical capability of monitoring sales patterns to a very fine granularity, yet so far none of their clients has ever asked for this information to be incorporated into replenishment decisions; it was only used for planning checkout staffing. All the retailers we spoke to were aware of the possible inefficiencies of not exploiting seasonality but were unsure of the return on investment for updating their systems. One retailer we met was in the process of investigating the mismatch between intra-day sales patterns and the replenishment times and building its own tool to address the problem.

We study a setting where demand has a known seasonality pattern with two types of variations: within-review period and across-review periods (the review period is defined as the time between when two replenishment orders are placed). We apply our findings to real-life examples where demand follows a seasonality cycle over the days of the week and the times of the day. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the type of seasonality pattern under investigation. It shows the sales of a specific cigarette product (global brand, single box of 10 cigarettes) at a European retail store for two months in 2010. Demand varies depending on the day of the week: weekly sales peak on Saturday and Sunday. Demand is also not evenly distributed within a day: on Saturday, most of the sales occur before 5pm while on Sunday most of the sales occurs after 5pm. In essence, the demand rate varies across days of the week and within the day, but displays the same periodic pattern every week.

Given seasonal customer demand, we research the following questions: (1) What is the cost of neglecting demand seasonality in retail inventory control? (2) For which type of products is this cost most significant? (3) How much can be gained by partially incorporating demand seasonality into an ASO system and what is the best way to do so? We answer these questions in a setting which is suitable for retail environments: we consider a single location, single item, lost sales inventory problem with handling costs, fractional lead time (i.e., a lead time shorter than the review period) and batch ordering. Further, we assume that demand is non-stationary, in particular the distribution of demand is different before and after the order is received within a review period and also exhibits a seasonal pattern. This means there are two types of demand variations: within-review period variations and across-review periods variations.

We consider four different settings in which the retailer accounts for varying degrees of seasonality. In the first setting, the retailer accounts for both types of demand variations. In the second setting, the retailer only accounts for across-review periods variations. In the third setting, the retailer only accounts for within-review periods variations. In the fourth setting, the retailer ignores all form of seasonality, which often corresponds to current retail practice.

In each setting, we calculate the inventory policy which minimizes the long-run average cost criterion by solving a Markov decision process and show that it does not have a simple structure. Then, the performance of the inventory policies in last three settings is evaluated using the true distribution of demand. This allows us to discuss when it is most important to incorporate within- and across-review periods variations into the ASO system and which type of variation is the most crucial. Third, we apply the problem to a real-life setting, using Point-of-Sales (POS) data from a European retailer and replenishment information. We also explore simplified policies of only distinguishing between weekday and weekend sales.

We find that incorporating seasonal variations can lead to a substantial decrease in costs – on average 4.91% in our application using POS data. Not surprisingly, we find that product categories with more variable demands lead to the highest optimality gaps but there is more to the story. First, we see that optimality gaps increase with average demand and decrease with case pack size, and the costs associated with ordering, handling and purchasing. Second, we see that from our POS data analysis that across-days variations have a greater impact than intra-day variations. In fact, taking intra-day variations into account without acknowledging across-days variations can lead to an increase in costs, i.e., more information is not always better. Finally we see that, in many cases, a very significant portion of the cost savings can be achieved with a simple distinction between weekday and weekend sales, provided the weekend is defined appropriately for each product category.

The closest paper to ours is a recent study by Tunc, Kilic, Tarim, and Eksioglu (2011), who investigate the best stationary policy given that demand is non-stationary. They find that a stationary policy may be a good approximation only if demand uncertainty is high, setup costs are high and penalty costs are low. Our papers have fundamentally different approaches. Tunc et al. (2011) search for the best stationary

                           )
                        
                      policy given non-stationary demand: the retailer knows that demand is non-stationary but restricts himself to a stationary policy because it is easier to implement. In contrast, this paper considers the best non-stationary inventory policy given a demand pattern that leaves out some seasonality, for example because the retailer uses weekly demand estimates. Further, Tunc et al. (2011) use a model with backorders, no lead time, a batch size of one, no handling costs and finite horizon, which means their work does not apply to the fast-moving consumer goods retail industry. In contrast, we consider an infinite-horizon average cost, lost-sales inventory model, with batch sizes and handling costs.

Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. Our first and main contribution is that we give insights on the tradeoff between the complexity of an ASO system and the cost benefits of incorporating demand seasonality to various degrees. Taking demand seasonality into account in an ASO system generally means making it more complex and opaque, which can decrease the store managers’ trust in the system. Interestingly we show that incorporating more of demand seasonality is not always beneficial. It is therefore important that retailers carefully analyze the demand patterns of their products before considering an upgrade of their ASO system. Our analysis can be used to provide motivation for improving an ASO system and provides suggestions on how to proceed. Our second contribution is theoretical: we are, to the best of our knowledge, the first authors to consider the impact of ignoring demand seasonality in a model tailored for retailing, i.e., a model with lost sales, lead times, batch sizes, and handling costs. In our analysis we calculate the optimal policy for each possible demand setting, using dynamic programming and show that it does not have a simple structure. Our third contribution is empirical: we include a study based on real-life sales data and illustrate the magnitude of the potential cost savings from incorporating demand seasonality.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We provide a review of relevant papers in Section 2. Our model is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we study the problem in four different settings wherein the retailer accounts for seasonality to various degrees. Section 5 applies the model to a real-life situation. Section 6 presents the conclusions and points towards further research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

In contrast to inventory models with backordering, where unmet demand is satisfied at a later time, lost-sales inventory models assume that customers are unwilling to wait for their order. Such behavior is frequent for retail out-of-stocks (Campo, Gijsbrechts, & Nisol, 2000). Lost-sales models penalize unmet demand to capture the negative effects of out-of-stocks. These include diminished customer loyalty and increased in-store logistics costs through staff attending shoppers and looking for out-of-stock items in back rooms (Gruen, Corsten, & Bharadwaj, 2002).

Because lost sales models are more difficult to analyze mathematically than backorder models, they have received much less attention in the inventory literature. With the exception of the case of zero lead time, for which it can be shown that (state-dependent) 
                        
                           (
                           R
                           ,
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policies are optimal (see e.g., Cheng & Sethi, 1999; Veinott & Wagner, 1965), there is no simple optimal replenishment policy in lost sales inventory systems. As Bijvanc and Vis (2011) write in their comprehensive review on lost sales inventory modeling, “not much is known about an optimal replenishment policy when excess demand is lost”. Therefore, the focus of most papers is on studying the performance of practically motivated policies (see e.g., Hill & Johansen, 2006; Johansen & Hill, 2000), obtaining structural properties of the optimal policy (see e.g., Huh & Janakiraman, 2010; Zipkin, 2008) or deriving bounds (e.g., Karlin & Scarf, 1958, chap. 10; Morton, 1969). Most of the methods employed in these papers also apply to the case of non-stationary demand.

A recent development related to our research is the consideration of fractional lead time, i.e., when the lead time is shorter than the review period. Kapalka, Katircioglu, and Puterman (1999) study the steady-state behavior of the on-hand inventory when the objective is to minimize the long-run average cost subject to a fill rate constraint. Janakiraman and Muckstadt (2004) analyze properties of the optimal policy and compare it to the best order-up-to policy. Chiang (2006) uses dynamic programming to analyze such a model with no fixed costs. Sezen (2006) uses simulation programming to study the impact of review period length on the average on hand inventory level and fill rate.

Also recently, handling costs have been added to lost-sales inventory modeling. Curşeu, Van Woensel, Fransoo, and Erkip (2011) include store handling cost into the single-item inventory problem in a retail setting. This reflects Van Zelst, van Donselaar, van Woensel, Broekmeulen, and Fransoo (2009)’s finding that item handling (e.g. receipt of goods, shelf replenishment) accounts for 75% of store logistics costs, while inventory accounts for the remaining 25% (see also Saghir & Jönson, 2001). Curşeu et al. (2011) examine the optimal policy under the long-run average cost criterion using parameter values typical for grocery retailing. They show that retailers can achieve substantial cost reductions by including handling costs in their inventory decisions.

Studies which look specifically at the issue of non-stationarity in demand are scarce (Tunc et al., 2011) and most focus on the case when unsatisfied demand is backordered. Karlin (1960a, 1960b) studies the discounted version of the non-stationary demand problem and gives an algorithm to calculate the optimal policy. Zipkin (1989) proposes an alternative policy for the average-cost problem. Johnson and Thompson (1975) proves the optimality of myopic inventory policies for certain dependent demand processes. Morton (1978) obtains bounds on the infinite horizon problem by allowing disposal in each period. Song and Zipkin (1993) obtain some monotonicity properties for the optimal policy in a setting where demand rates vary with an underlying state-of-the-world variables. Tarlim and Kingsman (2006) propose heuristic methods for calculating near optimal

                      policies with non-stationary demand while Silver (1981) and Morton and Pentico (1995) focus on alternative inventory control policies.

We consider a periodic review inventory replenishment system with lost sales, batch ordering and inventory handling costs, similar to that of Curşeu et al. (2011). The review cycle length R, i.e. the time between when two successive orders are placed, is exogenous to the model and set as the time unit. The lead time L is fixed and shorter than the review period length (i.e., we have fractional lead times). Hence, each review period is divided into two parts: a period of length L before order is received, and a period of length 
                        
                           R

                      after the order is received and before the next order is placed. Demands in these two parts are independent discrete random variables which exhibit a seasonal pattern with a fixed period of

                     , that is, the demand during the lead time in review period t has the same distribution as demand during the lead time in review period

From Fig. 3, we see that the structure of ordering policies differ from an

                         policy as for low levels of inventory on-hand, the advice is to order the same quantity. We also see that the order quantity seems to be monotone in the inventory on-hand in all four settings. This is true in most cases but not always, as also noted by Curşeu et al. (2011), Hill and Johansen (2006), and Jansen (1998).

Further, we see that the inventory policy in the

                         settings reveals that ignoring within review-period variations leads to lower-than-optimal order quantities. This is because most of the demand occurs during the lead time, therefore the retailer tends to underestimate demand uncertainty when it assumes that demand is evenly distributed during the review period as is the case in the

                         is high, so that little demand occurs during the lead time, the retailer benefits from ignoring both types of variations rather than accounting for within-review-period variations only. In other words, less information is better! This is because the retailer who ignores both types of seasonality benefits from two effects running in opposite directions. Not seeing that most of the demand occurs after the lead time results in higher than optimal order quantities. Not seeing that most of the demand occurs at the end of the season leads to lower than optimal order quantities in periods with higher season indices. Combined, the two effects partially offset each other. In contrast, the retailer who only ignores across-review periods variations but accounts for within-periods variations will order too little at the start of the season, resulting in higher stock-out penalties. Though this counter-intuitive result is a byproduct of our mathematical model, it nonetheless illustrates the fact that retailers should use caution when incorporating demand seasonality into their ASO. It is important to do a careful analysis and understand that some forms of seasonality are more important to incorporate than others. The next section shows how to perform such an analysis in practice.

                         and q. This can be explained by the fact that larger fixed costs (per order or per batch) and larger case pack sizes lead to larger optimal order quantities. As a result, it becomes less important to observe across- and within-review periods variations because the inventory ordered is used to cover multiple periods of demand. Moreover, the optimality gaps of the three policies are increasing in the penalty cost p. This is because a higher penalty cost makes the under-stocking associated with ignoring seasonality more costly. Further, an increase in the average demand

                         leads to an increase in optimality gaps since more demand to satisfy means more opportunity for errors when seasonality is ignored.

                         setting is more difficult to analyze because of the two opposite effects offsetting each other as discussed above.

In this section, we evaluate the value of accounting for demand seasonality using item-store level POS data collected at a European retailer for a single store in the entire year of 2010. The store stocks about 10.000 items (i.e. stock-keeping units) and is located at a major intersection, with two competitors’ stores nearby. It is open 7days a week from 6am to 10pm.

The retailer records sales by the second and stores this data by the hour. So it is possible to observe monthly, weekly, daily and intraday demand variation. Following Van Donselaar, Gaur, van Woensel, Broekmeulen, and Fransoo (2010), we conducted several observations on replenishment (after shelving) and on-shelf availability (before store closing) to ensure that tasks are executed as planned and sales data are not distorted by out-of-stocks. We did not find frequent or systematic out-of-stocks and therefore assume historical sales data to be a reasonable representation of shopper demand. In what follows we use the terms sales and demand interchangeably.

We analyze sales data at the item-level and find that demand during the week follows specific patterns. These patterns vary among items and are distinct from store sales patterns (see also the example of cigarette sales in Section 1, Fig. 1). We focus our analysis on a sample of 10 items from 10 different product categories. All of these items are included in the ASO system.

For each of the items, shelf replenishment is structured as follows. Every evening at 5pm, the ASO system observes on-hand inventory and calculates the order quantities. The store manager either approves or overwrites the orders and sends a confirmation to the distribution center. All orders are processed in the same regional distribution center which the retailer owns and operates. There are no direct deliveries from suppliers. The order placed every evening at 5pm arrives by truck from the distribution center the next morning. Until 10am, store staff shelves all items according to the planograms. The replenishment staff is well trained in shelf replenishment. The store has a small backroom for organizing items for shelf replenishment, e.g. to dispose of excess packaging, and to organize returns of roll cages and recycling materials. Items left over from shelf replenishment (one jar of jam, two deodorants, etc.) are organized in backroom bins until the next scheduled shelf replenishment.

Based on our discussion with the store management,
                        5
                        Specifically, we talked to the store head manager, replenishment and checkout staff, the corporate heads of logistics and sales as well as the forecasting and ASO team in the retailer’s headquarters.
                     
                     
                        5
                      it appears there is no systematic practice of overwriting the ASO’s order quantities. In particular, we believe that the store manager does not advance orders to balance workload as discussed in Van Donselaar et al. (2010). Overwriting the ASO occurs on rare occasions when store manager expects demand to deviate from the order suggestion based on her personal experience.

The ASO system generates orders in three steps. First, the system calculates an average of the past 52weeks of sales data, excluding promotions and special events, for example the national day. Second, it divides the resulting weekly demand estimate by seven in order to obtain the daily demand estimate. Third, the system compares the demand estimate to on-hand inventory and calculates the daily order quantities according to a formula accounting for case pack size and shelf space. It follows that the current ASO system neither accounts for intra-week sales variations nor intra-day variations. So for example, it ignores if an item typically sells more on Saturday than on Monday. Also, the ASO system ignores if an item sells more at night (after the 5pm order placement) than before lunch (after the 10am replenishment of the last order).

The team in charge of ASO at this retailer is thinking of incorporating intra-week sales variations to a certain degree by calculating two daily demand estimates: one for weekday sales and one for weekend sales. However, they are unclear about whether to treat Friday sales as weekday or weekend.

As mentioned earlier, the 10 items we study can be ordered every day at 5pm and the store is open every day from 6am to 10pm. Hence, we use 
                           
                              R
                              =
                              16
                           
                        
                        hours=1 (business) day for the length of the review period. Given that the new order is on the shelves by 10am, we use (10−5)+(10−6)=9hours=9/16day for our estimate of the lead time L. Therefore, in this section, within-review-period variations mean intra-day variations while across-review periods correspond to across-days variations. Note that a review period overlaps with two days of the week but for simplicity we call each review period by the day of the week where there is the most overlap. Also let day 1 in a week be Sunday, day 2 be Monday, etc.

For each item, the sales data exhibit a clear seasonality pattern with a period of one week, i.e., 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                                 
                                    ¯
                                 
                              
                              =
                              7
                           
                         days. Fig. 1 in Section 1 gives an example of the observed seasonality patterns. As in Section 3 we model the demand using a Poisson distribution, which proved to be a good fit for our data set.

The 10 items we selected cover a broad range of sales velocity, weekly and daily sales patterns, case-packs sizes, and other attributes, including global brands, national brands, regional brands, and private labels; hedonic and utilitarian items; items for immediate consumption and home storage; as well as varying degrees of shelf life. This product selection approach is common in on-shelf availability research (see, for instance, Campo et al., 2000; Gruen & Corsten, 2008).
                           6
                           Utilitarian items are primarily instrumental and functional, whereas hedonic items provide more experiential value, fun, excitement, and pleasure (see Sloot, Verhoef, & Franses, 2005).
                        
                        
                           6
                         Weeks during which there was a promotion or a special event (specifically Easter, Christmas, and the national day) were ignored in our analysis.


                        Table 2
                         gives the average sales values during the lead time (L), after the shelving of the new order (
                           
                              R
                              -
                              L
                           
                        ) for each day of the week as well as average weekly demand and the corresponding case pack size.

We also include two measures of sales variability:

                                    W
                                 
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    V
                                 
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                              
                           
                         which respectively capture the extent of within-review periods variations and across-review periods variations. They are calculated as follows:

                         policy introduced in Section 4. Note that this is not an exact representation of the retailer’s ASO system for two main reasons: (1) the policy used by the ASO system is a simpler policy which resembles an 
                           
                              (
                              s
                              ,

                         policy (2) the order quantity chosen by the ASO system is not explicitly based on a minimization of the costs involved. In terms of costs, the

                         policy is therefore a lower bound on the performance of the policy used by the ASO system, which implies that our results on the impact of incorporating seasonality are on the conservative side.

We compare this policy to the

                         policy which considers within-day but not across-days variations. We also construct six new settings in which the retailer groups the days of the week into weekdays versus weekend days and calculates a separate average daily demand for each group (as mentioned before, the retailer we spoke to considered implementing a similar idea). The six settings differ with respect to the definition of weekend (either Friday–Saturday, Saturday–Sunday or Friday–Saturday–Sunday) and whether or not they account for intra-day variations. In settings where the retailer does not account for intra-day variations, he assumes that the demand is evenly distributed throughout the review period. In his book-keeping, he keeps track of only two values of demand: the daily weekday demand and daily weekend demand.

                         and WFSS settings when the weekend is defined respectively as Friday–Saturday, Saturday–Sunday and Friday–Saturday–Sunday. The calculation of the corresponding 
                           
                              λ
                           
                         vectors is given in the Appendix A.

Calculating the minimum long-run average cost under each setting requires an estimate of the cost parameters, which in practice is a very difficult task.
                           7
                           For instance, Zipkin (2000) notes this difficulty as an obstacle for practical implementation. Only partial solution approaches to this problem exist in research, such as observational studies on store handling cost (e.g. Curşeu et al., 2009) and estimations on stockout penalty costs (e.g. Anderson, Fitzsimons, & Simester, 2011; Olivares, Musalem, Bradlow, Terwiesch, & Corsten, 2011).

                         For this reason, we decided to vary the cost parameters in a way similar to the approach in Section 4.2. We use

                         policy, which is a conservative estimate of current practice by the retailer, can be substantial. The maximum value we encountered in our numerical analysis was equal to 66.27%. This means that the retailer’s costs can be 66.27% higher than optimal when he ignores all forms of demand seasonality. The average optimality gaps across all product categories was 4.91%, with the greatest average values achieved for the caffeinated soda (16.10%), the potato chips (12.98%) and the energy drink (6.81%). Not surprisingly categories with more variable demands, as measured by

                         policy, that is accounting for across-days seasonality, would lead to a decrease in the average optimality gaps. This is especially notable with the energy drink (from 6.81% to 1.48%), the caffeinated soda (from 16.10% to 0.87%), the sausage (from 4.83% to 1.12%) and the potato chips (from 12.98% to 0.29%). This means that the retailer has a lot to gain from incorporating across-days variations. In fact doing so alone brings the retailer within 1.85% of optimality for all items and within 1% for seven of them.

We also see that a significant reduction in costs can be achieved by simply distinguishing between weekdays and weekend days: for example from 12.98% to 0.62% for potato chips. In some cases however, it is important to use the appropriate definition for the weekend. For example, the weekend should clearly be defined as Saturday–Sunday for the energy drink, caffeinated soda, croissant and potato chips items, as Friday–Saturday for sausage and as Friday–Saturday–Sunday for lettuce. Not defining the weekend properly can lead to worse performance than the 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    W
                                 
                                 
                                    ‾
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    A
                                 
                                 
                                    ‾
                                 
                              
                           
                         policy (e.g., for the energy drink, croissants, cigarettes and orange juice). Incorporating intra-day variations generally leads to a further reduction in costs but this improvement is not as important compared to the cost decrease that comes with the weekday-weekend distinction.

Interestingly, the connection between the number of input variables included in the ASO system and the optimality gaps is not straightforward: increasing the complexity of the ASO by adding more variables does not necessarily mean greater cost savings. This can be seen in Table 3
                        . For example, switching from the

                                    ‾
                                 
                              
                           
                         policy to the 
                           
                              W

                         policy does not always lead to an reduction in the average optimality gaps. In particular, the retailer would be worse off if it was to incorporate intra-day variations without taking into account across-days variations for the energy drink, caffeinated soda, sausage, potato chips and cigarettes. This is another example of ‘less information is better’ as discussed in Section 4.1. Also we see that incorporating only two input variables in the ASO system using the appropriate definition of the weekend can do better than using four input variables and an inadequate definition of the weekend. This suggests that there is an important tradeoff between ASO complexity and the benefits of incorporating demand seasonality, which has not received research attention previously.

In summary, we found that ignoring seasonal variations can lead to an increase in costs (on average 4.91%). The greatest benefit comes from incorporating across-days variations and much of this benefit can be captured with a distinction between weekday and weekend sales, provided the weekend is defined appropriately for each product category. In some cases, capturing intra-day sales variations without accounting for across-days differences can lead to an increase in costs, showing that the retailer should carefully analyze demand seasonality before deciding how to incorporate it into his ASO.

The aim of our study was to provide insights on the impact of incorporating demand seasonality in a retail replenishment system. Our motivation stems from the observation that many retailers do not (fully) consider seasonality in practice because of a lack of technical capabilities of their ASO system or a desire to reduce complexity.

Our paper yields some important insights for retail management. By accounting for non-stationary demand in inventory management, retailers can reduce inventory holding, handling and stock-out cost substantially. Cost savings are higher for fast-moving items with high demand variability across-review periods and low case pack size. Yet, in some cases, accounting for more demand seasonality can lead to an increase in costs, which suggests that the upgrade in the ASO system should be considered carefully. Our numerical analysis with real life data indicates potential cost savings that are considerable for the retailing industry with its tight margins and rigorous focus on cost-efficiency (an average reduction of 4.91% in optimality gaps). We show that it is most important to incorporate across-days variations and that large cost savings can be already achieved with a simple distinction between weekday and weekend sales, provided that the weekend is defined appropriately for each item (the optimality gap goes down to an average of 1.64%). Doing so improves the return on investment in automated store ordering systems that are equipped with the capabilities of accounting for non-stationary demand.

In our study, we did not focus on obtaining structural properties of the optimal policy. For the general case with fixed ordering and handling and fractional lead times, we have shown that the ordering policy in all four settings does not have a simple structure. However, it may be a special case of our model. We leave this possibility for future research, as this question is of a different scope than the current paper.

As our model is not specific to a particular demand pattern, it may also be employed in ultra-high selling retail outlets with multiple deliveries per day, for instance. The smaller the review period, the more accurate the information for shelf replenishment. Moreover, albeit the focus of this research was the retailing industry, we believe the insights to be of interest to similar settings, where product values are low compared to handling costs, demand is non-stationary and non-availability is penalized by customers.

In order to limit the complexity of the inventory problem at hand, we excluded minimum shelf inventory requirements, shelf space restrictions (we assume shelf space to be sufficient for demand during lead time), and perishability concerns in our analysis. Incorporating minimum stock requirements and shelf space restrictions into the model may provide interesting insights under non-stationary demand (see also Curşeu et al., 2011). Also, we investigate a single-item, single-location problem. Future research could work towards building multi-item and/or multi-echelon models and investigate workload scheduling and balancing in the retail supply chain (such as adjustments to delivery times as well as seasonal capacity constraints and cost) and at the store level. Lastly, we do not consider promotional events. Future research could work towards understanding promotional non-stationarity, e.g. the item-level intraday and across-days effects of various types of promotions. Combining the insights of promotional demand variation with our non-stationary demand inventory model accounting for ordering and handling costs may provide additional insights to retail marketers and logistics managers for increasing the return on promotions. Finally, another possible avenue for future research is the study of easy-to-implement heuristic policies which incorporate demand seasonality. For example, it would be interesting to study how well a
