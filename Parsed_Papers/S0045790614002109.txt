                  Compressed sensing recovers a sparse signal from a small set of linear, nonadaptive measurements. A sparse signal can be represented by compressed measurements with a reduced number of projections on a set of random vectors. In this paper, a multiscale compressed sensing based processing is investigated for an electrocardiogram signal which yields coded measurements. In case of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the coded measurements are expected to retain the clinical information. To achieve this, compressed sensing based processing is applied at each wavelet scale and measurements are coded using Huffman coder. The measurements at each scale use random sensing matrix with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) entries formed by sampling a Gaussian distribution. The proposed method is evaluated using pathological ECG signals from the CSE database, synthetic and normal ECGs. It helps preserve the pathological information and clinical components in compressed signal. The compressed signal quality is evaluated using standard distortion measures and mean opinion score (MOS). The MOS values for the signals range from

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging framework of signal processing where a sparse signal is recovered from a few samples [1,2]. It can reconstruct the signal from a set of highly incomplete measurements, which is conventionally believed to have insufficient information. This can be achieved if the signal has a sparse representation with an orthonormal basis. Since the last decade, a number of studies have been carried out on this novel idea to realize various signal and image processing applications [3,4]. Attempts have been made to acquire data directly in a lower dimensional subspace with, M, projections rather than its conventional higher dimensional projections, N, where 
                        
                           M
                           ≪
                           N
                        
                     . The possible research directions in sparse representation are discussed by various researchers [5–7]. The general framework for signal processing with compressive measurements has been discussed by Davenport et al. [8]. In time domain, CS has been applied to single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for data compression in wireless body sensor networks [9]. For multi-lead ECG, compressed measurements were acquired using wavelet basis [10]. For ECG data compression, a joint sparsity model is used to exploit intra and inter-signal correlations [11]. CS based data acquisition system with wireless bio-sensors is proposed for bio-signals like ECG and EMG [12]. For wireless telemonitoring of fetal ECG (FECG), for compression and reconstruction of non-sparse raw FECG recordings, block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework is proposed [13]. In an ECG signal, clinically essential diagnostic information such as P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave are present. These clinical components may carry pathological information. Application of CS based signal processing should not alter these information. Sparse representation is an essential requirement for successful implementation of CS when applied to an ECG signal. Thus, sparsity of the signal in wavelet scales can be exploited for application of compressive sensing. Multi-resolution decomposition of an ECG signal results in gross segmentation of its clinical information into different wavelet subbands [14–16]. It is similar to the different principal component (PC) capturing diagnostic components when principal component analysis (PCA) [17] is applied to ECG. The wavelet coefficients of higher order subbands capture most of the energy of the signal whereas lower order subbands contain less energy. Thus, the signal can be viewed as a representation having varied degrees of sparsity at different scales. The sparse characteristics of wavelet coefficients at different scales and the gross segmentation of the clinical information can help implementation of CS more efficiently, retaining diagnostic information. So, a multiscale compressive sensing (MCS) based signal processing which gives coded measurements of an ECG signal is proposed and investigated. However, it is assumed that the ECG signal is passed through analog-to-digital converter as in ‘digital CS’ [9,13]. The proposed methodology is presented in Section 2. Section 3 shows and discusses the results and a brief conclusion is presented in Section 4.

The motivation for the proposed multiscale CS is due to the gross segmentation of clinical components at different wavelet scales. The basic requirement is the sparseness of the signal in a suitable orthonormal basis. This will help recover the signal from a small set of linear and non-adaptive measurements of sparse samples. Reconstruction of a sparse signal is performed by solving convex optimization problem through L1-norm minimization. However, it should satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) and incoherence between orthonormal basis and sensing or measurement matrix [1,2]. The wavelet coefficients,

The approximation subband contains the low-frequency components of the signal and the details subbands contain the high-frequency components. The multiscale decomposition (MSD) exhibits good localization properties in time and frequency and the energy of the signal is captured by a few wavelet coefficients. Thus, it partitions the signal energy at different frequency bands. L level MSD for a given signal

The clinical significance and sparsity of the signal at different scales suggest that implementation of CS at different scales will be meaningful for retention of significant information.

Wavelet transform of an ECG signal shows sparse or near sparse samples at different wavelet scales with respect to the wavelet basis (

                        ). The finest scale produces coefficients with larger values and the coefficients of coarser scales are small in amplitude. If there are K non-zero entries in a signal, it is termed as K-sparse,

                        To achieve further compression, the compressed measurements are quantized uniformly and the Huffman coding is applied. Before the reconstruction process through L1-norm minimization, the coded samples are decoded and de-quantized. Recovered wavelet coefficients at different scales are arranged to apply inverse wavelet transform. This will produce the compressed signal in time domain.

The proposed method is shown in Fig. 2
                        . First, the signal is processed through the sparsifying basis,

                        . Then coefficient stratification gives approximation subband,

                        , and details subbands,

                        . Compressed measurements are obtained for each scale or targeted scale to preserve the clinical and the pathological components. Then the measurements are uniformly quantized and Huffman encoded. It produces encoded bit stream of each scale. In the reconstruction or the recovery path, the bit streams of each scale are decoded and de-quantized. At each scale, the wavelet coefficients are recovered by applying L1-norm minimization which is a convex optimization problem. Finally, to get the reconstructed signal inverse wavelet transform is applied.

                         are the number of non-zero entries. The compression ratio (CR) is defined as the ratio between the total number of bits used in the original signals to the total number of bits in the compressed signals [16]. After the compressed measurements and its recovery by convex optimization, the ECG signal may get distorted. It is essential to evaluate the distortion that appear in the compressed signal. The signal fidelity is evaluated by qualitative analysis and quantitative measures. Normally, the distortion measures such as the normalized mean square error (NMSE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the normalized RMSE (NRMSE), the percentage root mean square difference (PRD) and the wavelet energy based diagnostic distortion measure (WEDD) [20] are evaluated. The PRD gives normalized value of the error between the original and the compressed signal. Few other local error measures like maximum absolute error (MAE) or peak error (PE) and normalized MAE (NMAE) [10,20] are also evaluated.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ECG signal [21,22] and multilead ECG signals from common standards for electrocardiography (CSE) multilead measurement library [23]. The data set 3, CSE library has 125 original ECG data sets with almost equal numbers of normal and various pathological cases. The sampling frequency of the signal is 500Hz with 10 bits resolution and maximal 5mV quantization. Six level wavelet decomposition, [16] is performed using Daubechies 9/7 biorthogonal wavelet basis. Since the proposed method involves recursions, numerical results produced in this paper are the average of minimum twelve (12) simulations.

                         are linearly measured [5] without considering any sparsity, but they are subjected to Huffman coding with 8 bit quantization as others. To investigate the compression and the corresponding distortions introduced in the signal, simulations are performed at different sparsity levels. The CR and PRD values are plotted with the sparsity levels and they are shown in Fig. 4
                        (a) and (b). It is observed that the CR values are linearly increasing with good PRD values for sparsity level from

To evaluate the proposed method using real ECG signal, standard 12-lead clinical ECG data are taken from CSE multilead measurement library. Simulations are carried out using 20 data sets. Each data set contains 12-standard ECG signals in lead-I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6. Considering 4096 samples from each lead, signals are pre-processed for amplitude normalization and mean removal. Amplitude normalization factors are required in the reconstruction stage to de-normalize the signals. Fig. 5
                         shows the compressed signals of lead-I, lead-II, lead-aVR and lead-V6 along with the original signals. The data set M01-010 (Fig. 5) is a pathological case and T-wave carries this clinical information.

                         are compressively measured. During the Huffman coding stage, all the subbands are uniformly coded with same number of quantization bits. It is observed that the compressed signals contain all the clinical information like P-waves, QRS-complexes and T-waves including the pathological signatures. The processed signals also show the denoising effect which is clearly visible in case of lead-I and lead-aVR. The values of compression ratio for lead-I, lead-II, lead-aVR and lead-V6 are

The WEDD values are within the acceptable range [20]. The values for various signal distortion measures with compression ratio are shown in Table 2

The higher PRD values are due to the removal of noise present in the signals. The WEDD values faithfully capture the distortions of clinical features. The highest average WEDD value is

                         shows the variation of CR, PRD and WEDD as a function of the number of quantization bits. Compression ratio (CR) is exponentially decreasing when the number of quantization bits is increased. For a 4-bit quantization, the CR value is

It is noticed that, in data sets M01-001 to M01-020, most of the signals contain noise. Due to denoising effect (refer Fig. 5) of proposed multiscale compressed sensing, noise is removed. Thus, PRD and WEDD values are higher. The higher average PRD and average WEDD values may be due to this reason. For compressed signal, the quality groups are given as excellent, very good, good and not bad based on WEDD ranges (0–4.517%), (4.517–6.914%), (6.914–11.125%) and (11.125–13.56%) respectively [20].

Subjective quality of the compressed signal is evaluated by semi-blind mean opinion score (MOS). It gives the true quality of the compressed signals [16,24]. The evaluators reviewed the diagnostic features, P-wave, QRS-complex, ST-segment and T-wave of the original and the compressed signals. Scores are recorded in the quality groups, 1 (bad), 2 (almost tolerable), 3 (tolerable), 4 (good) and 5 (excellent) [24] for each signal. The average score is the mean opinion score (MOS). Five signal processing experts (SP Expert) working in biomedical signal and image processing area and three doctors in cardiac expertise (C Expert) have evaluated the compressed signals. MOS errors are shown in Table 3
                         for the signals of lead-I, lead-II, lead-aVR and lead-V6 (Fig. 5). The compression ratio values for lead-I, lead-II, lead-aVR and lead-V6 are

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The wavelet coefficients at different subbands are sparse in nature that enables application of CS at different scales. The compressed measurements at different scales are Huffman coded. The proposed multiscale CS is evaluated using synthetic, normal and pathological signals. Qualitative analysis and quantitative distortion metrics are evaluated. The compression ratio up to

Irrespective of noise content in the signals, averaging over large data sets (20 data sets) for lead-II ECG signal, an average CR value of 
                        
                           18.05

                     . The main advantage of the proposed method is the application of compressive sensing at wavelet scales. The virtue of the sparse characteristics of wavelet coefficients at different scales having grossly segmented clinical information can help implementation of multiscale CS more efficiently retaining diagnostic information including the pathological signatures in the signal. The proposed multiscale CS-based processing may be realized with a modified architecture of CS. It requires a wavelet transform block with a coefficient stratification block at the front end and a Huffman coder, in addition to hardware required for CS.
