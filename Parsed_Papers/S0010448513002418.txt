@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The clothing industry is facing rapid changes of consumer demands. Individualized clothing design has been seen as a trend in clothing industry. How to rapidly meet the consumer demands is the key problem in garment industry. The usual uncertainty and fuzziness of the consumer demands make the problem even complicated. It is meaningful to provide a conceptual design platform which helps the customers to clarify their design demands iteratively and enables the designers conveniently exploring, comparing, and evaluating the design concepts. The goal of our work is to establish a 3D graphics-based platform by seeking an easy-to-operate 3D garment modeling method.

Various garment modeling methods have been developed since 1980s, most of which are typically 3D–2D–3D schemes  [1]: the process starts with a 3D conceptual idea in designer’s mind from which 2D fabric patterns are generated by pattern design tools (3D–2D stage). These patterns are then assembled and sewn together to form clothing on a 3D human model (2D–3D stage). In such a process, expert knowledge on 2D pattern generation is required. It has been shown that it takes years for a person to become an expert pattern-maker; even the design of simple garments, such as T-shirts and skirts, requires the expertise of an experienced pattern maker  [2]. In fact, in clothing industry, pattern making is a distinct job and is typically not handled by the designers themselves  [3]. The high coupling between garment design and pattern making blocks the designers’ creations. Not to mention, it would be much more difficult for common consumers to model their favorite garments.

We provide a novel and feasible solution for decoupling the garment design and pattern making. Our approach is examples-based; 3D new garments are created by assembling or altering garment examples on individual human models. As shown in the left half part in Fig. 1
                     , the examples in our database are classified into several levels according to their utilities. Users can choose proper examples with certain utilities and composite them on individual human models, as shown in the right half part in Fig. 1. Modeling 3D garments in such a “what you see is what you get” mode would greatly reduce the operation complexity and free the designers’ and customers’ creations and imaginations. Summarily, our approach distinguishes from the existing garment modeling methods with the following features:- 
                        
                           •
                           We propose a garment prototype guided garment parts composition method which allows designing 3D garment models by directly compositing 3D parts from existing examples. It makes easy for both the designers and customers to express their creations and imaginations in a 3D graphical way.

Our approach bypasses the patterning making in the design stage, which effectively decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making in current mainstream 3D garment modeling methods.

To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to create 3D garment models on individual human models by compositing parts from garment examples.

It should be pointed out that our approach decouples the garment design and pattern making but not avoid the pattern making. Pattern making is postponed. After creating a 3D garment model, its 2D patterns could be obtained by trimming the 3D garment surface into several patches and then flattening these patches into 2D patterns, as would be detailed in Section  6.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After reviewing the related work in Section  2, the feature curve-net based garment prototype generation method is proposed in Section  3. The garment prototype is used to guide fitting garment parts onto individual human models and compositing garment parts on individual human models as would be detailed in Sections  4 and 5, respectively. The manufacturability of the garment modeling result is improved in Section  6. Implementation details and user experience are described in Section  7. The whole paper is concluded in Section  8.

Traditionally, garments are designed with the aid of CAD systems, such as Gerber, Investronica, Lectra, CLO 3D, and Optitex. Most of these systems are based on precise geometry information, which are effective and useful in garment detail design; however they are less effective in garment conceptual design. As the preliminary stage of the whole design process, in conceptual design, the design idea is often shown as a kind of inspiration flashing, and the design information is usually incomplete and uncertain.

Sketch-based technologies have been emerged to support the conceptual design  [3,4]. These technologies enable the designers to express their design ideas through sketching planar garment silhouette around a human model. Distance from the planar garment silhouette to the body model is used to infer the distance variations between the 3D garment and the human model, so that the garment surface can be constructed. The context-aware method  [5] can be used to make the distance variations more reasonable. Such technologies are very useful in conceptual design. However they call for 2D drawing skills, not everyone has such skills especially for the users lacking artist knowledge.

Our work is inspired by the recent trend towards examples-based modeling in which new models with highly detailed geometries can be created by synthesizing  [6], fusing  [7], blending  [8] or directly stitching  [9] parts from existing examples after setting the correspondence between the parts. Such technologies make it possible to conveniently transform the abstract design ideas into visible 3D geometric models and can be accessible to a wide range of people, not only expert designers but also consumers without expert knowledge. Applications in creating new buildings  [6], characters  [7,8], furniture  [9] and mechanical products such as bicycles, articular robots, etc.,  [10] have been developed. However seldom has the examples-based method been proposed for 3D garment modeling. In this paper, we propose a method of creating 3D garment models by examples.

Different from most existing examples-based methods in which new models are created by directly compositing parts from different examples, in our approach, the garment parts are composited on individual human models. Garment parts from different garment examples are initially designed for human bodies in a variety of shapes and poses. To fit the garment parts onto individual human models, their shapes and poses have to be transformed, while their design details (e.g. design styles, pleats, etc.) are expected to be preserved. Thus, the key problems of example-based garment modeling are:

                           How to fit garment parts onto individual human models with design details preserved?

How to composite garment parts on individual human models?

A number of methods have been proposed for fitting garments onto human models. Most of these methods are related to transfer the garment model on a dressed source human model onto a target human model  [11–14] by transferring the spatial relationship between the source human model and the garment onto the target human model. Source human models are required in these methods, while in our approach, for adequately reduce the data, source human models are not saved in the database. Therefore, a method for directly fitting a garment model onto an individual human model is required. Our previous work  [15] addressed this issue by deforming the garment model with the guidance of shape matching between the garment surface and the human surface. The above methods are proper for fitting garment models onto individual human models with their design details preserved. However, in the garment design process especially in the concept design period, it is desirable to have a tool which supports altering the design style conveniently, so that new garment can be quickly and economically designed by altering the examples. Unfortunately, none of the above method supports such a function.

To composite garment parts, transitional surfaces between adjacent garment parts are to be generated if gaps exist in between them, or the garment parts are needed to be blended together if they overlap each other. A number of gap filling algorithms were proposed. In the area of examples-based modeling, the adjacent parts are mostly composited by directly stitching their boundaries  [9,16]. In the 3D scanning area, methods that can fill arbitrary holes on manifold meshes were proposed  [17]. Commonly, these algorithms share the similar strategy that the expecting surface for filling the gap or hole should reflect the shape transition of the existing model. While, in our approach, the transitional surface to be created between two adjacent garment parts should not only reflect the shape transition of the garment parts, but also reflect the shape variation of the human body underlying the garment. Interference between the transitional surface and the human body surface should also be avoided. These requirements are beyond the ability of the existing gap filling methods or hoe filling methods.

For addressing the above issues, we propose a garment prototype guided approach for fitting and compositing garment parts on individual human models. Garment prototypes representing the general garment geometries without decoration are automatically generated from individual human models and are used to approximate and parameterize the garment parts. Thus the spatial relationship between the garment prototype and the individual human model can be transferred onto the garment parts for fitting and composition, and this spatial relationship can be conveniently altered by editing the parametric curves on the garment prototype, so that the design style of the garment parts can be flexibly altered.

In our previous work  [11], an approach for automatically generating a feature-curve-net-based garment prototype on an individual human model was proposed. The individual human model can be obtained from various ways, such as 3D scanning, parametric modeling, etc. The feature curve net is weaved by girth feature curves (GFCs) and lengthwise feature curves (LFCs). GFCs are cubic splines each of which is initialized as the minimal convex hull of the corresponding cross-section of the individual human model as shown in Fig. 2
                     (a) and then is transformed based on the ease-allowance rule, as shown in Fig. 2(b). LFCs are cubic splines generated by linking the corresponding control points on neighboring GFCs. For more details, the readers are referred to  [11]. In this paper, the garment prototype is further developed into the multi-resolution model and volumetric model as follows, so that it can be more flexibly used in approximating and modifying garment parts.

The feature curve net can be converted into a triangular mesh, as shown in the top image in Fig. 2(c). This mesh determines the basic topology and geometry of the garment prototype, and is named as the basic mesh of garment prototype (BMGP). For each quadrilateral element in the feature curve-net, it spans a bicubic Coons surface

It should be pointed out that parametric surfaces other than Coons surface, e.g. Bézier surface or NURBS surface, can also be applied to generate the garment prototype. We adopt the Coons surface because of its merit that it passes through the control curves, which is intuitive for the users to understand how the garment prototype surface is controlled. Consequently, it would be easy for the users, especially for those who have no idea of the parametric surface, to learn to manipulate the garment prototype surface by interactively editing the control curves. Comparatively, the Bézier or NURBS surface does not pass through their control curves.

                     , a set of radial edges could be obtained, as shown in the bottom image in Fig. 2(c). These radial edges together with the BMGP form a volumetric garment prototype (VGP) model which would be used in aligning the garment prototype to garment parts, as would be detailed in Section  4.

The garment parts can be the existing garment models or obtained by cutting from the existing garment models. We apply our previous surface trimming method  [18] to cutting parts from garments: the user is asked to draw the boundaries of each garment part on the garment surface with curves; then our system uses these curves to trim out the garment parts. These garment parts are classified into various types according to which part on the human body it covers.

To composite the garment parts on an individual human model, they should first be fit onto the human model. For addressing this issue, each garment part in the database is assigned a skeleton aforehand with its structure being part of the human skeleton. The skeleton is used to coarsely align the garment prototype to the garment part in Section  4.1. The garment prototype is further approximated to the garment part in Section  4.2 for reducing their shape difference, and then the garment part is locally parameterized on the garment prototype in Section  4.3. With the local parameterization, when the garment prototype is restored to the state before alignment, the garment part would be accordingly deformed to align with the human model. The design style of the garment part is transferred to the garment prototype in Section  4.4.

The garment skeleton can be set up either manually or semi-automatically  [15]. In our system, the initial skeleton of each garment part is duplicated from the relative part of human skeleton; then the user is asked to drag each joint on the garment skeleton to a new position so that its on-screen projection coincides with that of the corresponding garment joint. Then the system automatically computes the intersections between the garment surface and the line from the joint in the view direction, and the joint is repositioned as the average position of the intersections. The detailed method is referred to our previous work  [15].

Generally, the garment parts have different poses from individual human models, as shown in Fig. 3
                        (a) and (b). Before approximating the garment prototype to a garment part, its pose should be aligned to the garment part, which is implemented through VGP by minimizing a deformation energy.

We use Eq. (1) to locally parameterize the garment part on the garment prototype. When we recover the surface of VGP, i.e the BMGP to its original state (shown in Fig. 3(a)), the parameterized garment part is accordingly fit onto the human model, as shown in Fig. 3(f). However, due to the surface details’ difference, interference between the garment part and the human model might be occurred, as shown in Fig. 3(f). Because the garment part is parameterized on BMGP, such an interference can be resolved by altering the feature curves on BMGP, as shown in Fig. 3(g). Alternatively, the interference can be automatically resolved by applying the contour minimization technology  [22]; however the local details such as pleats might be lost in this automatic scheme.

By editing the feature curves on BMGP, the style of the garment part can also be altered, e.g. when the GFCs on the waist and hip in Fig. 3(h) are edited into a state in Fig. 3(i), the skirt can be restyled, as shown in Fig. 3(j). Such a friendly restyling operation greatly improves the flexibility of the garment design process.

Some regions on the garment part might not be covered by the garment prototype; to preserve the surface details in editing, we deform the garment part by minimizing the constrained Laplacian energy in Eq. (5) by altering the constrained vertices to be the vertices parameterized on the garment prototype. Thus the deformation on the parameterized regions could be propagated to the un-parameterized regions.

In the above process, the shape style of the garment part can be lost in fitting the garment part onto a human model, e.g. fitting the garment shown in Fig. 4
                        (a) onto a female model would result in Fig. 4(b) where the hem that originally flares out becomes close to the human skin. It is desirable to preserve the design style in the garment part fitting result, as shown in Fig. 4(c). We address this issue by transferring the design style on the garment part onto the garment prototype.

The main factor affecting the garment style is the ease-allowance variation throughout the human body. Such a variation can be approximately measured by the variation of the distance from the garment surface to the human skeleton (DGH for short). Therefore, if we transfer the DGH variation on the garment part onto the garment prototype, we can approximately transfer the design style of the garment part onto the garment prototype.

Generally, a garment surface can be partitioned into loading regions and fashion regions  [23]. Loading regions (mainly the up parts of the arms, shoulders and chest, etc.) directly contact with the body surface to counter the garment gravity, while the fashion regions are draped freely to enhance aesthetic appearance. The variation of DGH in loading regions is quite small. Therefore, the style transferring is only tackled on the fashion regions. Taking the LFC linking the right armpit and the hem as an instance, shown in Fig. 4, the design style is transferred as follows.

First, the DGH on the boundary between the fashion region and the loading region is computed and used as a reference distance, e.g.

                         in Fig. 4(e).

                         is used to reposition the corresponding control points. After tackling the other LFCs similarly, the design style on the garment part can effectively be transferred onto the garment prototype, as shown in Fig. 4(f).

After fitting a number of garment parts onto a human model, the next step is how to assemble the garment parts into a completed garment model. There are two spatial relationships between adjacent garment parts: (1) overlap exists, (2) gap exists. For the first case, the overlaps are detected and removed first; as a result a narrow gap between the adjacent garment parts would be formed. Accordingly, this section is composed of two parts: removing overlap between two adjacent garment parts in Section  5.1, and filling gap between two adjacent garment parts in Section  5.2.

We call two adjacent garment parts overlap each other, if they cover the same region of the human body. Directly detecting the overlap between two garment parts is very complicated, since they may not intersect or touch each other. It is possible to address this issue by detecting whether the garment parts share the same projection domain on the human body. However, the projection accuracy would be affected by the distance and shape difference between the garment part surface and human body surface. On the other hand, each garment prototype is tightly approximated by the garment prototype, as described in Section  4. The amplitude of the distance variation between the garment part surface and the garment prototype is very small, unless very deep and very narrow wrinkles existing on the garment parts (such style seldom appears on garments). Therefore, we can accurately detect the overlap between two adjacent garment parts by detecting whether they share the common parameterization domain on the garment prototype.

The regions from two adjacent garment parts with their exact parameterization domain overlapped are regarded as overlapped regions. As shown in Fig. 5
                        (a), the blue and purple garment parts are partially overlapped; their overlapped parameterization domain is illustrated in green triangles on the arm part in Fig. 5(b).

                         would be trimmed out, as shown in Fig. 5(c). As a result, a narrow gap is formed between the two garment parts. Fig. 5(d) shows the two relevant boundary loops of garment parts in blue and in purple after trimming. If the parameterization domains of two garment parts are not overlapped, there would be a gap between them, as shown in Fig. 6
                        (a). Therefore, the remaining task is how to fill the gap.

We tackle this issue in two situations: when the gap is narrow, the gap is filled by directly triangulating the corresponding boundaries of two adjacent garment parts; when the gap is big, a transitional surface between the adjacent garment parts is created, taking the shape of human body into consideration.

For the gap is narrow, it can be filled by directly triangulating the two relevant boundary loops of the adjacent garment parts. We adopt the divide-and-conquer strategy to implement the triangulation.

The protruding vertices on one boundary loop usually point to another boundary loop, as shown by the black points in Fig. 5(e). We extract such protruding vertices and find their nearest vertices on another boundary loop to form a set of vertex-pairs. These vertex-pairs segment the two boundary loops into a number of polygons as shown in Fig. 5(f). Then the triangulation between the two boundary loops can be realized by triangulating each of these polygons. Such protruding vertices can be detected by checking whether the sum of triangles’ inner angles on each of which is smaller than a threshold or not. We control the threshold to make the number of vertex-pairs within 20–30, which could effectively make most of the resulting polygons be simple polygons. A spatial polygon is denoted as a simple polygon, if all its edges can be projected onto a plane without self-intersection. Such a simple polygon can be efficiently triangulated as follows.

For each spatial polygon, it is projected onto its average plane, if there is no self-intersection on the projected polygon, then it can be triangulated on the plane by using 2D Delaunay triangulation, as shown in Fig. 5(g). The mesh structure of the triangulation result is transferred onto the 3D polygon, as shown in Fig. 5(h). In case self-intersections occur in projecting a spatial polygon, this polygon is decomposed into smaller polygons before triangulation.

After triangulation, two garment parts can be composited into one, as shown in Fig. 5(i). However in the triangulation result, poor quality triangles (e.g. tiny or thin triangles) usually exist due to the different mesh resolutions and different surface details of the garment parts, which affects the display effect. For addressing this issue, we optimize the shapes of newly created triangles and their neighbors by employing the Laplacian filter  [19], which also smoothes the shape transition between the two adjacent garment parts. The resultant composition is shown in Fig. 5(j).

For the gap is big, as shown in Fig. 6(a) with the relevant boundary loops shown in Fig. 6(b), the above direct triangulation method could not effectively express the shape transition between the two garment parts, as shown in Fig. 6(c). For addressing this issue, we generate a transitional surface between the two garment parts first, and then merge the transitional surface and the garment parts into one surface.

Because the garment prototype well approximates the garment parts, so the general shape of the transitional surface can also be represented by the part of the garment prototype. In this way, the ease-allowance between the garment prototype and the human body can be implicitly transferred onto the transitional surface, so that the resulting transitional surface can well reflect the shape of the underlying human body. It is detailed as follows.

We extract the Coons patches that parameterize the vertices on the relevant boundary loops and the Coons patches in-between them, as shown in Fig. 6(d) and (e). The black triangle chains in Fig. 6(e) are the discrete triangles on the Coons patches that contain the projection of the boundary vertices. These Coons patches represent the general shape of the transitional surface, but lack the shape details. To propagate the surface details on garment parts onto the transitional surface, these Coons patches are discretized into a triangular mesh with its average edge length being that of the garment parts; then this discretized mesh is fit onto the garment parts by mesh Laplacian deformation, as shown in Fig. 6(f). The surface in-between the two triangle chains is extracted and used as the transitional surface, as shown in Fig. 6(g). The garment parts and the transitional surface form narrow gaps, as shown in Fig. 6(h), which are filled by the direct triangulation method, as shown in Fig. 6(i). The shapes of triangles adjacent to the seams are optimized by the Laplacian filter, as shown in Fig. 6(j).

With the above technical details, our approach provides a useful tool for the garment concept design and can be effectively applied in intuitively designing individual garments. As illustrated in Fig. 7
                           , after choosing an existing garment that is close to the designer’s or customer’s demand, he or she can iteratively alter the garment by substituting or compositing its parts from other examples. As shown in the figure, the garment parts are smoothly composited with the shape details and design styles well preserved.

In the conceptual design stage, the design idea changes frequently; the designers care how the garment looks like more than how it can be manufactured. However, our approach can bridge to the manufacturing stage by improving the manufacturability of the garment modeling results.

The manufacturability of a garment can be measured by its Gaussian curvature. A garment is manufacturable, if its surface is composed of developable patches, i.e. patches with their Gaussian curvature close to zero, so that the garment surface can be flattened into planar patterns within small compress and stretch deformation. These planar patterns are used to cut out clothing for sewing the real garment. In our garment modeling approach, garment parts are obtained from existing design results that are usually manufacturable; however when they are fit onto the individual human model, their manufacturability might be decreased. We improve the manufacturability of the new created garment model from the following three aspects.


                     
                        
                           (1)
                           Style lines interactively drawn on the garment surface are used to cut the garment into 3D patches with our previously developed surface trimming tool  [18]. Therefore, the manufacturability of the garment can be measured by the manufacturability of 3D patches.

For each 3D patch, its manufacturability is improved by decreasing its Gaussian curvature  [24] within allowable surface deformation.

For a patch, if its Gaussian curvature is still high, darts are interactively inserted to reduce compress and stretch deformation in its flattening result.


                     Fig. 8
                      illustrates the workflow of our approach which is composed with garment modeling module and garment manufacturing module. The figure also reflects that the procedures of garment design and pattern making are decoupled in our approach.

For instance, to manufacture the modeling result in Fig. 7(h), the user is asked to interactively draw style lines on the garment surface to outline the 3D patches, e.g. sleeves, upper body pieces, skirt gores, etc., as shown in Fig. 9
                     (a). The Gaussian curvature of each patch is computed and visualized, as shown in Fig. 9(b). High Gaussian curvature yields large compress or stretch deformation in the patch flattening result, as the upper front body piece flattening result shown in the first row in Fig. 9(g). In the figure, the deformation ratio is computed as

                     th edge length on the 3D patch and its correspondence on the flattening result. The surface flattening method is referred to our previous work  [25]. By using such patterns with high deformation ratio to make garment, great shape error between the product and the expectation would be yielded.

In case the Gaussian curvature of any patch is high, our system automatically reminds the user to decrease its Gaussian curvature by using the tool integrated method from  [24]. Fig. 9(c) and (d) show the geometry and Gaussian curvature distribution of the garment after decreasing the Gaussian curvature. Accordingly, the deformation ratio in the flattening results is decreased, as shown in the second row in Fig. 9(g). We constrained the surface error in the decreasing Gaussian curvature, as shown in Fig. 9(e) where the surface error is measured by the displacement of each vertex.

In case the deformation ratio is still high in the flattening results, the user is asked to draw a dart in the region with high Gaussian curvature, as shown in Fig. 9(f). As a result, a wedge-shaped notch would be formed in the flattening result, which dissipates the compress and stretch deformation in surface flattening, as shown in the third row in Fig. 9(g). The deformation color on the 2D patterns reflects the compress or stretch ratio on the flattening results, which also indicates where the darts should be further drawn if the compress or stretch ratio is high. Feedbacks from the industry shows that the compress or stretch ratio below 5% is acceptable; under such a compress or stretch ratio, the pattern makers can quickly interactively alter the shape of 2D patterns to meet the design requirements. Fig. 9(h) shows all the flattening results of the 3D patches in Fig. 9(f). These 2D patterns would be used for fabricating the real garment. The effect of garment sewed by fabrics with different colors or textures can be simulated by mapping textures onto the 3D garment model, as shown in Fig. 9(i).

@&#IMPLEMENTATION@&#

We have implemented our approach using Visual C++ on a computer with an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q8300 @2.50G Hz and with 3.00G RAM. We minimize the energy in Eqs. (4), (5) in a least square manner by using the linear system solver TAUCS library  [26].

The main steps of our garment modeling approach are illustrated in Fig. 10
                        . We did experiments for compositing garment parts with about 20,000 vertices. Generally, such resolutions are high enough to describe geometric details of the garment surface. The computational time statistics for each step is shown upon the arrows in Fig. 10. The computational time of “edit Ps by altering T” and “edit G by altering T” indicates that, after interactively altering the curve-net of garment prototype, the garment or garment parts can be updated in 0.1 s. The time statistics show that the garment composition and editing process can be efficiently and interactively operated.

It should be pointed out that directly parameterizing garment parts with 20,000 vertices by garment prototype would cost about 20 s. However, this computation can be greatly reduced to 0.2 s after pretreatment: for each garment example in the database, as shown in Fig. 11
                        (a), we use a garment prototype to fit it. Then, we parameterize the garment example and the garment prototype by each other, and store the parameterization results. For the garment example, it is parameterized by using Eq. (1). For illustration, in Fig. 11(c), the parameterized regions are rendered in the same color as the relative Coons patches as shown in Fig. 11(b).

With the reciprocal parameterization, the initial geometry of the garment prototype can be efficiently restored from the garment example, and the garment prototype can be further used to fit and alter the garment example. Fig. 11(e), (f) show the results of reusing the parameterization information.

In the operation of “edit Ps by altering T” and “edit G by altering T”, during interactive dragging the feature points on the garment prototype, the garment surface can be efficiently updated by minimizing the Laplacian energy

Several new garments have been modeled by composing and altering existing garment examples, such as the new garments shown in Figs. 1, 7(d), (f) and (h). Other than 3D garment modeling, our approach can be applied in garment customization, as shown in Fig. 12
                        . 3D garment customization methods have also been proposed in  [27,11,13,14], which are generally realized by using the shape correspondence between the source human model and the target human model to transferring the garment on the source human model onto the target human model. Our approach can tackle with the situations either with or without source human model, and thus is more flexible. For situations with source human models, our approach customizes the garment by reusing the local parameters of the source human model i.e.  
                           
                              (
                              u
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    v
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                         and 
                           
                              (
                              α
                              ,
                              β
                              ,
                              γ
                              )
                           
                         in Eq. (1) onto the target human model; for situations without source human models, the garment customization is realized by fitting and parameterizing the 3D garments by the garment prototypes on individual human models, as described in Section  4.

The goal of our system is to make the garment design operation as easy as playing building blocks. So that not only the professional designers but also the common customers who want to have individualized garments would like to and feel easy to use our system.

For the garment modeling module in Fig. 8, three garment designers (modelists) from garment industry and several students from universities without garment designing experience were asked to use our system. The students were also asked to use our system as the communication platform to express their design demands to the designers, and the designers were asked to optimize the student’s idea from their professional view. All the designers and students can use the system fluently after a short time tutorial. Feedback from the students shows that our system is helpful for them to explore and express what kinds of garments they really want. Feedback from the designers indicates one difficulty at the early design stage that is how to get the design inspiration. By using our approach, the users can design garments in a way like playing-building-blocks, which opens their imagination and encourage them to explore various new garments. Feedback from the designers also shows that our system is useful in exploring the customers’ demands.

The garment manufacturing module is mainly based on our previous work  [18,25] and Zeng’s work  [24]. Our previous work  [18,25] has also been transplanted in the commercial software LookStailorX (also known as DressingsimLSX, http://www.digitalfashion.jp/) which has been successfully used in several fashion companies. The users’ feedback shows that our work makes the pattern making easier than the traditional ways. Even for users without professional pattern making knowledge, our intuitive pattern making operations can be quickly and easily learned. In this paper, we integrated the work of Zeng’s  [24] for improving the garment manufacturability. The relative operations are easy and intuitive with the aid of Gaussian curvature visualization as mentioned in Section  6.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for modeling 3D garments. A new garment model can be created by substituting or compositing parts from examples with the guide of garment prototype. Our approach decouples the high coupling between garment design and pattern making that widely exists in the mainstream of garment design method and can free the user’s creation and imagination. Our system can be conveniently operated by both experts and common users without any design skills.

This paper takes a small step down a new way; many works are to be carried out in the future: 
                        
                           (i)
                           Our current approach can tackle the garment examples with tubular structures, such as garment bodies, skirts, sleeves, etc., but cannot tackle piecewise parts, such as cardigans, collars, etc. This issue can also be addressed by setting curves on the garment prototype, corresponding to the boundaries of the piecewise parts, so as to align the parts and create transitional surfaces in between the parts with the guide of garment prototype, similarly as the method proposed in this paper.

In this paper, we only give examples of upper garments and skirts. However, our approach could also be used for modeling 3D trousers, as long as the trousers prototypes were provided.

Our current approach concerns more on visual look like than physical reality; we plan to integrate the physics-based garment draping technology into our approach.

More intelligent tools are looking forward to be developed, such as intelligent retrieval that can automatically suggest appropriate garment parts for the user to make the operation easier.
