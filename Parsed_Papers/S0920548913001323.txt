                  A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a special type of wireless network in which a collection of mobile nodes with wireless network interfaces may form a temporary network, without the aids of any fixed infrastructure. Security has become a hot research topic in mobile ad hoc networks. In 1998, Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-based key management and access control scheme for the mobile agents to manage rights to access its own resources for the visited mobile nodes. Latter, Huang et al. showed that Volker and Mehrdad's scheme needs a large amount of storage and costs for managing and storing secret keys. Huang et al. further proposed a new and efficient scheme based on the elliptic curve cryptosystems to reduce costs and gain better efficiency. However, there is a security leak inherent in Huang et al.'s scheme that the malicious node can overstep his authority to access unauthorized information. This paper will propose a secure, robust, and efficient hierarchical key management scheme for MANETs. Some practical issues and solutions about dynamic key management are also considered and proposed. As compared with Huang et al.'s scheme, our proposed scheme can provide better security assurance, while requiring smaller key-size, lower computational complexities, and constant key management costs which is independent on the number of the confidential files and the visited nodes.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) has caught the attention and provided anytime and anywhere networking services. It is a self-organized wireless network for mobile nodes without any fixed infrastructure. Such a network can be deployed rapidly and dynamically, and all mobile nodes are connected by wireless links. A group of mobile nodes can improve message delivery and save bandwidth effectively in a MANET. MANETs can provide self-organizing and infrastructure-less property, and hence they are widely used in varied applications such as military and commercial settings. In a MANET, each mobile node owns different resources and might allow the visited node to access them. A mobile node decides where to migrate and executes the tasks on the desired node. The mobile agent will return the result to the request node after it completes the intended tasks.

In a MANET, a mobile agent might have some valuable resources or information to share with authorized visited mobile nodes. All sensitive information might be sent via a general tunnel or over the air without any protection. Hence, it might suffer from some potential security threats such as compromising, eavesdropping, impersonating attacks, etc. Security is a significant issue for protecting the transmitted messages and providing access control to resources in constructing the MANET. The mobile agent must establish suitable security mechanisms to protect the resources from being disclosed and accessed by unauthorized mobile nodes. It is a challenge to dynamically manage the access rights to the resources for mobile nodes and protect them from being disclosed. A key management scheme is a cryptographic technique to manage cryptographic keys used to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive resources [1–4]. It allows only authorized mobile agents to access authorized resources and information with its own cryptographic key(s). A key management scheme can improve security and reduce the memory storage of keys, as presented in MANETs [5–7].

Recently, many scholars proposed various key management and access control schemes for MANETs [8–14]. In 1998, Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-based key management and access control scheme for the mobile agents to manage rights to access its own resources for the visited mobile nodes [8]. It allows that only the authorized visited mobile nodes can access some information according to the predetermined access control, while unauthorized visited mobile nodes cannot. Main drawback of their scheme is that it requires a large amount of storage and high computational complexities. To improve the performance of Volker and Mehrdad's scheme [8], Chang and Lin later proposed two key management schemes based on RSA cryptosystem, i.e. one is bottom-up approach and the other is top-down approach [11]. Chang and Lin's scheme requires less key management costs and fewer computational costs as compared with Volker and Mehrdad's scheme. However, their scheme is still inefficient from practical viewpoints since they require expensive exponential operations for key generation and derivation.

In 2009, Huang et al. proposed a practical and efficient hierarchical mobile agent framework for MANETs to handle key management and access control problems based on elliptic curve cryptosystems, one-way hash function and interpolating polynomials [11]. In Huang et al.'s scheme, each mobile agent must maintain an access control hierarchy to manage the access rights for visited mobile nodes. Such a hierarchy is a POSET (partially ordered set) hierarchy. Each confidential file owned by the mobile agent has a pair of secret keys, a decryption key and a superkey. The decryption key is used to encrypt/decrypt the confidential file. Only the mobile node with the decryption key can access the content of the confidential file. The superkey is used for deriving the decryption key according to the predetermined access control policies. The mobile agent can determine and assign a distinct superkey to a visited mobile node for accessing the confidential file(s) according to the predetermined hierarchy of access control. The authorized mobile node can use its given superkey to derive the decryption key of the intended confidential file and then use it to obtain the content. Attractive contribution of Huang et al.'s scheme [15] is to achieve the same security level while requiring smaller key-size and lower computational costs as compared with Chang and Lin's scheme [11].

There, however, is a security leak inherent in Huang et al.'s scheme [15] that the malicious node can overstep his authority to access unauthorized information, which violates the claimed security requirements. Moreover, Huang et al.'s scheme does not consider some practical dynamic key management problems. For example, it does not provide an access control updating mechanism for the mobile nodes leaved from the access control hierarchy. This paper will propose a secure, robust, and efficient hierarchical key management scheme for MANETs. Each node of the proposed scheme maintains only one secret key which is used to help the visited node to derive decryption key(s) of authorized confidential file(s). This will reduce the key management costs. Some practical issues and solutions about dynamic key management are also considered. We also provided practical and efficient solution to deal with dynamic key management problem for migration for mobile computing in MANETs.

The rest of this paper is sketched as follows. In Section 2, we briefly reviewed MANET technologies, elliptic curve cryptosystem, and Huang et al.'s scheme [15]. Security leak inherent in Huang et al.'s scheme is also discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we proposed a new key management and access control scheme based on a one-way hash function and discussed the solutions to dynamic access control problems. Security analysis and performance evaluations of the proposed scheme are given in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, we gave conclusions in Section 5.

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring and infrastructureless wireless network for mobile devices. In such a wireless network, all mobile devices can move freely in any direction and they will therefore be frequently connected by wireless. Characteristics of MANETs are infrastructureless network, ease of deployment, speed of deployment, multi-hop network, dynamic changing topology of mobile devices, etc. MANETs are expected to become an important part of the future 4G architecture for providing pervasive computing services. Users can accomplish their tasks, accessing information, and communicating anytime, anywhere and by any device in MANET environment. Applications of a mobile ad hoc network include tactical networks, emergency services, commercial and civilian environments, home and enterprise networking, mobile education, sensor networks, context aware services, and so on. General challenging issues in MANETs include distributed congestion control [16–18], load balancing [19], admission control [20], routing [21,22], security [23], etc. MANET has higher security risks than conventional infrastructure network.

The mobile agents of mobile devices are software programs that act on behalf of users or other software programs in MANET environment. A mobile agent can achieve one or more tasks automatically, clone itself and propagate, collaborate and communicate with other ones and so on. Some sensitive and confidential information might be stored in the agent and hence, the agent might be suffered from many security threats [24–26] such as unauthorized access, malicious impersonation, disclosing or tampering attacks in open MANETs. Hence, the agent must authenticate its visited host or agents according to some proper security policies [27].

In 1998, Volker and Mehrdad proposed a tree-based key management and access control scheme for the mobile agents to manage rights to access its own resources for visited mobile nodes as illustrated in Fig. 1
                         
                        [8]. In Fig. 1, nodes of the tree might either be folders or files and each node has a unique identifier. If a node is labeled encrypted, then its folders or files are encrypted from being disclosed. An encrypted node is tagged with the name of the decryption key for the valid readers to read its content. If a node is labeled signed then a digital signature is applied for the content of the node and integrity is protected. The signer of node is regarded as the rightful owner of the agent and a signed node is tagged with the signer's identity. Security policy of the agent is stored in the security context of the static branch. If an agent owner wants to send the mobile agent carried with the assigned tasks onto Internet, the agent owner encrypts its confidential file with a secret key using a symmetric cryptosystem. Then, a secret key is assigned by the owner to each host according to the access policies, and such secret keys are stored in the respective folders of each host. Furthermore, the respective folders are also be encrypted by the public key of each host. When the mobile agent visits the hosts and interacts with them, the host can decrypt its folder with its private key and then retrieves its secrete key to decrypt the confidential file according to its rights.

An elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) is first proposed by Miller [28] and Koblitz [29] in 1985. Attractive advantage of the ECC is that it can achieve the same level of security while requiring shorter key-size as compared with transitional cryptosystems. For example, the ECC with 160-bits key size is as secure as the RSA cryptosystem with 1024-bits one. This also implies that it requires lower memory and has greater execution speed. Since then, many standards are developed for the ECC, such as ISO 11770-3, ANSI X.9.62, IEEE P1363, FIPS 186-2, etc.

Typically, there are two types of the elliptic curves used in cryptography: the prive curves over Zp
                         for software applications and the binary curves over GF(2
                           n
                        ) for hardware application. In the finite field, an elliptic curve is typically defined as E: y
                        2
                        =
                        x

                        +
                        ax
                        +
                        b, where (a, b) ∈
                        Zp
                         and 4a

                        2
                        ≠0 (mod p). The elliptic curve Ep
                         (a, b) is the set of the integer points over the elliptic curve over Zp
                         and a point of infinity O. It forms a commutative finite group under the rules of addition operation. In Ep
                         (a, b), addition of any two points P
                        =(xP
                        , yP
                        ) and Q
                        =(xP
                        , yP
                        ) is denoted as P

                        =(xR

                        ) such that

Security of an elliptic curve cryptosystem is based on the intractability of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). It is computationally infeasible to solve ECDLP in computer science.

In this subsection, we briefly reviewed Huang et al.'s scheme [15] and then demonstrated an attack on Huang et al.'s scheme to show that the malicious node can overstep his authority to access unauthorized information.

Huang et al. proposed a hierarchical mobile agent framework for handling key management and access control problems based on the elliptic curve cryptography [15]. Their scheme consists of the initialization, the key generation, and the key derivation phases. In the initialization phase, a mobile agent determines all system parameters and assigns a key pair (a superkey and a decryption key) to each confidential file. In the key generation phase, the mobile agent determines a superkey to all visited mobile nodes and the public polynomials of each confidential file. In the key derivation phase, the visited node can use its own superkey and the public information related to the intended confidential file(s) to derive the decryption key(s) for accessing the authorized file(s). Detailed descriptions of these phases are given below.

The mobile agent randomly chooses a large prime p and two parameters a, b

The proposed scheme also consists three phases as those of Huang et al.'s scheme [15]. Descriptions of these phases are given below.

                        1, CF

                        4) using a symmetric cryptosystem as shown in Fig. 3
                        
                        . The symbol “EK
                        (CF)” denotes the encryption of the confidential file CF under the secret key K using a symmetric cryptosystem. We suppose that the agent owner builds a mobile agent structure (as shown in Fig. 2) to determine the access rights to the visited nodes, (VN
                        1, VN

                        4, VN
                        5). For the example as shown in Fig. 2, the visited node VN
                        4 has the rights to access confidential files CF
                        1 and CF
                        2, and VN
                        5 has the rights to access confidential files CF
                        2 and CF
                        3. The visited node VN
                        1 has VN
                        2's and VN
                        3's access rights, which implies that VN
                        1 can access (CF
                        1, CF

Security of our proposed scheme is based on the well-known security assumptions [30,31], i.e., the intractability of solving one-way hash function and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems. We hence first defined the well-known security assumptions [30,31] and then discussed the security analysis of the proposed scheme based such assumptions as follows.
                        Definition 1
                        (One-way hash function (OWHF) [30,31]). A secure one-way hash function h has the following properties that (i) Given an output h(x) of a one-way hash function h, it is computationally infeasible to derive x from h(x); and (ii) it is computationally infeasible to find two distinct values x and x′ such that h(x)=
                           h(x′).

Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) [32–34]. Let E
                           
                              p
                           (a,b) be an elliptic curve defined over GF(p), and G be a base point with order q in E. Given a point Q
                           ∈
                           E
                           
                              p
                           (a,b), it is computationally infeasible to determine x, 0≤
                           x
                           ≤
                           q
                           −1, such that Q
                           =
                           xG.

The core security about such assumptions is primarily based on the security of the secret or private keys since our proposed scheme primarily focused on handling key management and access control problems of a migration method. Security analysis of secret or private keys used in our proposed scheme is only given below and other potential attacks on ad hoc network such as impersonation, deniable of service, man-in-the-middle attacks are omitted. The readers can refer to Huang et al.'s scheme for the details about such attacks. In the following, we considered the contrary, the collaborative, the exterior, the equation, the exterior root finding, and the compromising attacks on the proposed scheme and showed that our proposed scheme is secured against such attacks based on the above security assumptions.

                         will face the intractability of solving the ECDLP. Therefore, the lower security class cannot derive the secret key of the higher security class.

                         while other nodes are unauthorized to access the particular file CFj

Consider the scenario that an intruder who is not a visited node of the hierarchy enters from outside the system and attempts to compromise the secret key(s) of visited node(s) for deriving the decryption key(s) of confidential file(s).

                           i

If two visited nodes have the common confidential file(s), one of them might attempt to use the public polynomial(s) of the common confidential file(s) for deriving unauthorized decryption keys. As shown in Fig. 2, VN

                        3 have the common confidential files (CF

                        3). The visited node VN
                        2 might attempt to derive VN

In this section, we compare Huang et al.'s scheme [11] and the proposed scheme in terms of computational complexities and storage. For simplicity, we denote the following notations to evaluate the performance of Huang et al.'s scheme [11] and the proposed scheme:
                        
                           n
                        
                        
                           the number of the visited nodes in a hierarchy,

the number of the confidential files,

the degree of the polynomial 
                                 
                                    
                                       f
                                       
                                          D
                                          
                                             K
                                             j
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                 
                              ,

the bit-length of an integer x,

the time for executing a scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve E,

the time for performing a modular multiplication computation, and

the time for performing a one-way hash function h(⋅).

The comparisons of storage and computational complexities of Huang et al.'s scheme [11] and the proposed scheme are summarized in Tables 1 and 2
                     
                     , respectively. From Table 1, we can see that the proposed scheme outperforms Huang et al.'s scheme [11] in storing the number of secret keys. It is noted that the number of secret keys maintained by the agent owner in our proposed scheme is 1, while it is (n
                     +

                     Table 2 summarizes the performance of Huang et al.'s scheme and that of the proposed scheme. Recalling tasks of the key generation phase, the computational efforts required by the agent owner depend on the construction of an interpolating polynomial

Furthermore, we considered the dynamic access control in adding a new confidential file, deleting an existing confidential file, granting an access right, and revoking an access right below. In Huang et al.'s scheme, the agent owner chooses a superkey (or secret key) s
                     
                        i
                      for each node and chooses a decryption key for each confidential file. The visited node VH
                     
                        i
                      uses its superkey s

                      has to renew the decryption key and CA needs to update the related public parameters

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Security is an important issue for mobile ad hoc networks. Key management and access control schemes are the central parts of the security of MANETs. In this paper, we demonstrated a security leak inherent in Huang et al.'s scheme [15] to show that their scheme violates the claimed security requirements. That is, the malicious node can overstep his authority to access the unauthorized information in the case of revoking an existing relationship. We further proposed a secure, robust and efficient key management and access control scheme to eliminate the pointed out security leak and satisfy all claimed security requirements. Some practical issues and solutions about dynamic key management are also considered and proposed. As compared with Huang et al.'s scheme, our proposed scheme can provide better security assurance, while requiring smaller key-size, lower computational complexities, and constant key management costs which is independent on the number of the confidential files and the visited nodes.
