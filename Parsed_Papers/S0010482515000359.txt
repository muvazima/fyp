                  In the present paper, an attempt was made to find waveform-derived variables that would be useful for a more precise diagnosis of hypovolemia. In attempting this, arterial blood pressure graphs of 18 hypovolemic postoperative patients were analysed using a discrete Fourier transform. Using a paired samples t-test, the amplitude of the first harmonic (A1) is shown to be significantly higher in normovolemic cases than in hypovolemic ones (p<0.001). Based on the values of A1, a preliminary study was performed in which an additional group of 14 hypovolemic and 14 normovolemic patients were categorized into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups using logistic regression. The method proved to be successful in identifying hypovolemic patients: the prediction was correct in 80% and wrong only in 20%, indicating that A1 is potentially a useful parameter in detecting hypovolemia.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Optimal fluid therapy is one of the cornerstones of hemodynamic management in critically ill patients. As both hypovolemia and hypervolemia are harmful states, recognizing the divergence from normovolemia is of vital importance. The diagnosis of hypovolemia in severely ill patients with extensive co-morbidities is a difficult task. The commonly used physical signs like severe postural dizziness or postural pulse increment or low blood pressure can help detect hypovolemia in the case of adults, but the sensitivity and specificity of these signs are very limited [1], and can vary in different age groups [2]. Moreover, they can often be overlooked and attributed to other less serious causes [3].

Noticeable changes in vital signs indicating hypovolemia occur only after 15% of the blood volume is lost [4]. There is quite a narrow range between the appearance of the first physical signs and immediate life threatening situations (>40% of blood volume loss), and therefore hypovolemic patients are at high risk of mortality [5]. It was recognized decades ago that the most common errors in the management of patients who died in hospital were related to inadequate fluid resuscitation [6]. Even though one study showed that physicians were able to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors more accurately than scoring systems [7], it remains a difficult task to predict the hemodynamic profile using conventional parameters, especially in the case of critically ill patients [8], and to establish specific cut-off points for clinical signs that could be used as triggers for clinical intervention [9].

Finding variables that reflect adequately the blood volume status in critically ill patients has for a long time been a challenge for scientists [10]. In recent years, instead of conventional static hemodynamic variables (e.g., central venous pressure (CVP) [11,12], or heart rate (HR) [13]), dynamic parameters have emerged as useful techniques to predict fluid responsiveness in ICU patients [14] (e.g., systolic pressure variation [15], pulse pressure variation [16], central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) [17]), and new variables have been introduced to guide fluid therapy in critically ill patients (e.g., global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) [18], hypovolemic index [19], extravascular lung water index [20]). However, each of these variables has limitations (regarding the physical condition [21] or age [22] of patients), and currently, no model exists to detect ongoing hypovolemia or bleeding [3]. The lack of hypovolemia-specific parameters was the reason why the most recent consensus conference on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring recommends a complete evaluation of the hemodynamic profile to recognize the adequacy of volume status of critically ill patients [23].

In previous studies, Fourier analysis has been used successfully to analyse waveform in patients with coronary artery disease [24] and to understand waveform changes in progressive hypovolemia [25]. In the present paper we used the same method to analyse the arterial blood pressure graphs of postoperative hypovolemic patients and our aim was to recognize hypovolemia in quite a simple way among severely ill patients.

For our investigations, we used the electronic database of our previously published prospective, randomized, multicentre study, which included 11 Hungarian ICUs from January 2005 to December 2008. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Health Scientific Council and was acknowledged by the institutions׳ ethical committees. A detailed description of the study was published previously [26]. Here we summarize only the relevant information.

The original population was 200 mixed postoperative hypovolemic patients, who needed intensive care treatment and more comprehensive hemodynamic monitoring because of their general health status. The diagnosis of hypovolemia was based on global clinical signs and on specific hemodynamic parameters (GEDVI<600ml/m2 and/or stroke volume variation (SVV) >10% in mechanically ventilated patients).

The study was able to be carried out from the first postoperative hour until the 10th postoperative day (at most). After stability screening, the patients were randomized into the following infusion groups (50 patients in each group): lactated Ringer׳s solution (LR), succinylated gelatin 4% w/v, waxy maize-derived 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl starch 6% w/v and human albumin 5% w/v. Ten millilitres per kilogram of volume loading was given over 30min in each group. A complete haemodynamic profile was obtained after 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min.

The principles used for assigning patients into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups are taken from our previously published paper [19] based on the same study referred to earlier:

In order to be sure that the patients were suffering from significant hypovolemia we took the widely accepted threshold values for hypovolemia of the basic hemodynamic parameters (HR ≥100 beats/min, mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤65mmHg, CVP ≤5mmHg, cardiac index (CI) ≤3l/min/m2, GEDVI ≤650ml/m2, stroke volume variation (SVV) ≥10%, ScvO2 ≤70%). Regarding the baseline values of these hemodynamic parameters, the patients received as many hypovolemic points as parameters that fulfilled the hypovolemic criteria (minimum 0, maximum 7). We classified the patients into Group A – high probability of hypovolemia – (n=140) where the hypovolemic points were ≥3.

A similar classification was made using the 30th minute values. We may suppose that at the end of infusion the hypovolemia was corrected. To reinforce this, we analysed the CI increasing effect of the different infusions. The volume loading was arbitrarily considered to be ineffective when the CI increment was <10%. Altogether it occurred in 59 patients. Because in 14 patients treated with LR the CI did not change or even decreased, the whole LR group was excluded from the normovolemic evaluation. The remaining 150 patients were rated according to the generally accepted values for normovolemia (HR ≤80 beats/min, MAP ≥75mmHg, CVP ≥10mmHg, CI ≥3.5l/min/m2, GEDVI ≥700ml/m2, SVV ≤10%, ScvO2 ≥75%). In a way similar to the hypovolemic grouping, the patients received between 0 and 7 normovolemic points. Next, they were assigned to Group B – high probability of normovolemia – (n=118) where the normovolemic points were ≥3.

In the present study we included only those patients who had online electronic blood pressure traces using the PiCCOwin software program (Pulsion, Munich, Germany). In the first part of the study 18 patients belonging to both group A and group B were included. In the second part, an additional group of 28 patients were included, 14 of whom belonged to group A, and 14 to group B.

In the first part of our study, arterial blood pressure graphs of patients from the first group were analysed using a discrete Fourier transform.

First, one cardiac cycle was chosen randomly from each of the 18 patients from the first group, both in hypo- and normovolemic cases. If respiratory cycles were clearly visible, the cardiac cycle at the end of exhalation was chosen. After applying the discrete Fourier transform to the chosen data, we got the following N-periodic sequence of complex numbers:

Next, the following variables were compared in hypo- and normovolemic cases using a one-sided dependent samples t-test:
                           
                              •
                              the mean arterial pressure (MAP);

the amplitudes of the first 8 harmonics of the discrete Fourier transform (A1–A8); and

the phases of the first 8 harmonics of the discrete Fourier transform (PHI1–PHI8).

Prior to conducting the analysis, the assumption of normally distributed difference scores was examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test.

In the second part of our study, an attempt was made to categorize patients from the second group into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups based on the values of MAP, A1, and PH1 using logistic regression in three different scenarios:

In the third scenario, only the values of A1 were involved in the regression, therefore only a
                                 2 was calculated (in case of one variable, the presence of a constant term did not have any effect).

After finding the optimal values for the coefficients, two thresholds were calculated for each scenario:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 The normovolemic threshold (T
                                 
                                    N
                                 ) was defined as the lowest cut off point where the sensitivity was 1 (that is, the lowest cut off point for fit probabilities where no hypovolemic patient was classified as normovolemic).

Similarly, the hypovolemic threshold (T
                                 
                                    H
                                 ) was defined as the highest cut off point where the specificity was 0 (that is, the highest cut off point for fit probabilities where no normovolemic patient was classified hypovolemic).

In each scenario, each patient from the second group (14 from group A and 14 from group B) was categorized into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups using the optimal coefficients and the two thresholds calculated from the first group of 18 patients in the following way:

First, one cardiac cycle was chosen randomly from each data file of patients from the second group (some patients had multiple data files). After calculating the values of MAP, A1 and PHI1, fit probabilities were determined in each scenario using the optimal coefficients as defined above. If the fit probability was lower than T
                        
                           H
                        , the data file was categorized as hypovolemic. If the fit probability was higher than T
                        
                           N
                        , the data file was categorized as normovolemic. Patients with at least one hypovolemic data file were categorized as hypovolemic. Similarly, patients with at least one normovolemic data file were categorized as normovolemic. Patients who had both hypovolemic and normovolemic data files were not assigned to any category.

In the first part of our study, the arterial blood pressure graphs of 18 patients from the first group were analysed. After performing a one-sided t-test, we can say that the values of MAP have increased (p=0.01) and the values of PHI1 have decreased (p=0.01) after volume loading. In the case of the values of A1 the increase was highly significant (p<0.001). There was a poor correlation between A1 and MAP (

                     Fig. 1(a)–(c) and 
                     Table 1.

Using the values of MAP, A1 and PHI1 calculated from these cardiac cycles, logistic regression was performed in three different scenarios, and hypovolemic and normovolemic thresholds were calculated as defined above. The optimal values of the coefficients in each scenario as well as the values of the thresholds can be seen in

                      was higher in Scenario 3.

After calculating the optimal coefficients and thresholds for each scenario, a preliminary analysis was performed in which an additional group of 28 patients (14 hypovolemic and 14 normovolemic) was categorized into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups as defined in Section 2. The results of classification for each scenario can be seen in 
                     Table 3. Results were the best in Scenario 3 where the prediction was based only on the value of A1. The prediction was made for 71% of the hypovolemic patients, and it was correct in 80% of the cases and wrong in 20%. For normovolemic patients, the prediction was made for 35% of them, and was correct in 14% of the cases and wrong in 21%.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The blood pressure graph is one of the key components of blood circulation analysis as it contains much information about the nature of the flow. In general, however, there is a poor correlation between blood pressure values and the degree of hypovolemia. The low pressure levels can indicate different shock states but cannot predict either cardiac output or volume status. As mentioned earlier, currently, no model exists to detect ongoing hypovolemia or bleeding [3]. In our previous studies [19,26], we found that a single hemodynamic variable is not enough to predict volume status; the combination of 5–6 hemodynamic parameters makes for a much more useful clinical approach. The most recent international hemodynamic monitoring guideline reaches a similar conclusion [23].

In this study our aim was to find waveform-derived variables that can be useful for a more precise diagnosis of hypovolemia. Finding a method that can detect hypovolemia using only these variables can be very helpful in clinical practice, since measuring blood pressure is a simpler and less expensive process than evaluating the complete hemodynamic profile.

Although several parameters varied significantly in hypovolemic cases on the one hand and normovolemic cases on the other, we used only the three parameters for which the significance was the highest: A1, MAP and PHI1. The very high significance of change for A1 and the poor correlation between A1 and MAP indicate that A1 contains more information about the volume status than the average blood pressure.

Since blood circulation is a complex system, there might be several reasons for the increase of A1 after volume loading. For example, it might be caused by the increased volume load of the heart as well as the increased elastic moduli in the blood vessels as a consequence of the increased volume of circulating fluid in them.

Based on the values of A1, a preliminary examination was performed to see how well we can detect hypovolemia using this variable. The results showed that A1 can be useful in detecting hypovolemia, although this was not true for normovolemia.

The benefit of using the method described in this paper to detect hypovolemia is that it can be measured and computed easily. In addition to this, the method uses only one parameter, in contrast to HVI, which is calculated from 5 to 6 parameters.

However, we also need to take into consideration the limitations of this study. First, in this study, only liquid infusion was used as a treatment for hypovolemic patients. Therefore, the effects of vasoactive drugs (vasopressors or vasodilators) need to be analysed in a separate study. Secondly, although the results show that A1 can be an effective parameter in detecting hypovolemia, because of the limited number of patients, further studies need to be carried out in order to support this result.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the present paper, an attempt was made to find ways to detect hypovolemia using only parameters calculated from the blood pressure graph of postoperative hypovolemic patients using a discrete Fourier transform. Using the values of the amplitude of the first harmonic, a preliminary analysis was performed in which additional patients were classified into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups. The method was successful in the case of hypovolemic patients: the prediction was correct in 80% and wrong only in 20%, showing that this variable can be useful in detecting hypovolemia.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

The diagnosis of hypovolemia is a significant problem facing hospitalized patients. Despite its physical signs, currently there is no model to detect ongoing hypovolemia. In the present paper, an attempt was made to find waveform-derived variables that would be useful for a more precise diagnosis of hypovolemia. In attempting this, the arterial blood pressure graphs of 18 hypovolemic postoperative patients were analysed using a discrete Fourier transform. Using a paired samples t-test, it is shown that the amplitude of the first harmonic (A1) is significantly higher in normovolemic cases than in hypovolemic ones (p<0.001). Based on the values of A1, a preliminary analysis was performed in which an additional group of 14 hypovolemic and 14 normovolemic patients were categorized into hypovolemic and normovolemic groups using logistic regression. The method proved to be successful for hypovolemic patients: the prediction was correct in 80% and wrong only in 20%, indicating that A1 can be a useful tool in detecting hypovolemia.

None declared.
