                  It has been previously suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) have a tendency to regulate the important components of biological networks. The goal of the present study was to systematically test if one can establish a relationship between miRNA targets and the important components of biological networks (including human protein-protein interaction network, signaling network and metabolic network). For this analysis, we have studied the attack robustness of these networks. It has been previously shown that deletion of network vertices in descending order of their importance (e.g., in decreasing order of vertex degrees) can affect the network structure much more considerably. In the current study, we introduced three miRNA-based measures of importance: “miRNA count” (i.e., the number of miRNAs that regulate a given network component); average adjacent miRNA count, “AAmiC” (i.e., the average number of miRNAs regulating the targeted components adjacent to a given component); and total adjacent miRNA count, “TAmiC” (i.e., the total number of miRNAs regulating the targeted components adjacent to a given component). Our results suggest that “miRNA count” is only marginally capable of locating the important components of the networks, while TAmiC was the most relevant measure. By comparing TAmiC with the classical centrality measures (which are solely based on the network structure) when simultaneously removing vertices, we show that this measure is correlated to degree and betweenness centrality measures, while its performance is generally better than that of closeness and eigenvector centrality measures. The results of this study suggest that TAmiC which represents a measure based on both network structure and biological knowledge, can successfully determine the important network components indicating that miRNA regulation and network robustness are related.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a growing class of small non-coding RNAs. These RNAs generally act as negative regulators of gene expression [1–3]. MiRNA-mRNA pairing, which leads to mRNA cleavage or translational repression, occurs in the seed (nucleotides 2–7) of miRNA. The “seed region” and degree to which a miRNA matches a potential mRNA target site has been extensively studied, and consequently, a number of miRNA target prediction methods have been introduced [4,5].

It has been previously shown that many miRNAs, act both on single target genes as well as systems level. For example, a number of genome-wide studies suggested that feedforward loops containing miRNAs are network motifs [6–8]. Following, we first discuss the basic concepts of network biology and its robustness, and then, review the current literature on the relationship between network structure and miRNA regulation.

Complex biological systems can be represented by networks. In such a representation, each individual component is represented as a vertex (node) of the network. Additionally, each edge (link) that connects two vertices of the network, represents an interaction between two interacting components of the system [9,10]. Protein–protein interaction network (PPIN), metabolic network and signaling network are examples of active biological networks in a cell. Although biological networks are typically considered as static systems, in fact they are dynamic entities [11] influenced by gene regulation.

One of the key aspects of biological networks is the network robustness against the failure of its components [12,13]. Thus, an important question is to find out how perturbing the components of the system may affect the functionality of the network. It is clear that vertices of a given biological network are of different structural and functional importance. Therefore, detecting those vertices whose perturbation critically influences the structure and operation of a biological network is of great importance. The term “centrality measure” is referred to as a measure of “importance” of a vertex based on its connection to other network vertices [14]. The basic mathematical definitions used throughout this paper are introduced in details in Section 2.

Many classical studies on the robustness of networks have used the strategy of removing vertices at random, or alternatively, in descending order of vertex importance [15–18]. For example, in some of these studies, the vertices are firstly sorted based on their degree or betweenness centrality values. Then, the robustness of each network after removing important vertices has been investigated [19,20]. In a more recent comprehensive study [12], the importance of vertices of a wide variety of networks (including some empirical and model networks) was determined. Different measures of importance were investigated in this analysis, namely degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centralities. Moreover, two strategies for removing important vertices, i.e., simultaneous vs. sequential targeted attack, were considered. It was shown that, generally, in case of simultaneous targeted attack, degree centrality was the best in detecting the most important vertices, while in sequential targeted attack betweenness centrality was the best measure. Furthermore, it was shown that robustness of a network may depend on different properties, such as degree distributions, clustering coefficient and coefficient of assortativity.

It has been proposed, based on network-based analyses, that miRNAs regulate biological networks through specific patterns. For example, using a reaction-centric model of human metabolic network, it has been shown [21] that miRNAs prefer to regulate hub nodes (the highly connected nodes) and cut points (the bottlenecks of metabolic flows), but not the intermediate nodes. In related works, several investigations were conducted to understand how miRNAs particularly regulate human’s PPIN [11], signaling network [22], transcriptional regulation network [23] and cancer-related pathways [24]. In general, miRNAs appear to govern effectively the functional state of biological networks via controlling the essential elements of a network.

An accumulating body of efforts have been devoted to investigating potential effects of regulatory factors such as miRNAs on the robustness of functions in biological networks [25]. [26] suggested that mir-7, which operates on feedforward loops (FFLs) and feedback loops has a specific role in maintaining the network robustness against environmental perturbations. On the other hand, through a computational analysis, Osella et al. demonstrated that miRNAs accompanied by their target FFLs could buffer noise [27].

Therefore, the role of miRNAs in regulating some important network motifs (like FFLs) has been studied to some extent [26,27]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study on the relationship between miRNA regulation and the network-based importance of cellular components.

In the present study, we systematically analyzed the possible link between miRNA regulation and the robustness of biological networks. More precisely, we showed that miRNAs have a strong tendency for regulating those components that govern the network robustness. Based on these results, we introduce a “biology-based” measure to identify the potentially important vertices of a network. Finally, we compare this measure with the commonly used centrality measures, typically applied for identification of the important network components.

In this study, the biological networks under investigation comprise three different versions of human protein–protein interaction networks, the human metabolic network, the human signaling network, and the C. elegans protein-protein interaction network.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 PPINs: The three PPINs used in this study are as follows. The first PPIN, namely CCSB-HI1, is a network containing 2754 edges obtained from a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. The second PPIN, that is LCI, includes 4067 literature curated protein–protein interactions. The third PPIN, which will be referred to as CCSB-HI1+LCI, is basically constructed by merging the two above-mentioned PPINs. This network contains 6726 edges [28].


                                 Signaling network: The human signaling network is a literature-mined undirected network containing 540 nodes and 1257 edges, showing the signaling relationships between proteins [29].


                                 Metabolic network: We used a previously reported reaction-centric metabolic network of human [21], which is obtained from the KEGG database. This network includes 1099 vertices (i.e., reactions) and 4169 edges (i.e., linking metabolites).


                                 PPIN of Caenorhabditis elegans (cPPIN): This network contains 2500 nodes and 3706 edges established using a highly specific high-throughput Y2H system [30]. We included this network in our analysis to show that our findings are not limited to human networks, and similar patterns may be observed in other species.

The genome-wide predicted human miRNA target genes were obtained from the TargetScanS web server (version 6.2) [31]. This dataset contains a total of 11,161 genes regulated by 6101 miRNAs (grouped in 153 conserved miRNA families). We also used another dataset of predicted miRNA target genes obtained from PicTar [32]. The latter dataset includes 6243 genes regulated by 168 miRNAs. The C. elegans miRNA target genes were acquired from the TargetScanS of worm (available at the http://www.targetscan.org/worm_52/).

We obtained the human essential genes from the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) v10.6 [33] (available from: http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg). A list of 2570 human essential genes in this database are extracted from Liao et al. [34] and Georgi et al. [35].

A list of 780 candidate oncogenes used in this study are obtained from Khosravi et al. [36].

To investigate the robustness of a biological network against removal of its vertices (i.e. attack robustness), a simple and effective approach is to measure how the size of the largest component of the network changes. This approach is sensible because when the size of the largest component reduces to a sufficiently small degree, the function of the biological system will be interrupted. Let 
                           N
                           =

                         be an original network, with the set of vertices 
                           V

                           E
                        . Define

                         as the number of vertices of 
                           N
                        , which will be called the size of the network. Suppose that a subset 
                           S
                           ⊆

                         of vertices (i.e. a fraction of vertices) besides its connecting edges are removed from the network. The remaining subnetwork will be represented by 
                           
                              
                                 N

                        . Let

                                 S

                         be the largest connected component of the remaining subnetwork. The subset 
                           S
                         is chosen by selecting a number of vertices based on a certain pre-specified strategy (e.g., by selecting vertices with the highest degree values, or by selecting vertices randomly, and so on). Then, the subnetwork-based robustness, that is, the network robustness after removing a subset

                         of vertices is defined as

                         represents the size of the largest connected component of the remaining subnetwork. Throughout the text, we will use this definition to describe the robustness of a network.

Obviously, the vertices of a given biological network can be of different functional importance. In other words, the network function is robust against mutation in some (but not all) of the components while vulnerable against mutation in some others. For computing the robustness of a network, the simplest strategy is to remove (i.e., to attack) vertices randomly, i.e., irrespective of their importance. The other alternative is the “targeted attack”, that is, to remove the vertices of the network in decreasing order of the vertex importance. A wide variety of measures have been proposed previously to predict the importance of network vertices [12,14]. The importance of a network vertex can be defined based on the way that the vertex is connected to other vertices. Such measures are typically referred to as “centrality measures”. These measures will be formally defined below.

By choosing a strategy for removing vertices of a network, the vertices of the subset 
                           S

                           V
                         can be deleted based on the specified strategy (for example, in decreasing order of vertex degrees). Let 
                           
                              
                                 S

                                 Eigenvector centrality: In contrast to degree centrality, eigenvector centrality focuses on the important neighbors instead of all neighbors. For computing eigenvector centrality, it is assumed that a given vertex is more important if it is connected to some other important vertices. The eigenvector centrality of a vertex

We used here the NetworkX [38] (available at: https://networkx.github.io) to calculate the degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. For computing eigenvector centrality, we used the igraph software package [39] (available at: http://igraph.org/).

In this work, we investigated whether miRNAs are capable of detecting those vertices which are critical in establishing the robustness of a biological network. To do so, we defined three importance measures based on the number of miRNAs which regulate a network component and/or its neighbors. Needless to say, measures based on miRNAs are biology-based measures and are conceptually different from any commonly used centrality measure.

                         be the number of miRNAs regulate a vertex 
                           i
                        . We consider 
                           
                              
                                 m

The second measure, which will be referred to as “TAmiC” (total adjacent miRNA count) denoted by

All of the three measures introduced in the present work, namely miRNA count, AAmiC and TAmiC, try to show how miRNAs cooperate. More specifically, miRNA count shows to what extent a gene is directly regulated by miRNAs. On the other hand, AAmiC and TAmiC show to what extent the direct “partners” of a gene must be regulated for fine-tuning the activity of that certain gene.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In order to have an overview of the structure of the networks under investigation, we studied the global properties of the six biological networks. The results are shown in 
                        Table 1. One can observe that these networks are of a wide range of properties. For example, the number of network components ranges from 540 to 3024, the number of connected components ranges from 1 to 100, and network clustering coefficient ranges from 0.031 to 0.414. Additionally, these networks are very different in their biological nature. Therefore, we believe that the patterns observed for all of these networks may reflect some universal rules in biological networks, that is, to be expected to occur in other biological networks.

In this study, the relationship between miRNA regulation and the robustness of biological networks was analyzed systematically. More precisely, the effect of removing vertices on the network structure was investigated. Briefly, in a systematic procedure, we first defined three different miRNA-based measures for identifying important vertices. Each of these measures may reflect a certain aspect of the mechanism of miRNA regulation. Then, the importance of vertices in each of the biological networks was computed based on these new measures along with the classical “centrality” measures. Afterwards, we used a targeted attack regime to study the network robustness. In other words, the effect of removing a given subset 
                           S
                         of the vertices (in decreasing order of the importance measure) on the size of the largest connected component, 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              
                                 N
                                 ,
                                 S
                              
                              )
                           
                        , was calculated.

In order to study the attack robustness, two different schemes can be used in the stage of removing a given subset 
                           S
                         of the vertices [12,19,20]. In the first scheme, known as “simultaneous” targeted attack, the selected subset of vertices are removed simultaneously in decreasing order of the applied importance measure. Simultaneous targeted attack is a suitable strategy for removing vertices in various applications such as vaccinating the individuals (i.e. removing vertices) in a population (i.e. a contact network) to prevent the disease transmission. However, in some situations, removal of the highest ranked vertex, identified by an importance measure, may in turn change the importance of other vertices in the remaining subnetwork. Therefore, it is necessary to recalculate the importance measure for each of the remaining vertices, and then, remove the highest ranked vertex again. This procedure, referred to as “sequential” targeted attack, is continued until the desired subset of vertices is completely removed. Sequential targeted attack appears to be more suitable strategy in special situations such as the World Wide Web in which the removal of any vertex influences the importance of the remaining ones.

To illustrate the robustness results for any biological network, we present the “fractional” size of the largest connected component, 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              
                                 N
                                 ,
                                 
                                    
                                       S

                              )
                           
                         , against the fraction of removed vertices, 
                           
                              |
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S

                              |
                           
                           /
                           n
                        . The vulnerability value, 
                           V
                        , of each network against targeted attack based on each of the importance measures is also computed.


                        
                        Fig. 1 demonstrates robustness results for biological networks including human signaling network, metabolic network and PPIN against simultaneous targeted attack according to the three miRNA-based defined measures, namely miRNA count, AAmiC and TAmiC. It should be noted that the miRNA targets are obtained from TargetScanS. The three different versions of human PPIN (i.e., CCSB-HI1 and LCI and their combination, CCSB-HI1+LCI) have been used to check the consistency of results while using different forms of a biological network. From this figure, one can observe that when miRNA-based measures are used for ranking the vertices, the robustness based on simultaneous targeted attack is less than the robustness based on random (non-targeted) attack. Note that the same conclusion can be drawn from comparison of vulnerability values. This observation apparently suggests that miRNAs preferentially regulate important network vertices. In the other words, the importance of biological nodes in maintaining the network robustness can be largely explained by the degree to which miRNAs target them.

Based on Supplementary Table S1, one can observe that, with simultaneous targeted attack, TAmiC and AAmiC are correlated to each other, while they do not show a strong correlation with miRNA count. This is also evident from Fig. 1: In contrast to our original expectations, with simultaneous targeted attack, it was observed that network robustness based on miRNA count is only marginally (although significantly) different from robustness based on random attack. Here, the most effective means of degrading biological networks among miRNA-based methods is via removing vertices in decreasing order of TAmiC. This striking observation suggests that miRNAs tend to regulate important components of the network indirectly, i.e., via regulating the expression of their neighboring components. Since network robustness is computed by removing the important network components, we may conclude that miRNAs regulate the neighbors of those network components that govern robustness of biological networks.

It should be noted that we repeated our analysis for three different PPIN datasets (Fig. 1c–e). The use of different PPINs ensures that our finding about the relationship between miRNA regulation and the robustness of biological networks is persistently observed in different networks. Very similar behavior was also observed for the PPIN of C. elegans (Fig. 1f).

To show that the above-mentioned results are not dependent on the miRNA target prediction method, we conducted the same experiments using the miRNA targets predicted by PicTar. Supplementary Fig. S1 strongly confirms the above observations, supporting that miRNAs have a strong tendency to regulate those network components which govern the robustness of biological networks.

We repeated the robustness analysis by considering degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centrality measures, in order to compare TAmiC (as a biology-based measure of importance) with these classical centrality measures. 
                        Fig. 2 demonstrates that for detecting important network components (which determine network robustness), in general, TAmiC shows its superiority over eigenvector and closeness centrality measures, under simultaneous targeted attack regime. In case of the signaling network as well as PPIN (CCSB-HI1 dataset) (Fig. 2a and d) TAmiC is even comparable to degree and betweenness centrality. Note that the vulnerability values confirm a similar trend in all of these cases.

In a further analysis, to check the consistency of results while applying other miRNA target prediction methods, we conducted the same analysis based on PicTar dataset. The results are presented in Supplementary Fig. S2, which confirms the consistency of the results based on TargetScanS and PicTar.

From Fig. 2, one observes that, in general, the behavior of the robustness graph and vulnerability values based on TAmiC can be compared to those of betweenness and degree centralities. To further investigate this issue, we computed the correlations between TAmiC and each of the four centrality measures. The results are shown in 
                        Table 2. As this table shows, TAmiC is acceptably correlated to degree centrality (and to some extent to betweenness centrality), while this measure shows only a weak correlation with closeness and eigenvector centralities.

Since TAmiC and degree centrality are correlated, one may question if TAmiC has any advantage over degree centrality. To further compare degree and TAmiC, we investigated the list of important nodes determined based on these two measures. Then, we assumed that “essential genes” (whose deletion is lethal) and “oncogenes” (which are important in carcinogenesis) are biologically important. During the vulnerability analysis, a “good” measure of importance must be able to detect the most important genes first, to remove them from the network.

Here we consider the human PPIN as an example (see 
                        Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). One can observe that during the vulnerability analysis, among the top genes removed based on TAmiC, more essential genes and more oncogenes can be found (compared to the top genes removed based on degree centrality. Consequently, we suggest that although TAmiC and degree are somehow correlated, because of the inclusion of biological information, TAmiC is able to detect more biologically important genes, and therefore, it is more relevant from the biological point of view.

Finally, we had to show that the usefulness of TAmiC is not dependent on the specific set of miRNA targets (predicted by TargetScanS). For this purpose, we repeated the above-mentioned analysis by considering those miRNA targets that are predicted by both TargetScanS and PicTar. Subsequently, we restrict our analysis to highly reliable miRNA targets, which means that some (correctly predicted) miRNA targets might not be included in our analysis anymore. Based on this “set of common targets”, we recomputed TAmiC values (called TAmiC+) and then repeated our analysis. The results are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3. Obviously, compared to degree centrality, TAmiC+ is more successful in predicting the important genes. Therefore, our results are not dependent on the choice of the miRNA target prediction method.

One of the side results of this study was that we found a strong negative correlation between vulnerability and clustering coefficient of the networks (last column of Table 1). The results are summarized in 
                        Fig. 4. In this figure, independent of the chosen importance measure, there is always such a strong negative correlation. As expected, in case of random attack, such a correlation does not exist. In conclusion, our results suggest that the higher the clustering coefficient, the greater the robustness of the network.

As mentioned before, there are two possible strategies for removing network vertices, namely, simultaneous targeted attack and sequential targeted attack. In the above section of this paper, we discussed the simultaneous targeted attack strategy. 
                        Fig. 5 shows the robustness of biological networks by sequential targeted attack. Similar to simultaneous targeted attack, we observed that the robustness results based on all importance measures (including TAmiC) are significantly different from robustness results based on random attack. This observation confirms that miRNAs are of strong tendency to regulate those network components which influence the robustness of biological networks. However, in sequential targeting vertices, compared to TAmiC, the centrality measures are more successful in detecting those network components that govern network robustness. Interestingly, in general, the robustness graphs based on the four centrality measures behave very similarly. This observation suggests that our new importance measure, i.e., TAmiC is essentially different from the centrality measures. This is not strange, as TAmiC is based on a biological concept, while centrality measures are graph-based measures and are computed based on the structure of the network. Finally, it should be noted that similar results are obtained using miRNA targets predicted by PicTar (Supplementary Fig. S4).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control many biological processes. They work through mRNA regulation, mostly by silencing its translation process or targeting it for degradation. Usually, miRNAs are not in perfect complementarity with their mRNA targets, at least in mammals. The degree of complementarity determines the action of guide miRNA to inhibit translation or destroy mRNA. Despite the imperfect “seed” sequence complementarity, it seems that adjacent sequences (and sometimes the 3′׳ end) of a miRNA may have some function in the regulation process. Additionally, it has been suggested that each miRNA may have up to hundreds of mRNA targets, and conversely, each mRNA may be under control of the several miRNAs which function cooperatively. Due to these potentially loose interactions, it is postulated that instead of looking at regulatory effects of a given miRNA (or a few miRNAs), one should investigate the “profiles” of miRNAs (reviewed in [40]). Due to the fact that miRNAs work cooperatively, one has to take an approach at the systems level to understand link between miRNA expression and miRNA targeting. Only these kind of approaches make real sense scrutinizing miRNA regulatory function in biological processes, as well as the effects of their deregulations where related to disease progression.”

In this study we presented a hypothesis that miRNAs play a critical role in regulating important components that govern robustness of biological networks. Equivalently, one may ask if miRNA-based measures such as miRNA count, AAmiC and TAmiC are capable of identifying important vertices of biological networks. The correctness of this hypothesis for each biological network can be tested by removing its vertices in decreasing order of these miRNA-based methods and studying their effects on the structure of biological networks. Using the above-mentioned approach, we found a strong relationship between the regulatory effect of miRNAs and robustness of biological networks. That is, miRNAs tend to regulate those network components/regions which are also important in determining network robustness.

Among the three miRNA-based measures of importance, namely miRNA count, AAmiC and TAmiC, the latter measure was found to be the most successful in locating the important components of the networks. In contrast to TAmiC, which is a biology-based and structure-dependent measure, miRNA count is entirely based on the biological knowledge and independent of the network structure. In the present study, we showed that even miRNA count, to some extent, is able to determine the important components of the biological networks. This finding is in line with the (weak) positive correlation reported between vertex degree and the number of miRNAs that regulate that component in a PPI network [11].

In our analysis, in certain cases (e.g., in Figs. 2 and S2, and also Figs. 5 and S4) we observed that when TAmiC is computed based on TargetScanS data, the network was found to be slightly more vulnerable against targeted attack compared to the case of PicTar data. Note that TargetScanS dataset includes more data compared to the PicTar dataset. This finding suggests that a more comprehensive knowledge on the miRNA targets, in the future, can potentially improve the performance of TAmiC in detecting important network components.

It has been previously reported that networks with high clustering coefficient are less robust to simultaneous targeted attacks [12]. However, this finding is against the classical view of network biology, as higher the clustering coefficient results in more connections in the network, which in turn means more robustness. In contrast to the previous report, in the analysis of biological networks, we found a positive correlation between clustering coefficient and the robustness.

In our robustness analyses, one can observe that the behavior of measures in the metabolic network is different than in other networks. This observation is presumably due to the fact that the links in all other studied networks, including the signaling network, represent some sort of protein interaction. On the other hand, the metabolic network is totally different: a link in the (reaction-centric) metabolic network represents two enzymes which are metabolically connected, i.e., the product of one enzyme is used as a substrate of another enzyme.

In the present study we introduced three importance measures of network components which are based on the number of miRNAs that regulate a network component or its neighbors. We showed that one of these measures, namely TAmiC, can successfully detect those network vertices which govern network robustness. This measure combines both network structure information and biological data about miRNA regulatory mechanism. We showed that although this measure may be correlated to some classical measures of importance (e.g., degree centrality), some of its properties are very different from these measures. In conclusion, we suggest that this measure, together with other measures of importance of network components, can be used in studies related to the biological networks.
