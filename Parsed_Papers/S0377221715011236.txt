                  This paper proposes a novel interest rate model that presents simple analytical pricing formulas for interest rate-based derivatives, including swaps, futures, swaptions, caps and floors. Exploring the regime-switching feature of Markov chains, the proposed model focuses on discrete changes in the central bank policy rates – the main driver of short-term rate fluctuations. An empirical analysis shows that the proposed model generally outperforms other standard short-term rate models in fitting cross-sections of options prices. Moreover, the explicit nature of policy rates, to some extent, enables the model to infer risk-neutral probabilities of the central-bank rate decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

According to data collected by the Bank for International Settlements (2015), the notional amount outstanding of interest rate derivatives has been multiplied by eight over the last fifteen years. This amount is more than six times larger than world GDP in 2014, sixty times larger than that of equity-linked derivatives.

Any change in interest rates affects the market value of these vast amounts of derivatives as well as the pricing of newly contracted ones. As a result, the sources of interest rate movements are highly scrutinised. This contributes to the particular attention given to central banks by financial markets. Indeed, monetary authorities steer the short-end of the yield curve by deciding on the policy rates. Moreover, the influence of central bankers is not limited to short-term rates; theoretical and empirical evidence points to a strong impact of monetary policy decisions and communication on medium to long-term rates.

                           Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) or Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005).
                     
                  

Despite the pervasive relationship between monetary policy and the yield curve, very few term structure models explicitly incorporate central-bank policy rates. In particular, standard models, where short-term rates typically follow Gaussian or square-root diffusions, do not accommodate the fact that most of the short-term rate fluctuations are accounted for by infrequent changes in the policy rates. This notably implies that conditional distributions of future interest rates derived from these models are not fully realistic, at least for short-term interest rates.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        Consider for instance the case where the policy rate is a multiple of 25 bps and where the overnight interbank rate is always close to – and on average equal to – the policy rate. Then, the conditional distribution of future overnight interest rate should be multimodal, with modes being multiple of 25 bps. This cannot be replicated by standard models.
                      Insofar as interest rate derivatives pricing precisely depends on these distributions, one may be concerned about the pricing ability of standard models. Nevertheless, the latter are widely used and various studies illustrate their reasonable fitting performances (e.g. Brigo & Mercurio, 2001, 2007; Gupta & Subrahmanyam, 2005; Martellini, Priaulet, & Priaulet, 2003). These comforting results are however obtained for calibration exercises performed on homogenous sets of market prices where, typically, a single class of interest rate options is present. The rare analyses that consider the ability of standard models to simultaneously price a wider variety of derivatives show less positive results (e.g. Jagannathan, Kaplin, & Sun, 2003). Arguably, a model based on more realistic interest rate dynamics may have less difficulties in matching large cross-sections of market prices. The results presented below do support this view.

In this paper, I introduce a novel interest rate model where policy rates occupy the central place. An extensive and original use of Markov-switching chains makes it possible to capture the step-like dynamics of policy rates. In spite of the important number of regimes it features – typically higher than 100 – the modeling approach remains particularly tractable, offering closed-form pricing formulas for swaps, futures, swaptions, caps and floors. These formulas involve only basic algebraic operations, ensuring fast and simple model calibrations.

                        3
                        By incorporating policy rates, my model features more structure than other short-rate models. However, as the latter, it does not account for other factors, such as demand pressure for specific instruments, that may also affect the values of derivatives. This is beyond the scope of this paper.
                     
                  

Based on euro-area yield and option data covering the last decade, an empirical analysis explores the fitting performance of the model. Specifically, at each date in the sample, the model is calibrated so as to fit a cross-section of swap yields and interest rate option prices (swaptions, caps and floors). The resulting fit is compared with those obtained with traditional short-rate models.
                        4
                     
                     
                        4
                        The alternative models are the Vasicek model, the CIR model, the extended CIR model (CIR
                              
                                 +
                                 +
                              
                           ) and the extended two-factor Gaussian model. An in-depth description of these models can be found in Brigo and Mercurio (2007).
                      The results suggest that the proposed model generally outperforms its competitors in fitting cross-sections of options prices. In a second exercise, the different models are calibrated on swaps and swaptions data only. Prices of caps and floors are then computed using the calibrated models. It appears that the cap and floor prices stemming from the regime-based model are closer to the (out-of-sample) observed prices than those derived from the other models. For instance, over the period 2010–2014, the mean absolute fitting error on cap and floor prices resulting from the present model is of 5 basis points – that is about 7 percent of the option prices – against 13 basis points – about 17 percent of the option prices – for the best of the alternative models. Hence, when it comes to price options for which no prices are available, the present model appears to be more reliable than its competitors; such a property makes the model particularly appealing for trading purposes.

In an additional application, I show how this framework stands as a relevant tool to recover market expectations of monetary policy – an application that is of particular interest for central bankers and market analysts alike. Being the first model in the literature that combines (a) explicit monetary policy rates and (b) a simple calibration based on derivatives prices, this model offers a natural and convenient way to recover market-implied probabilities of future policy changes. As illustrated by Krueger and Kuttner (1998) and Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2007), certain untransformed market data – such as the Fed funds futures rates or overnight indexed swaps (OISs) – can readily be interpreted as market expectations of future policy rates. Yet, while these rates may be informative to reveal the mean path expected by market participants, they do not reflect the market views regarding possible deviations from this path. Instead, as argued in Carlson, Craig, and Melick (2005) and Emmons, Lakdawala, and Neely (2006), option prices contain useful information about the market perception of uncertainty. The last two papers use specific options, namely the options on U.S. Fed funds futures, to recover the distributions of future policy rates. Unfortunately, such options do not trade in the euro area, as in many other currency areas.

                        5
                        Besides, as mentioned by Emmons, Lakdawala, and Neely (2006), these futures-option contracts do not have sufficient liquidity to derive expectations more than a few months ahead.
                      By contrast, a wide range of standard interest rate derivatives can feed my model, allowing it to capture an aggregated market view.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature of interest rate modeling. Section 3 sets forth the model and the pricing formulas. A basic specification of the model is explored in Section 4. Empirical exercises are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

The framework introduced in this paper extends the family of so-called short-rate models. These models are defined through the dynamics – i.e. the transition distribution – of the short-term rate.

                        6
                        Comprehensive reviews of the literature on interest rate modeling are provided by Boero and Torricelli (1996), Broadie and Detemple (2004) and Schmidt (2011); influential books are those of Rebonato (1998), Shreve (2004) and Brigo and Mercurio (2007).
                      Once this dynamics is specified, the prices of all interest rate-sensitive instruments result from the computation of the conditional expectation of discounted payoffs (see for instance Cochrane (2001), Sundaram (1997) or Shreve (2004)). The most prominent short-rate models include: the one-factor Gaussian model of Vasicek (1977), its two-factor version of Hull and White (1994) and the square-root model of Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) (CIR hereinafter). Important extensions of these models have been proposed by Hull and White (1990), Jamshidian (1995), Brigo and Mercurio (2001) and Moreno and Platania (2015). These models feature closed-form formulas for a variety of interest rate derivatives, which explains their popularity among practitioners and researchers alike.

The model I introduce below differs from the previous ones in that it explicitly incorporates policy rates. This paper provides evidence that this novel model is better at fitting large cross-sections of derivative prices. Piazzesi (2005) and Fontaine (2014, Chap. 9) also introduce term-structure models with explicit policy rates. Although the last two frameworks allow for a relatively simple computation of model-implied long-term yields, they do not offer closed-form formulas to price interest rate options. An additional drawback of these two models is that they cannot be made consistent with the existence of a lower bound for nominal yields; this may bias the pricing of interest rate instruments in a low-interest rate environment such as the one prevailing at the time of writing.

                        For instance, a model that does not preclude negative interest rates produces strictly positive price for all interest rate floors, even those with strongly negative strikes. The consistency of my model with a lower bound for nominal interest rates is further discussed in Section 5.6.1.
                     
                  

Another important class of interest rate models used for derivative pricing is that of LIBOR market models. These frameworks, originally due to Brace, Gatarek, and Musiela (1997) and Miltersen, Sandmann, and Sondermann (1997), have the great advantage of being consistent with Black (1976)’s formula, that is the standard formula employed in the interest rate options market. The tractability of these models is however limited to the pricing of a pre-defined class of interest rate options (cap/floor options versus swaptions).

                        8
                        That is, depending on model assumptions, LIBOR models can provide closed-form formulas for (a) caps and floors or for (b) swaptions, but not simultaneously (see Rebonato and Pogudin, 2011 or Brigo and Mercurio, 2007, Chap. 6).
                      By contrast, the model proposed in this paper offers closed-form formulas for all considered interest rate instruments and derivatives.

This paper also relates to the strand of the literature investigating the dynamics of policy rates (Balduzzi, Bertola, & Foresi, 1997; Balduzzi, Bertola, Foresi, & Klapper, 1998; Hamilton & Jorda, 2002; Hu & Phillips, 2004; Rudebusch, 1995). However, this literature focuses on the very-short-term rates and the models it employs are not suited to price long-term bonds or interest rate derivatives (unless resorting to time-demanding Monte-Carlo simulations).

This section presents the risk-neutral dynamics followed by the overnight interbank rate rt
                        , and its resulting implications in terms of pricing.

                           In a general discrete-time finite-horizon setting, the existence of a risk-neutral measure is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage opportunities (Delbaen & Schachermayer, 1994).

Here, I exploit this possibility in order to distinguish between (a) those dates for which a monetary-committee meeting is scheduled, which opens the possibility of having changes in the policy rates, and (b) those for which there is no monetary policy meeting, i.e. with no possibility of policy rate changes. In the former case,

                         (say). As in Piazzesi (2005), the pricing formulas take into account the exact number of days before the next monetary policy meeting only, the subsequent meetings being assumed to take place every 30 days.

                           Naturally, this periodicity can easily be modified to match the frequency of monetary policy meetings in the area into consideration. Typically, in the U.S., the average period between two FOMC meetings is of 45 days, as is the case in the euro area since January 2015.

                            Accordingly, the formula can be simplified with virtually no pricing effect by replacing

                           ), which equals 1 by definition of δ. This simplification is systematically used in the sequel.

As a second remark, it should be stressed that regularities in the matrix product appearing in Eq. (3) can be exploited in order to optimize the computing time of this pricing formula. Specifically, the sequential calculation of the k matrix products can be avoided by regrouping terms and using matrix powers.

An OIS is an interest rate derivative that allows exchanges between a fixed-interest rate cash flow and a variable-rate cash flow. I consider here OIS contracts of maturities τ lower than one year; these OISs involve a single payoff.

                              OIS with longer maturities involve several reset dates. This case is treated in Section 3.2.5.
                            At maturity, the payoff received by the fixed-rate receiver is the difference between (a) the notional (say 1) inflated with the date-t OIS fixed rate, and (b) the same unit notional capitalized with the realized short-term rates.

                                 At date t, the continuously-compounded OIS rate of maturity τ is equal to the zero-coupon-bond yield r

                           Since LIBORs act as the underlying indices of various fixed-income derivatives, function πR
                            will repeatedly appear in the following pricing formula.

Remark that OIS and LIBOR rates are equivalent in this model. This is due to the fact that the model does not take into account credit and/or liquidity pricing effects that explain why LIBORs are higher than OIS rates with matching maturities (e.g. Taylor & Williams, 2009). Neglecting these effects is broadly consistent with the pre-crisis context, but it is at odds with the episodes of increases in the LIBOR-OIS spreads that have been observed over the last few years. In my framework, this could be handled by adding interbank credit/liquidity stress regimes that would account for changes in banks’ default intensities. This is however beyond the scope of this paper, that focuses on pure interest rate risk. In the empirical exercise (Section 5), I will simply address this by allowing for a deterministic spread between OIS and LIBOR rates.

Here, as in the remaining of this paper, I assume that τ is a multiple of the period between two policy-rate-decision meetings. This assumption, which is de facto valid for standard swaps, implies that the number of days before the next meeting is nt
                            at each reset date, which mildly simplifies the formulas.

I now turn to the pricing of European swaptions. This kind of option gives the right to its holder to enter some pre-specified underlying swap contract on a pre-specified expiry date. Plain-vanilla swaptions are written on swaps whose references are LIBORs (i.e. those swaps considered in Section 3.2.5). The maturity of the underlying swap rate is called the tenor. There are two kinds of swaptions: (a) the receiver swaption, which gives the buyer the right to receive the fixed leg of the swap and (b) the payer swaption, which gives her the right to receive the floating leg of the swap.

A cap (respectively a floor) is a contract by which a seller of protection agrees to provide the buyer of protection with a positive payoff if a given reference rate exceeds (resp. falls below) a pre-specified level called the exercise rate on given future dates (the reset dates). The reference rate of plain-vanilla caps and floors are usually LIBORs, whose maturity – called tenor – is the difference between two reset dates.

                                 Note that caps and floors are usually defined so that the initial LIBOR rate does not lead to a payoff on the first reset date, i.e. at date

                      and 
                        
                           
                              Π
                              ¯
                           
                           ,
                        
                      which depict the dynamics of the policy rate that, in turn, drives the overnight interbank rate rt
                     . The next subsection details possible specifications of these matrices. Section 4.2 comments simulations generated by this model.

Recall that matrices 
                           Π
                         and 
                           
                              Π
                              ¯
                           
                         contain the probabilities of switching from one state (regime) of the economy to another. The value of the current policy rate is one element describing the state of the economy. If it were the only one, it would imply, in particular, that the probabilities of having cuts or hikes in the policy rate depend only on the last value of the latter. This would notably be at odds with the stylized fact according to which one policy rate change is much more likely to be followed by another change in the same direction (e.g. Rudebusch, 1995). In the context of the present model, this can be accommodated by introducing different monetary policy phases. Specifically, three phases are considered: easing (E), status-quo (S) and tightening (T). At date t, a policy rate cut (respectively hike) occurs with a strictly positive probability only if monetary policy is then in an easing (resp. tightening) phase and if a rate-decision meeting is scheduled for date t.
                           16
                        
                        
                           16
                           The definition of these phases is consistent with observed central banks’ rate-setting behavior and communication (e.g. Smaghi (2009)).
                         If there are N possible policy rates, the regime vector zt
                         is therefore of dimension 3N × 1 in such a model.
                        
                     

At that stage, two probabilities have been explicitly mentioned: the conditional probabilities of having an increase and a decrease in the policy rate. Note that these probabilities will be zero in 
                           Π
                        , which corresponds to those dates on which no meeting is scheduled. It remains to specify the probabilities of having some changes in monetary policy phases. Positing that there can be no direct transition –i.e. between t and 
                           
                              t
                              +
                              1
                           
                        – from E to T and from T to E, four additional probabilities are then required: E → S, S → E, T → S, S → T.

                         is illustrated in Fig. 1. Denoting by rmax
                         the maximum value for the policy rate

                         the vector Δ that corresponds to this specification of the transition-probability matrix is of the form: [0,0.25 percent, 0.50 percent, 
                           
                              ⋯

                         0, 0.25 percent, 0.50 percent, 
                           
                              ⋯

                                    x

                         0,0.25 percent, 0.50 percent, 
                           
                              ⋯
                              ,
                              
                                 r

                                    x
                                 
                              
                           
                        ]'. It can be seen that the specification proposed in Fig. 1 allows only for single-tick changes in the policy rate. (This can be relaxed at the cost of introducing additional parameters governing the breakdown of the probabilities of cuts and hikes.)

To complete the model specification, I need to define the distribution of ξt
                        . As stated in Eq. (1), this variable is the deviation between the effective interbank rate rt
                         and the policy rate. The latter policy rate (Δ′zt
                        ) corresponds here to the middle of the corridor, whose bounds are set by the central bank (see Appendix A for an introduction to the corridor system).
                           17
                        
                        
                           17
                           As explained in Appendix A, the overnight interbank rate is often close to the middle of the corridor but can also drop to levels close to the bottom of the corridor. In my illustrative example, I will not account for such effects, which will however be dealt with in the empirical section (Section 5).
                         To be consistent with the fact that rt
                         has to lie within the corridor, I select a distribution with a compact support. For a corridor width of 100 bps, a possibility is for instance to take ξt
                         equal to ηtβt
                         where ηt
                         is a zero-mean exogenous binomial variable valued in {-1 percent,1 percent} and βt
                         follows a Beta distribution.

Finally, I posit a maximum policy rate of 8 percent, which is a level that has not been reached by the policy rates of the main monetary areas over the last 20 years.


                        Table 1 reports the calibration of the model which are based on Figs. 2

                        Fig. 2 displays a simulated path for the effective interbank rate rt
                        , together with the policy rate Δ′zt
                        . One can in particular see the influence of the monetary policy phases – shown in the lower panel of the figure – on the interest rate dynamics.


                        Fig. 3 shows the term-structure of swap rates corresponding to different policy rates (0.50 percent, 3 percent and 5.5 percent) and different monetary policy phases. Naturally, the swap curve is higher during tightening phases and vice versa for easing phases. This figure also illustrates that the model can generate the usual yield-curve shapes: flat, upward sloping, hump shaped and inverse-hump shaped.

Model-implied term-structures of swaption prices are displayed on Fig. 4. These prices correspond to different expirations and tenors. While option premiums appear on the left-hand panel in this figure, Black volatilities are plotted on the right-hand panel.

                           In financial markets, it is common practice to price interest rate options using Black (1976)’s model. This model assumes a log-normal process for the forward rate (see e.g. Hull, 2006).
                         This plot demonstrates the ability of the model to generate humped-shaped term-structures of Black volatilities, a phenomenon frequently observed on these markets (see Mercurio & Moraleda, 2000).

I use euro-area data covering the period from January 23, 2004 to September 26, 2014 at the weekly frequency (end-of-week data; 558 dates). The data are extracted from Bloomberg; option prices are obtained from the ICAP Bloomberg page. The model is fitted on both interest rates and interest rate derivatives. Interest rates are OIS rates of maturities 1, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years. Nine at-the-money swaption prices are used: these prices are for three different times-to-expiry (6 months, 1 year and 2 years) and for three tenors (1, 2 and 5 years). I use prices of caps and floors of three maturities (3, 4 and 5 years) and I consider four exercise rates (0.50 percent, 1.00 percent, 1.50 percent and 2.00 percent). Before 2010, only few cap and floor prices are available. From 2010 onwards, about 10 cap and floor prices are available, on average, per date. In order to cope with temporary periods of illiquidity of cap/floor prices, I remove price observations that remain unchanged for 4 consecutive trading days. Eventually, between 16 and 31 prices are fitted for each date.

Despite the growing importance of OIS yields, plain vanilla interest rate options, such as those used here, are indexed on EURIBORs. As mentioned in Section 3.2.3, the present form of the model is not consistent with the existence of credit and liquidity premia in LIBOR-type rates. As a result, adjustments have to be made so as to make the approach compatible with the use of EURIBOR-based options (see Appendix C).
                     

The model presented in Section 4 is extended in order to better fit market data for all the considered dates. Note that while this extension results in an increase in the number of parameters to be calibrated – from 6 to 8 or 10 depending on the dates –, it does not imply a modification of the pricing formulas, which highlights the flexibility of the framework.

First, I allow the conditional probability of policy rate hikes or cuts to depend on the level of the current policy rate. Formally, instead of assuming that the conditional probability of having hikes (cuts) in the policy rate between t and 
                           
                              t

                              1
                           
                         is a constant parameter ph
                         (pc
                        ), this probability is allowed to be a function of the policy rate 
                           
                              
                                 r
                                 ¯
                              
                              =
                              
                                 Δ
                                 ′
                              
                              z
                           
                        . In order to ensure that these probabilities lie in the [0, 1] interval, I assume that they are given by logit functions:

Second, the basic model is specified in such a way as to accommodate the shift in the position of the overnight interbank rate within the monetary policy corridor that was experienced by the Eurosystem in the fall of 2008. (See Appendix A for precisions regarding the relationship between the corridor and interbank rates.) Before then, the overnight interbank rate was, on average, close to the rate of the main refinancing operations (MRO) conducted by the ECB, the latter rate corresponding to the middle of the corridor (see top panel in Fig. 5). I consider here that 
                           
                              
                                 r
                                 ¯
                              
                              t
                           
                         is the MRO rate. In October 2008, following the announcement and implementation of non-standard monetary policy measures that were taken in response to the financial crisis, overnight interbank rates fell to levels close to the bottom of the corridor.
                           21
                        
                        
                           21
                           These unconventional monetary policy measures notably included the move from variable rate tender procedures in liquidity providing operations to fixed-rate full-allotment procedures (announced on October 8, 2008), whereby the ECB accommodates any demand for liquidity its bank counterparties might express at the policy rate – against eligible collateral – in unlimited amounts (e.g. Giannone, Lenza, Pill, & Reichlin, 2010).
                         In the model, I account for this by making the distribution of ξt
                         depend on the MRO rate 
                           
                              
                                 r
                                 ¯
                              
                              t
                           
                        . Then, since 
                           
                              
                                 r
                                 t
                              
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    r
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 t

                                 t
                              
                           
                         (Eq. (1)), ξt
                         is the spread between the overnight interbank rate and the MRO rate. As mentioned above, this spread is, on average, close to zero under a normal functioning of the corridor system (regime C) and negative under the floor system (regime F). Compared to the model presented in Section 4, I therefore introduce additional regimes to account for the fact that δ can take two values. (Recall that δ is the log-Laplace transform of ξt
                         conditional on zt
                        , which is close to the mean of ξt
                         conditional on zt
                         because the order of magnitude of ξt
                         is 1 percent.) More precisely, all those regimes for which the MRO rate is below 2 percent are duplicated: the first group of regimes (state C) is such that 
                           
                              
                                 δ
                                 C
                              
                              =
                              0
                           
                         and the second group (state F) is such that δF
                         < 0. Consistently with the fact that the switch from state C to state F was not anticipated before October 2008, I assume that the probability to exit state C is zero. This leaves us with two additional parameters to estimate only for dates after October 2008: the probability pFC
                         to exit the floor system and δF
                        .
                           22
                        
                        
                           22
                           That is, I implicitly assume that state C is absorbing.
                        
                     

To sum up, the model is calibrated by adjusting 8 parameters for each date until October 2008: pES, pSE, pTS, pST, ν
                        1, ν
                        2, ζ
                        1 and ζ
                        2 and 10 for subsequent dates (pFC
                         and δF
                         in addition to the 8 previous ones).

To compute model-implied prices for a given date t, one requires to know the state zt
                         of the economy. Let us recall that a regime is defined by (i) the policy rate prevailing at date t, i.e. 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    r
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 t
                              
                              ,
                           
                         (ii) the monetary policy phase (E, S or T) and (iii) the functioning regime of the corridor system (C or F, as defined in the previous subsection). The policy rate, that I take equal to the MRO rate, is directly observable. As for point (iii), I consider that the floor system has been operating since October 8, 2008, that is the date on which the ECB announced important changes in its monetary policy operational framework (see Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5).

The identification of monetary phases is based on the slope of the short-end of the yield curve, proxied by the spread between the 6-month and the 1-month OIS rates. As can be seen by looking at both Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5, this spread is high in tightening phases and low during easing phases. The monetary policy phase is assumed to be a tightening (respectively an easing) phase when this spread is above (resp. below) 10 basis points.

                           As an alternative to this identification procedure, one could select, for each considered date, the type of monetary policy phase that provides the best fit of observed prices (for instance). The results however proved to be already satisfying with the simpler approach proposed here.
                         This leads to the identification of monetary policy phases displayed in Panel (c) of Fig. 5.

                           These weights have been chosen arbitrarily in order to yield a fit deemed satisfying across the different market data. Results are fairly robust to the choice of these weights. Naturally, a user that would focus on option pricing (say) would increase option-related weights.
                        
                     

This subsection explores the fitting performances of the regime-based model. Four alternative models are considered: the Vasicek (1977) model, the Cox et al. (1985) model (CIR), the extended CIR model (CIR

                         models notably possess the property of perfectly fitting the interest rate yield curves. This property is obtained by including a deterministic trend in the short-rate process; it is in that sense that these two models are “extended”. Two exercises are conducted; they respectively pertain to the in-sample and the out-of-sample properties of the model.

The objective of the first empirical exercise is to compare the in-sample properties of the proposed model with those of traditional models. That is, for each date in the sample, the models are calibrated on all available data (swap yields, swaptions, caps and floors prices) using the calibration approach of Section 5.4.

                               and the G2

                               models, I simply minimize the sum of squared option pricing errors (swaptions, caps and floors) since, by construction, these models perfectly fit the yield curve.
                         The results are presented in the upper two panels of Table 2
                        . For each interest rate instrument (swaps, swaptions, caps and floors), two pricing error metrics are considered: the first is the root-mean-square pricing error (RMSPE), the second is the mean-absolute pricing error (MAPE). In Panel A, the pricing error metrics are averaged over the whole period (2004–2010). Panel B focusses on the second part of the sample, marked by very low interest rates (2010–2014).

For the two different types of options and the two considered metrics, the proposed model provides the lowest average pricing errors. While the regime-based model does not perfectly fit the yield curve –contrary to the CIR

                         models–, yields’ pricing errors are small, between 2 and 3 basis points on average. Fig. 6 displays the weekly root-mean-squared pricing errors resulting from the best three models, that are the regime-based model, the CIR

                         models, over the 2010–2014 period. The upper (lower) plot presents the RMSPEs associated to swaption prices (cap and floor prices). These plots confirm that the regime-based model provides the best fit for most dates.

The fact that a model provides a good in-sample fit does not necessarily imply that it can satisfyingly price “out-of-sample” instruments. The second exercise addresses that point by excluding caps and floors data from the calibration process. Out-of-sample performances of the models are then gauged by their ability to recover cap and floor prices when these are not used in the calibration.

The results of this second exercise are shown in Panel C of Table 2. This exercise is carried out only on the latest part of the sample (2010–2014) because cap and floor data are scarce prior to that period. Comparing Panel C with Panel B, that cover the same time period, it appears that the fit of yields and swaptions tends to be better than in the first exercise. This is not surprising since, in this second exercise, the calibration can focus on these instruments. At the same time, the fit of cap and floor prices deteriorates. It is however remarkable to observe that the degradation of the fit is less dramatic for the regime-based model than for alternative models. For instance, while the increase in the RMSPEs on caps and floors is of 3 basis points for the regime-based model (from 3.4 to 6.4), it is of 8.8 and of 26.7 basis points for the CIR

                         models, respectively. The lower plot of Fig. 7
                        , which shows the time series of RMSPEs on caps and floors, graphically illustrates the better performance of the regime-based model. Arguably, the fact that the regime-based model possesses more structure than the other short-rate models may explain its outperformance in terms of out-of-sample fit.

Theoretical as well as operational arguments point towards the existence of a lower bound on nominal yields (see e.g. Coeuré, 2015). From a theoretical standpoint, the lower bound for nominal yields should be zero. Indeed, the physical currency – an alternative investment to bonds – provides a nominal payoff of zero. However, because of nonzero (but bounded) storing cost of cash, the theoretical lower bound can be negative. From an operational perspective, in the euro area, the lower bound on yields corresponds to the lowest possible level of the deposit-facility rate.
                              27

                              No bank would agree to lend to another bank at a yield lower than the one it can secure by using the ECB deposit facility (which is a credit-risk-free investment). In the euro-area, the deposit-facility rate is the lower bound of the monetary policy corridor (see Appendix A).
                            Over the last few years, comments by ECB officials have indicated that the lowest possible deposit-facility rate is close to zero (e.g. The Economist, 2014; Draghi, 2014). The slightly negative deposit-facility rate prevailing at the time of writing, of

Contrary to the model introduced in the present paper, some of the alternative above-mentioned models are not consistent with the existence of a close-to-zero lower bound.

                            Such models are subject to severe mispricing when it comes to valuing certain options; they would typically attribute strictly positive prices to floors with a very low exercise rate.

The last two rows of the three panels in Table 2 highlight the failure of some of the considered models to preclude too-low rates. These rows report the conditional probabilities, implied by the different calibrated models, of having very low short-term rates two years from the simulation date. For instance, it says that, on average over the period 2010-2014, the model-implied two-year-ahead probability of having an overnight rate below

Within the present framework, the set of model-implied conditional distributions of yields is very rich. Interested readers can easily verify this by using the internet interface (see Footnote

                           ). In particular, the model can accommodate wide ranges of skewness or kurtosis. It can also generate multimodal distributions.

As is formally illustrated by Propositions 3.2–3.7, the prices of fixed-income instruments incorporate market expectations of future policy rates. It is a common approach, among practitioners, central bankers and academics, to use fixed-income instruments to back out such implied expectations (see e.g. Krueger and Kuttner (1998) or Gurkaynak et al. (2007)).

It can be remarked that certain untransformed market data can readily be interpreted as market expectations. This is typically the case of Fed funds futures rates or overnight indexed swaps (OIS), that are often used as proxies for risk-neutral expectations of future central-bank target rates. However, while these rates may be informative to reveal the mean path expected by market participants, they do not provide information about market views regarding possible deviations from this path. For that, these rates have to be complemented with option prices and a model is then required to convert all these market data into implied probabilities. By offering simple formulas to price various fixed-income instruments, my model offers a natural and convenient way to recover such probabilities.

                           31
                           These probabilities are risk-neutral in the sense that they are associated to the pricing (risk-neutral) measure. They may deviate from physical probabilities due to the existence of risk premia, see e.g. Piazzesi and Swanson (2008). Carlson et al. (2005) also use option prices to recover risk-neutral densities of future policy rates. However, as discussed in the introduction, their approach requires specific option prices that are not available in the euro-area (as in many other currency areas).

More precisely, for each date t, the chart shows the model-implied risk-neutral probabilities that, 6-month later, the policy rate stands at least 1, 2, 3 or 4 ticks above or below its date-t level. Unsurprisingly, these probabilities closely relate to the monetary policy phases prevailing at each date.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposes a novel interest rate model offering closed-form formulas for various interest rate derivatives. In this model, the short-term rate follows an innovative process based on an extensive use of Markovian regime-switching features. The framework adequately captures the step-like path of policy rates. An empirical exercise is conducted on euro-area market data covering the last decade. The results suggest that this model outperforms traditional short-rate models in terms of in-sample as well as out-of-sample fitting performances, making it particularly relevant for derivative traders. As illustrated in this paper, this models also stands as a relevant tool for central bankers, financial analysts or researchers who want to infer market-data-implied probabilities of future changes in the policy rate.

The appendix introduces elements of monetary policy operational frameworks that make it possible for central banks to steer short-term rates. These elements, namely the policy rates and the corridor system, are captured by the model.

In all currency areas, the monetary policy framework is designed in such a way as to allow the central bank to make the short-term interest rates close to a target rate. The target rate is the short-term rate that monetary authorities deem consistent with the achievement of their goals –price stability being the most common of them (e.g. Amstad & Martin, 2010). It should be noted that the target rate is not always explicitly communicated by central banks.
                        33
                     
                     
                        33
                        For instance, contrary to the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, the ECB does not have an explicit interest rate target.
                      By contrast, the rates I will refer to as policy rates in the following are publicly disclosed.

The policy rates are those rates characterizing the so-called interest rate corridor system, which is now used by most central banks (e.g. Berentsen and Monnet, 2008; Kahn, 2010). The corridor system ensures that the overnight interbank rate lies in-between the rates of two standing facilities offered by the central bank; these facilities respectively allow banks to borrow (lending facility) or to make deposits (deposit facility) with the central bank. Banks being unwilling to deal in the market on worse terms than those that are available at the central bank, the short-term interbank market rate is unlikely to fall below the central bank’s deposit rate or to rise above the lending facility rate. Therefore, these two rates delineate the corridor.
                        34
                     
                     
                        34
                        However, Bech and Klee (2011) exhibit periods during which the effective federal funds rate fluctuated slightly below the deposit-facility rate; they argue this could be due to the fact that, in the US, not all participants in the federal funds market are eligible to receive interest on their reserve balances (Government-Sponsored Enterprises, GSEs, in particular).
                     
                  

By steering the bounds of the corridor, the central bank monitors the range of possible overnight rates. Now, the central bank can refine its control of the interbank rate by altering the supply of liquidity. Here is how it works. So as to meet the central bank’s reserve requirements and make interbank payments, commercial banks hold money in the form of reserves with central banks. But there is an opportunity cost of holding reserves; this cost is equal to the difference between the short-term interbank rate and the central bank’s deposit rate. The existence of this cost results is an inverse relationship between the quantity of reserve balances demanded by banks and the short-term interest rate. Through open market operations (OMOs), whereby it exchanges reserve balances for bonds, the central bank can manipulate reserve balances in such a way as to make the interbank market for short-term funds clear with trades taking place near its target rate.

There are two regimes under which the corridor system can operate (e.g. Clews, Salmon, and Weeken, 2010; Keister, Martin, and McAndrews, 2008; Martin, McAndrews, and Skeie, 2014). Under the first (“normal”) one, the central bank adjusts the aggregate amount of reserves by undertaking open-market operations in such a way that, on average, the interbank overnight rate almost coincides with the OMO rate. Under the second regime, called “floor system”, the central bank provides ample liquidity to banks and chooses to permanently maintain a large balance sheet. In this context, the negative relationship between banks’ reserves with the central bank and the short-term market rate is annihilated. Since the banking system, in aggregate, has to hold all the reserves the central bank creates, this reduces the number of banks that fall short of reserves, which pushes the interbank rate at the bottom of the corridor.

It is straightforward to generalize to h > 2.□

The model does not account for potential credit-risk and liquidity-risk effects in LIBOR-type rates. Therefore, if one calibrates the model on option prices whose underlying is the LIBOR, adjustments have to be made not to bias the estimation of the model parameters.

The calibration exercise presented in Section 5 is based on OIS rates as well as interest rate options (swaptions, caps and floors). Since the reference rate of these plain-vanilla options is the 6-month EURIBOR – and not the 6-month OIS rate – adjustments are required. For sake of simplicity, I propose adjustments based on the hypothesis of a deterministic spread between EURIBORs and OIS rates.

The swaptions used in the study are at-the-money (ATM), meaning that their strike rates are forward rates deriving from the EURIBOR swap curve. The assumption that the spread between EURIBORs and OIS rates is deterministic implies that the price of a (synthetic) ATM OIS-based swaption is the same as the price of the (observed) EURIBOR-based one. That is, the only adjustment that I need to make here is to compute the strike rate on the basis of the OIS curve (and not on the EURIBOR-swap curve).

Turning to cap and floor prices, I subtract from the exercise rate the spread between EURIBOR swaps and OIS rates of the same maturity. To be sure, assume for instance that the spread between the 3-year EURIBOR swap and the OIS with same maturity is of 30 basis points. This would mean that markets expect the EURIBOR rate to be approximately 30 basis points higher than the 6-month OIS rate over the next three years. Hence, the payoffs associated with a (EURIBOR-indexed) cap of exercise rate c are the same as those associated with a (OIS-indexed) based swap of exercise rate
