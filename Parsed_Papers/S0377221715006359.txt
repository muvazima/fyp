                  This study concerns a method of selecting the best subset of explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression model. Goodness-of-fit measures, for example, adjusted R
                     2, AIC, and BIC, are generally used to evaluate a subset regression model. Although variable selection with regard to these measures is usually performed with a stepwise regression method, it does not always provide the best subset of explanatory variables. In this paper, we propose mixed integer second-order cone programming formulations for selecting the best subset of variables with respect to adjusted R
                     2, AIC, and BIC. Computational experiments show that, in terms of these measures, the proposed formulations yield better solutions than those provided by common stepwise regression methods.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Variable selection in statistics, also known as feature selection or attribute selection in machine learning, is the method of choosing a set of significant variables from many candidate variables for model construction. Major benefits of variable selection are as follows (Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003; Whittingham, Stephens, Bradbury, & Freckleton, 2006): (i) improving predictive performance of a statistical model by preventing overfitting, (ii) identifying a model that captures the essence of a system, and (iii) providing a computationally efficient set of explanatory variables. Because of these benefits, studies on variable selection are of supreme importance in multiple regression analysis (Burnham & Anderson, 2002; Hocking, 1976; Miller, 2002).

There are several goodness-of-fit (GOF) measures, such as adjusted R
                     2 (Wherry, 1931), Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1974), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978), that can be used to evaluate a subset regression model. A direct way of searching for the best-subset regression model is evaluating all possible subset models. Though procedures for this have been described (Furnival & Wilson Jr., 1974; Gatu & Kontoghiorghes, 2006; Hofmann, Gatu, & Kontoghiorghes, 2007), this task is practically infeasible unless the number of candidate variables is small. Accordingly, the previous studies have focused on search strategies for approximately solving the problem (Blum & Langley, 1997; Guyon & Elisseeff, 2003; Kohavi & John, 1997; Liu & Motoda, 2007). Among them is the well-known stepwise regression method (Efroymson, 1960), which repeats forward selection, i.e., adding one significant variable, and backward elimination, i.e., eliminating one redundant variable, until a stopping condition is satisfied. Ridge regression (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970), Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), and several metaheuristics (e.g., Meiri & Zahavi, 2006) are also used for variable selection. Moreover, algorithms that maximize a submodular set function have received attention for the purpose of variable selection (Das & Kempe, 2008, 2011).

Although these heuristic optimization algorithms can handle large-scale variable selection problems, they do not necessarily select the best set of variables. In addition, other shortcomings of stepwise regression have been pointed out (e.g., Whittingham et al., 2006).

In contrast to heuristic optimization algorithms, integer programming has the potential to determine the best subset of explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression model. When the number of variables to be selected is given a priori, the variable selection problems using adjusted R
                     2, AIC, and BIC as GOF measures can be reduced to ones of minimizing the sum of squared deviation, which can be formulated as mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems (Arthanari & Dodge, 1981; Bertsimas, King, & Mazumder, 2014; Bertsimas & Shioda, 2009; Konno & Yamamoto, 2009). Bertsimas and Shioda (2009) utilized a tailored branch-and-bound procedure to solve such MIQP problems. Bertsimas et al. (2014) developed discrete first-order algorithms to warm start the MIQP computation. It is also known that, by using the mean absolute deviation as a deviation measure, the variable selection problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem (Arthanari & Dodge, 1981). Konno and Yamamoto (2009) solved similar MILP problems by using a mathematical programming solver, and Konno and Takaya (2010) developed a multi-step method to obtain a nearly optimal solution to large-scale problems.

However, if one is to take these MIQP or MILP approaches, the number of selected variables has to be fixed in advance. This is disadvantageous because the optimal number of selected variables in terms of a GOF measure is unknown before solving the corresponding variable selection problem. Another tractable case is that, when the residual variance of the best-subset regression model is given, the variable selection problem of minimizing AIC can be formulated as an MIQP problem (Emet, 2006; Skrifvars, Leyffer, & Westerlund, 1998); yet this assumption clearly does not coincide with reality. Recently, the authors of this paper pointed out that the variable selection problem using Mallows’ Cp
                      as a GOF measure can be posed as an MIQP problem (Miyashiro & Takano, 2015); in this case, we need not to fix the number of selected variables in advance.

On the other hand, a straightforward formulation for minimizing commonly used information criteria, such as AIC and BIC, leads to a mixed integer programming problem with a nonconvex objective function, which is computationally intractable even if the integrality of the problem is relaxed.

The purpose of this study is to develop an exact method for selecting the best subset of explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression model. To this end, we propose mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) formulations to build the best-subset regression model in terms of adjusted R
                     2, AIC, and BIC, without pre-specifying the number of variables to be selected. The continuous relaxation of an MISOCP problem is a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which is solvable in polynomial time; thus, the proposed MISOCP formulations can be handled by recent mathematical programming solvers using a branch-and-bound procedure

                        A concise description of SOCP and MISOCP is provided in Appendix A. See Lobo, Vandenberghe, Boyd, and Lebret (1998) for more details on SOCP, and Benson and Sağram (2013) for an explanation of MISOCP.
                     . Although SOCP has been used in the context of regression/classification analysis for, e.g., efficient computation (Debnath, Muramatsu, & Takahashi, 2005), robust modeling (Shivaswamy, Bhattacharyya, & Smola, 2006; Trafalis & Gilbert, 2006), and dimensionality reduction (Yuan, Ekici, Lu, & Monteiro, 2007), none of the existing studies have applied SOCP/MISOCP techniques to variable selection based on a GOF measure.

Using data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache & Lichman, 2013), we conducted computational experiments to assess the effectiveness of the proposed MISOCP formulations. The results show that they can provide the best subset of variables for small-sized instances in minutes. Furthermore, for medium-sized instances, they often generate better subsets of variables than stepwise regression methods do.

This section contains a brief review of variable selection and GOF measures and mentions previous research on variable selection using integer programming.

                         constraint (10) is invalidated. Thus, the number of chosen explanatory variables in the model becomes k due to constraint (11). Hence, problem (8)–(12) is a correct formulation for minimizing the sum of squared residuals under the condition that the number of selected explanatory variables is k.

Formulation (8)–(12) is a minimization problem with a convex quadratic objective function subject to linear and integrality constraints, i.e., an MIQP problem. A branch-and-bound procedure handles an integer programming problem by relaxing its integrality constraints and then repeatedly solving the relaxation problems with additional constraints; hence, a key factor for a branch-and-bound procedure is whether the continuous relaxation problem is computationally tractable. In this regard, the continuous relaxation of an MIQP problem is a quadratic programming (QP) problem, which is solvable in polynomial time. Therefore a branch-and-bound procedure should work well at solving problem (8)–(12).

Other than minimizing the sum of squared residuals, some researchers have considered minimizing the mean absolute deviations, i.e.,

Nevertheless, in the MIQP and MILP approaches, the value of k needs to be fixed in advance; as mentioned before, the optimal number of selected variables in terms of a GOF measure is unknown before solving the variable selection problem. Accordingly, to find the best subset of variables using these approaches, it is necessary to solve all

                        The continuous relaxation problem of the above is a convex programming problem (see Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, example 3.18), which is solvable in polynomial time. In fact, except for the integrality constraint in (16), problem (13)–(16) has the same structure as problem (A.1) and (A.2), which can be transformed into an SOCP problem (A.3)–(A.7); see Appendix A. Hence, importing the integrality constraint, we easily come up with an MISOCP formulation for maximizing

                        However, this straightforward formulation forces us to solve a mixed integer programming problem with a nonconvex objective function (22). Hence, even its continuous relaxation problem is computationally intractable. This is an undesirable outcome.

In the following, we make the above problem computationally tractable. The objective function (22) can be converted as follows:

Next, we propose an MISOCP formulation for minimizing BIC. The difference between minimizing AIC and minimizing BIC lies in the second terms of the objective functions (6) and (7). Hence, replacing 2j in constraint (30) with j log n yields the following constraint:

                        Accordingly, as an MISOCP formulation for minimizing BIC, we obtain a problem consisting of (28)–(35) except (30).

Finally, we mention minimizing other information criteria besides AIC and BIC. In fact, there are several information criteria, for example, corrected AIC (Sugiura, 1978), the Hannan–Quinn information criterion (Hannan & Quinn, 1979), and the residual information criterion (RIC; Leng, 2013; Shi & Tsai, 2002). Using the transformation technique explained in this section, the problem of minimizing such an information criterion can also be formulated as an MISOCP problem.

This section compares the computational results of the proposed MISOCP formulation with those of well-known stepwise regression methods.

We downloaded eight data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bache & Lichman, 2013) for the regression analysis. The “Solar Flare” data set has three variables (i.e., three classes of flares production) to be predicted, and accordingly, ten instances of variable selection problems were prepared. Table 1
                         lists these instances, where n and p are respectively the number of data points and that of candidate variables.

For the ForestFires instance, we created interaction terms from the variables of the x-axis and y-axis spatial coordinates. In the Crime instance, variables having missing values for most of the data points were removed. For all data sets, each categorical variable was transformed into as many dummy variables as its distinct values. To avoid numerical instability, each quantitative variable was standardized so that its mean was zero and its standard deviation one. In addition, data points including a missing value and redundant variables having a constant value were all eliminated.

The column “#vars” is the number of selected variables, and the column “time (second)” is computational time in seconds. Regarding MISOCP, each computation was terminated if the computation took more than 10,000 seconds; the column “B&B gap” is the branch-and-bound gap. For each instance, the obtained subset of variables is not necessarily optimal if the branch-and-bound gap is more than zero.

First, we found that the differences between the results of SWconst and those of SWall are large. Tables 2–4 show that SWconst and SWall selected quite different sets of variables in many cases. For example, for the Automobile instance, the differences in the obtained AIC values between SWconst and SWall were more than 20, which is hard to ignore. Additionally, in many cases, the number of selected variables (#vars) greatly varied between SWconst and SWall.

Next, the results show that MISOCP finished selecting the subsets of variables in minutes for small-sized instances involving less than 30 candidate variables. Note that integer programming proves that these subsets of variables are the best, and this is in clear contrast to heuristic approaches. Although the MISOCP problems for the ForestFires, Automobile, and Crime instances were not solved within 10,000 seconds, the GOF measures of the obtained subsets were comparable to those obtained by SWconst and SWall. In addition, for all instances of maximizing

                        /AIC/BIC, even for the large instances. Stepwise regression methods are greedy heuristics and naturally do not always provide the best subset of explanatory variables; however, one can also see that the results for SWconst and SWall are less robust than expected.

Regarding the computational time, MISOCP took much longer than the stepwise regression methods did. This reflects the difference between an exact method that pursues proof of optimality through a branch-and-bound procedure and the heuristic nature of stepwise regression methods.

The previous subsection
                         confirmed that the MISOCP approach generally provided better solutions than those of the stepwise methods, but took longer doing so. This subsection examines the effect of giving a solution obtained by stepwise methods to the MISOCP approach as an initial solution for the branch-and-bound process.

The rows corresponding to MISOCPSW in the “method” column are the results obtained by the MISOCP formulations that employed the better of the two solutions of SWconst and SWall as the initial solution. For each instance in the tables, the better of the GOF values is bold-faced.

In terms of solution quality, for the instances that were solved within 10,000 seconds, GOF values obtained by MISOCPSW were naturally the same as those obtained by MISOCP. For the instances that were not solved within 10,000 seconds, no solutions obtained by MISOCPSW were worse than those obtained by MISOCP. In fact, about half of the solutions obtained by MISOCPSW were better. In particular, for

                         and AIC of Automobile, the solutions obtained by MISOCPSW were superior to not only those of MISOCP but also those of SWconst and SWall.

Regarding computational time, giving an initial solution was not so effective for the instances that were solved within 10,000 seconds. In fact, for those instances, the average computational time increased by 4.54 percent. However, for the instances that were not solved within 10,000 seconds, giving an initial solution decreased the branch-and-bound gap by 0.32 percentage points on average.

From the above, we concluded that giving a solution obtained by stepwise methods as an initial solution is somewhat effective for large instances.

The MISOCP approach should also be compared to another exact method, the MIQP approach explained in Section 2.4. Computations for solving the MIQP problems were performed on the same PC used for the MISOCP approach, and CPLEX 12.5 (ILOG, 2012) was also employed as a mathematical programming solver. Table 10
                         lists the computational times for solving one MISOCP problem and for solving MIQP problems for

                              p
                           
                        .

For the instances from Housing to BreastCancer, i.e., the instances that were solved within 10,000 seconds by MISOCP, it was faster to solve 
                           
                              p
                              +

                         MIQP problems than to solve one MISOCP problem. However, neither the MIQP nor MISOCP approaches finished solving the other instances, i.e., ForestFires, Automobile, and Crime, within a day of computation (Table 10). For such large instances, one should limit the computational time for practical purposes, say, to within 10,000 seconds. As shown in Tables 2–4, the MISOCP approach succeeded in finding good subsets of variables for the large instances within 10,000 seconds. On the other hand, subsets of variables obtained by the MIQP approach in the limited computational time depended heavily on the order of solving the 
                           
                              p
                              +
                              1
                           
                         MIQP problems. In fact, our supplementary experiments found that, the MIQP approach failed to solve many of the problems within 10,000 seconds (11 out of 64 MIQP problems for ForestFires, 25 out of 66 MIQP ones for Automobile, and 71 out of 101 MIQP ones for Crime). In such cases, the MIQP approach likely wastes 10,000 seconds in finding subsets of variables of poor quality, because few MIQP problems can be solved within 10,000 seconds. Hence, the MISOCP approach, which optimizes the number of selected variables simultaneously, has an advantage over the MIQP one in getting better subsets of variables for large instances when the computational time is limited.

The reason why the MIQP approach was faster at proving optimality for small instances can be explained as follows. In each node of the branch-and-bound procedure, the dual-simplex method implemented in the mathematical programming solver handles a series of QP problems that correspond to a continuous relaxation of the original MIQP. At a child node in the branch-and-bound tree, the QP problem to be solved is almost the same as the problem at its parent node. Accordingly, the dual-simplex method needs only a few iterations to solve the QP problem, i.e., “warm-start” works well for an MIQP problem. In contrast, for an MISOCP problem, the branch-and-bound procedure solves a series of SOCP problems, which need an interior point method. Developing warm-start algorithms for interior point methods is still a topic of study in mathematical programming, and such algorithms have not yet been implemented in current commercial solvers that can handle MISOCP. This results in the difference between the computational times of the MIQP and MISOCP approaches.

Although at present the MISOCP approach needs a longer computational time than the MIQP one does, we emphasize that the proposed formulation technique allows us to transform the variable selection problem into a single MISOCP problem, not a collection of problems. Numerical techniques for solving SOCP and MISOCP problems are areas of active research, and thus, we expect that the proposed MISOCP formulations will be more valuable in the near future.

In this paper, we considered the problem of selecting the best subset of variables through the use of several GOF measures in a multiple linear regression model. We proposed formulations for maximizing

                      minimizing AIC, and minimizing BIC without pre-specifying the number of selected variables, whereas previous research methods using integer programming need to fix the number beforehand. The proposed formulations are MISOCP problems, whose continuous relaxations are SOCP ones, and thus solvable using a branch-and-bound procedure.

Through computational experiments, we compared the performance of the proposed MISOCP formulations with stepwise regression methods, which are well-known variable selection algorithms. We observed that the MISOCP formulations took only minutes to select the best subset of variables when the number of candidate variables was less than 30. Moreover, even when the number of candidate variables was more than 60, in many cases, the MISOCP formulations found better subsets of variables than those generated by the stepwise regression methods.

In contrast to the stepwise methods, the proposed methodology proves the optimality of the selected subset of explanatory variables when the associated MISOCP problem is completely solved. Since proper variable selection is essential for data analysis, it has a great advantage over heuristic methods. A direction of future research will be to extend our formulation to classification algorithms (e.g., Sato, Takano, Miyashiro, & Yoshise, 2015).

This appendix is a supplementary explanation of second-order cone programming (SOCP) and mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP). For more details, see Lobo et al. (1998) for SOCP, and Benson et al. (2013) for MISOCP.

The general form of an SOCP problem is as follows:

                      is called a second-order cone constraint. Since the constraint becomes linear when Ai
                      is a null matrix and 
                        b
                     
                     
                        i
                      is a zero vector, the class of SOCP includes linear programming as a special case. As in the case of a linear programming problem, an SOCP problem can be solved in polynomial time by using an interior point method; several mathematical programming solvers can handle SOCP problems.

A hyperbolic constraint takes the form x
                     2 ≤ f · g, f ≥ 0, g ≥ 0 for scalar variables f, g, and x. A linear programming problem with a hyperbolic constraint can be represented as an SOCP problem, because a hyperbolic constraint can be cast as a second-order cone constraint:

A mixed integer SOCP (MISOCP) problem is an SOCP problem with integrality constraints on some of the variables. Some recent mathematical programming solvers make good use of the fact that the continuous relaxation problem of MISOCP is an efficiently solvable SOCP problem, and they handle MISOCP problems by using a branch-and-bound procedure.

The linear constraints (10), (15), (20), (24), and (33), are written as big-M constraints,

                     In variable selection, one needs to represent the logical relationship (B.1), i.e., “if an explanatory variable is unselected, the corresponding regression coefficient should be zero.” There are a number of methods that can handle such logical relationships in mathematical programming.

A common choice is to use the big-M method. In the big-M method, the constant M should be larger than or equal to max 
                        j
                     |aj
                     | in an optimal solution. From a theoretical standpoint, if M ≥ max 
                        j
                     |aj
                     | holds, the optimality of the solution is guaranteed. In practice, however, too large M slows down the computation and hence, M should be as small as possible. Bertsimas et al. (2014) proposed ways of finding an appropriate value of M for variable selection.

Another method is to make use of the special ordered set type 1 constraint (SOS type 1; Beale, 1963; Beale & Tomlin, 1970). The SOS type 1 constraint means that not more than one variable in a specified set may be nonzero. A formulation of the logical relationship (B.1) using the SOS type 1 constraint is as follows:

                        
                           (B.2)

                                    {
                                    1

                                       z
                                       j
                                    
                                    ,

                                    }

                     The SOS type 1 constraint is implemented in most of recent mathematical programming solvers.

Some mathematical programming solvers implement the function to express the logical relationship (B.1) directly. Such solvers can effectively handle the relationship (B.1) in their specialized branch-and-bound strategies. In CPLEX (ILOG, 2012), which we used as an MISOCP/MIQP solver in our experiments, the indicator function is implemented for this purpose.

In the computational experiments reported in Section 4, we employed the last of the three methods. It is because using the CPLEX indicator function allowed us to solve the MISOCP problems most efficiently in our preliminary experiment, which was performed as follows.

We solved some small instances in Table 1 using each of the three methods: big-M, SOS type 1, and indicator. In the experiment using the big-M method, the value of M was set to ⌈max 
                        j
                     |aj
                     |⌉ for each instance we used, according to posterior analysis of optimal solutions obtained by indicator; the values ⌈max 
                        j
                     |aj
                     |⌉ were at most 3 in the instances we used. As a result, the method using big-M was about two times slower than indicator, and one using SOS type 1 was about ten times slower than indicator.
