                  In this paper, we demonstrate how to model a discrete-time dynamic process on a non-periodic time domain with applications to operations research. We introduce a discrete-time model of inventory with deterioration on domains where time points may be unevenly spaced over a time interval. We formalize the average cost function composed of storage, depreciation and back-ordering costs. The optimal condition is given to locate the optimal point that minimizes the average cost function. Finally, we present simulations to demonstrate how a manager can use this model to make inventory decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A typical discrete-time model such as an inventory model is defined on a evenly-spaced time domain. In such a model, events occur at evenly-spaced points in time t
                     =0,1,2,…, where the integers represent any unit of time such as a day or a week. However, in reality, inventory managers are faced with time intervals interrupted by weekends and holidays, different numbers of calendar days and business days in a month and the simple fact that customers do not arrive at a store at evenly-spaced time points in a time. Events may occur on a discrete-time domain

In this paper, we offer an approach for optimizing inventory cycles for any such 
                        
                           T
                        
                     . The proposed framework offers a general approach for modeling inventory cycles for deteriorating products with time-varying demand: By choosing an appropriate 
                        
                           T
                        
                     , we can model scenarios where customer demand is spread evenly over the inventory cycle, is clustered near a particular point or a number of points during the cycle, or is any arbitrary collection of points along the time line. We present a simple analytical solution for the optimal inventory level for the case when 
                        
                           T
                        
                      is known before the start of the inventory cycle. We also demonstrate how this model can be used as a simulation tool for optimizing an inventory cycle when 
                        
                           T
                        
                      is unknown ahead of time.

In operations research, a considerable amount of attention has been dedicated to developing mathematical models for production inventory systems (see [1,3–5,7]). Raafat [8] surveys the literature for the deteriorating inventory models. Examples of continuous-time models are discussed in Goyal and Giri [3], Balkhi and Benkherouf [1] and of Goyal et al. [4]. Our paper is related to Warburton and Ben Jazia [9], who present an analytical solution to a continuous-time model with deteriorating inventory and a “ramp” in demand. Although our model is a discrete-time model, it can be used by choosing an appropriate 
                        
                           T
                        
                     , to study a similar case where demand increases over time or other arbitrary variation in demand over time. From a practical standpoint, our model is useful for analyzing inventory cycles where replenishment is infrequent, demand is uneven, and amounts lost due to deterioration are substantial. Such situations can arise, for example, when managing food inventories at remote locations or when an inventory manager purchases a large lot of high-tech gadgets that can quickly go out of style.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we briefly summarize some basics of discrete calculus. In Section 3, we consider a conventional (i.e. 
                        
                           T

                           0

                      discrete-time deterministic model of inventory with deterioration by Dave [7]. We generalize this model so that it can be expressed on a discrete-time domain, which may consist of unevenly-spaced time points. Thus, our model is a general discrete-time model that includes a conventional discrete-time model as a special case. We also derive the condition for optimality that minimizes the cost function. Then, we consider an heuristic example given in Dave [7] to demonstrate how our model generalizes the model studied in [7]. In Section 4, we present simulations over various discrete-time domains. We also conduct several simulations to show how the model can be used to optimize inventory when the general pattern of customers’ arrival times is known but the exact 
                        
                           T
                        
                      is not observed before the start of the inventory cycle.

In this section, we will present only the basic definitions needed for the model discussed in the paper. For a comprehensive presentation of the calculus, which is known as Time Scale Calculus, we refer the readers to Bohner and Peterson [2].

In this section, we show how a discrete-time model can be expressed and solved using discrete calculus outlined in the previous section. We will use the model by Dave [7]. The model is a simple deterministic model of inventory with deterioration. The set up of the model is as follows:
                        
                           
                              
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    constant demand rate at every point along the discrete-time domain
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       T

                                    shortage cost per unit of time
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       θ
                                    
                                    constant deterioration rate
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Q(t)
                                    the inventory position at time t
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       q
                                    
                                    constant lot size
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

At t
                     =0, as soon as the lot q arrives, a portion of it (q
                     −
                     S) goes to replenish back-orders from the previous inventory cycle, where S is the starting inventory position. Lead time is assumed to be zero. Inventory is gradually depleted due to demand and due to deterioration. At some point t
                     ∗ that occurs at or before T, the inventory is depleted and all of the demand is back-ordered.

In this model, the main decision for the inventory manager is to choose t
                     ∗. The choice of t
                     ∗ is the result of a tradeoff: On one hand, the inventory manager faces the storage cost and the cost of deterioration – the more product is kept in stock and the longer that stock is maintained, the greater is the cost. On the other hand, the more the demand that is backordered, the greater is the shortage cost. If storage cost were zero and if the inventory did not depreciate, there would be no reason to incur the shortage costs and the optimal point t
                     ∗ would be at T, and q
                     =
                     S. At the other extreme, if there were no shortage cost, there would be no reason for the inventory manager to incur storage and depreciation costs – all of the demand after t
                     ∗ would be back-ordered (i.e. S
                     =0) and full-filled at the beginning of the next inventory cycle. Once t
                     ∗ is chosen, it determines q, S and, hence, the overall cost of holding inventory.

Dave [7] showed that this inventory model can be described using the following equations:

In this section we present results of two simulations to highlight the differences between the conventional discrete-time models and the models with non-periodic time domains. In the first simulation, we consider the discrete interval 
                        
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           12
                           ]
                           ∩
                           N
                        
                     . We divide each time unit into four equal parts, for Example 3; 3.25; 3.5; 3.75; 4. Then, we randomly choose a discrete-time domain with a pre-specified number of points (e.g. for a time scale with seven points, a randomly chosen domain could be 1.25,2.25,2.5,5,7.25,8.5,11.5) and find the optimal lot size, initial inventory and t
                     ∗ that minimizes the total average cost for an inventory model described in Example 3.1. We repeat the simulation 150 times. We also calculate optimal lot size, initial inventory and t
                     ∗ for a conventional periodic discrete time model. For example, when there are seven points, the time domain is 1.71, 3.43, 5.14, 6.86, 8.57, 10.29, 12. Fig. 1
                      shows optimal points t
                     ∗ for the simulated non-periodic time domains and the periodic time domains. Optimal points for the periodic case are shown in bold.

The stepwise pattern in optimal points for the periodic case is the direct result of the discrete nature of the model. For example, when there are nine points on the time domain, the t
                     ∗ is 6.67, which is the fifth point on the domain. When there are ten points, the t
                     ∗ is 7.2, and it is the sixth point. Therefore, the model suggests that when one more customer is added to the inventory schedule, we should hold additional inventory to satisfy that demand. When the time domain contains eleven points, the t
                     ∗ is 6.55 but it is still the sixth point on the domain. So, the extra goods demanded by this additional customer should be backordered. Therefore, as the number of customers increases, the optimal decision could be both to hold additional inventory to satisfy new demand and to backorder demand created by new customers.

More importantly, Fig. 1 demonstrates how ignoring non-periodicity of time domains can result in suboptimal outcomes. For example, when the number of points on the time domain is set to 13, the optimal points for the non-periodic time domains are all below the optimal point of t
                     ∗
                     =7.38 for the periodic case. Therefore, if we assumed that customers arrived according to a periodic time domain while in fact the arrival times were non-periodic, we would have held larger than necessary inventory because periodic and the case implied that the optimal point is later in the inventory cycle. This can also be seen in Fig. 2
                      which shows that the optimal initial inventory for the periodic domain is higher than for non-periodic domains in this particular example. In general, Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate the optimal points until which the inventory is to be held and the optimal initial inventories vary greatly across time domains and ignoring non-periodicity could result in substantial deviations from optimality.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows initial lot size for randomly generated non-periodic time and periodic time domains. The graph shows the periodic time domain always results in a larger lot size. Thus, periodic time domains require more goods to be held in inventory to satisfy the same number of customers.

In the second simulation, we show how the model can be used for decision-making under uncertainty. The goal of the simulation is to find the optimal starting inventory S when the discrete-time domain 
                        
                           T
                        
                      is unknown in advance. An inventory manager knows how many points there will be on 
                        
                           T
                        
                      but does not know the location of those points. To put it simply, the number of customers is known in advance, but exactly when these customers will arrive is uncertain. We only know that they will arrive sometime between t
                     =0 and t
                     =
                     T. In this simulation, we fix the number of customers at K
                     ∗
                     =12 but, in general, K
                     ∗ can be a random variable as well. The order level S has to be decided before 
                        
                           T
                        
                      is observed. The optimal quantity S is found by simulating a large number of time domains 
                        
                           T
                        
                      and computing an order level that gives the lowest average cost over all simulated 
                        
                           T
                        
                     ’s.

The simulation is conducted in three steps. First we generate 10,000

                     Second, for each

                      generated in the previous step, we calculate the average cost K(t
                     1) given some starting inventory S. Therefore, for each S, the cost K(t
                     1) is calculated 10,000 times – once for each of the simulated time domains. These calculations are repeated for S
                     ={0,1,2,…,3400}. The lowest value S
                     =0 implies that no inventory is being held at all and everything is back-ordered. S
                     =3400 is chosen in excess of the amount needed (K
                     ∗
                     ×
                     R

                     .

Third, for each of the S
                     ={0,1,2,…,3400} we calculate the mean and standard deviation of K(t
                     1)′s over the 10,000 simulated time scales.

We repeat this simulation using different assumptions about distribution of points along 
                        
                           T
                        
                      to analyze how timing of customers’ arrival affects the inventory cost. The points on 
                        
                           T
                        
                      are drawn from:
                        
                           (1)
                           Uniform distribution.

Beta distribution with α
                              =1.5 and β
                              =3.

Beta distribution with α
                              =3 and β

Beta distribution with α
                              =3 and β
                              =3.

The choice of a uniform distribution reflects a situation when customers are equally likely to arrive at any point along the inventory cycle. We choose Beta distribution because it can be defined on an interval with a fixed length, which is desirable when we are planning an inventory cycle. Another attractive feature of the Beta distribution is that by choosing just two parameters α and β, we can model a wide variety of shapes of densities. Fig. 4
                      illustrates probability density functions for Beta distributions chosen for this simulation. For example, Beta with α
                     =1.5 and β
                     =3 would approximate a situation where most customers arrive at the beginning of an inventory cycle. Beta distribution with α
                     =3 and β
                     =1.5 corresponds to an inventory cycle where customers tend to arrive toward the end. And, finally, α
                     =3 and β
                     =3 represent the case when most customers arrive in the middle of the cycle. In practice, one could estimate parameters α and β from available data, or choose any distribution to draw points for 
                        
                           T
                        
                     , including non-parametric densities estimated from actual data.

The mean of K(t
                     1) for these four densities are shown in the Fig. 5
                     . The step-wise shape of the mean cost plot arises due to the assumption that if there is not sufficient inventory to satisfy the demand R, then that inventory is thrown away. For example, if there are 300 units available in stock, then, after 200 units are purchased, the remaining 100 units will be discarded.

Results presented in Fig. 5 highlight the cost of ignoring non-periodicity of time scales. The reference line labeled S
                     =1728 represents the optimal initial inventory for a conventional periodic time domain 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                           
                        
                      (Example 3.1). If we naively choose this as a “one-size-fits-all” starting inventory, then the average inventory costs would be £6081, £7178, £7532, and £7922 if the actual points along the time domain followed a uniform, Beta (α
                     =1.5,
                     β
                     =3), Beta (α
                     =3,
                     β
                     =1.5) and Beta (α
                     =3,
                     β
                     =3) distributions, respectively. These costs are considerably higher than the inventory cost of £4767 under the 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                           
                        
                      case.

When we do recognize that the time domain for a particular inventory scheme is non-periodic, we can find an optimal S provided we have some knowledge about distribution of points along the time scale. Table 1
                      above shows optimal quantities S for each of the distributions used in this simulation as well as means and standard deviations of K(t
                     1) at the optimal S.


                     Table 1 and Fig. 5 demonstrate the cost of not knowing exact customer arrival times: Even if we choose optimal S for each distribution, the inventory cost is substantially higher compared with the 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           
                              
                                 Z
                              
                              
                                 +
                              
                           
                        
                      case. Moreover, the choices of S and resulting inventory costs vary greatly depending on the distribution of points along 
                        
                           T
                        
                     . If most customers arrive early in the cycle, little will be lost due to deterioration, and storage and shortage costs will be lower. Thus, it makes sense to carry larger inventory. This is illustrated by simulation results based on Beta (α
                     =1.5,
                     β
                     =3). On the other hand, if most customers arrive late in the cycle, a lot of inventory will be lost due to deterioration. Therefore, it is optimal to order a smaller amount and back-order the rest, as the Beta (α
                     =1.5,
                     β
                     =3) example suggests. When most customers arrive in the middle of the cycle, the cost is the highest due to the fact that a lot of the product is lost due to deterioration and because of substantial storage and back-order costs. Uniform density results in the highest standard deviation of costs because, under that assumption, there is not a period with a peak demand where most of the customers arrive.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We present a discrete-time inventory model in which the points along the time domain can be located at intervals of arbitrary length. We believe that the approach presented in this paper offers a substantial improvement over conventional discrete-time models because, in our model, events are allowed to occur at any unevenly spaced time intervals. Therefore, this model generalizes traditional discrete-time inventory models on periodic time domains to non-periodic discrete-time domains. From a practical standpoint, being able to model events on a non-periodic discrete-time domain is a desirable characteristic of an inventory model because it allows for more realistic treatment of timing of inventory flow. Although the model is a deterministic model, we show how this model can be used in numerical simulations and applied to decision-making under uncertainty.
