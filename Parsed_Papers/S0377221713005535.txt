                  There are some specific features of the non-radial data envelopment analysis (DEA) models which cause some problems for the returns to scale measurement. In the scientific literature on DEA, some methods were suggested to deal with the returns to scale measurement in the non-radial DEA models. These methods are based on using Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions from optimization theory. However, our investigation and computational experiments show that such methods increase computational complexity significantly and may generate as optimal, solutions contradicting optimization theory. In this paper, we propose and substantiate a direct method for the returns to scale measurement in the non-radial DEA models. Our computational experiments documented that the proposed method works reliably and efficiently on the real-life data sets.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The measurement of scale properties of frontier functions estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA) models may in some cases be problematic. In particular the non-radial DEA models (Banker, Cooper, Seiford, Thrall, & Zhu, 2004) can possess some specific features that give rise to estimation problems. First, multiple reference sets may exist for a production unit. Second, multiple supporting hyperplanes may occur on optimal units of the frontier. Third, multiple projections (a projection set) may occur in the space of input and output variables. All these features cause certain difficulties under measurement of returns to scale
                        1
                        Returns to scale (RTS) may be increasing, constant or decreasing and is measured by the value of the elasticity of scale evaluated at a point on the frontier function; therefore RTS and scale elasticity are often used synonymously.

                      of production units.


                     Banker et al. (2004) proposed a two-stage approach to determine returns to scale in the non-radial models. Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007) showed that this approach may generate incorrect results in some cases. An interesting approach was proposed for measurement of returns to scale based on using strong complementary slackness conditions (SCSCs) in the non-radial DEA models (Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2007).

However, our theoretical consideration and computational experiments show that the SCSC non-radial model may not be efficient from the computational point of view. The SCSC non-radial model generates ill-conditioned basic matrices during the solution process, which results in solutions that do not coincide with the optimal solution of the corresponding non-radial DEA model.
                        2
                        In Krivonozhko, Førsund, and Lychev (2012a) this was demonstrated for the radial Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984) (BCC hereafter) DEA model. Because the frontier function is identical for the radial and non-radial models the computational problems encountered with the radial model will also occur for the non-radial model.
                     
                     
                        2
                      This naturally contradicts the optimization theory.

In our work we propose a two-stage approach to measure returns to scale at projections points in the non-radial DEA models. At the first stage a relative interior point, belonging to the optimal face, is found using a special elaborated method. In Krivonozhko, Førsund, and Lychev (2012b) it was proved that any relative interior point of a face has the same returns to scale as any other interior point of this face. At the second stage, we propose to determine the returns to scale at the relative interior point found in the first stage with the help of Banker and Thrall’s (1992) method or using the direct method of Førsund, Hjalmarsson, Krivonozhko, and Utkin (2007), Førsund, Kittelsen, and Krivonozhko (2009).

Our computational experiments in Krivonozhko et al. (2012a) documented that the proposed approach is reliable and efficient for solving real-life DEA problems.

The plan of the paper is to state the problem to be investigated in Section 2, and to develop a direct method for discovering all units belonging to the minimum face in Section 3. Section 4 reports some of the numerical experiments with the non-radial model specification based on data for Russian banks. Section 5 concludes.

The non-radial DEA model can be written in the following form (Banker et al., 2004; Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2007)

                     Model (1) is also called range-adjusted model (RAM) (Cooper, Park, & Pastor, 2000).

In model (1), an efficiency score for unit (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) is evaluated, where (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) is any production unit from the set (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ), j
                     =1,…,
                     n. If the optimal value h
                     ∗ of the model is equal to zero, then unit (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) is considered efficient, if h
                     ∗
                     >0, then the unit is inefficient (Banker et al., 2004).

In the papers Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007, 2009), it was proposed to use strong complementary slackness conditions from optimization theory in order to find the set of optimal solutions in the primal and dual space. The SCSC non-radial model (Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2007) is written in the following form

The first six conditions are from the primal model (1), the next three conditions are from the dual problem (2), and the tenth condition provides the equality of the objective functions of the primal and dual problems. The last three conditions express the SCSC constraints. In order to secure that strong complementarity is obtained the variable η is entered as the objective function in (3).

In Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007) problem (3) is used in order to find the minimum face that contains the set of optimal solutions (a projection set) on the efficient hypersurface of set T in the space of input and output variables. Next, two additional fractional-linear optimization problems are determined for measurement of returns to scale.

The SCSC non-radial model is very interesting as a theoretical idea. However, our computational experiments show that model (3) may generate unacceptable results even for medium-size problems using well-reputed optimization software. The size of model (3) increases significantly in comparison with model (1). Indeed, the size of model (3) is equal to (3m
                     +3r
                     +2n
                     +2)×(2m
                     +2r
                     +
                     n
                     +2), where m is the number of inputs, r is the number of outputs, and n is the number of production units. Remember that the size of model (1) is equal to (m
                     +
                     r
                     +1)×(m
                     +
                     r
                     +
                     n), and n is usually much greater than (m
                     +
                     r) in real-life models. Moreover, economic interpretation of some constraints of model (3) does not make sense because in model (3) one has to add variables measured in quite different units. The reasons mentioned above may result in ill-conditioned basic matrices(Wilkinson, 1965) during the solution process. This may generate the unacceptable results in the optimal solution.

In order to investigate our suspicions about what will happen when using real datasets, we conducted computational experiments using two middle-sized models.
                        3
                        The same data are utilised in Krivonozhko et al. (2012a).
                     
                     
                        3
                      For the first model, call it Case 1, we took the data for electricity utilities in Sweden 1987; see Førsund et al. (2007). We used the total amount of low- and high-voltage electricity in MWh delivered to the customers and the number of low- and high-voltage customers served as the four outputs. On the input side we use kilometers of low- and high-voltage power lines and total transformer capacity in kVA as the capital variables. Labour is measured in full time equivalent employees. The number of production units in this model is 163.

For Case 2 we took the data from 920 Russia bank’s financial accounts for January 2009, where we used the following variables as inputs: working assets, time liabilities, and demand liabilities. As output variables we took: equity capital, liquid assets, fixed assets.

In the computational experiments we used the well-reputed optimization software CPLEX, the software Mathematica that is very popular among mathematicians, and the software FrontierVision, a specially elaborated program for DEA models that enables one to visualize the multidimensional frontier with the help of constructing two- and three-dimensional sections of the frontier.

It is interesting to note that the three software programs generated identical results when solving model (1) on data sets of Cases 1 and 2. However, the software CPLEX produced significant discrepancies between the solution of model (1) and model (3), which are described in detail in (Krivonozhko et al., 2012a).

Observe that the software Mathematica is not intended for solving large-scale LP problems, for this reason this program was not used for solving model (3). The software FrontierVision was not elaborated either for solving the type (3) model.

The main discrepancies in solving model (1) and model (3) with the help of the program CPLEX (though theoretically optimal solutions of these problems have to coincide) are as follows: (a) efficiency scores of model (1) and model (3) may differ significantly and (b) reference sets obtained in the solution of model (3) may contain inefficient units.

In the linear programming problem (1), the set of optimal points Λ
                     ∗ (the set of projections of unit (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) on the frontier) is situated on the boundary (frontier) of the production possibility set T. Since T is a polyhedral set, the boundary consists of a number of faces.

Remember that in the DEA models the dimension of a face may vary from 0 up to (m
                     +
                     r
                     −1),the maximal dimension. Faces of maximal dimension are called facets. Faces of 0-dimension are known as vertices and 1-dimension as edges. In our exposition, riΓ stands for the relative interior of face Γ.

                     ∗ of projections of unit (Xo

The solution set Λ
                     ∗ cannot belong to different faces that do not have common points, otherwise interior points of T would belong to the solution set. Thus, optimal solutions of set Λ
                     ∗ can belong only to the intersection of some faces of the set T.
                        Lemma 1
                        
                           Let two different faces Γ1 and Γ2 of the set T intersect. Then faces Γ1 and Γ2 do not have common relative interior points, i.e. riΓ1
                              ∩riΓ2
                              =∅.
                        

The proof of Lemma 1 is given in Appendix A.
                        Corollary 1
                        
                           Let two different faces Γ1 and Γ2 of the set T intersect. Then only one of the following cases occurs:
                        


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    One face belongs to the other face entirely, to be precise let Γ1
                                       ⊂Γ2, and set Γ1
                                       ∩Γ2 is a part of the boundary of Γ2.
                                 


                                    The set Γ1
                                       ∩Γ2 is a part of the boundary of the face Γ1 and face Γ2, moreover the set Γ1
                                       ∩Γ2 is also a face and its dimension is less than the dimensions of the face Γ1 or the face Γ2.
                                 

It is proven in Lemma 1 that an interior point Zo
                      of face Γ
                     1 cannot belong to intersections of riΓ
                     1 and riΓ
                     2. However, an interior point Zo
                      of Γ
                     1 may belong to Γ
                     2. In this case face Γ
                     1 belongs to face Γ
                     2 entirely and set Γ
                     1
                     ∩
                     Γ
                     2 is a part of the boundary of Γ
                     2. This can be shown by the same way as in Lemma 1.

However, if point Zo
                      belongs to Γ
                     1
                     ∩
                     Γ
                     2 and Zo
                     
                     ∉
                     riΓ
                     1
                     ∪
                     riΓ
                     2, then set Γ
                     1
                     ∩
                     Γ
                     2 is a part of the boundary of the face Γ
                     1 and the face Γ
                     2.

Summarizing all statements given above, we can prove that there exists a unique minimum face Γmin
                      that contains the set Λ
                     ∗. The notion minimum face Γmin
                      means that any other face that contains set Λ
                     ∗ also contains Γmin
                     .
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           In model (1), there exists a unique minimum face Γmin that contains set Λ∗.
                        

From Lemma 1 and Corollary 1, it follows that faces can intersect only along the boundaries of these faces. Taking into account also that the number of faces of the set T is finite, we obtain that there exists a unique minimum face Γmin
                            containing set Λ
                           ∗. By virtue of the non-negativity constraints on slack variables and the specific objective function associated with all slack variables in problem (1), set Λ
                           ∗ may constitute only some part of face Γmin
                           .□

This completes the proof.
                        Corollary 2
                        
                           Face Γmin is a bounded polyhedral set (polyhedron).
                        

This assertion follows from the constraints structure of problem (1).

Now, we proceed to the construction of the procedure that finds all production units belonging to the minimum face Γmin
                      and to the set Λ
                     ∗. Let problem (1), respectively problem (2), be solved by the simplex-method(Dantzig & Thapa, 2003) and optimal primal variables

Since the optimal solution is obtained with the help of the simplex-method, every non-basic variable is equal to zero. However, some basic variables may be equal to zero also, then the optimal solution is considered degenerate.

For the dual problem (2) all indices belonging to the set (J
                     ∗
                     ∪

                     ) contain a basic set of indices for model (1). However, the set (J

                     ∪

Set Jo
                               determines the set of units belonging to the face Γmin
                              . Set J
                              1 determines the set of units belonging to the set Λ
                              ∗.

The Procedure is completed.

A standard present-day optimization software generates only one point in the multidimensional space as an optimal solution. However, this may be not sufficient in order to determine returns to scale on the whole minimum face, since different vertices of the face may display different returns to scale. Any unit from set J
                     ∗ may belong to the minimum face. A standard software generates set J
                     ∗ as a by-product. So, the Procedure enables one to check whether some unit from set J
                     ∗ belongs to the minimum face or not. The validity of this assertion is based on the theorems given below.

After running the Procedure, the minimum face Γmin
                     , containing the optimal set Λ
                     ∗, can be written in the form:

                      and to the set Λ
                     ∗. The validity of this assertion is based on the following theorems.
                        Theorem 2
                        
                           Let unit Zt
                              ∊Em+r be an interior point of polyhedron Γ⊂Em+r, let also unit Zp
                              ∊Em+r be any point of this polyhedron, which is distinct from point Zt. Then unit Zt can be represented as a convex combination of (m+r+1) units of set Γ and unit Zp enters this combination with a nonzero coefficient.

                      can be measured by two methods at least. In the first (indirect) method (Banker et al., 2004) the BCC model is solved at the first step, the dimension of this problem is equal to (m
                     +
                     r
                     +1)×(m
                     +
                     r
                     +
                     n), then at the second step two additional problems are solved, the dimension of these two problems coincides with the dimension of the BCC problem. Returns to scale is determined with the help of dual variables.

In the second (direct) method (Førsund et al., 2007), an intersection of the set T and two-dimensional plane is constructed with the help of some algorithms at the first step. At the second step returns to scale of any point on the graph is measured by using derivatives of this graph.

Calculate the RTS and scale elasticity at point

Calculation of the RTS and scale elasticity can be performed also for any interior point of set Γ
                     min or Λ
                     ∗ and for any production unit (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ), j
                     =1,…,
                     n.

It is interesting to note a significant distinction between the radial and non-radial DEA models.

In the non-radial DEA models, even if unit (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) belongs to the efficient frontier, all steps of Algorithm have to be performed, since the set of optimal points on the frontier belongs to the minimum face Γ
                     min and RTS has to be calculated at some interior point of face Γ
                     min. Certainly, face Γ
                     min may be point (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) itself, i.e. it has 0-dimension.

In the radial DEA models, if unit (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ) belongs to the efficient frontier, it is sufficient to calculate the RTS immediately at point (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ).

In Fig. 1
                     , the production function for unit 618 is depicted, which is constructed as an intersection of the two-dimensional plane and the six-dimensional production possibility set T in Case 2 for banks. In Fig. 1 point Zo
                      (open circle) is the bank that has number 618 in the data set of banks. Small grey circles denote the projections of the actual observations of banks onto the two-dimensional plane. In the figure, scale elasticity values (from the left and from the right) are shown for three points of the graph Z
                     1, Z
                     2, Z
                     3, respectively. The software Frontier Vision constructs intersections for any unit, spending less than one second per section, and enables one to calculate scale elasticity instantly, hence to measure returns to scale of any points on the graph.

Consider computational experiments with the data set of Case 1 in detail. Problem (1) was solved for every unit (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ), j
                     =1,…,
                     n, where every (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ) was inserted in problem (1) instead of (Xo
                     ,
                     Yo
                     ). Next, the problem of the form (6) was determined on the basis of optimal solution of problem (1) and solved for every j
                     ∈
                     J
                     ∗ using the software CPLEX. Thus, all production units belonging to Γmin
                      or to Λ
                     ∗ were found for every solution of problem (1).


                     Fig. 2
                      represents the dependence of the number of problems of the form (1) on the number of 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     -variables in the optimal basis of problem (1). Remember that the number of 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     -variables in the optimal basis determines the dimension of the face associated with this solution for the bounded face. The dimension of space in Case 1 is equal to 8, so the maximal dimension of face is equal to 7; the optimal basis associated with a face of maximal dimension has to have eight 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     -variables in the basis.


                     Fig. 2 shows that faces of maximal dimension did not appear in optimal solutions of problems (1). This fact can be easily explained. The number of faces of the production possibility set is a finite number. However, the number of possible directions of vector (C
                     +,
                     C
                     −) in problem (1) is a non-countable infinite number. So, the possibility of cases, where vector (C
                     +,
                     C
                     −) is perpendicular to the face of maximal dimension, is very low.

As one can see from the figure, the maximal number of faces (62) turned out to have dimension 2.

Computational experiments showed that there are only two cases (for units 75 and 254) when a vertex belongs to set Γmin
                      and Λ
                     ∗ simultaneously. Consider the first case in detail.

                              0.574
                              ,
                           
                        
                     all other 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     -variables in the optimal solution are equal to zero.

Units 139 and 246 display constant returns to scale, unit 241 has increasing returns to scale.

After getting the solution of problem (6) for unit 75, we obtain that only for unit 139 the objective function

                     . This means that unit 139 belongs to Γmin
                      and Λ
                     ∗ simultaneously.

The light and dark points in the figure denote projections of units from the reference set onto the two-dimensional plane.


                     Fig. 3 shows also scale elasticities (ɛ
                     −,
                     ɛ

                     1, Z
                     2 and artificial unit 1075. Projection of unit 241 onto the plane almost coincides with corner point Z
                     1. It follows from the figure that unit 1075 has increasing returns to scale. Since unit 1075 is an interior unit of the face formed by units 139, 241 and 246, points lying on this face display increasing returns to scale, see (Krivonozhko et al., 2012b). However, the software could generate units 139 plus slacks as optimal solution. If one determined returns to scale only on the basis of this information, then all units of the face would display constant returns to scale.

The production function for unit 241 is depicted in Fig. 4
                     , where the vectors of the two-dimensional plane are determined by input and output vectors of unit 241. Again, the dark and light points in the figure denote projections of units from the reference set onto the two-dimensional plane. Left and right scale elasticities (ɛ
                     −and ɛ
                     +) are shown also in the figure for unit 241, according to their values unit 241 displays increasing returns to scale.


                     Fig. 5
                      represents the production function for unit 139. Left and right scale elasticities shown in the figure indicate that this unit displays constant returns to scale.

Hence, this example show that only an interior point of a face can determine return to scale of points lying on this face.

However, the question arises: What is the ‘payment’ for discovering all vertices of the face Γmin
                     ?

We calculated the number of iterations accomplished by the CPLEX software in order to solve problem (1) for all units (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ), j
                     =1,…,
                     n. This number is equal to α
                     =2876 iterations. Next, we calculated the number of iterations accomplished by CPLEX in order to solve problems (6) for all units (Xj
                     ,
                     Yj
                     ), j
                     =1,…,
                     n. This number makes up β
                     =1782=0.62α iterations in problems of the type (6). That is really not a heavy burden, even for an ordinary notebook.

It is worth noting that interior unit 1075 of face Γmin
                      is depicted as a corner point in Fig. 3. Moreover, the intersection of the two-dimensional face Γmin
                      and the two-dimensional plane spanned by input and output vectors of unit 1075 generates just one point (unit 1075). This situation is impossible in three-dimensional space. However, such cases do exist in the multidimensional case. Let us dwell on this more detail.

Designate (m
                     +
                     r) by p. Every face of the production possibility set in Euclidean space Ep
                      belongs uniquely to some minimum affine set.

Remember that the affine set Aff (Rockafellar, 1970) generated by units Zl

The dimension of the affine set Aff is equal to the dimension of the subspace L.

Now, we are ready to state the following result.
                        Theorem 4
                        
                           The intersection of the 2-dimensional plane and the k-dimensional affine set,

                           , result in a point in the multidimensional space Ep only if 
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 ⩾
                                 k
                                 +
                                 2
                              
                           .

The proof of the theorem is given in Appendix A.

It follows from Theorem 4 that in the 3-dimensional space the intersection of two 2-dimensional planes cannot result in a point. In fact, Fig. 3 shows that the interior artificial unit 1075 represents in the 8-dimensional space the intersection of the 2-dimensional face Γmin
                      and the 2-dimensional plane spanned by input and output vectors of the unit 1075.

                     Finding. The non-radial DEA models possess some specific features. However this is a not a problem in order for find returns to scale of the set of optimal points. For this purpose it is sufficient to find an interior point of the minimum face that contains the set of optimal solutions of problem (1) and to determine returns to scale of this interior point. Such solution requires much less computations than to solve problem (1) for the specific unit.

In Sueyoshi & Sekitani, 2007, 2009, a method was proposed in order to measure returns to scale in the non-radial DEA models using strong complementary slackness conditions. However, the size of the SCSC non-radial model (3) increases significantly in comparison with model (1). In particular, for the banks data set the size of basic matrices during the solution process becomes (1840×1840) instead of (7×7) in model (1). In addition, some constraints in model (3) do not make sense from an economic point of view. Unreliable solutions may follow due to these reasons.

In our method, it is sufficient to solve several problems of the form of model (1), however such problems have much fewer variables than problem (1). Thus, the proposed approach is reliable and efficient for solutions of real-life problems. Moreover, it was stressed in Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2007) that the method of Banker et al. (2004) cannot always generate reliable results because of difficulties described above in the non-radial DEA models. However, the method of Banker et al. (2004) can also be used to measure returns to scale from our point of view. For this purpose, it is sufficient to take an interior point of the minimum face, which can be found by the method proposed in this paper, after this one can use the method proposed in
                     Banker et al. (2004).

We applied our approach to the range-adjusted DEA model, since this model is well-known in the scientific literature on the DEA approach. However, our method can be extended to other types of the non-radial DEA models.

                           Polyhedron Γ is a bounded set; hence the face is also bounded.

Since Zq
                            belongs to some bounded face of polyhedron Γ, then according to the Carathéodory’s Theorem (Rockafellar, 1970), point Zq

The 2-dimensional plane in the p-dimensional space Ep
                            is determined by (p
                           −2) linear independent equations. The k-dimensional affine set in the p-dimensional space Ep
                            is determined by (p
                           −
                           k) linear independent equations. So, the intersection of 2-dimensional plane and k-dimensional affine space is determined by the system of (p
                           −
                           k

                           p
                           −2) linear equations.

This system determines a point in the multidimensional space Ep
                      only if the following conditions hold:
                        
                           (a)
                           The number of equations of the system

                                    p

                                    2
                                    )

                                    p
                                 
                               or 
                                 
                                    p
                                    ⩾
                                    k
                                    +
                                    2
                                 
                              .

The rank of this system of linear equations is equal to p.

Hence the intersection of the 2-dimensional plane and the k-dimensional affine set may result in a point in the multidimensional space.This completes the proof. □
