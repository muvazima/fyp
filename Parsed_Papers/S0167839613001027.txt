                  In this paper, the dual representation of spatial parametric curves and its properties are studied. In particular, rational curves have a polynomial dual representation, which turns out to be both theoretically and computationally appropriate to tackle the main goal of the paper: spatial rational Pythagorean-hodograph curves (PH curves). The dual representation of a rational PH curve is generated here by a quaternion polynomial which defines the Euler–Rodrigues frame of a curve. Conditions which imply low degree dual form representation are considered in detail. In particular, a linear quaternion polynomial leads to cubic or reparameterized cubic polynomial PH curves. A quadratic quaternion polynomial generates a wider class of rational PH curves, and perhaps the most useful is the ten-parameter family of cubic rational PH curves, determined here in the closed form.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Polynomial Pythagorean-hodograph curves are characterized by the property that the Euclidean norm of their hodograph is a polynomial, not a square root of a polynomial. These curves thus have a rational unit vector field of tangents, rational offset curves, and a polynomial arc length what makes them an important practical tool that finds its applications in robotics, in CAD/CAM systems, in animations, etc. Polynomial PH curves were introduced in Farouki and Sakkalis (1990) and have widely been studied since then (see Farouki, 2008 and the references therein). The usual approach to obtain a polynomial PH curve is to integrate the appropriate hodograph constructed with the help of the complex or the quaternion polynomials in the plane or in the space case respectively (see e.g. Farouki, 2008, 1994; Choi et al., 2002).

But the natural extension of the PH property to rational curves turned out to be quite a task, and only few results are known in this direction. The main obstacle is the fact that the polynomial preimage approach cannot be applied here since the integral of a rational curve is not a rational curve in general. Planar rational PH curves were derived in Pottmann (1995a), and independently in Fiorot and Gensane (1994). The suggested construction determines a planar rational curve as the envelope of a one-parameter family of tangent lines, given by a rational unit vector field of tangents, and a rational support function which defines the distance of the tangent line from the origin. As observed in Pottmann (1995a), the introduced dual form of a planar rational PH curve turns out to be more appropriate from the computational point of view than the corresponding point representation. Interpolation schemes involving planar PH curves can be found in Pottmann (1995b).

A short note (Pottmann, 1994) made the first step to spatial rational PH curves. It introduced the space curves in dual representation as well as its wedge product notation. Just recently, a comprehensive study of these curves has been carried out in Farouki and Šír (2011), where the construction of rational spatial PH curves has been presented and further justified and illuminated from several equivalent geometric viewpoints. Basically, the approach originates from the implicit curve representation involving the curve binormal direction and a rational function that determines the signed distance of the osculating plane from the origin. In order to assure the PH property of the curve, its binormal directions are generated from a rational vector field of unit length tangents.

In this paper a further insight into rational spatial PH curves is provided, with emphasis to their construction in a form that could be used in practical applications. First of all, since the construction in Farouki and Šír (2011) leads to rational PH curves of high degree in general, we stick to the dual form introduced in Pottmann (1994, 1995a). Note that this curve representation can be naturally extended to any dimension. In the PH case, the dual form enables one to deal in general with polynomials of a significantly lower degree than in the curve closed form point representation. The exception is the cubic case where degrees of both representations are equal. Equipped with the dual approach, we obtain the dual PH curve from the Euler–Rodrigues frame in a similar way as already in Farouki and Šír (2011). The E–R frame is generated by quaternion polynomials, and we focus on the question, how one should choose superfluous parameters to assure that the corresponding dual form would be of a low degree. Quaternion polynomials of degree ⩽2 are considered here in detail. It is shown that linear quaternion polynomials give rise to cubic or reparameterized cubic polynomial PH curves. Based on quadratic quaternion polynomials we derive rational PH curves with the dual form of degree

                        ,
                        5
                        ,

                        4
                      degrees of freedom. In particular, a ten parametric family of cubic rational PH curves with nonconstant denominator is presented in a closed form. This comes somewhat as a surprise since there are no additional free parameters in comparison to the cubic polynomial case.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section the dual form of a parametric space curve is introduced and its properties with the emphasis on rational curves analysed. Section 3 introduces rational PH curves with the dual form based upon E-R frame. Degree of the dual form of a rational PH curve and its reduction is considered in Section 4. In the next section curves that arise from a linear quaternion polynomial are treated. Rational PH curves from a quadratic quaternion polynomial are considered in Section 6 together with a few examples. In the end, we discuss possible future work directions.

In Pottmann (1994) or Farouki and Šír (2011), the key step to the construction of rational PH curves was a nice implicit representation of a parametric curve. Since the approach works in the planar case too, and it could be extended to more than three dimensions if needed, we briefly recall it. Let

                              r

                      are linearly independent on the parameter interval

                        ]
                     . Then the corresponding Frenet frame

                        b
                      denote the unit tangent, the principal normal and the unit binormal respectively. Further, a point

                        (
                        t
                        )
                      can be uniquely recovered as the intersection of the osculating, the rectifying, and the normal plane at a particular parameter value 
                        t
                        ∈

                      where × denotes the cross product, we proceed to the construction of curves in the implicit form (3). The coefficients of the first equation in (3) where 
                        ℓ

                      that pin down the family of the osculating planes, determine the corresponding curve uniquely since the second and the third equations of the system (3) follow from the first one. Following Pottmann (1995a) we call them dual coordinates of the parametric curve. In order to shorten the notation we introduce an imbedding shortcut

                      Note that the first assertion in (7) has already been derived in Pottmann (1994). Both relations in (7) emphasize the symmetry among the homogeneous form of a curve and the dual one. The form 
                        L
                      is dual to 
                        P
                     , and vice versa. So dual to dual of 
                        P
                      or 
                        L
                      should be equivalent to the original form. The following theorem states this fact precisely.

                      If the components of 
                        L
                      are not relatively prime, we may divide 
                        L
                      by the greatest common polynomial divisor to obtain relatively prime components. This simplifies the polynomial dual representation as much as possible. Except for the cubic case, degrees of 
                        P
                      and 
                        L
                      will be different in general. The following definition makes a distinction between degree of the curve and degree of its dual form. 
                        Definition 1
                        Rational curves with relatively prime polynomial dual form 
                              L
                            of degree m are called class m curves.

Let us reveal the relation between degrees of the curve representations. But first, we need the following theorem.

                     . This observation simply says that a switch from a known dual representation 
                        L
                      to a closed form representation 
                        P
                      might significantly increase complexity of the curve representation. If one is forced to start with the dual representation as it is the case with PH curves, low class curves will be the first to consider. However, point evaluation is a basic task one encounters, but it can be done efficiently from the dual form too. A Bézier dual representation that has been introduced in Pottmann (1994), allows one to do the computations in an efficient and stable way by applying the de Casteljau algorithm to dual coordinates.

Let us turn our attention to rational PH curves. The PH conditions are satisfied if one starts with a rational unit length tangent 
                        t
                        =
                        
                           1
                           ρ
                        
                        h
                     , where 
                        h
                      is a polynomial curve, and 
                        ρ
                        =
                        ‖
                        h
                        ‖
                      is its polynomial norm. Then a rational PH curve can be constructed by choosing any rational function ψ such that
                        
                           (14)
                           
                              r
                              =
                              ∫
                              ψ
                              h
                           
                        
                      is a rational curve too. But, the possible candidates for ψ are hard to be determined, especially if 
                        h
                      depends on some unknown coefficients. More or less, all reduces to a question, when the integral of a rational function is rational too. Fortunately, this problem can be avoided by using the dual construction. A dual form of a curve (14) is by (4) equivalent to

A rational unit vector field can be constructed by using the stereographic projection, which defines a bi-rational correspondence between points in the plane and points on the unit sphere in 
                        
                           
                              R

                      (see Farouki and Šír, 2011). The other standard way is the quaternion approach, which will be used in this paper.

Space of quaternions 
                        H
                      is a 4-dimensional vector space with a standard basis 
                        {
                        1
                        ,

                        j
                        ,
                        k
                        }
                     . Quaternions can be written as 
                        A
                        =

                        )
                      where the first component is called a scalar part, and the remaining three components form a vector part of the quaternion. A quaternion with a zero scalar part is called a pure quaternion, and such quaternions are identified with vectors in

To construct a rational unit vector field of tangents we start by a quaternion polynomial 
                        A
                        ∈
                        H

                        t
                        ]
                     , which components are relatively prime. With quaternion polynomial 
                        A
                      we associate the orthonormal Euler–Rodrigues frame

Degree of a dual PH curve representation (16) depends on degrees of 
                        A
                     , f and g. Degree of quaternion polynomial affects it most. Namely, if degree of 
                        A
                      is equal to k, it is easy to verify that

                        1
                     , and g of a low degree. Further, a quadratic 
                        A
                      yields curves of class ⩾6, and cubic one results in class ⩾10 provided the components of 
                        v
                      are relatively prime. But if they are not, the class could be quite clearly reduced by a proper choice of f. Suppose that

The next lemma shows that a multiplication of 
                        A
                      by a constant quaternion does not change the class of the corresponding curve or the degree of a common factor in 
                        v
                     . It induces a rotation and the scaling of the original curve only.

An obvious way to search for class 4 curves is to carry on the degree reduction of 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                         from (39) further. However, this approach fails since it implies 
                           
                              
                                 a

                                 ,
                                 0
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                        , and the denominator of the generated curve vanishes. This leaves two ways to obtain class 4 curves. Either one has to determine conditions such that 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                         in (39) would admit a common linear factor or one has to assure a quadratic divisor of the field (35). We only consider the latter case since it will cover the first possibility too. A straightforward trial to obtain a quadratic divisor ϑ of 
                           v
                         in general turned out to be quite complicated. Instead, we use the sufficient condition (28) supplied by Lemma 1. Since

                           =

                         and a common factor of 
                           h
                         cannot have real roots provided 
                           A
                         has relatively prime components, it is clear that any polynomial that divides ρ can only be factorized to irreducible quadratic factors over the real field 
                           R
                        . But then by (28) the polynomial ϑ must divide either

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 ν

To derive class 3 PH curves, one has to reduce 
                           v
                         from (35) to a cubic vector field. As with class 5 we can without loosing generality send one singular point to infinity by assuming (38), and only a quadratic reduction factor ϑ of (39) has to be decided upon. We observe from (39) and (40) that ϑ should be proportional to

In this paper we carry the construction of spatial rational PH curves from Pottmann (1994) and Farouki and Šír (2011) a step further, based upon the dual curve representation mainly. Using quadratic quaternion polynomials, curves of class

                      parameters of freedom are derived. There are many questions left concerning spatial rational PH curves. Of course, one has to state and analyse interpolation schemes suited for this purpose. Analysis of singular points and potential alternative ways how to present rational PH curves might also be two interesting issues. But perhaps the most valuable would be the answer to the question, where and when rational PH curves do better than their polynomial counterpart.
