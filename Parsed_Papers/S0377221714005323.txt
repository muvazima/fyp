                  The emergence of B2B spot markets has greatly facilitated spot trading and impacted supply chain structures as well as the way commercial transactions take place between firms in many industries. While providing new opportunities, the B2B spot market also exposes participants to a price risk. This new business landscape raises some important questions on how the supplier and manufacturer should change their sales channel and procurement strategies and tailor their decisions to this changing environment. In this paper, we study the channel-choice, pricing and ordering/production decisions of the risk-averse supplier and manufacturer in a two-tier supply chain with a B2B spot market. Our analysis shows that, to benefit from the B2B spot market and control the risk exposure, the upstream supplier should develop an integrated channel-choice and pricing strategy. When the supplier adopts a dual-channel strategy, the equilibrium contract price decreases in the supplier’s risk attitude, but increases in the demand uncertainty. However, it first decreases and then increases in the manufacturer’s risk attitude and spot price volatility. We conclude that rather than simply being a second channel, the B2B spot market provides a strategic tool to supply chain members to achieve an advantageous position in their contract trading.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The B2B spot market has been one of the most powerful business innovations in the past decade. With growing liquidities, trading in spot markets is increasingly important to supply chain management. Commodities and service, such as chemical products, semiconductors, logistics service, plastics, electric power, metals, and agricultural products, are now widely traded in spot markets (Turban, Lee, King, Liang, & Turban, 2009). At the same time, the relationship-based long-term contract still has merits and is widely used (Kleindorfer, 2009). Kleindorfer and Wu (2003) note that firms in capital-intensive industries need to sell most of their output or capacity via contract in advance, while using the spot market to better fine tune the demand and supply. In the DRAM memory industry for example, 75–80% of DRAM is sold in advance via fixed-price contracts to computer or smartphone makers, and the remainder is sold in spot markets (Mendelson & Tunca, 2007).

Another example is the U.S. beef industry where spot trading accounts for about 60% of total fed cattle while long-term contracts between packers and larger feedlots take care of the rest. The spot market is mainly driven by a large number of small producers of cattle, and packers can also resell contract-procured fed cattle in the spot market if they are not needed for the beef production (Boyabath, Kleindorfer, & Koontz, 2011). Other examples on practices of applying the mixture of long-term contract and spot market can be found in Kleindorfer (2009) and Inderfurth, Kelle, and Kleber (2013).

Spot markets serve as a platform for the upstream firms to offload capacity or output and for the downstream firms to address shortage and excess inventory. This flexibility can help firms better match demands and supplies. However, spot market transactions also expose participants to price volatility, and supply chain members’ profits (costs) cannot be fixed in advance (Grey, Olavson, & Shi, 2005). While long-term contracts can effectively hedge against commodity price risk, the lack of flexibility often comes with a quantity risk, i.e., either over stock or shortage (Dong & Liu, 2007 & Grey et al., 2005). Given the advantages and shortcomings of the spot trading and contract transaction, upstream firms may choose to sell through contract only, spot market only, or the combination of them. What are then the main tradeoffs that affect upstream firms’ channel choice?

Another critical issue is how supply chain members’ pricing and ordering/capacity decisions are affected by the presence of a spot market. In a traditional supply chain, the upstream firm has to determine her contract sale prices and production (capacity) plans, while the downstream firm has to decide his selling price of his final product and contract order quantity. A spot market helps the upstream firm effectively sells her output/capacity due to its continuous availability. Similarly, the downstream firm can readjust his inventory in the spot market according to the updated demand information. Obviously, supply chain managers need to tailor their pricing and quantities decisions to align with this new business environment. Furthermore, the B2B spot market is likely to expose participants to a new price risk; and hence, the notion of risk management should be incorporated when studying supply chain issues involving spot trading to gain insights into how risk factors affect the strategies of the participants.

Motivated by the questions elaborated above, we consider a two-tier supply chain in the presence of a liquid spot market. The upstream firm, referred to as the supplier, produces a commodity-like product, and sells it through the long-term contract as well as in the spot market. She decides her planned output quantity (capacity) available to the manufacturer for a targeted period, and announces the contract price. In response to the supplier’s offer, the manufacturer decides his contract order quantity and the selling price of his final product. Aware of the price risk in the spot market and the demand uncertainty in the final product market, both of them may be risk-averse and intend to maximize their respective mean–variance utilities. We formulate a Stackelberg game model to analyze the decisions and the performance of the two parties. This model setting matches the real operation in many supplier–manufacturer supply chains in which the downstream firm uses a perishable commodity or material with a higher storable cost to produce a final product in the presence of a liquid spot market. It can also be applied in service industries. In the sea-cargo industry, for example, carriers sells most of their capacities to forwarders in advance to reduce the demand uncertainty. The remaining spaces are sold in the spot market. Forwarders offer the value-added services to downstream shippers, they can also trade in the spot market (Xu, Kannan, Yang, Li, & Zhao, 2013).

We derive the unique equilibrium for the Stackelberg game in closed form. Our analysis shows that, to benefit from the B2B spot market and control the risk exposure, the upstream supplier should develop an integrated channel-choice and pricing strategy. When the manufacturer is more risk-averse, the supplier has three different combinations of the pricing and channel strategies at her disposal. If the expected spot price is sufficiently high, the supplier can follow a dual-channel and low-price strategy. The high expected spot price enables the supplier to produce more. To control her risk exposure, the supplier sets a lower contract price to entice the manufacturer to order more via contract. When the expected spot price is moderate, the dual-channel and high-price strategy can be followed to obtain a high profit margin from contract and clear surplus in the spot market. If the expected spot price is sufficiently low, the supplier follows the contract-only and high-price strategy. In this case, only enough will be produced to satisfy contract sales. When the manufacturer is less risk-averse, the supplier may follow a dual-channel and low-price strategy if the expected spot price is relatively high. If the expected spot price is sufficiently low, the supplier and manufacturer may not be able to reach an agreement on the contract, and the supplier sells only in the spot market. Furthermore, when the supplier adopts a dual-channel strategy, the contract price decreases in the supplier’s own risk attitude and increases in the demand uncertainty; and it first decreases and then increases in the manufacturer’s risk attitude as well as the spot price volatility. We can thus conclude that rather than simply being a second channel, the B2B spot market can provide a strategic tool to supply chain members to achieve an advantageous position in their contract trading.

We contribute to the literature by investigating how supply chain members can use channel and pricing strategies to gain benefits from spot trading. We also provide managerial insights, by positioning the spot market as a strategic tool, on how supply chain members use it to achieve advantageous position in their contract trading. More importantly, the integration of joint pricing and inventory/production, spot price and demand uncertainty, and supply chain members’ different risk attitudes into a single framework can help managers be better equipped for more complicated decision-making settings, which are becoming more common with the development of B2B online spot markets.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We review the literature in Section 2 and describe the decision models for a supplier and a manufacturer in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the Stackelberg equilibrium of the supply chain. In Section 5, we show that the supplier’s channel choice and pricing strategies are governed, respectively, by a switching curve-type policy. In Section 6, we examine the effects of the risk factors on the participants’ strategies, and provide a comparison with a benchmark without the spot market. We summarize our findings and present some future research opportunities in Section 7.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Our work generalizes two streams of research in the literature. The first stream is on dual sourcing with a spot market. Kleindorfer and Wu (2003) and Haksöz and Seshadri (2007) provide comprehensive surveys of this literature. Lee and Whang (2002) and Dong and Durbin (2005) consider a situation in which the multiple downstream firms have the opportunity to readjust (buy and sell) through a secondary market their inventory positions built from earlier contract procurements. Peleg, Lee, and Hausman (2002) compare three procurement strategies of using the long-term contract only, the short-term spot market only, the combination of both. They find that the optimal strategy depends on the market characteristics. Milner and Kouvelis (2007) study the periodic ordering policy of a buyer when the spot price is determined through a pricing mechanism in a multiple-firm model. Boyabath et al. (2011) examine a beef supply chain in the United States where a meat packer can source inputs through long-term based window contracts and a spot market to produce two beef products. In a multi-period setting, Inderfurth et al. (2013) study the procurement problem and develop a heuristic to determine the policy parameters. Mendelson and Tunca (2007) focus on the behaviors of one supplier and multiple buyers in a supply chain in the presence of a spot market. In their model, the supplier can receive private information about her costs, and buyers can update their beliefs on the consumer demand. Gümüs, Ray, and Gurnani (2012) model a supply chain consisting of one buyer, one reliable supplier, and one unreliable supplier. They examine the underlying motivation for the unreliable supplier to offer a price and quantity guarantee contract. Wu, Kleindorfer, and Zhang (2002), Spinler, Huchzermeier, and Kleindorfer (2003), Golovachkina (2003), Wu and Kleindorfer (2005), Fu, Lee, and Teo (2010), Pei, Simchi-Levi, and Tunca (2011), among others, study the option contacts procurement in the presence of a spot market. Their focus is on option contract design.

Some papers study dual sourcing problem from a risk management perspective. Seifert, Thonemann, and Hausman (2004) show that a risk-averse firm who uses spot markets can offer a higher expected service level, but might experience a higher variability in profits. Martínez-de-Albéniz and Simchi-Levi (2005) characterize a quantity bound using maximum-expectation and minimum-variance portfolios. Considering the effect of market liquidity, Xing, Wang, and Liu (2012) focus on the joint pricing and ordering problem for a risk-neutral or risk-averse buyer. Kouvelis, Li, and Ding (2013) study how firms use inventory and financial hedging to reduce the price and demand risk in a multi-period setting. Dong and Liu (2007) study forward contracting in the presence of spot markets in a Nash bargaining process. They find that the prevalence of forward contract is mainly due to its risk-hedging benefits. Different from the above papers, the upstream and downstream firms in our model have to make joint ordering/production and pricing decisions in a Stackelberg game setting. We also study how the participants use the channel and pricing strategies to reap benefits of spot trading while controlling their risk exposures.

The second stream of literature focuses on joint ordering/production and pricing decisions. Petruzzi and Dada (1999), Bernstein and Federgruen (2005), Raz and Porteus (2006), Song, Ray, and Li (2008), among others, study one firm’s joint decision problem in a price-dependent stochastic setting. Weng (1997) and Wang, Jiang, and Shen (2004) study the pricing and inventory issue in a decentralized supply chain, considering the pricing and inventory decisions of only one supply chain member. Zhao and Wang (1997) and Ray, Li, and Song (2005) allow both channel partners to make pricing and inventory/production decisions as we do. There are also studies on combined pricing and ordering strategy of a risk-averse newsvendor. For example, Chen, Xu, and Zhang (2009) use CVaR as risk criteria. Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) model risk aversion with the general utility function. Their model is extended to a multi-period setting in Chen, Sim, Simchi-Levi, and Sun (2007). Different from these papers, our study incorporates the effect of spot market and players’ risk-aversion in a decentralized price-sensitive setting. Each of these two characteristics has significant effects on managerial decisions and reveals different and interesting insights.

Consider a decentralized supply chain of a supplier and a manufacturer with a fully liquid spot market. The supplier (she) produces a commodity-like product (intermediate), which can be sold to the manufacturer through the contract as well as in the spot market. The manufacturer (he) uses the intermediate as a one-to-one input to produce a product he sells in the final product market. Before the selling season, the supplier decides on her planned output quantity Q available to the manufacturer for the targeted period and announces the contract price w. In response to the offer, the manufacturer must decide on the contract (ordering) quantity q and the selling price of its final product p. The contracted quantity is shipped to the manufacturer at the beginning of the selling period. During the selling season, the supplier will sell her remaining intermediate (not ordered by the manufacturer) in the spot market. The manufacturer produces the final product and sells it in the final product market. He can also purchases his shortfall or sells his excessive intermediate inventory in the spot market. Here, we only consider a wholesale-price contract which is common in many commodity products. We assume that: once the targeted period starts, the manufacturer cannot reorder from the supplier for this period and the selling price of the final product remains fixed. We further assume that regardless of the realized spot price, the manufacturer should meet all the demand in the final product market. This means that the manufacturer should procure the shortage from the spot market if the demand is higher than his contract quantity, or satisfy the demand in the final product market first before selling any extra stock in the spot market. The interactions between the supplier and the manufacturer form a Stackelberg game, in which the supplier is the leader and the manufacturer is the follower. We do not consider the information issue in this paper so that symmetric information between the supplier and the manufacturer is assumed.

The manufacturer faces a linear demand in the final product market:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              D
                              =
                              d
                              -
                              bp
                              ,
                           
                        
                     where random variable d is the potential demand (or market base) in the final product market, and parameter b is positive and measures customers’ price sensitivity. This linear demand function form is sufficiently simple for analytical tractability, and it has been widely used in the existing literature for studying joint pricing and ordering decisions, e.g., Petruzzi and Dada (1999), Wang et al. (2004).

Usually, demand in the final product market is driven by the overall demand trend. If the demand is high in the final product market, the spot price of the intermediate usually goes up, and vice versa. Thus, final product demand and spot price of the intermediate are usually positively correlated (Seifert et al., 2004). For model tractability, we assume that d and s follow a bivariate normal distribution with a correlation coefficient

                     . Normal distribution is commonly used in the literature, e.g., Seifert et al. (2004) and Boyabath et al. (2011). To deal with the problem of a possible negative value, we further assume that the standard deviations of the normal random variables are relatively small compared with their means. In reality, spot price fluctuation in one period usually does not exceed a certain level.

While seeking profit maximization, the supplier and manufacturer also need to limit their risk exposures in the spot market. In the current paper, we explicitly incorporate the players’ risk tolerances in the decision models. Let

                     . The manufacturing (processing) cost per unit for the final product is a constant, for simplicity, we normalize it to zero, which will not affect our analysis result. Since we focus on the perishable commodity or service, we further assume that neither the supplier nor the manufacturer will hold any surplus beyond the targeted period. These assumptions also help the analytical tractability of the model. The manufacturer maximizes his utility by setting the selling price of the final product and deciding the contract order quantity subject to the supplier’s output constraint (planned output). Thus, as a participant in the spot market, the manufacturer’s decision problem (MDP) is

                      is assumed increasing and convex. The convexity of the production cost function is also widely used in the literature to model production diseconomy, e.g., Anand and Aron (2003) and Ha, Tong, and Zhang (2011). In the commodity examples, it can be explained by more expensive capacity, financial constraint, and labor overtime. In the sea cargo case, the time of port operations caps the ship size, especially for short routes (Christiansen, Fagerholt, Nygreen, & Ronen, 2007). The variance of the supplier’s profit can be computed as follows:

The sum of the first two terms on the right hand side of (5) can be considered a weighted average of the two reference prices or procurement costs and serves as a base price.

This analysis reveals that the manufacturer’s pricing and procurement strategies are affected by the manufacturer’s risk attitude and spot price volatility through λ and ν. We verify that the contract quantity sensitivity ν and the price sensitivity λ are decreasing in

                     . The manufacturer is less sensitive to the contract price if he is more risk-averse or if the price volatility in the spot market is very high. In this situation, the manufacturer reduces exposure to the spot market and relies more on the contract procurement. Conversely, with a relatively stable spot market, the contract quantity is more sensitive to the contract price, as the spot market provides the manufacturer with a good alternative channel to buy or sell.

The availability of a B2B spot market brings values to the members of a supply chain, and also changes the supply chain structure. Several questions should be asked. How does the supplier (manufacturer) make sale channel (procurement portfolio) decision? What is the effect of the spot market on the supplier’s pricing and production strategy, and should she set the contract price higher or lower than the expected spot price? To address these questions, we use a quadratic cost function,

                      and average production cost 
                        
                           AVC
                           (
                           Q
                           )
                           =

                     . A more general production cost function should include a linear term. However, the linear term can be normalized to zero by redefining the demand intercept of the final product market, and the following results still hold.

Three different channel strategies are available to the supplier: contract sales only (CO), both contract sales and spot market sales (CS), and spot sales only (SO). For the problem setting in this study, the main purpose of the supplier is to sell most of her output or capacity out and not to speculate in the spot market (Kleindorfer & Wu (2003)). Assuming selling a contract by the manufacturer to the supplier is not reasonable. Therefore, we assume that the supplier and the manufacturer only use the spot market separately when a contract cannot be agreed between them, i.e., the SO channel strategy.

Since the supplier easily identifies her partner’s type due to the long-term relationship, and can use some tools to compute the expected spot price, such as the method provided by Seifert et al. (2004), we define four regions in terms of the expected spot price and the risk attitude of the manufacturer to simplify the discussion of the supplier’s channel strategy:

                        , the CO strategy is optimal. A more risk-averse manufacturer depends more on the contract procurement, and the lower expected spot price suppresses the supplier’s output. This is why the CO strategy is the best choice for the supplier. Thus,

                        , the CS strategy or the dual-channel strategy becomes optimal. In this case, the higher expected spot price stimulates the supplier to increase her output, at the same time, the supplier uses the contract sale to obtain a part of risk-free profit, while participates in the spot market for additional profit.

                              , a supplier–manufacturer supply chain will always utilize the contract transaction.
                           

When the price sensitivity in the final product market is relatively large, contract transaction will always be maintained by the supply chain members. The condition

                         is a sufficient condition guaranteeing the availability of the contract trading. When the spot price is sufficiently volatile, the supply chain members cannot fully depend on the spot market, and maintain the contract transaction to control their risk exposures.

The S-switching curve appears to be affected by the supplier’s risk attitude. The following corollary analyzes how the supplier’s risk attitude affects the channel choice strategy.
                           Corollary 2
                           
                              A more risk-averse supplier is more likely to adopt the CS strategy when the manufacturer is not sufficiently risk-averse, that is,

                         can be considered the marginal value of the perceived risk seen by the supplier for one additional unit to be sold in the spot market. Therefore at the equilibrium production quantity, the marginal production cost equals the perceived marginal revenue. The equilibrium production quantity reaches its maximum

                         by the value of the perceived risk, and the equilibrium production quantity is also lower.

We are also interested in examining the motive that drives the supplier’s pricing strategy. The motive can be examined from either a cost-based perspective or a market-driven perspective. Eq. (15) shows that the supplier should use her average variable cost

The cost-based pricing strategy is useful for the internal rationalization of a specific price. However, the market-driven pricing strategy may help us better understand how the spot market affects the participants’ decisions.

                           Remark 1
                           To control the risk exposure and reap the benefits of the spot market, the supplier should adopt an integrated channel and pricing strategy according to an optimal policy structure defined by the manufacturer’s risk attitude and the expected spot price, as illustrated in Fig. 2

                              , a contract-only and high-price strategy should be followed. The supplier will only produce for the contract sale as the expected spot price is relative low.

In practice, if a supplier (manufacturer) is large and well-diversified, she (he) may behave risk-neutral in the market. How do the equilibrium strategies respond to these two special situations?

This proposition reveals that the supplier will set her contract price equal to the expected spot price for a near risk-neutral manufacturer and to improve her utility. Interestingly, the equilibrium production quantity in this case is the same as in the case when the supplier is risk-neutral, since a risk-neutral manufacturer is anticipated to procure the supplier’s entire output as long as the contract price is not higher than the expected spot price.

For the manufacturer, the spot market serves as the secondary procurement channel in

                        . The base selling price of the final product and the demand risk-adjusted margin have opposite effects on the manufacturer’s pricing strategy. A less risk-averse manufacturer sets a lower base price because of the lower procurement cost but sets a higher demand risk-adjusted margin. Conversely, a more risk-averse manufacturer sets a lower demand risk-adjusted margin and a higher base price. Therefore, the manufacturer’s pricing strategy is a tradeoff between lowering procurement cost and controlling demand risk.

To further understand the equilibrium decisions, we discuss how risk attitudes and market uncertainties affect the behavior and dynamics of the supplier and the manufacturer, respectively. Comparing with a pure contract model, we also show how the presence of spot market affects the equilibrium results. We focus on the case in which the supplier adopts the CS strategy.

A more risk-averse supplier is more inclined to take measures to limit her risk exposure in the spot market, including lowering her contract price to enable more contract sales and/or lowering her output quantity to avoid having to sell a substantial quantity in the spot market. Knowing this tendency, a manufacturer should order more as the contract price would be lower, and he should set a lower selling price to sell more in the final product market. The following proposition verifies this intuition.

To set an appropriate contract price, a risk-averse supplier should balance two opposite intentions. One is to set a higher contract price for a higher profit margin from the contract trading. The other is to hedge her risk exposure by setting a lower contract price to increase contract sale. Fig. 3(a) shows that

                         is a trade off of these two different intentions. When the manufacturer is relatively more risk-averse, the first intention dominates the second, and then the contract price increases in

                         decreases to a certain level, the first intention weakens while the second strengthens, and the contract price decreases in

                        . Therefore, a risk-averse supplier can always set a contract price favorable to herself by appropriately balancing profit margin and risk sharing according to the manufacturer’s risk attitude. Although the supplier’s risk attitude has a negative effect on the selling price of the final product (Proposition 3), this effect is insignificant, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The manufacturer’s risk attitude has a significant effect on the selling price because the demand risk-adjusted margin plays a major role in determining the selling price.


                        Fig. 3(c) confirms Proposition 2: When the manufacturer is near risk-neutral, the supplier achieves the maximum production quantity. A risk-averse supplier always produces less than a risk-neutral supplier, as discussed in Section 5.2. Fig. 3(d) shows that when the supplier is risk-averse, the manufacturer’s equilibrium contract quantity decreases sharply when

                           Remark 2
                           The joint pricing and ordering decision of a risk-averse firm has been studied in the literature. For example, using the increasing and concave utility function, Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) show that a risk-averse firm will charge a lower price if the price only affects the location of the demand distribution. Chen et al. (2009) also obtain a similar result using CVaR to measure the risk-averse behavior. Our study shows that this result still holds in a supply chain with a spot market using the mean–variance framework. In summary, while the effect of the spot price variability and the supplier’s risk attitude on the optimal selling price of the final product is weak, the negative effect of the demand uncertainty and the manufacturer’s risk attitude on the selling price is significant. The equilibrium order quantity increases in the supplier’s risk attitude and the demand uncertainty. The impact of the manufacturer’s risk attitude on the equilibrium order quantity also depends on the value of the supplier’s risk attitude.

Next, we examine the effects of market uncertainties on the supplier and manufacturer’s performances. Fig. 5
                        (a) shows that the supplier’s performance is the worst when the demand uncertainty in the final product market is low and the spot price volatility is high. As the supplier sells through the contract as well as in the spot market, lower demand uncertainty in the final product market gives the manufacturer greater market power in contract trading. At the same time, the volatile spot market also hurts the supplier. However, the supplier will utilize the manufacturer’s adverse position (with a large value of

                        ) to extract a higher utility. We also notice that when both uncertainties are high, the supplier can extract a relatively higher utility. Fig. 5(b) shows that

We now analyze a pure contract case without the presence of a spot market, and use superscript B to denote this benchmark setting. We assume that the supplier produces the intermediate according to the manufacturer’s contract quantity. This is reasonable because in reality suppliers seldomly sell their products directly into salvage markets. Therefore, the supplier’s profit becomes

                        Seifert et al. (2004) provide some analytical results to a similar model. However, our model setting differs in that the manufacturer jointly decides the contract quantity and the selling price of the final product to maximize his utility, i.e.,

                         in our example). The spot trading improves the manufacturer’s expected profit in both the contract and spot markets. In the contract market, the manufacturer benefits from the lower contract price, and in the spot market, he benefits from the lower spot procurement cost or the speculative trading. However, the spot trading has two opposite effects on the supplier’s expected profit. On the one hand, the spot trading reduces the supplier’s expected profit in the contract market due to the lower contract price. On the other hand, the supplier can improve her expected profit by selling a part of intermediate in the spot market.

                         in our example, the spot trading reduces the supplier’s expected profit less in the contract market since she has more market power in the contract trading, and the first effect is dominated by the second. This is why the spot trading improves the supplier’s expected profit when the demand uncertainty is relatively high.


                        Fig. 6(b) shows that the spot trading always brings greater risk exposures to both the supplier and the manufacturer, and the manufacturer faces a greater risk exposure than the supplier. The manufacturer faces both the price risk from the spot market and the demand risk from the final product market, but the supplier only faces the price risk. We further find that the manufacturer improve his utility through the spot trading for the whole range of the demand uncertainty we examined (from

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We study the decentralized decisions of a risk-averse supplier and a risk-averse manufacturer in the presence of a fully liquid B2B spot market. Formulating the problem as a Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader, we can derive the unique equilibrium strategies analytically. Incorporating the notion of risk in the model, we gain insights into how participants’ risk attitudes affect their strategies under various market environments in demand uncertainty and price volatility. The central question analyzed is how the spot market affects the pricing and ordering/production strategies of the supply chain members.

We find that when the manufacturer is relatively more risk-averse, relational contract is always needed in the supply chain. As the expected spot price increases, the supplier first changes her channel strategy from contract-sales only to dual-channel, and then alters from high-price strategy to low-price strategy. However, if the manufacturer is less risk-averse, spot trading is always adopted by both supply chain members. It is optimal for the players to adopt dual channel and low-pricing strategy if the expected spot price is high, and trade separately in the spot market if the expected spot price is relatively low. By adjusting pricing, quantity and channel strategies, supply chain members effectively reap the benefit of spot trading and control their risk exposure.

We conclude that rather than serving simply as a secondary channel, the spot market also serves as a strategic tool for both the supplier and the manufacturer. If one supply chain member has a disadvantage facing a volatile market, the other member can exploit it to gain a favorable position in the contract trading. For example, when the manufacturer faces more demand uncertainty in the final product market, he will depend more on the contract procurement to avoid additional risk caused by spot procurement. The supplier then can exploit these disadvantages to gain a favorable position in the contract trading. Conversely, if the supplier is more risk-averse, she has to set a lower contract price to sell more via contract. However, the equilibrium contract price first decreases and then increases in the manufacturer’s risk attitude and the spot price volatility if the supplier is also risk-averse. Thus, the decrease in spot price volatility may not necessarily be good news for a supply chain member. Furthermore, a risk-averse supplier should have a strong incentive to improve her risk management capability. This is not true for the manufacturer. Changing risk-attitude on either direction may induce aggressive contract pricing by the supplier. The selling price of the final product is a tradeoff of the procurement cost and risks. The manufacturer’s risk attitude and demand uncertainty have a significant downward effect on the selling price of the final product, whereas the effect of the supplier’s risk attitude and the volatility of the spot price on the selling price is very mild.

One limitation of our model is that we assume all the parameters are common knowledge. In practice, the supply chain members may have the private information on the demand uncertainty, the spot price volatility and his own risk-type. For example, the manufacturer may have more information about the demand variability, whereas the supplier has more incentive to acquire information on the spot price. Further, a revenue-care type manufacturer pays more attention to the demand side uncertainty, but a cost-care type manufacturer is more sensitive to the supply side volatility. An interesting topic for future research is to extend our model to consider the effect of asymmetric information. Another limitation is that we do not consider the competition in the upstream and/or downstream firms. The market competition directly affects the pricing strategy of the players. Therefore, a possible future research direction is determining the role of a spot market under different supply chain structures, e.g., multiple manufacturers and a single supplier or multiple suppliers and a single manufacturer.
