                  We developed a mechanical tissue model containing a cell with cytoskeletal filaments inside to investigate how tissue deformation is reflected in the deformation of a cell and its internal cytoskeletal filaments. Tissue that assumes a collagen gel construct was depicted as an isotropic linear elastic material, and the cell was modeled as an assembly of discrete elements including a cell membrane, nuclear envelope, and cytoskeletal filaments. Mechanical behaviors were calculated based on the minimum energy principle. The results demonstrated the effects of the type of tissue deformation on deformations of cytoskeletal filaments. The distribution of strains of cytoskeletal filaments was skewed toward compression when a tissue was stretched, toward stretch when the tissue was compressed, and almost normal when the tissue was sheared. The results also addressed the dependency of deformations of a cell and cytoskeletal filaments on the ratio of the Young’s modulus of a tissue to that of a cell. Upon tissue stretching, cell strain increased and the distribution of strains of cytoskeletal filaments broadened on both stretch and compression sides with an increase in the Young’s modulus ratio. This suggested that the manner of tissue deformation and the tissue/cell Young’s modulus ratio are reflected in the distribution pattern of strains of cytoskeletal filaments. The present model is valuable to understanding the mechanisms of cellular responses in a tissue.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A biological tissue is capable of changing its structure, characteristics, and functions in response to external mechanical stimuli. This change is called tissue remodeling and results from the responses of cells within tissues [1]. Past studies have demonstrated that tissues remodel differently according to the manner and strength of the applied mechanical loads [2,3]. By utilizing such functions of tissue remodeling, attempts have been made to construct engineered tissues. For example, Webb et al. [1] cultured human tracheal fibroblasts on a polyurethane scaffold with repeated stretching of the scaffold by a strain of 0.1 at a frequency of 0.25Hz. Reportedly, the construct cultured with stretching displayed greater elastic modulus than that cultured with no load. Garvin et al. [4] cultured avian flexor tendon cells within a collagen gel for eight days while applying a cyclic stretch of 1% at 1Hz for one hour per day. As a result, the tensile strength of the collagen gel construct cultured with the mechanical load was nearly three times greater than that cultured without load.

Mechanical loads applied to a tissue cause deformations of resident cells. They are transmitted immediately to the inside of cells through cytoskeletal filaments that interact extensively and intimately with the cell membrane [5–7]. In response to changes in external mechanical environments, cytoskeletons reorganize themselves, which results in an alteration of the shape [8], orientation [9,10], stiffness [11], and viscoelastic properties [8] of the cells. The sensitivity of these cellular responses appears to depend on the angle of the applied deformation with respect to the orientation of bundles of actin filaments, one of the cytoskeletal elements [12]. It was also shown that cytoskeletal arrangements significantly affect the strains in the nucleus, given shear deformation to the tissue [13]. Taking account of those facts, we hypothesize that the cellular responses to mechanical stimuli emerge as the collective responses of cytoskeletal filaments.

The understanding of basic characteristics of collective cytoskeletal responses with cell deformation is critical to gain mechanical insights into the mechanism of cellular responses. However, despite recent advances in imaging techniques, it is still difficult to visualize how the structure of cytoskeletons varies when the tissue having a cell inside is deforming. The experimental drawbacks emphasize on the necessity to develop a mechanical tissue model which enables the visualization of cytoskeletal behavior and the quantification of their mechanics during a tissue deformation. In the previous study, we developed a mechanical model of a tissue having a cell inside that consists of a cell membrane, nuclear envelope, and cytoskeletal filaments (CSKs) [14]. The results demonstrated that even if the same deformation was applied to a tissue that assumes a collagen gel construct, the degree of cellular and CSKs deformations appeared to differ depending on the initial orientation of CSKs. In order to gain further insight into the multi-scale physics involved in the hierarchical system of tissue, cell and cytoskeletons, we studied how the behaviors of CSKs inside a cell vary if the Young’s modulus ratio of a tissue to a cell and mechanical loads applied to a tissue change.

We use a mechano-cell model, which is capable of expressing the deformation behavior of a cell during mechanical tests as a model of a cell within a tissue [14–18]. Details of the computational model have been described by Ujihara et al. [15]. Briefly, the model consists of three main components: a cell membrane (CM), a nuclear envelope (NE), and cytoskeletal filaments (CSKs), as depicted in 
                        Fig. 1(a).

The CM and NE are layers of lipids supported by cytoskeletal networks. The cytoskeletal networks are known to resist in-plane deformation such as stretching or compressing. Because both lipid bilayer and cytoskeletal networks have a finite thickness, they resist bending. Moreover, because the number of lipids on the CM and NE would not change drastically over a finite period of cell deformation, the lipid bilayer offers resistance to changes in membrane area. Thus, the mechanical nature of the CM and NE is expressed by a fluidic lipid bilayer and an elastic cytoskeletal network in a mutually complementary manner.

To express these mechanical properties, we represented both the CM and NE as a spherical shell of spring networks. The spherical cell assumes the one at the onset of culture when it is just harvested in a gel. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the CM and NE were divided into small triangular meshes. Nodes were linked by a spring (spring constant, k
                           
                              s
                           ) that gives rise to resistance to stretching or compressing. Neighboring elements were connected with a bending spring (spring constant, k
                           
                              b

                            is the contact angle between neighboring elements. To express the resistance to change in the surface area of the CM and NE, potential functions for the area were introduced. Both the resistance to change in the surface area of the whole membrane and that in an area of a local element were considered. The former corresponds to the situation where lipid molecules can move freely over the cytoskeletal network. The latter corresponds to the situation where the movement of lipid molecules is restricted to a local element. To account for the whole area change and local area change, we defined the potential functions W

In the present study, we assumed the situation where a cell is just seeded in collagen gel construct. Under this assumption, cytoskeletal filaments in the cell are not aligned in a particular direction. Based on this assumption, CSKs were randomly chosen without overlap from all possible candidates of CSKs that were created by connecting two nodes on the CM. Because cytoskeletal networks lie beneath the CM is modeled as a part of CM, CSKs that were made by connecting adjacent nodes were excluded. Based on Hooke’s law, a potential energy W

Because the cytoplasm is present between the CM and NE, the NE is received forces by the movement of the cytoplasm in accordance with the deformation of the CM. Based on the consideration that the cytoplasm is composed mostly of a cytosol that has highly-fluidic nature, we modeled the physical interaction with the CM and NE via a cytoplasm as a potential function, Ψ with respect to the distance between them for the sake of simplicity. Mathematically, it is given by

In the present study, we assumed a tissue as a collagen gel construct. Although a tissue is essentially anisotropic due to the presence of collagen fibers, here we modeled it as a linear isotropic material in order to simplify the problem. This assumption corresponds to the onset of culture where a tissue is just a gel. The tissue geometry analyzed here is depicted in Fig. 1(b), where the upper half of the tissue has been removed to visualize the inside. The tissue was cubic with the length of each line, 2a, of 100μm. The tissue was hollowed spherically at its center to embed a cell. For further modeling, a Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) was instituted at the origin, with O defined at the center of the tissue. Three axes (x, y, z) were defined along the line connecting the origin O with the center of an edge face of the tissue (see Fig. 1(b)). The tissue model consists of solid finite elements. The tissue region was divided into first-order tetrahedral meshes such that nodal points and elements on the cell surface coincided with those on the tissue at their boundary. As a result, the nodal points at the boundary between cell and tissue had both natures of a cell and tissue. A strain energy density function at element i, Wi

In our previous study [14], we investigate the strain transmission from a tissue to CSKs only when the tissue was uni-axial stretched. In the present work, to understand basic characteristics of collective CSKs responses with tissue deformation, three types of basic deformation, namely, uni-axial stretch, uni-axial compression, and pure shear, were applied to a tissue, as illustrated in 
                        Fig. 3. Imagine a cubic object made of an incompressible elastic material with line length of 2a and the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) defined at the center of the object with their axes being perpendicular to face the center of the cube. When the object is stretched by stretch ratio λ

                        Similarly, when the object is compressed in the z-axis by λ

                         are expressed as Eq. (20) where the object deforms such that it is expanded in x and y directions. The uni-axial compression is equivalent to equi-biaxial stretch if frictions at compressive surfaces are neglected. Pure shear deformation is achieved by stretching the object by λ

                        inside the object. The pure shear is also known by the names “constrained tension” [19]. Hereinafter, these deformations are simply referred to as stretch, compression and shear.

In the actual simulations, stretch was applied to the tissue by moving nodes at z=a in the direction of positive z while fixing nodes at z=−a. For compression, nodes at z=a were moved in the direction of negative z while nodes at z=−a were fixed. In stretch and compression, nodes at z=−a and a were constrained in the z direction, but free in the x and y directions. Shear deformation was simulated by moving nodes at z=a in the direction of positive z, fixing those at z=−a. In addition, y-displacements of nodes at y=−a and a were constrained, and nodes at x=−a and a were moved in the x direction such that the tissue volume was constant.

To investigate essential features of collective responses of cytoskeletal filaments following tissue deformation, the existence probability P of CSK strain was calculated by counting the number of CSKs having a specified strain at intervals of 0.003 between −0.15 and 0.15, and dividing this by the total number of CSKs, N

                        =10 was subjected to a tensile strain (a) obtained from the previous simulation [14], a compressive strain (b), and a shear strain (c) of 0.1. Color in tissue elements represents the first principal stress. As shown, the cell and the tissue deformed in the same fashion. The first principal stress of local elements around the cell differed from the value of the global tissue.


                        
                        Fig. 5 shows a histogram of the existence probability P of CSK strains when a tissue of E

                        =10 was deformed with a tensile strain (a) obtained from the previous simulation [14], a compressive strain (b), and a shear strain (c) of 0.1. A broken line in Fig. 5 indicates the mean CSK strain. As shown in Fig. 5(a), when the stretch was applied, the histogram was relatively skewed toward the compression side. The number of stretched and compressed CSKs was 92 (46%) and 108 (54%), respectively, meaning that there were more compressed CSKs than stretched ones. In this case, the CSK strain ranged from −0.0533 to 0.116. The direction of skewing changed to a stretched direction when the tissue was compressed. There were more stretched CSKs than compressed ones (117 (58.5%) versus 83 (51.5%), respectively), and the CSK strain ranged from −0.107 to 0.0507. With shear deformation, the CSK strain ranged from −0.0940 to 0.122, and the distribution was almost symmetric around a strain of 0. The mean CSK strain was 0.0058 for stretching, −0.0013 for compression, and 0.0011 for shear deformation.

In addition, although the tissue was stretched, there were more compressed CSKs than stretched ones. Fig. 7 also demonstrates a skewed distribution of CSK strains, in which stretched CSKs are distributed uniformly from zero to the maximum strain, whereas compressed ones were distributed more narrowly.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the present study, we developed a mechanical tissue model containing a cell with CSKs inside on the basis of the minimum energy principle to predict how tissue deformation is reflected in the deformation of a cell and its internal cytoskeletal filaments. The cell model used here was developed in our previous study [15]. Its validity was demonstrated by a comparison of that the cell shape and the load-deformation curves obtained from the simulation with the experimental data [16–18]. A tissue was described with an isotropic material under the assumption that a tissue is collagen gel. Employment of the Green-Lagrangean strain including the second order term achieved the description of geometric nonlinearity that occurred in large deformations. Although the validity of the combined model of the cell and tissue is not fully demonstrated and assumptions were made for the way of a contact between a cell and a tissue, the model still gives some important insights into interactive behaviors between a tissue, a cell and its internal structures.

Understanding of mechanical behaviors of cells and cytoskeletons with tissue deformations is essential in the research of cellular responses to mechanical stimuli. Although recent advancements in experimental modalities enable us to visualize intracellular phenomena even at molecular levels, dynamics analysis of mechanical behaviors of cells and cytoskeletons during tissue deformation remains a challenging task solely on the basis of experimental approaches. The computational model developed here involves many simplifications, for instance, linear elastic modeling of cytoskeletal filaments. However, the model provided valuable information on CSK deformations and internal loading conditions in the tissue, which are not easily obtained with experiments. As shown in the results, the manner of tissue deformation and the tissue/cell Young’s modulus ratio are reflected in the pattern of the distribution of CSK strains. Discussions below mainly highlight the pattern of the distribution of CSK strain that variously appeared for a different manner of tissue deformation and for a different tissue/cell Young׳s modulus ratio.

As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the distribution of CSK strains varied with the mode of cell deformations; it was skewed toward compression when a tissue was stretched, skewed toward stretching when compressed, and almost symmetrical when sheared. Furthermore, even when the tissue was stretched with the same strain, the distribution of CSK strains changed drastically according to the Young’s modulus ratio of the tissue to that of the cell. Interestingly, regardless of the deformation mode of a cell and the Young’s modulus ratio, the mean CSK strain was always nearly zero, which was not the same as both the strain of a cell and tissue in any cases studied here. Actually, it is impossible to gain insight into behaviors of cytoskeletal filaments solely from the magnitude and directions of a load applied to a tissue and the cell shape; these findings underscore the importance of analyzing deformations of individual cytoskeletal filaments.

As shown in this study, the distribution of CSK strains following tissue stretching varied significantly with the Young’s modulus ratio of the tissue to that of the cell. Regardless of the Young’s modulus ratio, the CSK strains did not show a normal distribution. It is therefore difficult to discuss the distribution of strains of cytoskeletal filaments using means or other statistical measures. To date, the relationship between heterogeneous distributions of strains of cytoskeletal filaments and cellular responses to mechanical stimuli remains unknown. Nevertheless, taking into account experimental evidence that cytoskeletons are involved in the transmission of mechanical signals [9,12,23] and spontaneously alter their structures [24–26] in response to mechanical stimuli, we conclude that the cytoskeletal behaviors reported in this study provide useful information to gaining insight into the mechanisms by which living cells distinguish various modes of mechanical stimuli and sense the direction of stresses acting on cells.

The analysis of the distribution of CSK strains demonstrated that there are compressed CSKs in a stretched cell (Figs. 5 and 7). As shown in Fig. 8, the deformation manner of CSKs is dependent on their alignment within a cell; CSKs that align parallel to the stretched direction of the tissue are tensed, whereas those aligned perpendicular to the stretched direction are compressed. This is attributable to the Poisson effect in which tissue stretching causes the cell to become wider in the direction of the tensile load and shorter laterally. Thus, even though a uni-axial stretch is applied to the tissue and cell, some CSKs are subjected to compression. Further analysis of the distribution of CSKs strains revealed that the number of compressed CSKs is greater than that of tensed CSKs This is simply due to the three-dimensionality of deformation in which a cell is stretched in one direction (z-direction) and compressed in two directions (x and y directions).

The cytoskeletons are dynamically reorganized in response to a mechanical stimulus. When a cell-embedded 3D tissue is mechanically stretched, it was observed that cells and cytoskeletal filaments align along the axis of stretching [27–29]. The alignment of cell and cytoskeletal filaments would be a result of cytoskeletal remodeling. The remodeling starts with disassembly of cytoskeletons. Costa et al. [30] cultured human aortic endothelial cells on pre-stretched silicone rubber substrates and quickly released the substrates to cause buckling of stress fibers aligned in the shortening direction in adherent cells. As a consequence, stress fibers were disassembled within 10s. Sato et al. [25] applied compressive deformation to osteoblastic cells by uni-axially releasing a pre-stretched silicon rubber substrate, and speculated that the compressive strain, not in the whole cell body but in a stress fiber, was important to induce its disassembly. Moreover, Sato et al. [31] selectively shortened in a targeted stress fiber of a single osteoblast-like cell, and showed that only the shortened stress fibers were selectively disassembled, although biochemical signals, such as intracellular calcium signaling, were activated in the entire cell body. These experimental results demonstrated highly dynamic cytoskeletal responses to the mechanical environment to which it is exposed, and the occurrence of disassembling of cytoskeletons when they are subjected to compression. According to the present study, CSKs lying perpendicular to the stretched direction before deformation were compressed, when the tissue was stretched. Taking account of this result, we infer that the alignment of cytoskeletal filaments in the stretched direction of a substrate and tissue observed in Gauvin et al. [27], Henshaw et al. [28] and Nieponice et al. [29] is a net result of disassembling of cytoskeletal filaments that lied perpendicular to the stretch.

Regardless of the ratio of the Young׳s modulus of a tissue to that of a cell, upon stretching of a tissue, the absolute value of the maximum tensile strain was greater than that of compressive strain (Fig. 7). When a tissue undergoes uni-axial stretching, a spherical cell is elongated in the stretched direction. Concomitantly, because of the Poisson effect, a cell is compressed in the other two directions perpendicular to the direction of cell elongation. In such a case, the degree of deformation of a cell in the compressed direction is less than that in the stretched direction. If the cell is stretched by λ, it contracts by a factor of λ
                     −0.5 for incompressibility. As a consequence, compressed CSKs were present in a narrower range of strain than stretched CSKs. The maximum values of compressive and tensile strains result from such a deformation manner of a cell.

As illustrated in Figs. 5 and 7, the mean CSK strain was almost zero, regardless of the deformation mode of tissues and the Young’s modulus ratio. This is attributable to two factors. First, CSKs in the present cell model are randomly distributed within the cell. Second, cell deformation is constrained by an energy function of volume, meaning that the volume strain of a cell is nearly zero. Although each CSK deforms at various stretch ratios depending on its location and alignment within a cell, the mean CSK strain became nearly zero as a consequence of these two factors.

Garvin et al. [4] reported that the Young’s modulus of collagen gel constructs containing cells and cultured under cyclic stretching was three times greater than that cultured under no load. This indicates that the mechanical properties of a collagen gel construct changes in response to mechanical loads applied to the construct during culture. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the strain transfer ratio (STR) increased drastically with an increase in E
                     
                        t
                     /E
                     
                        c
                      when the Young’s modulus of tissue (E
                     
                        t
                     ) was smaller than that of a cell (E
                     
                        c
                     ). In contrast, when E
                     
                        t
                      was larger than E
                     
                        c
                     , an increase of STR was gradual and it converged to a certain value. Therefore, when the Young’s modulus of a developing tissue is smaller than that of a cell, it is necessary to delicately control the strength of the load applied to the tissue, since STR varies sensitively with the development of tissue. On the other hand, when the Young’s modulus of a tissue was larger than that of a cell, STR did not vary so much with the development of tissue. Thus, in this case, it is speculated that careful adjustment of the load applied to developing tissue would not be necessary, once the appropriate strength of a load is set.

At E
                     
                        t
                     /E
                     
                        c
                     =1, tissue strain ε
                     
                        t
                      is not equal to, but smaller than cell strain ε
                     
                        c
                     . In fact, the cell is a composite material consisting of various components including a cell membrane, cytoskeletons, and nucleus. Thus, an apparent Young’s modulus of a cell results from the interaction of these components. As described in Section 2.6, the current study estimated the Young’s modulus of a cell from the stress–strain relationship in the range of strain from 0 to 0.1 when the cell is stretched. Therefore, it is only the initial stage of stretching when this Young’s modulus is equal to the Young’s modulus of a tissue. In practice, with stretching of the tissue, the cell is elongated, which passively reorients intracellular CSKs to a stretching direction. This passive re-orientation of CSKs in the stretched direction gradually increases the elastic resistance of the cell against the stretched direction, thereby increasing the apparent Young’s modulus of a cell [15]. In other words, although CSKs in the present cell model were expressed by a linear elastic element, the cell as a whole appeared to have non-linear deformation properties. This is responsible for the cell strain being less than the tissue strain under the condition of E
                     
                        t
                     /E
                     
                        c
                     =1.

The present study assumed that the cell was spherical, CSKs were randomly distributed, and the tissue was a linear isotropic material. This condition corresponds to the situation of a cell at the onset of culture within a gel. In reality, while cultured over time, cytoskeletons, in particular stress fibers, develop and become aligned in one direction, which drives changes in cell shape. In fact, our previous paper showed that when CSKs were uni-directionally aligned, the mean CSK strain varied depending on the orientation of CSKs with respect to an applied deformation [14]. In addition, the extracellular matrix remodels such that they have structural and mechanical anisotropy [7]. Although these remodeling changes are not simulated here, the present model has the capability to include those changes that occur during culture. For instance, the mechanical anisotropy of the extracellular matrix or tissue can be expressed by substituting Eq. (12). Although the mathematical description of changes in cytoskeletal structures and material properties of the extracellular matrix in responses to external mechanical stimuli remains as a future task, the obtained data suggest the potential of the present model as a tool for analyzing the mechanics of a cell residing in tissue.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In the present study, we studied the mechanical interaction between a tissue, cell, and CSKs with various ratios the Young׳s modulus of a tissue to that of a cell when stretch, compression, and shear are applied to a tissue. The results demonstrated that the manner of tissue and cell deformation is reflected in the pattern of the distribution of CSK strains. These results would be valuable for understanding the mechanism of cellular responses that occur in a tissue, and the present model will provide a way of establishing new tissue engineering approaches on the basis of the analysis of strains of cytoskeletal filaments.
