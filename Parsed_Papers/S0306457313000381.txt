                  Most existing search engines focus on document retrieval. However, information needs are certainly not limited to finding relevant documents. Instead, a user may want to find relevant entities such as persons and organizations. In this paper, we study the problem of related entity finding. Our goal is to rank entities based on their relevance to a structured query, which specifies an input entity, the type of related entities and the relation between the input and related entities. We first discuss a general probabilistic framework, derive six possible retrieval models to rank the related entities, and then compare these models both analytically and empirically. To further improve performance, we study the problem of feedback in the context of related entity finding. Specifically, we propose a mixture model based feedback method that can utilize the pseudo feedback entities to estimate an enriched model for the relation between the input and related entities. Experimental results over two standard TREC collections show that the derived relation generation model combined with a relation feedback method performs better than other models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Traditional information retrieval models have mainly focused on finding documents relevant to an information need. However, information needs are certainly not limited to relevant documents. For example, a consumer may want to find cell phone carriers selling iPhones, or a conference PC chair may want to find potential reviewers who are knowledgeable in certain research areas. Although users could use existing IR systems to find relevant entities by going through every returned document and manually identifying the entities, the whole process would be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, it is necessary to study how to automatically retrieve entities, such as persons and organizations, that are relevant to a given query.

The problem of related entity finding is finding entities related to the information specified in a query. Unlike keyword queries used in document retrieval, an entity-related query needs to specify both the type and the relevance criteria of the target entities. Following the problem setup in the TREC Entity Track (Balog, de Vries, Serdyukov, Thomas, & Westerveld, 2010), a query for the related entity finding task is formulated as a structured query, which specifies an input entity, the type of the related entities to be found, and the relation between the input and the related entities. The goal is to find the related entities, which have the specified type and relation with the input entity, from a supporting document collection. For example, a user who wants to find ACM Athena award winners may formulate a query as shown in Fig. 1
                     , and this query specifies that the input entity is “ACM Athena award”, the type of related entities (i.e., target entities) is “person” and the relation is “winners of” (note that the narrative field is a mixture of input entity and relation), in a supporting document collection. The results are expected to include a list of the award winners such as “Deborah Estrin”, “Shafi Goldwasser” and “Karen Spärck Jones”.

The related entity finding problem can be naturally formulated as two subtasks: (1) candidate extraction, i.e., how to extract candidate entities based on the type specified in the query, and (2) candidate ranking, i.e., how to rank candidates according to their relevance to the query. While the first subtask can be solved using an off-the-shelf NER tagger or external resources such as DBPedia (McCreadie, Macdonald, Ounis, Peng, & Santos, 2010; Serdyukov & de Vries, 2010), the second subtask does not have any existing straightforward solution, and is thus more challenging.

In this paper, we focus on the second subtask, i.e., to rank candidate entities based on their relevance to a structured query. The main challenge is to leverage the structured query to estimate the probability that a candidate entity is relevant. Motivated by the general probabilistic frameworks proposed for traditional ad hoc retrieval (Lafferty & Zhai, 2003) and expert finding (Fang & Zhai, 2007), we derive six generative models for candidate entity ranking and then analytically and empirically compare these six functions. To further improve the performance, we study the problem of feedback in the context of related entity finding. In particular, we propose a novel mixture model based method that can utilize the pseudo feedback entities to estimate an enriched model for relation between the input and related entities. We conducted experiments on two standard TREC collections to evaluate the derived generative ranking models and the proposed relation-based feedback method.

We find that incorporating candidate priors is crucial to achieve reasonable retrieval performance. As a result, the retrieval models that can incorporate candidate priors are better choices than others since they are less sensitive to the quality of entity candidates. Furthermore, the proposed relation-based feedback methods are effective to further improve the retrieval performance.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We formulate the problem of related entity finding and present a general approach in Section 2. We discuss the proposed generative models in Section 3 and propose relation-based feedback method in Section 4. We discuss experiment results in Section 5, and discuss the related work in Section 6. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.

The problem of related entity finding is to find the entities that are related to the information described in a query based on a supporting document collection. Unlike keyword queries used in the traditional ad hoc retrieval task, queries used in the related entity finding task are structured as shown in Fig. 1. In particular, a query specifies the type of related entities, an input entity and the relation between the input and related entities.

It often requires a two-step approach to solve the problem of related entity finding. The first step is candidate extraction, which is to find all the candidate entities with the specified type, i.e., e
                     
                        t
                     
                     ∈
                     E
                     
                        t
                     . A simple solution is to directly apply an off-the-shelf NER tagger to extract candidate entities based on the specified type. The second step is candidate ranking, which is to further refine the candidate entities extracted in the first step and find those having the specified relation with the input entity, i.e,. e
                     
                        t
                     
                     ∈
                     E
                     
                        t
                     , where r(e
                     in,
                     e
                     
                        t
                     )=1.

In this paper, we focus on the candidate ranking step. Following the spirit of the probabilistic ranking principle (Robertson, 1977), we rank the candidate entities according to the probabilities that they are relevant to a query. Thus, the key challenge is how to estimate the probability of a candidate entity being relevant, i.e., how likely it has the specified relations r with the input entity e
                     in. Unlike keyword queries used in traditional retrieval tasks, we focus on deriving generative retrieval models and feedback method for the structured queries. The details are given in Section 3 and Section 4.

With a list of extracted candidate entities and the corresponding structured query, we now discuss how to assign a relevance score to each candidate based on the probability that the candidate has the specified relations with the input entity.

Given a query q

                        r} and a related entity candidate e

                           t
                        , we need to estimate the probability that e

                         is a binary random variable denoting the relevance. Following the previous studies (Fang & Zhai, 2007; Lafferty & Zhai, 2003) we may use the odds ratio to rank candidates and then apply Bayes’ rule for the estimation:

Now the challenge is how to factor the conditional probability 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    e
                                 
                                 
                                    in
                                 
                              
                              ,
                              r
                              ,
                              
                                 
                                    e
                                 
                                 
                                    t
                                 
                              
                              |
                              R
                              )
                           
                        . Since there are three variables involved, we may apply the chain rule in different ways based on their dependency relations shown in Fig. 2
                        . Each dependency relation corresponds to a generative process among these variables. As an example, RG (relation generation) model assumes that relations are generated from the input and target entities.

By comparing these models, we can make the following observations:
                           
                              •
                              The top three models (i.e. RG, IEG and QG) share a similar property that e
                                 
                                    t
                                  generates the other components, which enables us to incorporate a candidate-related prior for e
                                 
                                    t
                                 , while the other models cannot utilize the candidate priors.

Every pair of the models in the same column (i.e. RG and EG, IEG and RERG, QG and REG) would share some commonalities in the ranking functions because one component either generates the other two or is generated by the other two.

We now discuss the derivation of the six generative models. Since the derivations are similar, we provide the details only for RG model and briefly explain the derivations for the other models.

The RG model assumes that the relation between two entities is generated by a probabilistic model based on the entities (as shown in Fig. 2a). Thus, the conditional probability in Eq. (2) can be factored in the following ways:

However, one limitation is that the coverage of the knowledge base is not complete, which could lead to inaccurate estimation. In this paper, we instead propose to leverage supporting documents from the collection as a bridge to estimate the probability by exploiting the co-occurrences of these three variables (i.e., e

                        Table 1
                         summarizes all the six derived models when leveraging supporting documents for estimation. By comparing with the derivations of the six models above, we find that models in the same cell are similar to each other. Let us take QG and REG for example. The main difference to distinguish them is that QG contains a candidate normalizer, i.e.,

                              P

                                    t

                                    d

                              ,
                              R
                              =
                              1
                              )
                           
                        . Since the normalizer penalizes the popular candidates, we hypothesize that QG with uniform candidate prior may over-favor noisy candidates that occur less frequently in the supporting documents, which would lead to worse retrieval performance than REG if the noisy entity candidate ratio is high. Similar hypotheses can be made for the models in the other two cells. We conduct empirical evaluation in Section 5, and the empirical results are consistent with the hypotheses above.

We now describe how to estimate the conditional probability 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              X
                              |
                              d
                              ,
                              R
                              =
                              1
                              )
                           
                        , which essentially describes how likely X is “generated” from the observed document d. Here X may be individual query components (i.e. e
                        
                           t
                        , e
                        in and r), or the combinations between any two query components (i.e. {e
                        in,
                        r}, {e
                        
                           t
                        ,
                        r} and {e
                        in,
                        e
                        
                           t
                        }) where the combination is essentially the union of term sets from two query components. The conditional probability can be estimated with language modeling approach by representing both X and d as bags of terms. In this paper, we use Dirichlet smoothing method for the estimation since it has been shown to be more effective for the document retrieval problem (Zhai & Lafferty, 2001). Since our framework is rather general, other ways of estimating the models could also be applied. We will discuss how to utilize feedback information to better estimate

                        , i.e., UniPrior and OccPrior. Which one should we choose? It depends on whether the assumption (i.e., popular candidate entities tend to be relevant ones) holds. There are two types of noisy candidates in the candidate set: non-relevant entities and non-real-world entities. When a candidate set contains lots of noisy entities with the second type, i.e., those are not real entities, this assumption may not hold because those noisy candidates with common words might also occur very frequently. However, when a candidate set contains only the first type noisy entities, i.e., most of the candidates are real-world entities, the assumption would hold and the OccPrior is expected to improve the performance.

We now discuss the connections between the derived models and methods used in the top performed runs in the TREC Entity Track.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 REG is similar to the models used by Purdue (Fang, Yu, Xian, & Xu, 2009), PRIS (Wang et al., 2010) and NiCT (Wu & Kashioka, 2009; Wu, Hori & Kawai, 2010). The main differences come from the estimation of component functions. For example, Fang et al. proposed to estimate the relevance scores based on not only documents but also passages (Fang et al., 2009), Wang et al. tried to incorporate a document prior (Wang et al., 2010), and Wu. et al. utilized Wikipedia and term proximity in relevance modeling (Wu & Kashioka, 2009; Wu, Hori & Kawai, 2010).


                                 RG is similar to the models used by ICT (Zhai, Cheng, Guo, Xu & Liu, 2010; Cao et al., 2010) and University of Amsterdam Bron et al. (2010). The main difference is the estimation of candidate priors. For example, instead of relying on the collection, external resources such as DBPedia and Freebase were used to compute the prior, i.e., how likely a candidate has the specified type.


                                 REG and QG with uniform prior were studied in our previous work in the context of entity track (Zheng, Gottipati, Jiang, & Fang, 2010). However, the performance was not very satisfying because the quality of the candidate entity sets was low.

It is clear that our proposed framework is general enough to include three existing ranking methods as well as three new ones. Although some of these models have been studied, it remains unclear which ranking models are more effective based on TREC official results. For example, REG has been used by multiple groups in TREC 2009 (Fang et al., 2009; Wu & Kashioka, 2009; Zheng et al., 2010), but the performance were quite different (e.g., the results measured with nDCG@N
                        
                           R
                         ranged from 0.0488 to 0.3061). The reason for the performance differences could be twofold. First, the pre-processing quality varies as they use different ways of entity candidate extraction ranging from simply applying off-the-shelf NER taggers (Zheng et al., 2010) to more sophisticated methods such as extracting entities from tables and lists (Fang et al., 2009) or using Wikipedia link information for entity filtering (Wu & Kashioka, 2009). Furthermore, they estimated the component function using different resources, such as using only documents (Zheng et al., 2010), using only supporting snippets (Wu & Kashioka, 2009), and using multiple resources (Fang et al., 2009). In fact, one of our goals is to set up a common ground for comparing and understanding the effectiveness of different ranking models.

Feedback is a commonly used technique to improve retrieval performance through finding more terms that are related to the given topic. In the scenario of document retrieval, a new query model can be estimated using the feedback documents (Zhai & Lafferty, 2001). In this paper, we study the problem of feedback in the context of related entity finding task, where a query specifies two fields, i.e., relation and input entity. The input entity is often clearly specified with the entity name. However, there may be several different expressions for the relation between the input entity and target entity, the original relation r may not cover all of them. Consider the example query in Fig. 1. The relevant entity “Deborah Estrin” may be described as “Deborah Estrin received the ACM Athena Award” or “the ACM Athena Award was granted to Deborah Estrin” instead of saying “Deborah Estrin is the winner of ACM Athena Award” in many documents. If we use only the original relation description, we may fail to retrieve such relevant entities.

We thus propose a relation feedback method to estimate an enriched relation model 
                        
                           
                              
                                 θ
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       R
                                    
                                    
                                       f
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     . Following the problem setup of document feedback, we may use a basic related entity finding model, such as the ones proposed in the previous section, to retrieve a list of candidate related entities. We then assume that the top ones are relevant. The challenge is how to utilize these feedback entities to estimate an enriched model for the relation specified in the query.

To address the challenge, we propose a novel mixture model based relation feedback method. For each feedback entity, we first generate a new query that includes the input entity, feedback entity and their relation. We then retrieve a set of feedback documents 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 d
                              
                           
                        
                      for every generated new query. Intuitively, these feedback documents contain information about the input entity, related entity and their relations. Thus, we can assume that these feedback documents are generated from a mixture model of input entities, candidate entities, their relations and a background model:

                     2 and λ are coefficients of linear interpolation and they represent the likelihood that a term w is generated by each of the language models.

                      can be estimated in a similar way.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

We evaluate the proposed methods on two standard collections developed in the TREC Entity track.
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Ent09: The collection is developed and used in TREC 2009 Entity Track (Balog et al., 2010). It includes (1) ClueWeb09 category B collection with 50 million English web pages crawled from the Internet; (2) 20 queries, each of which corresponds to an information need related to entities, and the types of related entities including person, organization and product; and (3) the judgement file with relevant entities and homepage for every query, where each query has around 17 relevant entities on average.


                                 Ent10: The collection is developed and used in TREC 2010 Entity Track. It includes (1) English portion of ClueWeb09 collection with about 500 million web pages crawled from the Internet; (2) 50 queries, the format is the same as that of 2009 Entity Track, while a new related entity type Location is introduced; and (3) the judgement file with relevant entities and homepage for every query, where each query has around 16 relevant entities on average.


                        Table 2
                         shows the statistics of the two collections including the number of queries and average number of relevant entities per query for different related entity types.

The performance is primarily measured with the official measure used in the track: nDCG@N
                        
                           R
                        , i.e., normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at N
                        
                           R
                        , where N
                        
                           R
                         is the number of relevant entities for a given query. Note that the measure is based on the homepage of the entity rather than the entity itself, one homepage has three relevance levels: primary, relevant and non-relevant, and the corresponding gains are 2, 1, 0, respectively.

The smoothing parameter μ is set to 1000 for all the experiments.

We conduct two sets of experiments to evaluate the proposed six retrieval models. Recall that the related entity finding requires two steps: entity candidate extraction and entity ranking. Since we focus on entity ranking in this paper, we use two simple strategies for entity candidate selection.

In the first set of experiments, we apply an existing NER tagger to extract entity candidates based on the specified type. Specifically, a query is first formatted into Indri query language format, and then used to retrieve top ranked paragraphs from the document collection. We then apply the Stanford NER tagger (Krishnan & Manning, 2006) to extract all the candidates from the retrieved paragraph collection (denoted as NER). The reason to choose paragraphs rather than whole documents to apply NER is that we found the quality of NER extracted entity candidates from paragraphs are better than that from documents because paragraphs have better proximity for entities. After that, we apply the proposed ranking models and feedback method to rank the entity candidates.


                        Table 3
                         shows the performance comparison on the NER generated entity candidate set. The performance of all the models is similar, and incorporating OccPrior into RG, IEG and QG models can improve the performance in most cases. Moreover, with entity candidate prior, models on the top row of Fig. 2 have comparable performance with the other models in the bottom row of same column (e.g. comparing RG
                        +
                        OccPrior with EG).

By analyzing the results, we find that using only existing NER taggers cannot generate a high quality set of candidates because many results from NER extraction are non-real-world entities with the correct type. For example, consider the query “Winners of ACM Athena Award” with the entity type “person”, there are many noisy entity candidates from the NER extraction: “Murray Hopper Award”, “Dr. J”, “Palo Alto”, “Kate”. Among the 8321 entity candidates extracted in Ent09, 169 (2.0%) are relevant, and among 23,418 entity candidates in Ent10, 519 (2.2%) are relevant.

To construct a better candidate set, we follow a heuristic used in TREC (Bron et al., 2010) and apply DBPedia-based filtering over all the entity candidates from NER extraction (denoted as NER
                        +
                        DBPedia). We keep the entities which have valid DBPedia URI and belong to the type specified in the query according to the ontology.
                           1
                           The DBpedia Ontology: http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Ontology.
                        
                        
                           1
                         The statistics of both entity candidate sets are shown in Table 4
                        . We find that NER based entity extraction can lead to high recall, and DBPedia-based filtering can reach higher precision with acceptable loss of recall, showing it is an effective heuristic.

We then conduct another set of experiments to evaluate the performance of our entity ranking models on NER
                        +
                        DBPedia, and summarize the results in Table 5
                        . Compared with Table 3, we find that the models perform much better on the new candidate set. Moreover, incorporating priors is more effective in improving the retrieval performance because all “non-entity” noises are filtered out.

To better understand the impacts of two entity candidate sets on the performance of entity ranking, we choose one query from Ent09 (query #7 “Airlines that currently use Boeing 747 planes”), and show the top 5 entities for RG model with OccPrior on the two entity candidate sets in Table 6
                        . We find that DBPedia based filtering can purify the entity candidate set (i.e. removing non-type-match entities like “Boeing”, “China”, etc.).

We conduct experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed relation feedback method. Specifically, we choose RG and QG model with OccPrior for evaluation because QG is the one that performs best, and RG is the one that can more naturally incorporate feedback. We choose the original relation model as the baseline, denoted as NO-FB. We first do parameter tuning of our related-based feedback methods and report the optimized results as OPTIMIZED.


                        Table 7
                         shows the performance of our feedback methods on the two entity candidate sets respectively. It is clear that our proposed relation feedback method can significantly improve the performance on both data sets under optimized parameter settings. Moreover, the improvement of RG model is larger than that of QG. By analyzing the results, we find that the proposed relation feedback method is able to find terms that are relevant to the relation described in the query. For example, for query “Winners of ACM Athena Award”, our proposed model can find useful terms, such as “nominate” and “receive”, for the relation “winners of”.

There are five parameters in the relation-based feedback method: the number of feedback entities n
                        
                           e
                        , α (Eq. (12)), λ (Eq. (10)), β
                        1 (Eq. (10)), and β
                        2 (Eq. (10)). Since the optimized parameter settings on different data sets are different, we would like to see whether the optimized parameter setting on one data set can lead to optimized performance on others. We use one data set to train the optimized parameter setting and apply it to the other. The results are denoted as TRAINED. By conducting experiments to examine the parameter sensitivity of the relation feedback method, we find that the performance is relatively robust (±3%) with regard to the variation of most parameters. Therefore, we recommend a set of fixed parameter settings based on the observations of parameter tuning process as a guidance for further research efforts, as shown in Table 8
                        . The results associated with the recommended parameter setting are denoted as FIXED. Table 9
                         shows the results comparison for OPTIMIZED, TRAINED and FIXED. We find that both the trained parameter setting and the recommended fixed parameter setting can lead to near-optimized performance for our related-based feedback method.

We compare our models with the methods in TREC 2009 Entity Track (Balog et al., 2010). With the fixed parameter setting, our system is able to be ranked at the third place in Entity Track 2009 and fourth in Entity Track 2010, respectively. Note that the top 2 runs used additional information such as passage-based relevance, Wikipedia link information and term proximity (Fang et al., 2009; Wu & Kashioka, 2009), which are not used in our work. We expect that the performance of our proposed method could be further improved if combined with these additional techniques.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The related entity finding task is similar to the traditional ad hoc document retrieval task (Salton & McGill, 1983) in the sense that both tasks rank a list of information items, i.e., entities or documents, based on their relevance to a given query. Related entity finding has attracted much attention due to the launch of the TREC Entity track (Balog et al., 2010).

Most participants first extracted entity candidates using either off-the-shelf or custom-made named entity recognizers, and then ranked the entities using different ranking strategies. Fang et al. (2009) applied the hierarchy relevance model to estimate the relevance score at document, passage and entity levels. Kaptein, Koolen, and Kamps (2010) used the outgoing links from the page of input entity to the page of target entities to model the relevance score between them. Serdyukov and de Vries (2010) utilized the external links on the Wikipedia pages of entities to rank the entities. Kaptein, Serdyukov, de Vries, and Kamps (2010), Kamps, Kaptein, and Koolen (2010) leveraged category information and external entities on the Wikipedia pages as a pivot to rank the entities. The voting model (Santos, Macdonald, & Ounis, 2010; Macdonald & Ounis, 2009) took the relevance score of each overlapped document between the query retrieved set and entity profile set as a vote for the entity. Hold, Leben, Barczynski, and Brauer (2010) combined the Jaccard and Jaro-Winkler similarity to merge duplicate entities into groups and took the distance in sentences between input and target entities to model the relevance. Wu, Hori and Kawai (2010) integrated the relevance score between the query and both the entity and homepage of the entity. Besides these, some ranking strategies were combined with the use of various heuristics such as result filtering (Vydiswaran, Ganesan, Lv, He, & Zhai, 2010), the use of anchor text (Zhai, Cheng, Guo, Xu & Liu, 2010) and the use of external resources such as WordNet (Fang et al., 2009), Google results (Wu & Kashioka, 2009) or DBPedia (McCreadie et al., 2010; Serdyukov & de Vries, 2010). Besides these heuristics and difference between the estimation of component function, the basic idea of entity ranking models in Fang et al. (2009), Wu, Hori and Kawai (2010), Wu and Kashioka (2009) are essentially very similar to our REG model.

The related entity finding problem is also related to the expert finding problem (Balog, Meij, & de Rijke, 2007). In fact, it can be regarded as a more general problem than expert finding (Balog et al., 2007), since the latter focuses only on a specific type of related entities (i.e., person), a specific type of input entities (i.e., expertise area) and a specific relation (i.e., expert of).

Another body of related work is the entity ranking track of INEX (de Vries, Vercoustre, Thom, Craswell, & Lalmas, 2008; Demartini, de Vries, Iofciu, & Zhu, 2009; Demartini, Iofciu, & de Vries, 2010), which emphasizes more on the type of the targeted entities (i.e, categories) than the relation between the target and input entities. Vercoustre, Pehcevski, and Naumovski (2009) utilized a four-class prediction step to predicate the topic difficulty which can be used to further improve the entity ranking performance by setting the retrieval parameters to the optimal values based on the prediction. Rode, Hiemstra, Vries, and Serdyukov (2009) used the PF (PathFinder)/Tijah system which combines database and information retrieval technology through integrating the retrieval language NEXI with the database query language XQuery and applies relevance score propagation to rank the entities. Kaptein and Kamps (2009) explored relational information of Wikipedia pages, categories to estimate the distance between document categories and target categories and utilized the link information to perform relevance propagation. Both the relation and link information can lead to performance improvement. Itakura and Clarke (2009) used redundancy technique for question answering (Clarke, Cormack, & Lynam, 2001) as well as category estimation to retrieve top rank passages from which entities are extracted. Entities are ranked based on the number of passages which contain them then. Balog, Bron, De Rijke, and Weerkamp (2009), Balog, Bron, and de Rijke (2010), Balog, Bron, and De Rijke (2011) performed entity ranking using a KL-Divergence based generation model which integrates both term-based and category-based representations of queries and entities. The underlining generation model is similar to our QG model with uniform entity prior, but the estimation of generation probability is different from ours: they used Wikipedia documents associated with query entity and target entity to connect them while we use the whole collection to bridge them. Koolen, Kaptein, and Kamps (2009) proposed a probability framework which also exploits the category information explicitly. Both queries and entities are represented by term-based and category-based model which essentially are probability distributions. The ranking of entities can be done by measuring similarities between the probability distributions.

There are also some studies on how to apply relevance feedback on entity ranking. Balog et al. (2010), Balog et al. (2011) focused on expanding query term model and category model directly from the documents associated with feedback entities. Iofciu, Demartini, Craswell, and de Vries (2011) utilized the Wikipedia category graph structure to estimate the entity ranking weight which is interpolated with the initial ranking as the final one. However, their models heavily rely on the structure of Wikipedia (e.g. links, categories) and cannot be extended to web scale corpus with unstructured documents (e.g. ClueWeb09 used in TREC Entity Track). Different from their models, our relevance feedback model estimates the enriched entity relation model from the supporting documents of feedback entities and it does not use any specific structure information of the document.

Compared with the previous work, our main contributions include the following: (1) We derive six generative models for related entity finding, connect them with methods used in Entity track, and conduct both analytical and empirical studies to compare these models. (2) We propose a novel relation-based feedback method that can better capture the information about the relation between the input and related entities. Note that both retrieval models and feedback method are complementary to the heuristics used in the Entity track and INEX and can be combined to further improve the performance.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

We study the related entity finding problem in this paper. Specifically, we focus on ranking candidate entities based on their relevance to a structured query. To tackle this problem, we first derive six generative models to rank candidates. As far as we know, this is the first systematic study of the formal models for related entity finding. Experimental results indicate that the retrieval performance is closely related to the quality of extracted candidate sets. It is more effective to incorporate candidate prior when the quality of candidates is higher. Moreover, we propose a novel relation based feedback method that can utilize the pseudo relevant entities to better capture the relation between entities. Experimental results show that the proposed feedback method is effective to improve the performance.

There are many interesting future research directions. First, we plan to explore alternative ways of estimating component functions in the models. Second, we could study how to leverage the NER results in the ranking procedure. Finally, it would be interesting to study how to combine our proposed ranking strategies with existing QA methods to improve the performance.
