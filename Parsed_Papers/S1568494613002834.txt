               Abstract
               
                  We present a new classifier fusion method to combine soft-level classifiers with a new approach, which can be considered as a generalized decision templates method. Previous combining methods based on decision templates employ a single prototype for each class, but this global point of view mostly fails to properly represent the decision space. This drawback extremely affects the classification rate in such cases: insufficient number of training samples, island-shaped decision space distribution, and classes with highly overlapped decision spaces. To better represent the decision space, we utilize a prototype selection method to obtain a set of local decision prototypes for each class. Afterward, to determine the class of a test pattern, its decision profile is computed and then compared to all decision prototypes. In other words, for each class, the larger the numbers of decision prototypes near to the decision profile of a given pattern, the higher the chance for that class. The efficiency of our proposed method is evaluated over some well-known classification datasets suggesting superiority of our method in comparison with other proposed techniques.
