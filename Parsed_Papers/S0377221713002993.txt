                  This paper focuses on detecting nuclear weapons on cargo containers using port security screening methods, where the nuclear weapons would presumably be used to attack a target within the United States. This paper provides a linear programming model that simultaneously identifies optimal primary and secondary screening policies in a prescreening-based paradigm, where incoming cargo containers are classified according to their perceived risk. The proposed linear programming model determines how to utilize primary and secondary screening resources in a cargo container screening system given a screening budget, prescreening classifications, and different device costs. Structural properties of the model are examined to shed light on the optimal screening policies. The model is illustrated with a computational example. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the ability of the prescreening in correctly identifying prescreening classifications and secondary screening costs. Results reveal that there are fewer practical differences between the screening policies of the prescreening groups when prescreening is inaccurate. Moreover, devices that can better detect shielded nuclear material have the potential to substantially improve the system’s detection capabilities.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most catastrophic events for the United States would be a domestically-detonated nuclear weapon, which would lead to the loss of numerous lives and devastate the economy. It is known that terrorist groups are trying to obtain nuclear material to build a weapon of mass destruction (WMD), which would then presumably be smuggled and detonated within the United States. A nuclear attack would be within the realm of possibility, since there have been several cases of weapons-grade nuclear material being stolen (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2007). Reducing the risk of a nuclear attack in the United States can be achieved in part by improving security screening in the transportation sector. Cargo container screening at United States ports is a critical component in the nuclear security system, since cargo containers are viewed as a likely avenue for smuggling WMDs into the United States (Fritelli, 2005).

This paper focuses on cargo container screening and port security, since the United States economy largely depends on its port capabilities for trade. McNicholas (2008) states that with regards to warfare and criminal or terrorist attacks, “no sector is more dangerously exposed than ports.” Programs and legislation such as C-TPAT, the 24-Hour Rule, the Container Security Initiative, and Secure Freight Initiative, have been created to reduce illegal material (e.g., drugs and weapons) from being smuggled into the United States. These programs allow the United States to enforce increased security measures for incoming cargo containers. These initiatives have been used to supply foreign and domestic ports with screening devices for detecting nuclear threats within cargo containers (McNicholas, 2008).

Port security operations consist of a multi-layer security screening system. Before containers depart from a foreign port, the Automated Targeting System (ATS) is used to prescreen and classify the risk associated with the individual container (Strohm, 2006). When a container arrives at a domestic port, it goes through routine primary screening procedures. Port security screening devices for nuclear or radioactive material are often radioactive isotope identification devices (RIIDs), radiation portal monitors (RPMs), and X-ray imaging devices (McNicholas, 2008). Primary screening can consist of several such devices, which in combination yields a primary screening alarm, suggesting that a threat item may exist within the container, or the container is cleared, where it continues along its route. Containers that yield a primary screening alarm are sent to secondary screening, where they are further inspected for nuclear material. The secondary screening outcome are again either alarm or clear, where the containers that yield a secondary screening alarm are delayed as they are physically inspected with more intrusive screening methods, such as manual detection. These delays have severe economic costs since they disrupt the flow of international trade.

This paper determines how to simultaneously define primary and secondary screening decisions using linear programming models. A prescreening-based screening paradigm is considered, where each cargo container first undergoes prescreening using ATS or a similar prescreening system. Prescreening is used to classify each cargo container into a predefined prescreening group. Every primary screening policy use a combination of screening devices, where each type of screening device has associated alarm probabilities and a cost. It is assumed that there is a budget for performing both primary and secondary screening. The screening system can be viewed as a mixture of decision trees, where the decision nodes are screening procedures (applied simultaneously or sequentially) and whose chance nodes are screening outcomes. A number of different threat scenarios are considered, which include different sources used for nuclear weapons (e.g., highly-enriched uranium or plutonium), whether the source is masked and/or shielded, and the possible target for the nuclear weapon. Different screening devices have differing capabilities in detecting WMDs constructed using different sources. The linear programming model is similar in spirit to a partially-observable Markov process, where the decision variables capture observable states (the pre-screening groups and primary screening outcomes) whereas the alarm probabilities reflect the true, hidden state (the threat scenarios). A solution to the linear programming model provides a policy for defining both a primary screening alarm and a secondary screening alarm for each prescreening group. A computational example sheds light on the value of prescreening in making security screening decisions, how to balance primary and secondary screening methods, and how the dependencies between different screening methodologies affect optimal screening decisions.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review of research that is related to this paper. Section 3 proposes a linear programming model for determining the optimal primary and secondary screening decisions. Section 4 summarizes the structural properties of the model as they relate to multiple choice knapsack problem models. In Section 5, a computational example is analyzed. Section 6 provides conclusions, recommendations and future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is growing body of literature aimed at modeling how to screen cargo containers using nuclear screening procedures and devices. This paper is related to prescreening-based cargo container screening models provided by McLay et al. (2011) and McLay and Dreiding (2010, 2012). These models examine how linear programming models can be used to identify primary screening policies that depend on the prescreening group, they evaluate the risk of naturally occurring radioactive material and the impact of prescreening intelligence. They determine screening policies based on the number—not type—of primary screening alarms, and they do not consider the efficacy of secondary screening.

Several research papers examine inspection strategies for cargo containers that use several types of screening tests. Gaukler et al. (2011) investigate how radiography-based images can be used to supplement or replace prescreening by computing hardness measures to identify potential containerized threat scenarios. They explore the tradeoffs between the system detection probability and the sojourn time of the containers. Gaukler et al. (2012) extend this approach to consider hybrid screening systems and container-specific false alarm rates. The key difference is that this paper focuses on designing prescreening-based primary and secondary screening architectures using prescreening systems whereas Gaukler et al. (2011, 2012) focus on improving prescreening systems themselves. Ramirez-Marquez (2008) use decision trees to find cargo container inspection strategies that minimize inspection costs. Each strategy selects sensors that have varying reliability and costs. The strategy presented maintains a required detection rate that follows a minimum cost, order-dependent inspection. Concho and Ramirez-Marquez (2010) extend this work to provide an evolutionary algorithm for identifying near-optimal sensor operating characteristics.


                     Boros et al. (2009) determine how to optimally, sequentially inspect cargo containers by using a large scale linear programming model by constructing mixtures of decision trees as inspection systems. Boros et al. (2011) extend this approach using decision trees and knapsack problem models by using dynamic programming algorithms to identify optimal inspection policies, and they implicitly consider the effects of prescreening. They give a formulation that includes stochastic dependence as well as the more common stochastic independence. Kantor and Boros (2010) use principles of game theory to determine when to perform secondary screening when considering mixed inspection strategies.

This paper examines how to make integrated primary and secondary screening decisions in a prescreening-based framework. The model in this paper considers a single screening architecture where several primary screening methods are applied jointly. The fixed screening architecture in this paper can be compared to the flexible screening architectures studied by Boros et al. (2009, 2011). The model in this paper is similar to these papers in that it identifies screening procedures that are mixtures of decision trees. However, Boros et al. (2009, 2011) consider generalized screening systems that optimally sequence screening procedures, where prescreening, if it is used at all, can occur at any stage in the sequence. In this paper, prescreening occurs first in the sequence, and the analysis focuses on the central role of prescreening in optimally allocating scarce screening devices to cargo containers. Our analysis focuses on the implications of the relationship between observable characteristics (prescreening and primary screening outcomes) with unobservable characteristics (the underlying threat scenarios) on the optimal screening decisions.

In this section, a linear programming models is proposed for identifying optimal, integrated prescreening-based cargo container screening decisions. Terminology and parameters are introduced for the Nuclear Screening Problem (NSP), the proposed model.

NSP assumes that each cargo container is classified into a prescreening group, which implicitly captures its likelihood of containing a threat. A prescreening system such as ATS is assumed to classify each cargo container into prescreening groups. All containers undergo primary screening (determined by the model), which yields one of a given set of outcomes (e.g., the devices that alarm or clear). A container may undergo secondary screening (i.e., inspection), which is determined by the model and it depends on the containers’ prescreening group, primary screening procedures, and primary screening outcomes. The primary and secondary screening decisions are integrated such that the probability of detecting a threat container using secondary screening procedures depends on the primary screening devices used, the combination of primary screening devices that yield an alarm, and the container’s prescreening group. Thus, NSP determines how to define primary and secondary screening alarms using a prescreening-based approach given a total screening budget. NSP captures the direct screening costs, which include the operational cost of the screening devices as well as the costs associated with processing the true alarms, true clears, and false alarms. It implicitly determines where to deploy and how to use screening devices. The model is stated as a linear programming model.

The parameters for NSP are as follows.

The number of items N represent the number of containers that are screened at a specific port in a given time period (e.g., a day). It is assumed that there is a prescreening system in place (such as ATS) that can classify the containers into the set of prescreening groups R. The threat scenarios T⧹NT capture a large number of potential cargo containers that contain a nuclear WMDs, where the threat scenarios could be based on the nuclear material, the masking and/or shielding of the nuclear material, and other weapon characteristics. There is a subset of non-threat containers (NT) that could contain naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) or other material that would affect the alarm probabilities, and hence, multiple types of non-threat containers are considered. In practice, one would expect few pre-screening groups (e.g., fewer than ten) and potentially many of threat groups (e.g., Dimitrov et al. (2011) consider 1320 when considering the origin and target of an attack).

Each primary screening procedure corresponds to a container being screened by a certain combination of screening devices. Each primary screening procedure j
                     ∈
                     J has a set of corresponding outcomes, captured by O
                     
                        j
                     . For example, if primary screening procedure j screens a container with two RPMs, then the set of primary screening outcomes O
                     
                        j
                      could be neither RPM yielding an alarm, the first RPM yielding an alarm and the second RPM not yielding an alarm, the first RPM not yielding an alarm and the second RPM yielding an alarm, and both RPMs yielding an alarm (a total of four outcomes). Alternatively, O
                     
                        j
                      the alarms could be defined using threshold policy (e.g., either zero, one, or two RPMs yielding an alarm). The primary screening cost a
                     
                        j
                      is based on the primary screening level that is used. The cost of secondary screening b is a constant for all containers that go through secondary screening, since the procedures for secondary screening, such as inspection, are likely to be the same in all scenarios.

Several conditional probabilities link the cargo containers to the primary and secondary screening alarms. The probability of threat scenario Pr{t} captures the fraction of cargo containers that would be in each threat scenario t

The input parameters can be estimated using data available in the public domain, proprietary information obtained when testing screening devices, and expert judgment. The threat scenarios and the threat probabilities can be estimated using expert judgment (Merrick et al., 2010; Hagan, 2009) or risk assessment tools National Academy of Sciences (2008). The conditional probabilities that each threat scenario is captured by each of the prescreening groups can be estimated using prescreening systems such as ATS (Strohm, 2006). The conditional probability that a cargo container yields various outcomes can be estimated by testing and evaluating the security devices; such testing is required before screening devices can be deployed. Estimating these conditional probabilities can be simplified by making reasonable assumptions, such as assuming that conditional probability that a cargo container signals an alarm when screened by a security device is independent of the prescreening group to which the container is assigned. Several techniques can be used to estimate the conditional probabilities, includes Bayesian Hierarchical models, Bayesian logit models, and threat likelihood display concepts (Sanquist et al., 2004). Conditional alarm probabilities can be estimated using time series with recursive digital filters (Fehlau, 1993) or a spectral-time based filter (Robinson et al., 2009). Simulation can be used to estimate detection probabilities by decomposing the large number of threat scenarios into independent submodels using Green’s function (Thoreson and Schneider, 2010, 2012). The cost parameters can be estimated using data available from the screening device manufacturer, a throughput analysis of the port, and the salaries paid to the employees hired to perform screening.

Estimating the last input parameter, the conditional probability of detecting alarms through secondary screening methods such as inspection, is speculative. Anecdotal observations of the inspection process suggest that the perceived risk of a container as well as the contents of the container influence the accuracy of secondary screening (Lava, 2008).

The objective function is to maximize the interdiction probability. The first set of constraints ensures that the cost of the primary and secondary screening decisions do not exceed the budget. The second set of constraints ensures that x
                     
                        ij
                      is one for any prescreening group classification, which ensures that all containers are screened. The next set of constraints ensures that the proportion of containers sent to secondary screening y
                     
                        ijk

                        ij
                     , linking primary and secondary screening decisions. The final set of constraints ensures that the x
                     
                        ij
                      variables are nonnegative numbers between zero and one.

NSP has a knapsack problem substructure. In the next section, the structural properties of NSP are explored to shed light on the optimal screening policies using multiple-choice knapsack problem models.

In this section, NSP is reformulated as a particular case of the linear Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). The comparison sheds light on the structure to the optimal solution and its corresponding implications on screening policies. First, we introduce MCKP. It has m classes, and each class i is associated with a set of items N

                      and a weight w

                        i
                     , and the total knapsack capacity is c. The objective of MCKP is to select one item in each class to add to the knapsack such that the total reward is maximized and the total weight is capacity feasible.

NSP can be formulated as a particular case of MCKP. To see this, the objective of NSP seeks to identify a screening rule for each prescreening group, where a screening rule is defined by selecting a primary screening procedure as well as its outcomes that would lead to secondary screening. Therefore, the set of knapsack classes corresponds to the set of prescreening groups (i.e., m
                     =∣R∣), and the items in each class correspond to a primary screening procedure and a combination of its outcomes (therefore, each j

                        ij
                      captures the utility of selecting containers for secondary screening based on their prescreening group i, primary screening procedure, and primary screening outcomes. The weight w
                     
                        ij
                      captures the cost associated with screening containers with prescreening group i with a given primary screening procedure as well as selecting a given subset of its outcomes for secondary screening.

The MCKP formulation of NSP combines each primary screening procedure to the primary screening outcomes into a single item, which combines the NSP variables x
                     
                        ij
                      to the corresponding variables y
                     
                        ijk
                     , k
                     ∈
                     O
                     
                        j
                     . To do so, the resulting MCKP formulation implicitly assumes that x
                     
                        ij
                     
                     =
                     y
                     
                        ijk
                      when y
                     
                        ijk
                      is non-zero, which implies that when containers yielding primary screening outcome k
                     ∈
                     O
                     
                        j
                      are selected for secondary screening, this decision is always deterministic rather than random. This is not a limitation when assuming that all primary screening costs are non-negative (i.e., a
                     
                        j

                     ∈
                     J), that secondary screening costs are positive b
                     >0, and that there is a primary screening level with zero cost (corresponding to no primary screening). This can be seen by noting that the x
                     
                        ij
                      variables have objective function coefficients of zero while the y
                     
                        ijk
                      variables have positive objective function coefficients. If y
                     
                        ijk
                     
                     >0 and y
                     
                        ijk

                     x
                     
                        ij
                     , if then the objective function can be improved by reducing x
                     
                        ij
                      and increasing y
                     
                        ijk
                      until y
                     
                        ijk
                     
                     =
                     x
                     
                        ij
                      (and screening any otherwise unscreened containers by the primary screening procedure with zero cost).

Once NSP is reformulated as a particular case of MCKP, MCKP results can be directly applied. There are many well-known algorithms that find solutions to MCKP in linear time that shed light on the optimal policies for NSP (Kellerer et al., 2004). A solution to MCKP has several properties, which are stated here and interpreted with respect to NSP.

The first result compares the rewards and weights of items within a single class (i.e., prescreening group) to determine which combinations of primary screening procedures and their outcomes that are not selected for secondary screening. Such items are said to be dominated. Recall that each item j
                     ∈
                     N
                     
                        i
                      corresponds to a primary screening level j′∈

                     Proposition 1 indicates that dominated items always have values of zero in the optimal solution. For NSP, this means that containers that yield certain combinations of outcomes associated with a primary screening procedure (those associated with MCKP item j′ and primary screening outcomes k
                     ∈
                     o
                     
                        j”) will not be selected for secondary screening.

Once the dominated items have been removed, without loss of generality, assume that the remaining items in each class are sorted such that their weights are non-decreasing. The next result describes the number of fractional solutions in NSP, where a fractional solution indicates which proportion of containers with a given prescreening group and yielding a given set of primary screening outcomes are randomly selected for secondary screening. Proposition 2 indicates that in an optimal solution to NSP, containers in at most one prescreening group are randomly selected for secondary screening; containers in the other prescreening groups are selected in a deterministic manner. Therefore, the optimal solutions correspond to policies that are largely deterministic.

                     Proposition 2 follows from NSP having a single budget constraint. If side-constraints are added to NSP (e.g., labor constraints), then the optimal policies may allow for randomized secondary screening strategies across multiple prescreening groups.

This section introduces an illustrative computational example for NSP, where primary screening uses next-generation RPMs and X-ray devices. The results determine the primary and secondary screening decisions for different levels in prescreening accuracy. In this example, suppose there are N
                     =9999 cargo containers entering a port per day. Table 1
                      summarizes the primary screening decisions and outcomes and their abbreviations. It includes the primary screening costs a
                     
                        j
                      for both prescreening groups, where a
                     
                        j
                      represents the sum of the primary screening costs associated with each of the devices used. An RPM scan is set to one, and being screened by an X-ray device is set to 20. This results in a
                     
                        j
                      values between zero (when no devices are used) and 22 (when two RPMs and an X-ray are used).

The remaining parameters are based on data published in the public domain. The values of Pr{i∣t}, Pr{k∣i
                     ∩
                     j
                     ∩
                     t} and Pr{A∣i
                     ∩
                     j
                     ∩
                     k
                     ∩
                     t} are determined as follows. First, two prescreening groups are considered, high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR), resulting in ∣R∣=2. Approximately 4% of all containers are assumed to be high-risk, which is agreeable with port authorities (Lava, 2008). Therefore, low-risk containers are about 96% of all containers. The conditional probability that a container in a threat scenario (t
                     ∈
                     T) is classified as high-risk is the same across all threat scenarios. Likewise, the probability that a container in a non-threat scenario (t
                     ∈
                     NT) is classified as high-risk is the same across all non-threat scenarios. The prescreening multiplier β is used to capture the relative likelihood that threat containers are classified as high-risk relative to non-threat containers (McLay et al., 2011). The ratio of high-risk threat containers to low-risk threat containers is therefore represented as β, where β
                     =
                     Pr{t∣HR}/Pr{t∣LR}, t
                     ∈
                     T⧹NT. Since threats must all be classified as either high-risk or low-risk, then Pr{HR∣t}+
                     Pr{LR∣t}=1, t
                     ∈
                     T. Bayes Rule can then be used to compute Pr{HR∣t} and Pr{LR∣t}, t
                     ∈
                     T. The base case considers β
                     =1, 10, 100. The scenario with β
                     =1 corresponds to random prescreening, in which the probability of threat containers being classified as high-risk is equal to the overall probability that a container is classified as high-risk (0.04 in this case). The β
                     =10,100 scenarios result in the high-prescreening group capturing 0.294 and 0.806 of the threats, respectively.

Ten container scenarios are considered, including eight threat scenarios and two non-threat scenarios. The probability of a container being in any one of the threat scenarios is P
                     =1/N, where one threat is expected to exist among the containers. This value of P is selected such that the results reflect the interdiction probability. Table 2
                      summarizes the eight threat and two non-threat scenarios. The eight threat scenarios capture the source (either highly-enriched Uranium (HEU) or Plutonium), whether the weapon is masked, and whether the weapon is shielded. An example of a threat scenario is a container with a uranium-made weapon that is both masked and shielded (U-S-M). The two non-threat scenarios correspond to whether or not NORM is in a container. Note that masking and shielding do not exist for either NT scenario since there is no weapon. Table 2 contains the probability that a container contains either a threat or non-threat scenario, Pr{t}, t
                     ∈
                     T. The threat scenarios, their likelihood, and their alarm probabilities are based on published data and estimates (Rooney, 2005; Bakir, 2008; Fritelli, 2005; Levi, 2007) and expert opinion (Lava, 2008; Hagan, 2009).

Two types of RPMs are considered separately: current-generation and next-generation RPMs (“Current” and “Next-gen” in Table 2). The current-generation RPMs cannot detect shielded weapons well, and therefore, next-generation devices illustrate potential improvements to the interdiction probability with improved capabilities. The primary screening alarm probabilities for the primary screening devices are listed for the ten threat and non-threat scenarios. It is assumed that the primary screening devices operate independently, and hence, the values of Pr{k∣i
                     ∩
                     j
                     ∩
                     t} can be computed using these alarm probabilities for all primary screening outcomes k
                     ∈
                     O
                     
                        j
                     , for each i
                     ∈
                     R, j
                     ∈
                     J, and t
                     ∈
                     T. Likewise, Table 2 contains the probabilities that each threat and non-threat scenario would yield an alarm during secondary screening (SS alarm prob.). It is assumed that containers that are not masked nor shielded would be more likely to be detected using secondary screening policies, presumably since there would be no simple explanation for why the container yielded primary screening alarms (Lava, 2008). These alarm probabilities can be used to compute the conditional probabilities of a secondary screening alarm Pr{A∣i
                     ∩
                     j

                     t}, k
                     ∈
                     O
                     
                        j
                     , for each i
                     ∈
                     R, j
                     ∈
                     J, and t
                     ∈
                     T.

The remaining base case input parameters are as follows. The cost of secondary screening b is assumed to be a constant value of 100. The costs of primary and secondary screening are subject to the budget B
                     =20K. An upper bound of 2% of containers can be inspected based on these cost parameters. In the optimal solutions, 0.30–0.72% of containers are inspected by secondary screening procedures. When the budget increases to 50K, as many as 1.27% of containers are inspected by secondary screening procedures. Therefore, the screening operations resulting from the optimal solutions would not be expected to lead to costly delays. This is notable, since inspection rates reported in the public domain are significantly higher (Rooney, 2005; Lava, 2008).

All scenarios are formulated as linear programming models with 48 variables and 40 constraints. The linear programming models were solved using GLPK 10.0 on an AMD Opteron 2.6gigahertz processor with 4gigabyte RAM. GLPK solved each scenario in less than one second.


                     Tables 3 and 4
                     
                      summarize the screening policies for the base case scenarios with the current and next-generation RPMs, respectively. The primary screening procedure captures the combination of primary screening devices used to screen each of the prescreening groups. Since the scenarios allow for random primary screening, the values of x
                     
                        ij
                      report the conditional probability that containers in a particular prescreening group are selected for each primary screening procedure. The primary screening outcomes that would lead to a container being selected for secondary screening are listed as “PS Alarm,” whereas the primary screening outcomes that would lead to a container being cleared as listed as “PS Clear.” Recall that the secondary screening decisions are always deterministic. In the base cases, an alarm from any of the primary screening devices would lead to a container being selected for secondary screening, whereas a container would be cleared only if none of the primary screening devices yield an alarm response. Note that the β
                     =1 scenarios correspond to random prescreening, and hence, there is no difference between high-risk and low-risk containers. As a result, all containers are screened in the same manner. With the current-generation RPMs (see Table 3), 71.7% of containers are (randomly) screened with one RPM in primary screening while the other 28.3% of containers are screened with two RPMs. When β
                     =100, all high-risk containers are screened with one RPM and one X-ray device, whereas 70.2% of low-risk containers are screened with one RPM and 29.8% of low-risk containers are not screened.


                     Fig. 1
                      illustrates the interdiction probabilities corresponding to the base case scenarios as a function of budget, with 15K
                     ⩽
                     B
                     ⩽50K. Fig. 1a and b reflect the interdiction probabilities using the current and next-generation RPMs, respectively. The differences in the interdiction probabilities between the β
                     =100 and β
                     =10 scenarios at the same level of the budget are greater than the differences between the corresponding β
                     =10 and β
                     =1 scenarios. In the next-generation RPM scenarios and with B
                     =30K, β
                     =1 has nearly the same interdiction probability as the β
                     =10 scenario. This suggests that moderate improvements in prescreening intelligence over random do not result in significant improvements in the interdiction over random prescreening, since the screening devices are often used in similar ways (see Table 4). Primary screening devices are used in ways that significantly improve the interdiction probability only when prescreening is highly accurate. This observation is consistent with other research that examines how to define a system alarm for cargo containers screening systems (McLay et al., 2011).


                     Fig. 2
                     a and b illustrate the primary screening decisions for the high- and low-risk containers over the different values of β and B for the next-generation RPM scenarios. The primary screening decisions for the current-generation RPM scenarios are similar, and therefore, they are not shown here. Fig. 2 reflects the optimal solutions over all levels of β and B, not just those in the base cases. Since there are fractional values for some of the primary screening decisions, the decisions illustrated are those in which the fractional values are greater than 0.50, which is defined as the dominant primary screening decision. Moreover, the secondary screening decisions are not depicted. For high-risk containers with β
                     <8 and B
                     <$22K, the dominant primary screening decision is to use one RPM. When either B or β increase, the dominant primary screening decision changes from one RPM to two RPMs. When both B and β are large, then the dominant primary screening decision is either 1 X-ray and 1 RPM or 1 X-ray and 2 RPMs. Fig. 2b illustrates the dominant primary screening decisions for the low-risk containers. The dominant primary screening decisions for low-risk containers are sensitive to B and are insensitive to β. The dominant primary screening decision is either to use one RPM for smaller values of B and two RPMs for larger values of B. Fig. 2a and b can also be compared to determine when they screen high-risk and low-risk containers in the same way. High-risk and low-risk containers have the same dominant primary screening decisions when β
                     =1, β
                     ⩽10 and B
                     <22K, and β
                     ⩽13 and 33K
                     ⩽
                     B
                     ⩽47K. This suggests that when β is low, prescreening may not be accurate enough to warrant different screening methods for high-risk and low-risk containers.

A sensitivity analysis on the NSP parameters sheds light on how the primary and secondary screening decisions would change as a function of the secondary screening cost b. In the base case, b
                     =100, which means that secondary screening costs are one hundred times more expensive than an RPM scan. This reflects how secondary screening can be labor intensive if a container is unpacked and inspected (Bakir, 2008; Wein et al., 2007). Fig. 3
                     a and b illustrate the interdiction probability as a function of the secondary screening cost b for the current and next-generation RPMs, respectively. These results can be compared to those reported in Fig. 1 (when b
                     =100). Note that the interdiction probability is 0.72 when b
                     =0 and all containers are selected for secondary screening (with no primary screening), since not all threats would be detected by secondary screening. The interdiction probabilities are less sensitive to b when β
                     =100, with the interdiction probability decreasing by 0.12 and 0.10 between b
                     =0 to b
                     =300 for the current and next-generation RPM scenarios, respectively. This can be contrasted with the β
                     =1 and 10 scenarios, where the interdiction probabilities decrease by 0.42 and 0.47, respectively, between b
                     =0 to b
                     =300 for the current RPM scenarios and decrease by 0.29 and 0.25 for the next-generation RPM scenarios. This suggests that highly accurate prescreening can be used to design screening systems that are robust to changes in screening costs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Interdicting nuclear weapons in cargo containers is a challenging problem. This paper focuses on interdicting nuclear weapons on cargo containers via port security screening operations, where the nuclear weapons would presumably be used to attack the port or a more devastating target. This paper examines how to design cargo container screening architectures that make integrated screening decisions across primary and secondary screening using linear programming models. The resulting screening paradigm determines how to simultaneously identify optimal primary and secondary screening policies in a prescreening-based paradigm, where incoming cargo containers are classified according to their perceived risk. Structural properties of the model are examined to shed light on the optimal screening policies.

There are several directions for future research. One extension is to extend the model to make screening decisions across multiple screening stations. A second extension is to extend the decision context to consider the impact of setting the device alarm thresholds (individual screening device operating characteristics). See, for example, Wein et al. (2007) and Boros et al. (2009) who examine device alarm thresholds while assuming that an escalating security policy is in place. A third extension is to consider augmenting the prescreening system by updating perceived risk estimates using device outcomes, resulting in prescreening group assignments that are fluid rather than fixed. A final extension is to include a general cost function that would capture the economic impact of screening policies, such as the effect of inspections on delays. Work is in progress to address these avenues for future research.
