                  In this paper, we focused on characterizing and solving the multiple objective programming problems which have some imprecision of a vague nature in their formulation. The Rough Set Theory is only used in modeling the vague data in such problems, and our contribution in data mining process is confined only in the “post-processing stage”. These new problems are called rough multiple objective programming (RMOP) problems and classified into three classes according to the place of the roughness in the problem. Also, new concepts and theorems are introduced on the lines of their crisp counterparts; e.g. rough complete solution, rough efficient set, rough weak efficient set, rough Pareto front, weighted sum problem, etc. To avoid the prolongation of this paper, only the 1st-class, where the decision set is a rough set and all the objectives are crisp functions, is investigated and discussed in details. Furthermore, a flowchart for solving the 1st-class RMOP problems is presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Decision making is a very important and much studied application of mathematical methods in various fields of human activity. In real-world situations, decisions are nearly always made on the basis of information which, at least in part, is vague in nature. In some cases (e.g. zooming out, granular computing and system complexity reduction), vague information is used as an approximation to more precise information. In such situations, this form of approximation is convenient and sufficient for making good enough decisions. In other cases (e.g. image processing and pattern recognition) and due to the limited precision in data acquisition phase, vague information is the only form of information available to the decision maker.

Since it was pioneered by Pawlak, rough set theory (RST) (Pawlak, 1982, 1996) has become a hot topic of great interest in several fields. The capability of handling vagueness and imprecision in real-life problems has attracted researchers to use RST in many fields; one of them is the 'optimization'. Actually, most real-life problems involve (1) a process of optimizing simultaneously a collection of conflicting and competing objectives (i.e. a process of multiple objective programming (MOP)) and (2) vague or imprecise descriptions of some parts of the problem. Therefore, we usually need a suitable framework for handling this hyperdization of MOP and vagueness. For conventional MOP problem (Ehrgott, 2005; Hwang & Masud, 1979), the aim is to maximize or minimize a set of objectives over a certain decision set, both of which are precisely defined. But in many realistic situations, the available data lacke vagueness and inexactness and the decision maker may only be able to specify the objectives and/or the decision set imprecisely in a ‘rough sense’ using RST.


                     Youness (2006) was the first who applied RST to the single-objective programming (SOP) problem and proposed a new optimization problem with rough decision set and crisp objective function, called “rough single-objective programming” (RSOP) problem. He also defined two concepts for optimal solutions, namely “surely optimal“ and “possibly optimal”. Then after, many attempts were made to overcome the concept of rough mathematical programming. For more details see (Xu & Yao, 2009a, 2009b; Osman et al., 2011; Lu, Huang, & He, 2011; Tao & Xu, 2012; Zhang, Shi, & Gao, 2009).

Hence, for the sake of acquiring more realistic models and results of real-life MOP problems, we present a new extension of RSOP models presented in Osman et al. (2011), to the case of rough multiple objective programming (RMOP). A new framework in modeling and solving the RMOP problem is proposed without requiring any additional data.

RST was proposed by Pawlak in the mid-1980s, and presents a new mathematical approach to imperfect (vague/imprecise) knowledge. The problem of imperfect knowledge has been tackled for a long time by philosophers, logicians and mathematicians. Recently, RST has been proven to be an excellent mathematical tool dealing with vague and imprecise descriptions of objects. It became a crucial issue for artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences, especially in the areas of machine learning, knowledge acquisition, decision analysis, knowledge discovery from databases, expert systems, inductive reasoning and pattern recognition.

RST expresses ‘imprecision’ by employing a boundary region of the vague object (e.g. set, number, interval, function, etc.). If the boundary region of an object is empty it means that the object is crisp (exact); otherwise the object is rough (inexact). A nonempty boundary region of an object means that our knowledge about the object is not sufficient to define it precisely. The bigger the boundary the worse (i.e. the higher the imprecision of) the knowledge we have about the object.

Let U be a non-empty finite set of objects, called the universal set, and E⊆U × U be an equivalence relation on U. The ordered pair A = (U, E) is called an approximation space generated by E on U. E generates a partition

                      (or simply M
                     BN). The set M is crisp (exact) in A iff

In RST, each element x ∈ U is classified as ‘surely’ inside M iff x ∈ M
                     * or ‘may be’ (I'm not sure if it is or not) inside M iff x ∈ M
                     BN; otherwise x is surely outside M. Furthermore, an element x ∈ U is said to be “probably inside M”, iff x ∈ M*. On the other hand, each equivalence class Y ∈ U/E is classified as ‘completely’ included in M iff Y⊆M
                     * or ‘partially’ included in M iff Y⊆M
                     BN, otherwise Y is completely not included in M. Furthermore, an equivalence class Y ∈ U/E is said to be "possibly included in M", iff Y⊆M*.

Consider the following crisp SOP problem

                        
                           (1)
                           
                              
                                 
                                    max
                                    
                                       x
                                       ∈
                                       M
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                 g
                                 
                                    (
                                    x
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     where g(x) is the objective function, and M is the feasible set of the problem. In the conventional mathematical programming problem, it is assumed that all the parts (i.e. g(x) and M) are defined in a crisp sense and “max” is a strict imperative. However, in many practical situations it may not be reasonable to require that the feasible set or the objective function be specified in a precise crisp terms. In such situations, it is desirable to use some type of modeling that is capable of handling vagueness and imprecision in the problem. This led to the hybridization between SOP and RST to get the concept of “rough single-objective programming”. RSOP problems are broadly classified according to the place of roughness into three classes as follows:

                        
                           1st-Class: problems with rough feasible set and crisp objective function.

2nd-Class: problems with crisp feasible set and rough objective function.

3rd-Class: problems with rough feasible set and rough objective function.

Unlike the crisp case (where the optimal value is a single crisp value), the optimal value in RSOP, denoted by 
                        
                           g
                           ¯
                        
                     , is defined by its lower and upper bounds i.e. 
                        
                           
                              g
                              ¯
                           
                           *
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              g
                              ¯
                           
                           *
                        
                      respectively, such that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 g

                           ≤
                           
                              g
                              ¯
                           
                           ≤
                           
                              
                                 g
                                 ¯

                     . Therefore, in RSOP we can say that:

                        
                           •
                           a solution x is surely-optimal, if

                              ,

a solution x is surely-not optimal, if 
                                 
                                    g
                                    
                                       (
                                       x

                                    <

                              .

Also, in the 1st and 3rd classes of RSOP (where the feasible set is a rough set), it is remarkable that:

                        
                           •
                           a solution x is surely-feasible, iff it belongs to the lower approximation of the feasible set,

a solution x is probably-feasible, iff it belongs to the upper approximation of the feasible set,

a solution x is surely-not feasible iff it does not belong to the upper approximation of the feasible set.

Furthermore, in RSOP the optimal set is replaced by four optimal sets (See Fig. 1
                     ) covering all the possible degrees of feasibility and optimality of the solutions, as follows:

                        
                           •
                           The set of all surely-feasible, surely-optimal solutions, denoted by FOss.

The set of all surely-feasible, probably-optimal solutions, denoted by FOsp.

The set of all probably-feasible, surely-optimal solutions, denoted by FOps.

The set of all probably-feasible, probably-optimal solutions, denoted by FOpp.

Therefore, we have:

In this section, we present a new proposal to extend the concept of “rough programming” to the case of multiple objective programming. This proposal is called rough multiple objective programming (RMOP) and represents the hybridization of MOP and RST.

In contrast to SOP, a solution to a MOP problem is more of a concept than a definition. Typically, there is no single global optimal solution in MOP, and it is often necessary to determine a set of points that all fit a predetermined definition for an optimum. One property commonly considered as necessary for any candidate solution to the multiple objective problem is that the solution is not dominated by any other solutions in the feasible set. “The non-domination” (or best compromise, efficiency, Pareto-optimality) is the central concept in MOP only because an optimal solution for one objective function is not necessary an optimal solution for others. The predominant concept in defining an optimal point is that of Pareto optimality (Ehrgott, 2005; Hwang & Masud, 1979).

                      and the decision set M of problem (3) are defined precisely. However, practically this does not always be the case of study. Sometimes, in multiple objective programming, one or more of the problem components may be only defined through vague descriptions, and using rough set theory this could be handled easily. The roughness may appear in the MOP problem in the decision set and/or the goals, and then the problem is called rough multiple objective programming (RMOP) problem. According to the place of the roughness, the RMOP problems can be broadly classified into three classes as follows:

                        
                           1st-Class: problems with a rough feasible set and crisp objective functions.

2nd-Class: problems with a crisp feasible set and at least one rough objective function.

3rd-Class: problems with a rough feasible set and at least one rough objective function.

Furthermore, only in the 1st and 3rd classes of RMOP problems (where the feasible set is a rough set), we have solutions with different degrees (e.g. surely and probably) of feasibility. While in the 2nd class, all the feasible solutions are surely-feasible.

In this section, we define and discuss in details the RMOP problem in which the decision set is a rough set and all of the objectives are crisp functions. The roughness of the decision set appears when the feasible solutions have different degrees of feasibility (e.g. surely and probably). This case is mostly happening in the approximation process at zooming out and granulation operations (e.g. in pattern recognition and image processing). Also, due to insufficient and limited precision in data mining and information acquisition phases, we face some vagueness in data classifications and this causes rough feasibility too.

Characterizing the optimality conditions, efficient solutions, weak efficient solutions, Pareto front and optimal sets for problem (4), is the core of the following discussion. It is remarkable that the key idea in the following definitions is to use the notions of "the smallest and largest probable feasible sets" in order to characterize "the probably and surely states" of the different types of solutions (e.g. efficient and weak-efficient solutions). The smallest probable feasible set refers to any set that consists of all the elements of the lower approximation M
                        * together with only one element from each equivalence class Y ∈ M
                        BN (since Y∩M ≠ ϕ    ∀Y ∈ M
                        BN). So that the smallest feasible set is not a unique set, while the largest probable feasible set is always the upper approximation  M*.

Now for problem (4), we have the following definitions and propositions.

Generally in MOP problem (3), the image of the efficient set in the objective vector space is called ‘Pareto front set’. Also, the objective vector which is composed by the minimum values of the objectives over the efficient set is called ‘nadir objective vector’ and denoted by F
                        nad. Therefore, in problem (4) we can define both of the ‘Pareto front set’ and ‘nadir objective vector’ as follows.

                           Proof
                           The proof of this theorem in the crisp MOP form is well known. In RSOP problem (6), the solution feasibility and optimality characteristics (e.g. surely and probably degrees) are obviously transferred to the solution feasibility and efficiency in problem (4). Therefore, a surely (or probably) feasible solution of problem (6) is a surely (or probably) feasible solution of problem (4). Also, a surely (or probably) optimal solution of problem (6) is a surely (or probably) efficient solution of problem (4).□

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we presented the concept of “rough multiple objective programming” from a new point of view as a multiple objective programming but in a rough environment and classified its problems into three classes. The basic model and the necessary concepts for the 1st-class are defined and presented to characterize the solution of MOP problems when the roughness exists only in the decision set. Also, we introduced the SOP weighted-sum problem which is equivalent to the 1st-class RMOP problem and declared the meaning of its solution. Furthermore, we presented a flowchart containing the proposed approach for solving the 1st-class problems.
