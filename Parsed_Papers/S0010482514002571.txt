                  In this paper, a new method is developed for extracting so-called region-based stellate features to correctly differentiate spiculated malignant masses from normal tissues on mammograms. In the proposed method, a given region of interest (ROI) for feature extraction is divided into three individual subregions, namely core, inner, and outer parts. The proposed region-based stellate features are then extracted to encode the different and complementary stellate pattern information by computing the statistical characteristics for each of the three different subregions. To further maximize classification performance, a novel variable selection algorithm based on AdaBoost learning is incorporated for choosing an optimal subset of variables of region-based stellate features. In particular, we develop a new variable selection metric (criteria) that effectively determines variable importance (ranking) within the conventional AdaBoost framework. Extensive and comparative experiments have been performed on the popular benchmark mammogram database (DB). Results show that our region-based stellate features (extracted from automatically segmented ROIs) considerably outperform other state-of-the-art features developed for mammographic spiculated mass detection or classification. Our results also indicate that combining region-based stellate features with the proposed variable selection strategy has an impressive effect on improving spiculated mass classification and detection.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Currently, the most cost-effective method for early detection of breast cancers is screening mammography [1]. In screening mammography, breast mass is known to be one of the major signs of breast cancers [2]. Especially, breast masses with spiculated margins have a high likelihood of malignancy [2,3]. It has been reported that about 81% of spiculated masses are malignant [3]. Due to the high probability of malignancy, early detection and diagnosis of spiculated masses and architectural distortions may significantly improve the chance of survival for patients with breast cancer.

There has been a limited but increasing amount of work on the development of computer-extracted features for the detection and classification of spiculated masses on mammograms for computer-aided detection (CAD). Kegelmeyer et al. [4] proposed an analysis of local oriented edges (ALOE) features that represent stellate patterns of mammographic masses. The features were used for detecting spiculated lesions. Karssemeijer et al. [5] proposed pixel-wise stellate features for the purpose of detecting malignant masses on mammograms. Mudigonda et al. [6] developed directional gradient strength and coefficient of variation of gradient strength. In [7,8], the authors proposed the fuzziness of mass margin, radial to tangential signature information, and spiculation measure based on relative gradient information. The authors in [9] proposed the so-called texture flow-field analysis based features for the purpose of false positive (FP) reduction. Wei et al. [10] used multi-resolution spatial gray level dependence (SGLD) texture features to characterize the pattern of spiculated masses on mammograms.

While a few feature extraction methods have been suggested so far for automatic classification and detection of spiculated masses in mammography, developing effective and robust stellate features—providing acceptable classification performance—still remains a challenging and open question. In this paper, we present new feature extraction approach to correctly differentiate spiculated masses from normal tissue in mammographic CAD systems. Key technical contributions can be summarized in the following aspects:
                        
                           •
                           One particularly important characteristic of mammographic spiculated masses is having stellate patterns that appear as a number of line structures reside in a padiation pattern [4,5]. In light of this fact, our proposed features, termed region-based stellate features, have been designed for well encoding the stellate pattern information of spiculated masses. To this end, when extracting the feature form a given region of interest (ROI), the ROI is divided into three individual subregions (namely, core, inner, and outer parts) based on a band of pixels surrounding the segmented mass object in the ROI. The statistical characteristics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) associated with stellate (or spiculated) pattern information are then separately extracted from three different subregions. Finally, we combine these complementary sources of information to form the so-called region-based stellate features—allowing for characterizing the stellate patterns of spiculated masses at a regional level.

In this paper, we propose the use of AdaBoost learning [11] to select the best set of variables of region-based stellate features for maximizing the discrimination between spiculated masses and normal tissues. In particular, differing from the existing variable selection algorithms [12,13], the proposed variable selection method has been designed for the targeted classification applications in mammographic CAD systems. In detail, a novel variable selection criterion well suited for improving classification of spiculated masses in mammographic CAD is devised to optimally determine variable importance (ranking). To the best of our knowledge, combining the proposed region-based stellate features with variable selection underpinning AdaBoost is a new and novel approach for classifying and detecting spiculated masses in mammographic CAD systems and could have important implications in early detection and diagnosis of spiculated masses with high malignancy.

Comparative and extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of proposed region-based stellate features in conjunction with our proposed variable selection algorithm. The popular benchmark mammogram database (DB) “Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)” [14] was used in our experimentation. The results show that the proposed approach for extracting stellate patterns can achieve a high level of classification performance—in the presence of the errors caused by the inaccurate location of the boundaries of masses automatically segmented using computer algorithms (see 
                     Fig. 1)—that meets the requirement of real-life clinical applications. In addition, we validate the superiority of our proposed region-based stellate features by comparing other state-of-the-art features recently proposed for representing stellate patterns of mammographic masses. In addition, our results demonstrate that the performance (in terms of classification) can be impressively improved by combining our region-based stellate features with variable selection based on AdaBoost learning.

This paper improves and extends preliminary work presented in [15]. In particular, this paper presents a new approach that combines our region-based stellate features with a novel variable selection algorithm. Further, we report integrated experimental results that are more extensive and rigorous in the following aspects: (1) the comparison of other state-of-the-art spiculated (stellate) features; (2) additional analysis using more classifier models; (3) systematic investigation on the effect of combining stellate patterns each computed from a particular mass subregion.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, ROI detection and segmentation method used in this study is briefly explained. Section 3 details the proposed region-based stellate feature extraction. In Section 4, the proposed variable selection algorithm on the basis of AdaBoost learning is outlined. In Section 5, we present the experimental results. In Section 6, we discuss issues related to the proposed method. The conclusion is drawn in Section 7.

Note that a typical CAD system largely consists of three parts [9,16–19]: (1) automated detection and segmentation of mammographic lesions from a given mammogram, which generates ROIs; (2) automated feature extraction for generated ROIs; (3) automated classification of ROIs into true and false positives for a FP reduction purpose. Before explaining the extraction of our region-based stellate features, we briefly describe the ROI detection and segmentation method employed in this study.

In our work, as recommended in [9,20–22] to perform a more realistic assessment of a classification process under the assumption that the incorrect segmentation results would affect the classification performance, the ROIs are automatically detected and segmented from each mammogram by using a fully automated segmentation method. For this purpose, one popular approach of using multi-level thresholding algorithm [9,18,23] is adopted for segmenting masses on mammograms. We chose this segmentation approach because it has been well-documented in previous publications that it can provide “successful” segmentation results. The segmentation algorithm used consists of the following three sequential steps: (1) construction of iso-contour map; (2) formation of inclusion tree; (3) computation of minimum nesting depth. The implementation details of each step have been described in the literature [23].


                     Fig. 1 shows an example of segmented ROIs generated by segmentation algorithm used. Note that in Fig. 1, the red line is the successfully segmented mass contour with spiculated margins identified by the segmentation algorithm, and the blue line is the mass outline (as ground truth) marked by experienced radiologists. Note that the size of the ROI is chosen such that the computer-marked mass contour and a band of pixels surrounding a segmented object are included in the ROI (a detailed description of determining the width of the band is given in Section 3.1). The mass or normal tissue ROIs are then used as input for region-based stellate feature extraction to be discussed in the following section.

The authors in [5] proposed pixel-wise stellate features to detect mass candidates in mammography. The proposed region-based stellate features are developed based on pixel-wise stellate features described in [5]. It should be noted, however, that our proposed region-based stellate features have been developed in a novel and quite different way for a ROI classification purpose. In particular, differing from the previous pixel-wise stellate features, key technical significance can be summarized in the following aspects:
                        
                           •
                           The proposed region-based stellate feature extraction adopts statistical operations (e.g., average) to encode stellate patterns of malignant masses on mammograms more robust and stable, in the sense that the errors caused by the pixel-wise stellate feature extraction could be nullified by the statistical operations.

Previously developed pixel-wise stellate features have one limitation in that they represent the stellate pattern information at a pixel-level only. On the other hand, our region-based stellate features are designed for characterizing the stellate pattern information at a regional level by independently extracting stellate features from different subregions of each ROI.

In what follows, we explain in detail the method for extracting our region-based stellate features.

Spiculated masses on mammograms are likely to infiltrate into surrounding tissues [2,3,5]. Hence, it may be difficult for automatic mass segmentation algorithms to generate a clear and accurate boundary between breast masses and surrounding tissues. In addition, key idea of developing our region-based stellate features is to characterize the stellate pattern information of the masses at a regional level. For these reasons, we constructed a band of pixels [9] along the boundary of the segmented object in the ROI. This allows for reliably extracting the stellate patterns (of malignant masses), which is not sensitive to the precise location of the detected boundaries of mass ROIs.

Note that the regions that are segmented by the method described in Section 2 vary greatly in size and shape. To cope with this problem, we adaptively compute the width of the band based on the segmented region׳s size and shape in the same as proposed in [9]. Specifically, the diameter of the bounding circle enclosing a given segmented region is first obtained by calculating the maximum distance between any two points on its boundary. Next, the area of the segmented region

                         and the bounding circle

                         enclosing the region are calculated. The width of the band is then computed as

                         is a simple indicator of representing the narrowness and complexity of the segmented region. Finally, the band of pixels can be formed by applying morphological dilation operation [24] on the boundary of the segmented object. The bands of pixels extracted across the boundaries of the segmented regions are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 2(b).

Based on the band of pixels, a segmented ROI is divided into three individual subregions (as illustrated in Fig. 2(c)) to capture differences of stellate pattern information among three subregions: (1) core part that is assumed to be merely affected by the accuracy of the mass boundary; (2) inner part that is inside of the detected ROI region around the boundary; (3) outer part that is outside of the ROI region that surrounds the region. Rationale behind the effectiveness of such region partition is that within a given ROI, there may be several subregions containing different, complementary stellate pattern information. Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows examples of original mammogram image with the segmented ROI locations and the ribbons of pixels extracted from segmented ROIs.

Malignant masses are generally surrounded by radiating pattern of linear spicules [5]. Based on this fact, if line orientation (determined by using gradient operators [5]) of a large number of pixels points toward a central region, it is reasonable to assume that the corresponding region is considered as suspicious tissue. In support of this assumption, 
                        Fig. 3(b) and (e) shows potential pixels of interest (POIs) on line-like structures (depicted as gray pixels) located by a multiscale line orientation estimation [5]. Among the POIs, pixels pointing toward a disk of radius r (i.e., a central region) centered at x (depicted as white pixels) are selected as in [5]. To this end, Fig. 3(c) and (f) depicts the angle histograms [25], where a bin represents the number of POIs (white pixels) that are directed toward a disk of radius r within a given angular range. Obviously, it can be observed in Fig. 3 that malignant spiculated mass has more pixels pointing toward a disk with radius r, compared to the number of pixels resulting from normal tissue ROI. Pixel-wise stellate features proposed in [5] are designed to represent the aforementioned characteristics of each pixel.

At a given pixel x in a given ROI, the normalized number of POIs oriented toward x is defined as follows [5]:

Another important property of spiculated masses is “the radial uniformity” of spiculated patterns. If spicules are found in many directions, the likelihood of the presence of stellate pattern is increased. Dividing regions around x into k bins of different directions, the number of pixels in each bin that are pointing towards the center is calculated. Then, the radial uniformity is quantified by [5]:

It should be noted that one key characteristic of malignant spiculated mass is the presence of line structures radiating from the center of mass in many directions. Based on this fact, it can be expected that statistical characteristics of pixel-wise stellate feature values are likely to be different, depending on the distances of tissue regions from the central location. To justify this argument, the probability densities for feature values

                         (defined in Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively) are present in 
                        Fig. 4. It can be observed in Fig. 4 that as opposed to probability densities obtained for normal tissue ROIs, probability densities of pixel-wise stellate feature values computed using spiculated mass ROIs tend to be different, depending on individual subregions (i.e., core, inner, and outer parts) of a mass ROI. In particular, pixel-wise stellate features computed at the proximity of the central location (i.e., core or inner parts) of the spiculated mass tend to have larger values than those acquired at the boundary region (i.e., outer part). Furthermore, when comparing an outer part to core or inner parts in the same class (i.e., spiculated mass ROIs or normal tissue ROIs), probability densities of pixel-wise stellate feature values computed using spiculated mass ROIs are much different between subregions, while the probability densities between subregions are almost similar in normal tissue ROIs. This observation indicates that relative distributions of pixel-wise stellate feature values between subregions also have discriminant information of spiculated masses.

In light of this observations, our proposed region-based stellate features are extracted by computing statistics of pixel-wise stellate features, with respect to three individual subregions.

We now describe the way of extracting the proposed region-based stellate features. To separately extract statistical characteristic for three different subregions, mean values of pixel-wise stellate features for core, inner, and outer part regions (each denoted by

It can be expected that the pixel-wise stellate feature values tend to be larger in the central region of spiculated mass. Hence, differences in feature values computed between three individual subregions for spiculated mass ROI are likely to be larger compared to those obtained from normal tissue. To exploit this as discrimination information, differences in mean values of pixel-wise stellate features computed within three different subregions are defined as follows:

In addition, mean values of pixel-wise stellate features (each computed for one of the three subregions of normal tissue ROI) are likely to be similar to each other, while those computed from spiculated masses have some deviation. To exploit this information, standard deviations of mean values of pixel-wise stellate features in three subregions are computed as follows:

Further, standard deviations of pixel-wise stellate features for each subregion can be used as discrimination information for differentiating spiculated masses from normal tissues. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, normal tissues have a small number of stellate patterns and, at the same time, a larger portion of their pixel-wise stellate feature values may have small differences. For this reason, pixel-wise stellate features are expected to have small standard deviation for the case of normal tissues. Hence, the following standard deviations are used for discriminant features:

                        Table 1 summarized the proposed region-based stellate features and the intuition behind the contribution of each feature for the characterization of stellate patterns. Note that the proposed features defined in Eqs. (3) and (6) characterize the distributions of pixel-wise stellate features in each subregion separately, while another features in Eqs. (4) and (5) focus on the distributions between three subregions. Finally, different and complementary features (related to stellate pattern information)—computed using Eqs. (3)–(6)—are combined at feature level [26] by concatenating all available components in column order, yielding the proposed region-based stellate features. The purpose of using feature fusion method is to effectively facilitate a complementary effect between different statistical components related to stellate pattern information; this enables our region-based stellate features to provide different complementary information about the complex patterns of spiculated masses and, therefore, the components of region-based stellate feature vector are likely to be mutually compensational for improving malignant mass classification. The region-based stellate features for each ROI are applied to construct a classifier in the training stage, as well as the classification in the testing stage.

For the classification, one straightforward way is to apply our region-based stellate features described in Section 3.2 to a classifier (such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)). However, our region-based stellate features could contain some redundant information, not allowing the maximization of classification performance. To cope with this issue, variable selection procedure is integrated with our proposed region-based stellate features. It is reasonable to assume that a successful selection method might improve classification performance and enhance robustness. In addition, the selection could be used as a tool for analyzing the importance of each variable in terms of classification performance. The proposed variable selection method is developed based on the adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) [11]. Although AdaBoost was originally proposed to improve classification performance by combining weak classifiers, in this study, we reformulate it to suit the purpose of variable selection problem at hand. Especially, we devise a novel variable selection criterion for selecting variables that achieve an optimal balance between training and validation errors in terms of improving classification of spiculated masses in the context of mammographic CAD framework at testing stage.

The implementation steps of the proposed variable selection algorithm are described in 
                     Fig. 5. The proposed variable selection is to choose P variables out of region-based stellate feature consisting of a total of N

                      can be determined based on the classification error of the best candidate feature subset; on each round, the values of distribution progress towards increasing the likelihood of difficult samples. This forces the algorithm to select a variable at the next round to work well for the classification of hard-to-classify training samples.

It should be pointed out that the ultimate goal of our variable selection is to maximize generalized (validation) classification performance, rather than training classification performance. To achieve this purpose, we need to choose an optimal (or sub-optimal) subset of variables with low training classification error while at the same time its validation classification error should be kept to a minimum. Motivated by this, we propose a novel selection criterion which aims at selecting variables that achieve an optimal balance between training and validation classification errors.

In the proposed selection criterion, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is used to measure classification performance on the validation set

                           .
                         This is mainly because AUC is a widely used measure of the performance of the classification algorithms developed for mammographic CAD applications [28]. The AUC is equivalent to calculating the mean classification performance, averaging over the distribution of the classifier decision threshold (i.e., the output of the

                           )
                        . Further details on the definition of AUC are described in [28]. Let us denote the value of AUC (as validation classification performance) obtained using the

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In this section, we have conducted a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed region-based stellate features and to validate the feasibility of incorporating our proposed variable selection solution for the purpose of improving classification performance. A detailed description on our experimental studies will be given in the following subsections.

Mammograms from public Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) [14] were used in this study. We collected 140 mammograms (each with one malignant spiculated mass) of 72 breasts. For 68 breasts, the two standard mammographic views were available, while for four breasts, the biopsy-proven spiculated mass was available only in one of the two mammographic views. The selection of these mammograms was based on the following criteria: (1) for data consistency purposes, all of the used mammograms were selected from the same type of scanner (Howtek 960 [14]) and resolution (43.5μm pixel size); (2) we chose 140 mammograms acquired with the scanner type so-called Howtek 960 because a large number of cases are digitized by this type [14].

For a realistic assessment that assumes the dataset for classification could have errors as described in Section 2, using a computer segmentation algorithm, a ROI dataset was generated from the 140 mammogram images. Note that, during the generation of ROIs, we chose operating threshold which led to an average number of about 17.8 FPs per image at a detection sensitivity of about 65%. As a result, a total of 2494 ROIs was automatically generated: 91 spiculated mass ROIs and 2403 normal tissue ROIs (i.e., FP regions). The DDSM provides annotations of the masses presented in each image. These annotations were considered as the ground truth in our experiments. Using the ground truth information, a generated ROI was considered as a true mass ROI only if it met the following two criteria [30]: (1) the centroid of a segmented region is included in the DDSM annotated area, and (2) a segmented region intersects with the true mass region more than 25%. Note that the masses with different shapes and density found in clinical practice were fairly well represented in our collected dataset which contains a broad variety of mass shapes, margin characteristics, and breast densities. Therefore, it should be pointed out that this allows testing the proposed region-based stellate features and variable selection solution in realistic clinical conditions, as also encountered by real-world CAD applications.

In our study, decision tree [27], LDA [27], and SVM [31,32]—extensively used for mammographic CAD algorithms [19,33–35]—were used as classifiers. Specifically, a SVM classifier, which utilizes a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, was constructed. To implement tree base classifiers, ‘Gini impurity’ [27] was used as a criterion for choosing a split. The outputs of classifiers (e.g., distance measures of a SVM) were used as a decision variable in receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis [36,37] to evaluate the classification performance. ROC analysis evaluates the relationship between the true-positive fraction (TPF) or sensitivity and the false-positive fraction (FPF) or specificity (1 – FPF) at differing decision thresholds. The area under the ROC curve denoted by A
                        
                           z
                         was used as an index of classification performance because A
                        
                           z
                         is a commonly used performance index for evaluating classification algorithms developed for mammography CAD systems [38]. Furthermore, to test the statistical significance of the differences between the different ROC curves, a popular statistical test developed by Hanley and McNeil [28] was used.

To avoid over-fitting and biased estimates of classification performance (which can be caused by a small number of masses), a total of 91 spiculated mass ROIs and 2,403 normal tissue ROIs were randomly divided into two sets of equal size: training and testing sets. For each random partition, we train a classifier (described in Section 5.1) on the training set and then assess it on the corresponding test set. Note that, to guarantee stable classification results, 40 independent runs of aforementioned random partitions were executed. Thus, all of the results reported in this section were averaged over 40 runs. In this way, the classification performance was estimated reliably and in an unbiased way [37]. It should be also noted that each classifier was trained using the same training set to guarantee that variation in performance is due only to the difference in the used classifier construction methods.

In this section, we compared the proposed region-based stellate features against other four state-of-the-art features developed for the detection and classification of spiculated masses on mammograms: (1) gradient-based features [6], (2) SGLD-based features [21], (3) spiculation features [7], and (4) texture flow-field analysis-based features [9]. It should be noted that, when implementing other four texture features, we have strictly followed the implementation guidelines (and parameter settings) listed in the respective published paper for the purpose of fair comparisons. For gradient-based features [6], the following two features, namely “directional gradient strength” and “coefficient of variation of gradient strength” were extracted for each ROI image. For SGLD-based features [21], 13 features, namely, “correlation”, “energy”, “entropy”, “inertia”, “inverse difference moment”, “sum average”, “sum variance”, “sum entropy”, “difference energy”, “difference variance”, “difference entropy”, “information measure of correlation 1”, “information measure of correlation 2” were extracted from each SGLD matrix at five different inter-pixel distances (d=1, 2, 4, 6, 8) and in four directions (θ=0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°) were used to produce 20 SGLD matrices [21,39]. Therefore, a total of 260 SGLD features were computed for each ROI. For spiculation features [7], the following four features, so-called “fuzziness features of mass margin”, “radial to tangential signature information”, “spiculation measure based on relative gradient information” were extracted for each ROI image. For texture flow-field analysis based features [9], the four features, namely, “contrast”, “coherence ratio”, “entropy of orientation”, and “variance of coherence-weighted angular estimates” were extracted based on textual flow-field analysis [9].

The comparative ROC analysis results are given in 
                        Fig. 6. From Fig. 6, we can see that the classification performances of the proposed region-based stellate features are better than those obtained using the other state-of-the-art features developed for the detection and classification of mammographic spiculated masses. Looking at ROC curves shown in Fig. 6, the proposed region-based features achieve a false positive fraction (FPF) of 16.6%, 22.6%, and 11.7% at a true positive fraction (TPF) of 90% for the decision tree, LDA and SVM classifier, respectively. In particular, compared to the second best SGLD features, 14.1%, 1.0%, and 7.4% FPF performance improvements at TPF of 90% can be attained from the proposed region-based stellate features, in the order of decision tree, LDA and SVM classifiers. Moreover, considering a statistical comparison of differences between the ROC curves (i.e., our proposed stellate features versus the second best SGLD features), the results of p<0.001, p=0.097, and p<0.001 were observed for decision tree, LDA, and SVM, respectively (deemed statistically significant at a level of 0.05 [28]). These results validate the superiority of our proposed region-based stellate features in terms of improving FPF performance with a high sensitivity value.


                        
                        Table 2 shows the comparative results in terms of A
                        
                           z
                         classification performances, with respect to five different features. As shown in Table 2, the proposed region-based stellate features considerably outperform the other four stellate features in terms of A
                        
                           z
                         for all classifier models. SVM classifiers, especially, show better classification performances A
                        
                           z
                         compared to decision tree and LDA, because the SVM with RBF can generate a complex non-linear hyper plane for classification by utilizing a kernel trick [32]; this can provide better generalization power in the sense of correctly determining complex and arbitrary decision boundary. Consequently, the results shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2 demonstrate the feasibility of our region-based stellate features with regards to well capturing the stellate patterns of malignant masses, which leads to improved detection and classification of malignant masses with spiculated margin patterns on mammograms.

Recall from Fig. 4 and Section 3.2 that the proposed region-based stellate features are designed for characterizing the stellate pattern in three subregions. To validate the potential advantage of using three subregions, at the same time for encoding stellate pattern information at regional level, we have performed an additional experiment. The analysis was focused on investigating the effectiveness of the feature extraction using three subregions (i.e., core, inner, and outer parts) compared against feature extractions using two subregions for simplicity. Note that two subregions were generated by merging two of three subregions while the other subregion was remained. To this end, two different configurations were generated as follows: (1) core region

                                 R

                        . It should be noted that due to the reduced number of subregions, 12 dimensional features were extracted when using two subregions.

The results are given in 
                        Table 3 in terms of classification performance A

                        . As shown in Table 3, the proposed region-based stellate feature extraction using three subregions achieve better results, compared to the cases of using two subregions. This result confirms that the proposed feature extraction using three different subregions is able to extract more discriminant information of stellate patterns. In addition, among the cases of using two subregions, features extracted from central (core and inner parts) and outer region show better classification performances. This result is consistent with the description in Fig. 4 that discriminant stellate pattern information would be more concentrated inside core or inner regions.

In this section, we present the results for evaluation of the effectiveness of combining our proposed variable selection algorithm (developed based on AdaBoost learning) with the proposed region-based stellate features. The variable selection procedure (described in Section 4) was performed on the region-based stellate features to further improve classification performance. For this, an entire ROI dataset (2494 ROIs) was first randomly divided (split) into two parts, with 1/2 as a test set and 1/2 as a training/validation set. In order to guarantee the stability of our test results, the training/validation set was then resampled using the most widely used 5×2-Fold cross-validation (cv) [27] for testing our proposed variable selection algorithm. Herein, twofold cv has been done five times. In each cv run, we divided this dataset into training and validation halves. The roles are swapped at each fold to generate ten training and validation sets. Recall that as described in Section 4, the goodness of a variable subset selected by our variable selection method was evaluated by the performance of a weak classifier (created using the training set) on the validation set. Specifically, the validation classification error defined in Eq. (8) can be used to measure the value of selection criterion shown in Eq. (10), aiming to achieve a maximum generalized classification performance. The aforementioned process (including both random partition and 5×2-Fold cv) was repeated 20 times, yielding the final classification performance computed by averaging 20 corresponding results.

We plot the averaged A
                        
                           z
                         value (as classification performance) versus the size of variable subsets selected by the proposed variable selection method in 
                        Fig. 7. It should be noted that the values of A
                        
                           z
                         reported in Fig. 7 were measured on the validation set. As shown in Fig. 7, the optimal number of variables (in the sense that classification performance is maximized) is found to be 15, 17, and 16 for decision tree, LDA, and SVM, respectively. This observation indicates that the variable subset with the largest value of A
                        
                           z
                         could be chosen as the best variable subset for the purpose of maximizing testing classification performance. 
                        Table 4 shows a set of variables commonly selected for all of used classifier models. The 13 variables are present (in common) for all best set of variables. It can be observed that in Table 4 among variables those extract statistics of a single subregion such as Eqs. (3) and (6), the more important variables are associated with stellate features obtained for core and inner subregions, while stellate features for the outer region would be less important. This observation is consistent with the description in Fig. 4 in that discriminant stellate pattern information would be more concentrated inside core or inner regions. In addition, for the case of extracting region-based stellate features using two or three subregions (e.g., the computation in Eqs. (4) and (5)), it can be observed that the feature variables coming from outer part are always included in the selected best subset. This indicates that outer part region can play a complementary role in characterizing stellate patterns.

To further confirm the feasibility of our variable selection algorithm for enhancing classification performance, the testing classification performances of decision tree and LDA classifier models with full number of variables are reported in 
                        Table 5, together with those of the best variable subset selected by our variable selection algorithm. Note that in Fig. 7, decision tree, LDA, and SVM were used as weak classifiers 
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 t
                                 ,
                                 m
                              
                           
                           (
                           ⋅
                           )
                         (described in Eq. (7)) during the implementation of our variable selection algorithm. For the sake of comparison, we also report the classification performance of the same classifier models using a well-established feature selection method for mass classification, so-called the stepwise feature selection (SFS) [40]. At each step of the SFS procedure, one feature (or variable) is entered into or removed from the selected feature pool by analyzing its effect on a selection criterion. In this experiment, we employed the Wilks׳ lambda as our selection criterion, which is defined as the ratio of features selected by this method is controlled by two parameters, called F-to-enter and F-to-remove [40]. A detailed description of implementing classifiers in combination with SFS procedure can be found in the literature [13,40]. Looking at the results in Table 5(a) and (b), we can see that the classification performances with variable selection using either our proposed method or SFS are better than those obtained using all variables (i.e., without variable selection) as input feature used to construct classifier models for all of decision tree, LDA, and SVM. It can be also observed that classification results with our proposed variable selection algorithm are better than their counterparts with SFS. These results indicate that selecting an appropriate subset of feature variables using our proposed variable selection algorithm (based on AdaBoost learning) is feasible for providing additional improvement in testing classification performance.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

In Section 5.2, experimental results showed that the proposed feature outperforms other state-of-the-arts features developed for spiculated mass classification in mammography. In the experiment, the performance of the pixel-wise stellate features [5] (defined in Eqs. (1) and (2)) was not compared because the features are extracted at pixel-level, while other features are extracted at ROI-level. To evaluate the ROI classification performance of the pixel-wise stellate features, we followed the spiculated mass detection scheme using the pixel-wise stellate features in [5]. In the evaluation, we used the same evaluation protocol in Section 5.2 that executed 40 independent runs of 1:1 random partitions of ROIs for training and testing. The pixel classifier was trained using pixel-wise stellate features from pixels included in training ROIs. Note that for when training a pixel classifier using SVM, a linear kernel was used instead of the RBF kernel due to the huge number of training samples. For testing a given ROI, the maximum classifier output of pixels in the ROI was used as a decision variable. The pixel-wise features achieve an A
                     
                        z
                      of 0.875±0.009, 0.790±0.007, and 0.881±0.009, in the order of decision tree, LDA and linear SVM, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed features successfully improve spiculated mass classification performance by utilizing statistics of pixel-wise stellate features at regional level.

The features used in Section 5.2 are designed to characterize spiculated masses in different approaches. It has been generally believed in [26] that combining multiple and complementary features can improve classification performances. Thus, to evaluate the effect of the feature fusion solution on the improvement in classification performances, all of the available features were combined at feature level by concatenating them, yielding augmented feature vectors based on the most widely used feature fusion strategy [26]. The evaluation was performed exactly same as the experiments in Section 5.2. In the experimental results, the concatenated features achieve an A
                     
                        z
                      of 0.923±0.008, 0.947±0.006, and 0.968±0.004, in the order of decision tree, LDA and SVM, respectively. Results show that when comparing the case of using only a single feature type, the classification performances can be improved by making effective use of feature fusion solution.

As mentioned in Section 2, under the assumption that the incorrect segmentation results would affect the classification performance, the automated ROI segmentation was adopted to perform a more realistic assessment of the classification process leading to a small number of spiculated mass ROIs compared to normal tissue ROIs. To evaluate the effect of the number of spiculated mass ROIs on the proposed region-based stellate features, we generated a set of semiautomatically extracted mass ROIs by using the following approach. First, the bounding boxes containing spiculated mass ROIs were cropped from each mammogram; each bounding box was determined based on the ground truth annotation of each mass provided by DDSM [7,21]. In the next step, the automated ROI segmentation algorithm described in Section 2 was applied to each of the cropped bounding boxes so as to obtain mass contours (boundaries). As a result, 140 spiculated mass ROIs were generated for the additional experiments. Also, note that the same 2403 normal tissue ROIs described in Section 5.1 were used. Using these semiautomatically extracted spiculated mass ROIs and automatically extracted normal tissue ROIs, we have performed additional experiments to investigate the effect of ROI segmentation results on the performance of our proposed features. As a result, the proposed features achieve an A
                     
                        z
                      of 0.932±0.008, 0.942±0.008, and 0.958±0.006 in the order of decision tree, LDA and SVM, respectively. According to our experimental results, it has been found that the classification performances can be improved for the case of using semiautomatically extracted mass ROIs. However, it should be pointed out that the performance improvement would be marginal. This may indicate that our proposed region-based stellate features are likely to be little affected by the ROI segmentation results.


                     
                     Fig. 8 shows examples of correctly and incorrectly classified spiculated mass ROIs in the experiments in Section 5.4. By looking at the examples of incorrectly classified mass ROIs, there is a tendency (to a large extent) those mass ROIs those have few stellate patterns induce incorrect results, compared to correctly classified masses. Furthermore, about 75% of the incorrectly classified mass ROIs are coming from the mammogram with a high portion of dense tissues (density 3 and 4 in BI-RADS) induce incorrect results. Kindly note that a high proportion of dense tissues in mammography often may hamper cancer detection and recognition by increasing the subtlety of mass margin characteristics [20]. Hence, it is a challenging task for classifying masses in high density tissues, because stellate patterns of masses are likely to be concealed by surrounding parenchymal dense tissues [41]. To resolve this issue, our proposed region-based stellate features should be used in conjunction with other different types of mammographic features (e.g., texture [10,37] and intensity features [42]) that are less sensitive to dense tissues in the aspect of encoding the distinct characteristics of malignant masses.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the mammography, breast masses with spiculated margins have a high likelihood of malignant cancer. Due to the high probability of the malignancy, early detection and diagnosis of spiculated masses may significantly improve the chance of survival for patients with breast cancer.

In this paper, new region-based stellate feature extraction approach was proposed, aiming to correctly differentiate spiculated malignant lesions from normal tissues on mammograms. The proposed features have been designed for well encoding the physical characteristic that spiculated masses have stellate patterns. To this end, each region of interest (ROI) to be given for feature extraction is divided into three individual subregions (namely, core, inner, and outer parts) based on a band of pixels surrounding the segmented mass object in the ROI. The statistical characteristics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) associated with stellate (or spiculated) pattern information are then separately extracted from three different subregions. Finally, we combine these complementary sources of information to form the so-called region-based stellate features allowing for characterizing the stellate patterns of spiculated masses at a regional level.

To further maximize classification performance, a novel variable selection algorithm based on AdaBoost learning is incorporated for choosing an optimal subset of variables of region-based stellate features. In particular, we develop a new variable selection criterion that considers generalized classification error that combines training error and validation error to effectively determine variable importance (ranking) within the conventional AdaBoost framework.

Experimental results showed that the proposed region-based stellate feature extraction and variable selection algorithm can further improve the classification performance for correctly identifying spiculated masses. Consequently, it may be of high potential that the proposed method would improve radiologists׳ accuracy in the characterization of malignant masses via CAD systems, and ultimately may reduce the cost and patient stress of unnecessary treatment due to the prevalence of false-positive outcomes (biopsies).

For the future work, we will develop the solution to combine our proposed region-based stellate features with other different types of mammographic features (such as texture [10,37] and intensity features [42]). It is believed that this future work would be useful for improving classification or identification performances on malignant masses with dense tissues in mammography. In addition, future work includes extending our proposed method to other different classification tasks of importance in mammography CAD systems, such as the classification of malignant and benign masses or the estimation of the level of malignancy of identified masses in mammography. This extension will enable our current approach to be feasible for a more realistic CAD system to fully meet the requirements for routine clinical examinations.
