@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Bone fractures are among the most common orthopedic injures and extremity fractures represent most frequent of them. The healing of such injures represents a complex regenerative process initiating in response to fracture or to scaffold implantation.

To achieve a complete regeneration and a fully functional bone, many interrelated anatomical, biomechanical and biochemical processes must occur in adequate sequence and mode [1]. Particularly, bone healing typically requires a correct anatomical reduction of the fracture ends, a stable primary fixation and prevention of micromotions at interfaces. While various methods are already utilized for long bone fixation [2–6], an impeccable fixation approach guaranteeing the most efficient healing process has not yet been determined. Noteworthy, existing fixation methods, even the most successful ones, are quite invasive and may induce complications causing long healing times.

The idea of the current study is to propose an innovative method for long bone fixation by incorporating intramedullary magnetic rods. We have previously demonstrated the possibility to apply magnetic forces to osteochondral scaffold fixation [7–9]. Those encouraging results have stimulated current investigation in an attempt to promote the magnetic fixation to the more complicated case of long bone defects.

Intramedullary rods, also known as intramedullary nails, are widely used independently or additionally to other fixation systems like external fixators or orthopedic plates. Fixation of the injured bone without opening of the fracture site reduces the surgical trauma of the periosteum, which has a key role in the fracture healing [4–6]. On the other hand, when fracture site must be opened, for example, to apply a scaffold or an internal orthopedic plate, the implantation of small magnetic rods directly in the fracture site would not require additional cuts, hence in these cases it can be considered as little invasive. We analyze various magnetic configurations and show that the application of magnetic rods can provide advantages with respect to standard intramedullary rods.

The matter was approached theoretically on the basis of detailed calculations and simulations within a finite element method (FEM). The simulations have involved parameters and values as close as possible to real in vivo cases. This allowed to reveal correct data for attractive forces, resulting in numbers that are promising and interesting for real medical applications. This work will be useful to agree on the choice of the magnetic devices and their arrangement in further in vivo experiments, whose realization before similar estimations would have been ethically incorrect.

The forces between two permanent magnets adopted for fracture treatment were calculated analytically in Matlab 7.6 (Matlab R2008b, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) via programs developed by authors on the basis of formulas from [10].

For scaffold application computer modeling with COMSOL 3.5 (Comsol Inc., Stockholm, Sweden) was employed to calculate magnetic forces between different magnetic rods via Maxwell Stress Tensor. The cylindrical symmetry of the studied configurations (see below) permitted to use Multiphysics–Magnetostatics–2D axial symmetry application mode, significantly decreasing the computational time. Nevertheless, the investigation of the lateral displacement between objects required the application of 3D approaches: the AC/DC Module-3D Magnetostatics—No Currents mode was used in this case. Utilizing only half of the studied configurations allowed to refine the mesh as well as to reduce the calculation time.

Due to finite element analysis, the choice of the object mesh is crucial for obtaining correct solutions. The most adequate mesh was specifically identified for all the considered objects choosing appropriate subdomain mesh parameters such as maximum element size and/or element growth rate and using a refine mesh method. For a correct comparison of different magnetic materials the same mesh was utilized for the same geometric configurations. Finally, the modeling involved a sufficiently large air sphere (R=333mm) surrounding the magnetic objects and having magnetic insulation boundary condition.

The use of intramedullary rods spreads from fractures treatment to critical long bone defects, where the latter is often based on scaffold utilization to replace lost/sick bone. 
                        Fig. 1 visualizes two magnetic fixation cases investigated in our study. For fracture treatment we considered two equal cylindrical permanent magnets firmly fixed inside the bones (Fig. 1a). Whereas for scaffold assisted application the considered configuration included one central 30mm long magnetic rod firmly incorporated into the scaffold and two 20mm long magnetic rods fitted into adjacent medullary bone cavities (Fig. 1b).

Although a magnet implantation technique is similar to common intramedullary nailing, the short magnet size (10–20mm) enables its easy insertion directly through the opened injured site without additional osteotomy. A sufficiently rigid fixation of magnetic rods into the bone can be ensured embedding the devices into drilled intramedullary canal of required diameter. After the healing the rods remaining in the bone can be treated similarly to common intramedullary nailing devices.

In order to cover the widest possible range of applications we calculated the fixation forces for three magnetic rod diameters: 4, 8 and 14mm were chosen as applicable to either small arm bones or to big leg bones.

Two magnetic materials were employed in our simulations and calculations: NdFeB permanent magnet with residual magnetization B
                        r=1.2T and stainless steel with saturation magnetization M
                        s=1.4T. For permanent magnets the magnetic field can be described via the relation

                           r
                         is the residual magnet magnetization. The magnetic forces are directly proportional to the square of 
                           B

                           M
                         is the material magnetization. In our simulations we have used experimentally obtained magnetization curve M(H) for stainless steel AISI 410L powder (Institut Hochfeld-Magnetlabor, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Germany).


                        In vivo experiments are beyond the scope of this paper. The paper presents the estimation of the magnetic fixation capability, mandatory before any in vivo experiment. Nevertheless, we show as example data dealing with in vivo investigation of the magnetic scaffold fixation (Fig. 1c) similar to the first of the three considered configurations (Fig. 4a, MAG). In experiment the scaffold was fixed by internal metal plate. Magnetic fixation was added only to one scaffold end to evidence the interfacial magnetic effect on tissue regeneration with respect to purely mechanical fixation at another interface. While these data are not sufficient to be considered as a prove of the above described theoretical achievements, the used image (Fig. 1d, histological test) clearly demonstrates the appeal of such in vivo experiments, indicating good bone regeneration inside the scaffold especially near the magnets.

Moreover, recent publication showed a very good biocompatibility of titanium-coated NdFeB magnets in in vivo experiments. No sites of necrosis or inflammation due to corrosion products or iron toxicity were detected in the bone tissue surrounding magnets at 4 weeks after surgery [8].

It is important to mention, that the magnetic flux density used in our calculations never exceeded the value of the safety strength of 400mT at the body tissue established by ICNIRP (International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection). This value is given by the “Guidelines on Limits of Exposure to Static Magnetic Fields” (2009) and holds for any part of the body, while the exposure limit of limbs is set at 8T. It has to be mentioned nevertheless that in spite of such limitations it was showed that strong static magnetic field (8T) not only reduce cell proliferation, but even stimulate bone formation and regulates its orientation in both in vitro and in vivo models [11].

@&#RESULTS@&#

As a first step for estimating the possibility of the bone retention in fracture we calculated the magnetic attraction forces between two equal coaxial cylindrical permanent magnets of 
                              l=20mm length and diameters 
                              d
                            equal to 4mm (green line with circle markers), 8mm (blue line with square markers) and 14mm (red line with triangle markers) as function of separation distances (
                           Fig. 2a).

The forces increase severely by decreasing distance: the dependence is nearly exponential in the 1–5mm range, and sharpens further below 1mm (see data in the semi-logarithmic scale). For example, for a gap of 0.1mm and magnet diameters of 
                              d=4, 8 and 14mm the forces are about 6, 26 and 75N, respectively.

In the second step we investigated the influence of magnet length on attraction forces for two constant separation distances of 1mm (open markers) and 0.1mm (solid markers) (Fig. 2b). The lowest separation value corresponds to the direct touch of the magnetic objects and is given by the total thickness of the mandatory coating of the magnets. It is possible nevertheless to assess the displacement of two rigid bodies inside bone through radiostereometric analysis (RSA) software and CAD/CAM model of the permanent magnets used as template on biplanar x-rays. This approach, already used in clinical practice, is based on the post-operative analysis compared with subsequent follow-up examinations and allows for the detection of displacement of two rigid bodies inside the bone up to 0.1mm.

It can be seen that the forces tend to saturation by increasing the magnet length. For 20mm magnet length (Fig. 2a case) the attraction forces are practically saturated for magnets of 4mm (green lines with circle markers) and 8mm (blue lines with square markers) diameters and are close to saturation for magnets having diameter of 14mm (red lines with triangle markers) for both considered distances. Hence increasing the magnet length above 20mm does not provide significant advantages for magnetic attraction forces.

In this part we investigated the stability of magnetic configurations and forces between the magnets out of coaxial alignment. 
                           Fig. 3 shows forces between two 20mm long permanent magnets with diameters 4, 8 and 14mm distanced by 0.1mm or 1mm between them. The line colors and markers are chosen similarly to Fig. 2b. The dependence of the radial force component 
                              F
                           
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                            as function of radial displacement 
                              dr
                            is presented in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b illustrates the decrease of axial forces 
                              F
                           
                           
                              
                                 z
                              
                            corresponding to the increasing radial displacement 
                              dr
                           .

By increasing radial displacement the axial forces decrease and further became negative for displacements close to magnet diameter. Thus for large enough lateral displacements the magnetic forces can switch from the axial attraction to a weak axial repulsion. Clearly, such large displacements are not expectable in real orthopedic situations.

On the other hand, radial forces are always negative indicating that the magnets in this configuration are always under radial attraction. Therefore the magnetic force try to return magnets to their initial coaxial position. The maximum radial force is achieved at radial displacements close to magnet radius and it is about 25–30N for magnets with diameter 
                              d
                           =14mm, 7–10N for 
                              d=8mm and 2–3N for 
                              d
                           =4mm. Thus all the involved forces are enhanced by increasing the magnet diameter 
                              d
                            and by decreasing the axial distances 
                              dist
                           .

Moving to scaffold applications we analyzed the possibility to apply the magnetic rods to improve the stability of long bone scaffolds and to reduce the micromotions at the bone–scaffold interfaces. For this purpose we simulated scaffold fixation by magnetic rods with diameters 14mm and lengths 20, 30, 20mm from permanent magnet (Br=1.2T) or from stainless steel (Ms=1.4T) materials in different coaxial configurations.


                           
                           Fig. 4 and 
                           Table 1 describe the following configurations: three permanent magnets (MAG); two permanent magnets and a central stainless steel pin (MSM); two stainless steel pins and a central permanent magnet (SMS).

                            emphasizes the differences between three configurations. Red color corresponds to permanent magnets having the highest magnetic field. Stainless steel rods have cyan color corresponding to lower magnetic field. The pictures out of magnetic configurations excluding regions between magnetic rods are blue, where the magnetic field is close to zero. Color bar at the right side of the Fig. 4a represents the common color scale of 
                              B

                            for the three configurations (color figures can be seen in on-line version).


                           Fig. 4b shows the axial distributions of the magnetic field magnitude for the same three configurations and two distances between the magnetic rods, namely 0.1mm and 1
                           mm. The vertical dashed lines at 
                              z
                           =±15mm correspond to central rod ends. It can be seen that the maximum magnetic field about 1.0–1.2T is confined inside the permanent magnets. The field distribution in the MAG configuration is quite homogeneous (magenta lines with circle markers) especially for small distances between magnets (solid line with open circles). Inside the stainless steel rods magnetic field decreases approximately from 0.8 to 0.4T in the MSM configuration (cyan lines with cross-shaped markers) and from 0.8 to 0.1T in the SMS configuration (gray lines with triangle markers) by moving away from the magnets. For both latter configurations the magnetic field at the interfaces between permanent magnet and stainless steel rod are quite similar, causing alike forces between these objects (Fig. 4b, Table 1). In the MAG configuration the forces are two times or even three times higher with respect to other two configurations (Table 1) due to the higher magnetic field between permanent magnets (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, similarly to the fracture case, for scaffold application the forces between magnetic rods increase by augmenting their diameters and by decreasing distances between them.

Moving the scaffold and hence the central magnetic rod out of the coaxial position, the radial magnetic forces 
                              F
                           
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                            push the system towards the initial alignment. 
                           Fig. 5 shows how these forces change for scaffold lateral displacements 
                              dr
                            ranging from 0 to 10mm out of axis.

Dotted lines correspond to magnetic rod diameter of 4mm, dashed lines to 8mm and solid lines to 14mm respectively. It can be seen that forces in configurations with stainless steel rods (MSM and SMS) are practically indistinguishable except for the largest rods with 14mm diameter: cyan lines with cross-shaped markers stand for MSM, while gray lines with triangle markers correspond to SMS configurations. The maximal magnitude of the radial forces is up to four times higher for MAG configuration (magenta lines with circle markers) with respect to MSM and SMS configurations. In the MAG configuration the gradient of forces is also higher, leading to a faster return of the system towards the initial alignment. Therefore the permanent magnets provide a much higher system stability. It has to be noted that in this case the restoring radial forces acting on the scaffold involve the sum of two interactions at its ends. Radial forces acting on the each magnetic rod fitted into the bone amount to a half of the latter forces and in MAG configuration are very close to the fracture case (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the corresponding axial forces are very comparable to each other (Fig. 3b). Although axial forces decrease faster in MAG configuration than in the two others, they always exceed forces corresponding to MSM and SMS configurations.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

All the analyzed magnetic configurations for bone/scaffold fixation have shown promising results. Generally the knowledge on exact force strength, necessary for an efficient fixation, is lacking and its choice is mainly owed to the surgeon experience. However, considering the substitution of the mechanical fixation with magnetic ones it is evident that even maximal obtained forces about 80N (approximately 8kg) are not sufficient to guaranty a stable fixation under loaded conditions. Nevertheless, while magnetic fixation cannot substitute traditional mechanical one and shall be used additionally in a combined mode, the forces between two permanent magnets in the fracture model can reach considerable values especially for long bones with large medullary canals. Differently from the common intramedullary nailing, these attraction forces act directly at magnet–magnet ends, hence, at bone–bone interfaces, improving thus the bone interface stability also in z-direction. Therefore we expect these axial magnetic forces to reduce the bone–bone relative micromotions, representing quite a crucial problem, especially in the primary post-operative period.

For the scaffold fixation we have compared three configurations using permanent magnets (MAG configuration) and stainless steel rods (MSM and SMS configurations). It was found that axial and radial forces between two permanent magnets exceed by several times the forces between permanent magnet and stainless steel rod, promoting the better fixation and stability in MAG configuration.

As an additional advantage of the magnetic rods with respect to traditional intramedullary rods we shall mention the possibility to induce magneto–mechanical stimulations at the bone/bone or at the bone/scaffold interfaces for fracture and scaffold applications respectively. To estimate this effect we analyze the magnetically provoked pressure between these interfaces for three different magnet diameters, namely 
                        d=4, 8 and 14mm, approximately corresponding to medullary canal size from small upper arm bones to big lower limb bones. Applying two 4mm diameter permanent magnets distanced by 0.1mm to ulna with a cross-section area of about 2.5 cm2 one can generate at the bone/bone interface a pressure about 20kPa. The application of two 14mm diameter permanent magnets to femur fracture with cross-section area about 5
                     cm2 leads to a pressure about 150kPa. Such pressures are known to be beneficial and to stimulate bone regeneration [12,13].

On the other hand, the application of a magnetic field as a treatment to inflammation and regeneration processes is a common and widely used practice, in spite of the significant lack of knowledge and understanding of its basic mechanisms. The magnetic therapy based on low frequency and low intensity pulsed magnetic field is particularly indicated to stimulate fractures healing and to slow down the decrease of bone density caused by osteoporosis [14]. Proposals to use strong static magnetic fields (up to 8T) to improve the bone formation in in vivo and in vitro systems have been also advanced [11].

The last but not the least attractive issue is exemplified by the possibility to guide various bio-agents and drugs by magnetic fields [15]. Targeted drug delivery represents a fascinating therapeutic opportunity. It involves the guiding of medicines directly towards the selected region, avoiding thus their spread in the whole body. Also, a correct and fast bone regeneration requires the provision of the defect region by a sufficient quantity of appropriate bio-agents. Finally, combining magnetic scaffolds with permanent magnets revealed the encouraging capability for a controlled delivery and distribution of various bio-agents inside the scaffold via the magnetic guiding of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles [9,16]. Further investigation of the magnetic fixation effects will strongly rely on the results of the in vitro and especially in vivo experiments, which we believe will be actively stimulated by this paper.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This article illustrates for the first time the innovative method for long bone fixation by magnetic rods. Both fracture and scaffold applications have been analyzed in detail. We found that magnetic fixation of long bone is potentially very promising. Magnetic rods generate significant attraction forces supporting bone and scaffold fixation, their mechanical stimulation and reducing micromotions at interfaces. Furthermore the presence of magnetic field can accelerate the bone regeneration process leading to a faster achieved general wellbeing. Preliminary in vivo results confirmed the perspectiveness of the proposed solutions and advocate for further investigations.
