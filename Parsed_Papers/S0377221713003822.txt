                  A Markowitz-type portfolio selection problem is to minimize a deviation measure of portfolio rate of return subject to constraints on portfolio budget and on desired expected return. In this context, the inverse portfolio problem is finding a deviation measure by observing the optimal mean-deviation portfolio that an investor holds. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a deviation measure are established. It is shown that if the deviation measure exists, it can be chosen in the form of a mixed CVaR-deviation, and in the case of n risky assets available for investment (to form a portfolio), it is determined by a combination of (n
                     +1) CVaR-deviations. In the later case, an algorithm for constructing the deviation measure is presented, and if the number of CVaR-deviations is constrained, an approximate mixed CVaR-deviation is offered as well. The solution of the inverse portfolio problem may not be unique, and the investor can opt for the most conservative one, which has a simple closed-form representation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Understanding and modeling of individual risk preferences has long been a central venue in decision sciences, finance, and economics. A general approach is to introduce a system of axioms on preference relations that agree with “rational” behavior and then to construct a numerical equivalent (representation) to that system, so that given a choice of several random variables, a decision maker compares only their numerical equivalents. For example, the celebrated von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory [12] introduces axioms of completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence and shows that the decision maker needs to deal only with expected utilities. A change in the system of axioms leads to another numerical equivalent that results in possibly different decisions. Since Neumann and Morgenstern’s seminal work [12], similar choice theories such as the prospect theory [7], the dual utility theory [20], and the regret theory have emerged. However, none of their axiomatic systems are in complete agreement with empirical evidence, which is known as axiom violations or paradoxes. Even if a particular decision maker does agree on a proposed system of axioms on preference relations, still there is a wide class of possible numerical equivalents (utility functions) that represent the system, so that finding a particular numerical equivalent amounts to a tedious questionnaire procedure. A different approach was proposed by Markowitz [10], who suggested that portfolios of risky assets can be ordered at least partially based on two quantities: mean and standard deviation of portfolio rate of return. The approach reduces mean–variance portfolio selection to a simple quadratic programming problem and also leads to a convenient capital asset pricing model (CAPM). However, the simplicity of this approach has proved to be both its advantage and disadvantage. The extensive body of empirical and theoretical research shows that standard deviation is hardly an appropriate measure of risk and that a market portfolio, predicted by the mean–variance approach to be held by all investors, is only a theoretical concept (a real market index does not follow from the mean–variance approach). General measures of deviation introduced by Rockafellar et al. [14,15] address main shortcomings of standard deviation: they are not symmetrical with respect to ups and downs of a random variable and provide sufficient flexibility in customizing individual risk preferences. Let a random variable X represent the portfolio return. A Markowitz-type portfolio selection problem replaces standard deviation by a general deviation measure

                      is a feasible set of portfolio returns. Rockafellar et al. [17,16] generalized the one-fund theorem and CAPM, originally established for (1) with standard deviation, for an arbitrary deviation measure. Also, if each investor believes in the mean-deviation paradigm [4] and has a corresponding deviation measure as a numerical representation of his/her risk preferences then there exists a market equilibrium (see [18]), and, moreover, a group of investors can form a cooperative portfolio that satisfies (1) with a “cooperative” deviation measure (see [5]). However, as in the aforementioned utility theories and in contrast to the Markowitz’s mean–variance approach, a variety of deviation measures brings the question of choosing appropriate deviation measure for each investor. Partially, this question was answered in [3] by establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the class of alpha-concave distributions and the class of comonotone deviation measures via the maximum entropy principle. However, the resulting deviation measure reflected the “average” preferences (of the market as a whole) rather than preferences of an individual investor.

A different perspective to this question could be offered through an inverse approach. Instead of agonizing over idealized postulates of rational behavior, an investor can identify his/her risk preferences in the form of a set of benchmarks (portfolios, financial instruments, assets, etc.) that he/she is relatively satisfied with. This work solves the inverse portfolio problem: given a convex set of bounded portfolio returns 
                        
                           V
                        
                      and a portfolio return

                     . An approximate solution to this problem was given in [8], where a set of feasible deviation measures was confined to linear combinations of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) deviations for certain risk-tolerance levels or, equivalently, to so-called mixed CVaR-deviations. However, an approximate

                      substantially depends on the choice of the risk-tolerance levels and on an error measure for residuals. Here, it is proved that “exact”

                      may not be unique, and it is suggested that in this case, the investor takes the supremum over all possible deviation measures 
                        
                           D

                     . Remarkably, this supremum admits a simple closed-form representation in the form similar to a worst-case mixed-CVaR deviation. In addition, given T scenarios for asset returns, an algorithm for finding

                      in (1) in the form of mixed CVaR-deviations is provided, and if the number of CVaR-deviations is constrained, an alternative approach to constructing an approximate deviation measure is also presented.

This work is organized into seven sections. Section 2 reviews basic notions of general deviation measures. Section 3 formulates and solves the inverse portfolio problem. Section 4 addresses the inverse problem for scenario-based portfolio selection. Section 5 finds an approximate deviation measure in the form of mixed CVaR-deviation with specified number of risk-tolerance levels. Section 6 constructs a risk-envelope representation for a non law-invariant deviation measure provided that law-invariant one does not exists. Section 7 concludes the work.

                           Originally, in [15], averse measures of risk were called strictly expectation bounded risk measures.

                         Examples of lower range dominated deviation measures include lower semideviation, lower range deviation, CVaR-deviation, and mixed CVaR-deviation. Nonnegative risk envelopes offer a powerful modeling tool: given T scenarios for asset returns with historical probabilities p

Suppose an investor believes that his/her risk preferences are consistent with the mean-deviation approach, i.e. he/she prefers instruments’ rates of return with higher means and lower deviations, and suppose the investor is relatively satisfied with a given rate of return X
                        ∗, so that X
                        ∗ can be assumed to represent the rate of return of investor’s optimal portfolio. This is a typical situation at a pension fund, when the investor, being presented with several predetermined portfolios (investment “schemes”), choses just one of them based on his/her risk preferences. Now, the question is what deviation measure 
                           
                              D
                           
                         produces X
                        ∗ through the portfolio problem (1). In addition, 
                           
                              D
                           
                         is desired to be law invariant and to be defined for all possible distributions, which is equivalent to 
                           
                              D
                           
                         being Schur convex (see Proposition 2.4 in [3]). This is an inverse portfolio problem that can be formulated as follows.

                         is required to be proper. Once the investor determines 
                           
                              D
                           
                         from Problem 1, he/she can use it in (1) with a different set 
                           
                              V
                           
                        , e.g. with different instruments and different constraints on portfolio weights.

First, we characterize portfolio rates of return that cannot be optimal in (1) and then establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to Problem 1.

The deviation measure (20) solves Problem 1 in the form of worst-case mixed-CVaR deviation (5). However, it may not be a unique solution in this form and in deviation measures that do not admit the representation (5). In this case, the investor may take the supremum over all possible solutions of Problem 1. Since any solution

The deviation measure (24) is finite for any bounded X and is +∞ for any unbounded X.

In contrast to (22), the deviation measure (24) does not depend on the set 
                                 
                                    V
                                 
                              , which is a substantial advantage. For example, if no-shorting constraints are added to (13), then the optimality conditions (14) may no longer hold, and as a result, the deviation (22) that follows from (14)–(20) may be meaningless.

The deviation measure (24) can be represented in the form

                      is a set of linear constraints for portfolio weights, then (30) admits a linear programming (LP) formulation.

Similarly, through the formula (29), the portfolio problem (1) with the worst-case mixed-CVaR deviation in the form (22) and with 
                        
                           V
                        
                      being a set of linear constraints for portfolio weights can be reduced to an LP problem.

For discrete random variables, the proof of Proposition 4 yields the following result.

On the other hand, the mean-deviation portfolio problem (1) is inappropriate for risk seeking investors. Several algorithms are available for testing of whether solutions to portfolio optimization with n assets and T scenarios are SSD-efficient; see e.g. [9]. Thus, the inverse portfolio Problem 1 can be solved by the following algorithm.

                        Example 4
                        numerical illustration


                        We consider a risk-free asset with zero rate of return and 91 assets from the FTSE 100 index
                              6
                              There are 94 assets in the index, and three assets EVRAZ, Glencore Intl, and Polymetal Intl are excluded because of the lack of data.
                           
                           
                              6
                            with weekly rates of return from 3-January-2011 to 4-March-2013. The set 
                              
                                 V
                              
                            is assumed to be in the form (13). The algorithm in [9] shows that the index is dominated by SSD on 
                              
                                 V
                              
                           . In this case, one may construct an SSD-efficient portfolio either by the algorithm in [9] starting from the index or as described in [22]. Yet another way is to find an optimal mean–variance portfolio, which will be SSD-efficient. We proceed with the latter approach. With X
                           ∗ being the rate of return of the optimal mean–variance portfolio consisting of the specified 91 assets, the system (32)–(34) is solved to find weights λ
                           1,…,
                           λ
                           
                              T−1 in (31). Fig. 1
                            shows the risk profile g, which is determined by (11) and plays the role of a dual utility function [20,19] in the representation (8). Once λ
                           1,…,
                           λ
                           
                              T−1 in the mixed CVaR-deviation (31) are determined, we can now solve the portfolio problem (1), which in the discrete case and with 
                              
                                 V
                              
                            being a set of linear constraints for portfolio weights reduces to the LP problem (37). However, the found λ
                           1,…,
                           λ
                           
                              T−1 are not unique, and “to be safe,” we can use either the worst-case deviation measure in the form (26) or the worst-case mixed-CVaR deviation (22) with given X
                           ∗.

As in Proposition 5, let Problem 1 have a unique solution D
                     ∗ in the form (4). If the corresponding weighting measure λ
                     ∗ in (4) is not simple, an approximate solution to Problem 1 can be sought in the form (10).

Determining an approximate solution requires a metric on the space of deviation measures, which can be introduced by

The problem of identifying investor’s deviation measure in the mean-deviation portfolio problem (1) based on observing the rate of return of investor’s portfolio has been solved. This inverse problem assumes that investor’s portfolio is an optimal solution to (1) for some deviation measure. A necessary and sufficient condition for the inverse problem to have a law-invariant solution has been established. Proposition 4 shows that if a given portfolio is ≻
                        s
                     -undominated, then a solution always exists and has the form of mixed CVaR-deviation (4); otherwise, the inverse problem has no law-invariant solution. If the solution is not unique, the investor may choose the worst-case solution given by (24). Also, Proposition 5 proves that in general, if the inverse problem is required to have a solution, mixed CVaR-deviations (4) represent the smallest feasible set of deviation measures. However, if the portfolio problem (1) has n assets with T scenarios for assets’ rates of return, a solution to the inverse problem can always be chosen in the form of a mixed CVaR-deviation with no more than min{T
                     −1,n
                     +1} CVaR-deviations. When the number of CVaR-deviations is constrained, an approximate mixed CVaR-deviation is provided as well. Finally, if a given portfolio is not ≻
                        s
                     -undominated, and law-invariant solution does not exists, a non law-invariant solution is presented in the dual form (6) with the risk-envelope
