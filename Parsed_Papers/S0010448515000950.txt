                  We present a precise contact motion planning algorithm for a deformable robot in a planar environment with stationary obstacles. The robot and obstacles are both represented with 
                        
                           
                              C

                     -continuous implicit or parametric curves. The robot is changing its shape using a single degree of freedom (via a one-parameter family of deformable curves). In order to reduce the dimensionality of the configuration space, geometrically constrained yet collision free contact motions are sought, that have 
                        K
                        
                           (

                      simultaneous tangential contact points between the robot and the obstacles. The 
                        K
                     -contact motion analysis effectively reduces the degrees of freedom of the robot, which enables a more efficient motion planning. The geometric conditions for the 
                        K
                     -contact motions can be formulated as a system of non-linear polynomial equations, which can be solved precisely using a multivariate equation solver. The solutions for 
                        K
                     -contact motions are represented as curves in a 4-dimensional

                      space, where 
                        x
                        ,
                        y

                      are the degrees of freedom of the rigid motion and 
                        t
                      is the deformation’s parameter. Using the graph structure of the solution curves for the 
                        K
                     -contact motions, our algorithm efficiently finds a feasible path connecting two configurations via a graph searching algorithm, whenever available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of collision-avoidance in robot motion planning has been an active research area over the last several decades. Remarkable progress has been achieved in numerous practical applications. However, relatively few results were introduced for the case of deformable robots, even though potentially many applications can benefit from the added degrees of freedom. The deformation ability of the robot provides more flexibility in the motion planning and enables the successful navigation of more challenging tasks that cannot be accomplished by rigid robots. Actual designs of deformable robots already exist, i.e.  [1]. On the other hand, more degrees of freedom in the robot exponentially increase the complexity of motion planning algorithms. As a consequence, it is very difficult to find feasible motions in a reasonable amount of time.

The geometry of deformable robots and their environments are often designed with Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces, which is the de facto standard representation for industrial objects. Yet, the majority of contemporary algorithms for motion planning first tessellate the freeform NURBS curves and surfaces, as they can handle only piecewise linear discrete objects. The errors caused by the polygonal approximation are difficult to control. Moreover, it is non-trivial to precisely manage the collision detections (in particular when dealing with contact motions) using these polygonal approximations. Thus, it is highly desirable to directly process the NURBS curves and surfaces for applications requiring high accuracy.

In this paper, we consider the precise (up to machine precision) contact motion planning for a deformable planar parametric or implicit freeform

                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           )
                        
                     , and one rigid motion degree of freedom in rotation, 
                        θ
                     . Finally, the last degree of freedom 
                        t
                      provides the shape control over the robot’s deformation function 
                        
                           
                              Φ
                           
                           
                              t
                           
                        
                     . The configuration space (C-space) is thus a 4-dimensional space, in 
                        
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           ,
                           θ
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                        
                     .

A naive approach for planning the motion of such a deformable robot is to compute the entire boundary of the C-space’s obstacle which can be represented as an implicit 3-manifold, 
                        f
                        
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           ,
                           θ
                           ,
                           t
                           )
                        
                        =
                        0
                     , and use this 3-manifold for the motion planning. The optimal motion path may then be computed by considering all possible motion paths over the entire boundary of the obstacle’s C-space. Clearly, computing and even representing the entire 3-manifold solution is expected to be highly challenging. It is indeed inefficient and in fact unnecessary to compute the entire boundary of the C-space, because the robot typically follows a univariate motion path and thus only a small portion of the C-space is used for the motion planning.

Therefore, instead of computing the entire C-space, we focus on analyzing contact motions that satisfy additional geometric constraints so that the dimension of the computed solution can be significantly reduced. Toward this end, we seek the collision free motion of a (deformable) robot

                           )
                        
                      while it maintains multiple tangential contacts, typically two or three, with obstacles 
                        D

                     . We denote such motions 
                        K
                        
                           (

                              -contact motion analysis often provides a good solution for narrow passage problems, because there is a high probability for the robot to have multiple contact points in such narrow passages. Fig. 1

Algorithms for motion planning of deformable robots are typically based on the probabilistic road-map (PRM) approach  [2]. A PRM planner samples random points in the C-space and generates an approximated C-space graph by connecting adjacent sample points. Then, the planner finds a feasible motion by connecting these points on the graph via a graph searching algorithm. The performance and quality of PRM based algorithms is heavily dependent on the sampling strategy. Guibas et al.  [3] proposed an efficient motion planning algorithm for flexible objects. By deforming the robot as closely as possible to the medial axis of the workspace, the algorithm successfully finds critical deformations and effectively reduces the deformation space. However, the medial axis computation for 3D objects is computationally expensive and fitting the object to the 3D medial axis is non-trivial. Bayazit et al.  [4] sampled configurations that might cause inter-penetration into the obstacles and then generated a collision-free path by locally deforming the robot. The deformation of the robot is employed only for preventing the inter-penetration of the robot and thus limits the exploration of the deformation space. Gayle et al.  [5] developed a practical algorithm for motion planning of deformable robots in complex environments, which can take into account geometric and physical constraints. The deformation of the robot should satisfy some imposed constraints that are formulated as an energy minimization problem and be solved via an optimization algorithm. This optimization can be inefficient if the geometry of the robot and the environments are not similar. Mahoney et al.  [6] tackled the problem of motion planning of deformable robot by reducing the dimension of the deformation space via principal component analysis over the deformation space. The entire deformation space is reduced to the subspace spanned by a small number of basis elements and the degrees of freedom in C-space are significantly reduced. The problem is that, in many cases, the reduced deformation space suffers from narrow passages of the obstacles.

The above results focus on polygonal representation and typically produce approximate solutions. The previous work on precise motion planning for NURBS curves and surfaces is limited. Bajaj and Kim  [7–9] considered the generation of C-space obstacles for translational motions of rigid algebraic curves and surfaces. For the case of a rigid planar freeform shapes moving (with translation only) among similar static freeform curves in the plane, Lee et al.  [10] presented a high-precision algorithm that can approximate the boundary of the obstacle’s C-space using B-spline planar curves. Holleman et al.  [11] and Lamiraux et al.  [12] applied a PRM planner for path planning of flexible surface patches modeled with low degree Bézier surfaces. Holleman et al.  [11] enforced a desired deformation of the surface by formulating the energy function and Lamiraux et al.  [12] handled a specialized deformation having only one degree of freedom. Milenkovic et al.  [13,14] developed a robust algorithm for constructing the C-space obstacles for a rigid planar moving object and obstacles bounded by circular arcs. Recently, Kim et al.  [15] presented an algorithm for computing the precise contact motion between rigid planar freeform curves. In this work, we extend the approach of Kim et al.  [15] to the case of deformable robot.

Designing the proper deformation of the robot is crucial for the generation of feasible motions. We employ shape morphing techniques (also known as metamorphosis) for designing the deformation of the robot. The algorithms for shape morphing can be classified into two main categories: parametric correspondence and interpolation  [16,17] and implicit function interpolation [18,19]. The parametric methods directly interpolate two (or more) shapes using the correspondence between them and are therefore relatively faster and more efficient than methods for implicit functions. On the other hand, implicit methods interpolate the implicit representations of shapes and have no constraints on the topological similarity of the deformed shapes (see Fig. 2
                      for an example). The motion planning algorithm for deformable robots that we present in this work can handle both types of shape deformation interpolations.

The presented algorithms for motion planning of continuous NURBS curves and surfaces involve solving a system of non-linear equations. Based on the analytical representation of NURBS, the desired geometric constraints can be converted to a set of implicit multivariate equations via symbolic computation. Sherbrooke and Patrikalakis  [20] proposed an early subdivision-based approach for solving a system of multivariate equations. Elber and Kim  [21] and Hanniel and Elber  [22] improved the subdivision based method by introducing a simple termination condition into the subdivision process. Barton et al.  [23] presented an efficient algorithm for handling the special case of univariate solution spaces. In this work, we employ the approach of  [23] to solve the presented systems of non-linear constraints.

We consider two general ways of prescribing a planar deforming shape, algebraically. Parametric forms are blended to generate a parametric deformed shape, and implicit forms are also blended to generate implicits under deformation. We briefly discuss both approaches below.

Implicit blends have the advantage that they may change the topology as a part of the deformation; thus, the two shapes

Both the parametric and implicit deformation forms yield algebraic constraints that can be exploited in this work. This ability will be demonstrated in the coming sections. In the ensuing discussion, we assume the deformable robots are always smooth and regular.

There exist special cases where the constraints for the 
                        K
                     -contact configuration are dependent on each other. Consider a 2-contact motion between a rigid unit circle and two parallel line segments (Fig. 3
                     ). Then, we have the following four constraint equations to represent this

                      and thus it is supposed to have a univariate solution set. However, in this case, the robot can rotate in place or slide left/right while maintaining a 2-contact configuration. As a result, this system of algebraic equations has a bivariate solution space. Special cases, with dependent constraint equations near/at zeros, are referred to as singularities. In the rest of this paper, we assume that there are no singularities in the constraint systems for the

In the following sections, we present an efficient algorithm for computing these 2- and 3-contact motions.

The graph we build consists of 2- and 3-contact motions. We first compute the 2-contact motion curves for a rigid robot, fixing the deformation parameter as 
                        t
                        =
                        
                           
                              t

                     . For the sake of simplicity, we assume 
                        
                           
                              Φ

                              )

                     . The 2-contact motion curves are derived using the algorithm described in Kim et al.  [15]. We then compute the necessary 3-contact motion curves based on the results of 2-contact motion analysis. In this section, we briefly review the algorithm of Kim et al.  [15] only to discuss how to extend this algorithm to the case of 3-contact motion, for a deformable robot.

                         can be characterized as the self-intersections of the 2-manifold boundary of the C-space obstacle. Each of these self-intersection curve segments has two end points that correspond to 3-contact configurations between

                        . The 2-contact motion curves thus have a layout which can be represented in a graph structure, where each vertex corresponds to a 3-contact configuration and each edge corresponds to a 2-contact motion curve. (See Fig. 4
                        ).

If the 2-contact motion graph of a rigid robot has disconnected components (see the leftmost column, in Fig. 8), there is no valid 2-contact motion that connects these isolated components. In such a case, it is impossible for a rigid robot to move between the disconnected components. However, we may connect these disconnected components by allowing the robot to deform. Then, the univariate solution space for the 2-contact motion expands to a bivariate solution space, having 
                           t
                         as a new degree of freedom.

To take advantage of the possibility of robot deformation while aiming to keep the univariate graph structure of the motion space, we employ a 3-contact motion analysis for deformable robots. As pointed out in Section  4, the 3-contact motion analysis for a robot with a one-parameter family of deformations also has a univariate solution space. Hence, this analysis can provide a new type of collision-free contact motion which involves simultaneous deformations of the robot. Indeed and as will be shown later on, in many cases, this deformable robot’s 3-contact motion is able to connect disconnected components of the rigid robot 2-contact motion graph (see the second column from the left, in Fig. 8). In this section, we present the algorithm for computing these deformable robot’s 3-contact motions, based on the result of the 2-contact motion graph of Kim et al.  [15].

As discussed in Sections  4 and 5, the algebraic constraints for 3-contact planar motion of a deformable robot have seven equations with eight variables

Due to its high dimensionality and the corresponding large solution space, we strive to exploit the 2-contact motion analysis for a rigid robot as much as possible, and resort to a 3-contact analysis over a deformable robot only when necessary, achieving a better performance. The 2-contact motion graph for a rigid robot includes 3-contact configurations as vertices of the graph. These 3-contact configurations are locations where the rigid robot is tangential to the obstacle, in three different places. We will take these 3-contact configurations as the locations where the deformable robot is tangential to the obstacle, in three different places, when

In other words, we use these 3-contact configurations as seed points for tracing the 3-contact deformable robot motion, by solving the algebraic constraint equations for 3-contact motions of the deformable robot, in the local neighborhood of these seed points, for which

We repeat this tracing procedure, solving algebraic equations for one sub-domain and then deciding the next sub-domain to solve, until the traced 3-contact motion curve meets one of several terminal points which are described in the next section.

Typical terminal points for the 3-contact motion curve of a deformable robot is a 4-contact configuration location (see Fig. 5
                           (a)). The 4-contact configuration is realized when the robot undergoing a 3-contact motion gets in a tangential contact with the obstacle in a fourth location. The algebraic conditions for this 4-contact configuration can be formulated using Eqs. (7), for

During the 3-contact motion computation, we keep checking whether the robot has any collision with the obstacle. The inter-penetration of the robot can be checked by computing the intersection point between the robot and the obstacle. Since the robot already has three tangential contacts with the obstacle, we check if the tangent directions at the intersection point are parallel or not, to distinguish the current three tangent points from the new intersection point.

Once we detect an inter-penetration at

                            are the parameters of the inter-penetration location (see the blue points in Fig. 5(b)). We then solve the algebraic equations for the 4-contact configuration in the domain

Similarly to the 2-contact motion curve of a rigid robot, the 3-contact motion curve of a deformable robot has singular terminal points in the form of order-four (curvature derivative) contact points. The curvature derivative contact configuration is realized when two different contact points merge to a single location. Fig. 6
                            shows one example of an order-four terminal contact. Two order-two (tangential) contact locations coalesce into one order-four (curvature derivative) contact. We can formulate this event by the following three equations in three variables

We start from the seed points which are 3-contact vertices in the graph of the 2-contact motion of rigid robot, solve the algebraic constraints for the 3-contact motion curve of a deformable robot in the local neighborhood of these seed points and trace the 3-contact motion. When a terminal 4-contact configuration is reached during this tracing, we must fork out multiple branches for new traces. We now explain this forking-out process.

When a rigid planar robot is in a 3-contact with its obstacle(s), there are three different 2-contact motion routes that the robot can get out without collision. This is because there are

                            different ways to select 2-contact points out of the three (without repetitions). When we trace a 2-contact motion to a terminal 3-contact configuration, we already exhausted one such path (where we came from) and so two new paths are to be forked and traced out. Similarly, a deformable planar robot in a 4-contact configuration with its obstacle(s) has 
                              4
                              =

                            different ways to select a 3-contact. One path (where we came from) is again already exhausted and so three new paths are to be forked out and traced from every 4-contact location of a deformable robot. As is shown in Fig. 7
                           , typically four 3-contact motion curves branch out from the 4-contact configuration location.

Finally, when the 3-contact traced motion curve of a deformable robot terminates at the curvature derivative contact or at an extreme deformation point (i.e., 
                              t
                              =
                              0
                            or 1), we simply stop the tracing process.

When solving the entire constraint system via a multivariate equation solver  [23], one can guarantee to find all solutions up to some prescribed tolerance. On the other hand, when we locally trace the 3-contact motion, we examine a considerably smaller domain space while we are not guaranteed to find all possible 3-contact motions. However, it effectively finds 3-contact motions that connect the fully disclosed but possibly disconnected 2-contact univariate components in the C-space (solved using  [23]).

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We have implemented the presented contact motion planning algorithm for deformable robots in C++ and using the IRIT solid modeling system  [24] on an Intel Core i7 3.4 GHz PC with 32 GB main memory. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we performed the motion planning for obstacles having narrow passages.


                     Fig. 8
                     (a)–(d) shows four examples. The first three examples employ a parametrically defined robot while the last example, in Fig. 8(d), shows an example of an implicitly defined robot. In the leftmost column, the 2-contact motion graph of a rigid robot is shown. This graph has disconnected components. The second column from the left augments the 2-contact graph with 3-contact motion paths of a deforming robot (in red) which connects the isolated components. The three columns on the right show samples of the computed motion using the combined 2- and 3-contact motion. Using the graph structure of 2- and 3-contact motions and Dijkstra’s algorithm  [25], non-trivial motion paths can be efficiently computed.


                     Table 1
                      presents some statistics for these four examples. To compare our local tracing algorithm for 3-contact motions with a general algorithm (that is based on all possible constraints), we solved the entire system of equations for Example 2 (shown in Fig. 8(b)) which is the fastest among all test examples considered in this work. Because the construction of an entire system of equations requires a huge amount of memory space, which is far beyond the capability of modern workstations, we had to subdivide input curves into Bézier pieces and then constructed a system of equations for each sub-domain. It took about 295 h to solve the entire domain and it is more than 70 times slower than our local tracing algorithm. We report the average fraction of examined domain for each variable. The domain for each variable including 
                        θ
                      is scaled to 
                        
                           [
                           0

                      and thus the entire domain space can be represented as

                      is the dimension of the space of the domain) of the summation. As can be seen from the results, our algorithm examined less than 5% of each dimension of the domain on average, which means that the domain examined by our algorithm is less than

Even though our algorithm examined only a tiny fraction of the entire domain, enabling a significant performance improvement, the computation times are still in the range of many hours. Nevertheless, the algorithm effectively and precisely produced 3-contact motions that connect disconnected components of the rigid robot 2-contact motion graph.

The results are also presented in a video   [26] that shows the animated version of our four examples (Fig. 8(a)–(d)). Again, the first three examples employ parametrically defined deformable robots whereas the last example (d) employs an implicitly defined deformable robot. The pink curve on the right shows the computed continuous motion path connecting the start (in blue) and goal (in red) configurations employing Dijkstra’s algorithm  [25]. The deformable robot (in yellow) on the left undergoes the computed continuous contact motion that consists of 2- and 3-contact motions (and hence includes deformations) from the start configuration to the goal configuration.

The motion of our deformable robot is fully determined by Dijkstra’s algorithm. The algorithm does not distinguish between 2- and 3-contact motions and it simply finds a sequence of edges connecting the start and goal configurations from the graph structure of 2/3 contact motions. By following the sequence of 2- and 3-contact motions, the robot undergoes either rigid transformations or deformations, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

In this work, we have extended previous results on motion planning for rigid robots to a generalized approach that supports deformable robots. This extension is based on the representation of deformable robots using one-parameter family of deformations. Algebraic methods played a major role in this work, an approach that yields high accuracy in the order of machine precision. More importantly, based on the ability of the exploited multivariate solver  [21–23] that ensures finding all real solutions, we can guarantee that the configuration space will be exhaustively analyzed, and thus always finds a feasible motion if one exists, up to the prescribed tolerance. While the presented algorithms are slow and requires hours and days of computations, they all used a single thread. Parallelizing the solver is possible and can clearly reduce the computing time. Another possible consideration for optimization is the optimal 
                        δ
                      value to be used in the local tracing. One can also consider further optimizations via the use of different 
                        δ
                      values for each variable, which potentially reduce the domain size of the system of equations.

Our algorithm effectively addresses a narrow passage problem which is typically the most challenging part of the motion planning. On the other hand, it cannot handle open regions where there exist no 2/3 contact motions. These open regions can be effectively handled by using other well-known algorithms such as a probabilistic road map (PRM)  [2] or a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT)  [27]. However, there are several technical issues that must be resolved before applying these sampling based algorithms to 
                        
                           
                              C

                      continuous implicit or parametric curves. For example, collision test for the straight line in the C-space connecting two collision free configurations is non-trivial and it is even more difficult to check the condition efficiently. Therefore, combining our work with other sampling based method requires a further in-depth research and analysis.

Clearly one can consider more than one degree of freedom in the deformation function of the robot. In fact, the tangible robot of  [1] can have several independent degrees of freedom. Let

                     , a univariate is prescribed. While the complexity of solvers  [21–23] is exponential in the dimension, the algebraic structure of the problem is clear. One can hope that this algebraic configuration can be exploited, as in the local behaviors scheme exploited in this work, reducing the dimensionality and exploiting the deformations’ full degrees of freedom only when they are really needed.

Similarly, one should also consider handling piecewise
