                  Introduction
                  Restenosis is strongly attributed to stresses caused by stent–artery interactions generated in the artery after balloon angioplasty. Numerical methods are often used to examine the stent–artery mechanical interactions. To overcome the extensive computational requirements demanded by these simulations, simplifications are needed.
               
               
                  Objective
                  We introduce simplified models to calculate the mechanical interactions between net-structured stents and arteries, and discuss their validity and implications.
               
               
                  Methods
                  2D simplified numerical models are suggested, which allow cost effective assessment of arterial stresses and the potential damage factor (DF). In these models, several contact problems were solved for arteries with hyper elastic mechanical properties. Stresses were calculated for a large range of cases and for different numerical model types. The effects of model simplifications, oversizing mismatch and stenosis rate and length and symmetry on the resulting stresses were analyzed.
               
               
                  Results & conclusions
                  Results obtained from planar 2D models were found in good agreement with results obtained from complex 3D models for cases with axisymmetric constant or varying stenosis. This high correlation between the results of 3D cases with varying stenosis and the more simple 2D cases can be used as a simplified and convenient tool for calculating the arterial wall stresses in complex cases. Maximal stresses obtained by the 2D model with an asymmetric stenosis are lower than the maximal stresses obtained in the axisymmetric case with the same stenosis percentage. Therefore, axisymmetric models may provide the worst-case estimation values for a stent of interest.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During stent implantation, the mismatch between the stent and the artery diameters cause elevated stress in the arterial wall, leading to local injury of the artery. These stent induced arterial injuries and stresses are believed to be a determining factor in the onset and progression of in-stent restenosis [1]. After stent deployment, artery injury by the stent׳s struts leads to thrombus formation and a cascade of inflammatory events [2]. Inflammation caused by the above mentioned arterial injury plays a central role in the formation of a new layer of scar tissue (neointima) further narrowing the arterial lumen and increasing the risk for restenosis [3–5]. The developing stresses in the artery wall are major contributors to neointima formation, even in the absence of deep injury [6,7].

Studies have shown that stent design including its geometric dimensions and mechanical properties are important factors in the clinical outcomes [8]. In the context of stent optimization, the design objective is to minimize the stress level in the arterial wall following stent deployment [9,10]. Computational models of stent deployment, such as finite element (FE) models, may serve as powerful and cost effective tools for optimizing stent designs. FE methods enable investigation of specific design parameters, or allow comparison between different designs, using a vast range of criteria for stent performance. FE models can be utilized to reduce arterial injury or to assess the potential risk of injury in the early design phase and hence minimize in-stent restenosis [8,11–17]. Strut thickness, for example, was found as an independent predictor of restenosis. Stents with thinner struts have a lower restenosis rate, while stents with thicker struts induce higher stresses within the artery wall [18–20].

When modeling an interaction between a stent and an artery, many challenges arise, among them, the construction of arterial model geometry, the complex contact interaction and the material properties [21]. To overcome these challenges, several simplified methods have been suggested [2]. Zahedmanesh et al. showed that direct application of pressure to the stent inner surface may be used as a good approximation for blood pressure [22]. Auriccio et al. focused on the interaction between a balloon expanded stent and the artery, suggesting a modified design of the stent to reduce the nonuniformity of the contact stress distribution [23]. In previous studies, our group focused on the mechanical interaction between the stent and artery using analytical and numerical models [24–27]. These studies assessed the effect of stent and arterial geometric and mechanical properties on the distribution of stresses developed at the stent–artery interface.

Many studies have used FE models to investigate the effect of plaque composition [10,21,23,28–31], or to simulate the arterial biological response [11,31]. To overcome the extensive computational requirements that these simulations demand, such studies used 2D models to estimate the stresses acting on the arterial wall. Zahedmanesh et al. [2] used an axisymmetric hyperelastic FE model of an artery to employ the biological response to an implant using mechanobiological models. In their model, the stents struts were represented using a simple square cross section pressed against the artery wall, neglecting the stiffness of the stent structure and the effect of stent oversizing. In addition, their model considered the beam as perpendicular to the axial axis, while in reality it is mainly parallel. Boyle et al. [32] used a more realistic 2D geometry of axisymmetric artery and stent cross-section of a symmetrically stenosed artery with six stent struts. A 1/6 segment was considered due to symmetry. The stents beams were represented by circular cross sections. In their model, a displacement was applied to the circular strut, neglecting the stiffness of the stent structure and the effect of stent oversizing. Teodorescu et al. [33] used 2D models to predict the arterial wall subsurface stress field due to individual stent beams cross sections. In their models, they compared squared and circular cross sections for modeling stent struts, revealing the effect of sharp edges on stress concentrations. For the contact mechanics, they used a method which decomposes the contact pressure distribution into a series of harmonic waves that predicts the subsurface stress and strain fields for each harmonic [34].

However, we did not find any study discussing the validity of these 2D simplifications and their correlation with more realistic 3D models. In the present study, we propose simplified models for net-structured stents which are inserted into asymmetric stenosed arteries, containing two hyper elastic layers and discuss their validity and their implications. 2D simplified numerical models are also suggested. This allows for a cost effective assessment of arterial stresses and the stent׳s potential damage for a wide range of cases.

We used simplified models for net-structured self-expanding stents to evaluate the developing stress in the arterial wall. A potential damage factor was formulated, describing these stresses. DF was calculated for a large range of cases and for different numerical model types. The effects of model simplifications, oversizing mismatch and stenosis rate, length and symmetry on DF values were also analyzed.

@&#METHODS@&#

The models in this study focus on net-structured stents. Net-structured stents are commonly used in many different stent types such as Driver™, BioMatrix™, Promus™ (for coronary arteries) and SciMed™ (for peripheral arteries), among others. These stent types are characterized by a periodic structure of beams in alternating directions (zigzag).

To assess the potential risk of stress induced restenosis due to a specific artery-stent configuration, a criteria index defined by Brand et al. [26] defined as damage factor, was used in this study. This factor is defined as the average radial stress in the contact region, normalized by blood pressure, i.e.

                        (i) is the circumferential stress in the artery at node i.

The numerical simulations included a thorough investigation of stresses developed in the artery wall due to self-expanded stent implantation with different oversizing values. Four different models were examined: (i) axisymmetric two-dimensional model (ii) axisymmetric three-dimensional model with constant stenosis (iii) axisymmetric three-dimensional model with varying stenosis and (iv) asymmetric two-dimensional model.

All models used the NiTinol net-structured stents, with a Poison׳s ratio of 
                           υ
                           =
                           0.3
                         and Young׳s modulus of E=46GPa. To account for standard oversizing of self-expanded stents, mismatch values between the outer diameter of the stent and the inner diameter of the artery were specified in the range of 0.5–1mm.

Both the artery wall and plaque were considered to have nonlinear and hyper-elastic material properties. The outer layer was defined using average properties of healthy adventitia and media, based on experiments of Holzapfel et al. [21]. Similarly, the plaque was determined by the average properties of diseased fibrous intima and media. The stiffness of the plaque is approximately twenty times greater than that of the healthy layer. The stress–strain diagram of the hyperelastic properties used for the two layers in the models is shown in 
                        Fig. 1.

The curves were approximated to the Ogden form of strain energy potential, which is based on the principal stretches of left-Cauchy strain tensor for isotropic material, with the form:

The first model examined was an axisymmetric two dimensional model of a single chain of a net-structured stent. It was developed using the so called “strip theory” of structural mechanics, as follows: Consider the middle cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal x-axis of the stent–artery system (
                        Fig. 2a). The rotational symmetry of the domain, together with the symmetry of the internal pressure, allows us to consider a single sector ABCD (Fig. 2b).

The beams of the stent are tilted by a small angle (α~10°) with respect to the x-axis. Thus, we assume that the beams are perpendicular to the cross section plane and therefor the problem can be approximated as planar (Fig. 2b). For our specific case, 18 beams are distributed along the inner circle uniformly. Consequently, the central angle of the sector ABCD is 360/18=20°. The dimensions of the inner and outer radii of this sector before stent insertion are identical to the dimensions of a stenosed artery after balloon inflation.

The stent strut is represented by a square cross section which is located in the center of the inner artery wall (
                        Fig. 3). The artery and the stent were discretized by 5400 and 800 2D elements, respectively, according to mesh independence tests. The mesh was refined around the stent–artery contact region.

In all models, mesh convergence test was carried out in order to find the optimum number of elements needed to capture the solution with stress error not larger than 7%. (
                        Fig. 4). The radial stiffness of the artery is defined by its geometry and mechanical properties. The stent׳s stiffness, however, cannot be represented in a similar manner, and thus a spring element was added. The stiffness of the spring is defined by the radial stiffness of the stent as calculated using a simple numerical simulation (without the contact problem). This element is connected on one edge to point O located at the center of the ring, and its other edge is connected to the stent׳s strut (Fig. 3). The stiffness of the spring was computed according to the radial stiffness of the stent, based on a numerical analysis [35].

The boundary conditions for the model are shown in Fig. 3. Blood pressure was modeled as radial pressure acting on the inner wall of the artery and the inner edge of the stent. In addition, a radial displacement was assigned to the lower edge of the spring. The value of the displacement was equal to the difference between the outer radius of the stent at its free state, and the inner radius of the artery before the stent׳s insertion

                           )
                        . This boundary condition models the displacements of the stent and the artery after stent insertion, where the artery moves outwards and the stent moves inwards. The radial displacement of the stent is represented by the contraction of the spring.

The geometry of the three dimensional model is similar to that of the two dimensional model, relying on the symmetric structure of the net-structured stent. The repetitive module of the artery is a 3D sector of a hollow bi-layer cylinder with the central angle of 20° (
                        Fig. 5). The radii of the cylinder the inner and the outer, are determined in a manner identical to the one employed for the two dimensional model. The length of the sector along the axial axis was defined according to the length of the stent׳s beam (Fig. 2a). The geometry of the stent׳s beam is obtained from a cylindrical envelope with suitable dimensions wherein the difference between the inner and outer diameters of the envelope is equal to the thickness of the stent׳s beam (Fig. 5).

The boundary conditions were defined as illustrated in 
                        Fig. 6, where the blood pressure acts on the internal surface of the artery and the stent. The stiffness of the stent in this model is defined from the stent׳s geometric shape, mechanical properties and boundary conditions. Therefore, there is no need to employ a spring element like in the two dimensional model.

The artery and the stent were discretized by 15,280 and 1652 volumetric elements respectively and refined mesh around the contact region was considered.

Usually, the stenosis structure varies along the artery (for example see 
                        Fig. 7). Therefore, a model with varying axisymmetric stenosis was considered.

Axial symmetry of the stenosis allows for a model of a symmetric sector, similar to the 3D model with constant stenosis that we used above. The stent selected by the cardiologist is usually longer than the stenosis zone. Therefore, five stent chains were modeled for the 3D stent (
                        Fig. 8a). The boundary conditions were defined similarly to the above 3D model with constant stenosis. The inner diameter of the artery after being inflated is 3.5mm and the stenosis percentage varies from 0% at its edges, to 90% at its axial center. The dimensions of the artery and the stenosis percentage are described in Fig. 8b.

Usually, plaque is asymmetrical [21,36–38] (
                        Fig. 9a), therefore, an asymmetric 2D model was also defined (Fig. 9b). Prior to stent insertion, the stenosed artery undergoes balloon inflation. To derive the shape of the artery following the inflation process, a prior simulation was performed in which a rigid cylinder was inserted into the stenosed artery. In 
                        Fig. 10a, the geometry of the inflated blocked artery is shown, for the case of an artery of 4mm inner diameter before the blocking developed. The geometry of the blocked artery before its inflation is shown by the dashed line. The geometry and the radial displacements after the inflation are described by the colored sectors. It can be seen that during the inflating process the healthy part of the artery is stretched. This fact stems from the high stiffness of the blocking plaque strata relative to the stiffness of the healthy layer. The derived model is shown in Fig. 10b. Plane symmetry of the stenosis allows the formulation of half of the model containing nine stent beams (Fig. 10b). The boundary conditions are similar to those defined in the previous case of the 2D axisymmetric stenosis but with a sector of 180°.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we present the stresses in the contact regions between the stent and artery. We used a normalized averaged parameter for radial stresses (DF) and an averaged parameter for the circumferential stresses (ACS).

Examples of the stress distribution are presented in 
                        Fig. 11, as calculated by using the 2D (Fig. 11a) and the 3D (Fig. 11c) axisymmetric models. These results are for a 2.75mm diameter artery with 75% stenosis, into which a 3.5mm diameter stent was inserted. The radial and circumferential stresses at the artery׳s inner wall shown in Fig. 11a and b for the 2D model are presented graphically as a function of the angular coordinate in 
                        Fig. 12. The dashed vertical lines in the graph describe the contact region between the stent and artery.

The radial stresses on the artery׳s inner wall along the non-contact surface are equal in their values to the mean blood pressure (100mmHg; 13.6kPa). Along the contact region between the stent and artery they vary and reach a maximum value of 73kPa. The greatest stresses are found at the sharp stent׳s edges. The values of the circumferential stresses at the artery׳s wall along the non-contact surface reach approximately 120kPa, vary in the contact region and are in opposite manner to the radial stresses.

The stress distributions calculated from the 2D and the 3D models are in good agreement with all the calculated cases (see for example Fig. 11a and c). DF and ACS values were calculated for a large range of cases with different stent oversizing (0.5mm<Δd<1mm) (
                        Fig. 13). There is also good agreement between the 2D and 3D models and this agreement is valid for a large range of stent–artery diameter mismatch cases (up to 10.5% difference in DF and 7.4% difference in ACS). As expected, both DF and ACS increase with stent oversizing (Δd). The dependence between them has a quasi-linear form.

Since the 2D model nicely predicts the DF obtained from the 3D model, an additional examination of the effect of artery stenosis was performed. A large set of 2D models having a 3.25mm diameter artery with 20–90% stenosis with an 0.5–1mm oversizing mismatch were used. The resulting DF values for these cases are shown in 
                        Fig. 14. As expected, the DF values increase with stenosis rate, but the effect of mismatch value is more significant.

The following results are for a 3D model of varying stenosis (Fig. 8), compared with corresponding 2D and 3D models of constant stenosis (Figs. 3 and 6). The examined cases include a 3.5mm diameter artery with varying stenosis of 0–90%, into which a 4.25mm diameter stent was inserted. Values of DF, as calculated using the three methods are shown in 
                        Fig. 15. Note that the graph describes DF as a function of stenosis percentages, and not of artery length. The actual variations in DF values for a higher stenosis region change along the artery in a more moderate pace.

The results of the DF values depict good correlation between the 3D model with varying stenosis and the other models. The DF values for the 3D models with constant stenoses show up to 6% differences, and the 2D models show up to 11% differences.

The following results are for a 2D model with an asymmetric stenosis. The model includes a 3.75mm diameter artery with a 40% stenosis and a 4.25mm diameter stent (Fig. 10). The calculated radial stresses and DF values are depicted in 
                        Fig. 16. The resulting DF values are highest for the beams located near the edges of the plaque (marked with circles in Fig. 16) and reach a maximal value of DF=1.15. This maximal value is lower than the value of DF=1.35 obtained in the axisymmetric case with the same stenosis percentage.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We have suggested criteria for the estimation of potential arterial damage due to stent oversizing. The four model types described in this manuscript propose different simplifications that allow fast and cost effective results over a large range of cases.

These numerical simulations modeled net-structured self-expanding stents implanted in arteries with arterial stenosis. All models used bi-layered models of the arterial wall with hyperelastic material properties. The artery models assumed a uniform external healthy layer and different geometries of the internal plaque. The defined material properties for the models are based on average values of measured tissues [10]. The models assumed isotropic and homogenous characteristics of the arterial wall and plaque, even though in reality the arterial plaque may include non-homogenous components, such as lipid core, fibrous caps and calcifications. Therefore, the averaged material properties assumed by our models for the plaque may be an overestimation of the actual properties. Thus, the obtained DF values obtained in this study are probably upper limit values.

The stresses that develop in the arterial wall were evaluated for a large range of cases and the effects of simplifications, oversizing mismatch and stenosis configuration were compared. The arterial radial and circumferential stresses due to the stent insertion are represented using the non-dimensional averaged parameter DF and the averaged parameter ACS, respectively. When the DF value equals one, the radial stresses at the artery wall are similar to the stresses developed under natural conditions due to blood pressure. In order to prevent stent malposition, the DF values should be larger than one. On the other hand in order to prevent intimal hyperplasia and restenosis the DF values should be minimally and close to the natural pressure of blood pressure [6].

In all the examined cases, the diameter mismatch between the artery and the stent range between 0.5 and 1mm and the stenosis rates were in the range of 20–90%. The DF values range between 1.2 and 3.5. It increases with stenosis rates, and more significantly, with oversizing mismatch. Maximal radial stresses are in the range of 16–47kPa and the circumferential stresses reaches 120kPa for the 2D cases (max effective stresses of 130kPa). These results agree with previous reported results by our group [20,24] obtained by analytical and numerical models. The analytical model of a stent being inserted into an artery, allows simple calculations of displacements of the stent and the artery as well as the stresses generated between them for a given geometry [35]. [2,39] Reported that maximum effective stresses in an artery with a net-structured stent reaches 194kPa and 229kPa, respectively, which is of the same order of magnitude obtained in the current study. However, full comparison is impossible because the mechanical properties and the geometric data of the stent and the artery in those studies are missing.

Results obtained from planar 2D models were found in good agreement with results obtained from 3D models for cases with axisymmetric constant or varying stenosis. The 2D models, by providing good approximations for the 3D cases, are preferable since they demand fewer calculations over a large range of cases. Similarly, the simplified 2D model and the 3D model with constant stenosis closely predicted the DF values calculated by the more complex 3D model with varying stenosis. The minor differences between these three axisymmetric methods may be attributed to the radial stiffness of the stent׳s beams. In the 3D case with constant stenosis, DF was calculated based on an average value of radial stresses along the outer surface of the stent׳s beam. However, for the 3D model with varying stenosis, the DF values were calculated based on average values at specific locations along the beam (Fig. 8), while the radial stiffness of the stent varies along the beam. For example, in the varying stenosis case, lower stresses were obtained for planes which are located near the beam׳s edges (e.g. 72% and 78% stenosis), while for the planes which are located at the beams׳ centers (e.g. 40% and 90% stenosis), higher stresses are obtained.

The high correlation between the complex 3D case with varying stenosis and the more simple 2D case may suggest a simplified and convenient tool for calculating the stresses at the artery׳s wall in complex cases, such as patient specific geometries, or curved arteries. This calculation would be carried out by introducing the spatial problem as an assembly of planar two dimensional cross sections. Moreover, arterial stenoses are rarely fully axisymmetric, thus the 2D cross sections can be asymmetric, as shown in the fourth model.

The maximal value of DF obtained by the 2D model with an asymmetric stenosis is lower than the value of DF obtained in the axisymmetric case with the same stenosis percentage. Therefore, axisymmetric models may provide the worst-case estimation values for a stent of interest. This result is supported by other studies such as Hayashi et al. [40] and can be attributed to the fact that the healthy artery׳s stiffness is lower than the stiffness of the plaque strata. When the stenosis is symmetrical the plaque stratum is distributed uniformly around the entire inner wall of the artery and therefore the radial stiffness of the stenosed artery׳s structure increases. However, in the asymmetric case, a part of the artery׳s wall contains only a healthy layer, and thus leads to lower radial stiffness of the structure.

If the 2D model requires non-homogeneous or non-isotropic materials, a multi-layered model can be used with the corresponding effective mechanical properties in the circumferential direction for each layer.

The suggested models are limited to net-structured stents which are often used in most peripheral arteries and stent-grafts designs. In addition, many stent designs can be approximated to some periodic 2D models in a similar way as suggested in this manuscript. In addition, the models presented in this study simulate self-expanded stents, and therefore assume that the artery is after a balloon inflation process. The models do not include residual stresses in the arterial wall due to the inflation process. We assume that the inflation cause mainly plastic deformation and therefore the elastic recoil of the artery after inflation takes place before stent implantation. In addition, it should be noted that arterial tissue has viscoelastic properties, and thus stress relaxation over time leads to a decrease of stent artery contact stresses [2,32]. However, the maximal stresses occurring immediately after the stent insertion, are critical. Therefore, we defined the DF using these stresses.

The variety of stenoses geometry, components and configurations is unlimited. It is therefore invaluable to be able to calculate the stresses in real cases. We therefore suggest simplified models that may provide a reliable and efficient prediction tool for comparing the stents׳ damage factor. The advantage of robust simplified models is in providing comparative estimations of integral parameters, such as DF or ACS, allowing fast and easy assessments of stent design for a large range of cases. These models may serve as a useful tool for stent development as well as for real-time decisions for patient-specific stent selection.
