                  In classical scheduling problems it is common to assume that the due dates are predefined parameters for the scheduler. In integrated systems, however, due date assignment and scheduling decisions have to be carefully coordinated to make sure that the company can meet the assigned due dates. Thus, a huge effort has been made recently to provide tools to optimally integrate due date assignment and scheduling decisions. In most cases it is common to assume that the assigned due date(s) are not restricted. However, in many practical cases, assigning due dates too far into the future may violate early agreements between the manufacturer and his customers. Thus, in this paper we extend the current literature to deal with such a constraint. This is done by analyzing a model that integrates due date assignment and scheduling decisions where each job may be assigned a different due date whose value cannot exceed a predefined threshold. The objective is to minimize the total weighted earliness, tardiness and due date assignment penalties. We show that the problem is equivalent to a two stepwise weighted tardiness problem, and thus for a large set of special cases it is strongly 
                        NP
                     -hard, even when the scheduling is done on a single machine. We then provide several special cases that can be solved in polynomial time, and present approximation results for a slightly modified (and equivalent) problem on various machine settings.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Objective functions that include both earliness and tardiness penalties are now very popular in the scheduling literature due to the increasing interest in Just-in-Time (JIT) production in industry. When due dates are given in advance the most common objective in a JIT scheduling environment is to find a schedule S that minimizes

                      represents the tardiness of job j. Scheduling problems with the objective of minimizing Z(S
                     ) in (1) are usually referred to as earliness-tardiness scheduling problems. Such problems arise in a scheduling environment where customers are not interested in receiving their jobs either earlier or later than the due date. Thus, if a job is finished prior its due date, it has to be held in inventory until that date. Consequently, this job incurs an earliness cost depending on the length of time it is held in inventory. This earliness penalty cost can result from deterioration, storage, insurance, etc. On the other hand, if a job is delivered after the due date, it incurs a tardiness cost that depends on how tardy the job is. The tardiness penalty can result from customer dissatisfaction, contract fines, and exposure to potential loss of reputation (Chen, 1996).

Earliness-tardiness scheduling problems have attracted the attention of many researchers (see, e.g., Sundararaghavan and Ahmed, 1984; Hall and Posner, 1991; Hall, Kubiak, and Sethi, 1991; Hassin and Shani, 2005; Davis and Kanet, 1993; Sivrikaya-Serifoğlu and Ulusoy, 1999 and Sourd and Kedad-Sidhoum, 2008). A survey on those problems can be found in Baker and Scudder (1990) and Lauff and Werner (2004). In all these papers, the main assumption is that due date quotation and scheduling decisions are made separately. Thus, due dates are given in advance as predefined parameters. In an integrated (centralized) system, however, due dates are determined by taking into account the ability to meet them. This is why an increasingly large number of recent studies view due date assignment (DDA) as part of the scheduling process and show how the ability to control due dates can be a major factor in improving system performance (see Gordon, Proth, and Strusevich, 2004 and Kaminsky and Hochbaum, 2004 for extensive surveys on this subject).

In a JIT scheduling environment where both due date assignment and scheduling decisions are integrated, it is common to include a due date assignment penalty within the objective function. This penalty reflects the fact that promising delivery dates too far into the future may force a company to offer price discounts in order to retain its business. In fact, the most common objective in the scheduling literature involving DDA decisions (see, e.g., Seidmann, Panwalkar, and Smith, 1981; Panwalkar, Smith, and Seidmann, 1982; Chen, 1996; Shabtay and Steiner, 2006 and Shabtay and Steiner, 2008; Mosheiov and Yovel, 2006; Li, Ng, and Yuan, 2011 and Drobouchevitch and Sidney, 2012) is to find a schedule S and a set of due dates

                      is a nonnegative parameter representing the per unit lead time cost, and Aj
                      represents the lead time that is considered to be acceptable (and thus there is no lead time cost if the due date is set to be less than or equal to Aj
                     ).

Several methods to assign due dates have been considered in the literature. The most commonly used ones are (i) the common DDA method (usually referred to as the CON DDA method), where all the jobs are assigned the same due date; (ii) the slack due date assignment method (usually referred to as the SLK DDA method), where the jobs are given an equal flow allowance that reflects an equal waiting time; and (iii) the unrestricted due date assignment method (usually referred to as the DIF DDA method), where each job can be assigned a different due date. A common assumption is that the assigned due dates (in the DIF method) or the common due date or slack values (in the CON and SLK methods) are not restricted. However, in many practical cases, assigning a due date too far into the future may not be acceptable or may even violate an earlier agreement between the manufacturer and its customers. Thus, in this paper we extend the literature devoted to the DIF DDA by including a limitation on the assigned due dates. We do this by analyzing a set of scheduling problems in which the objective is to find a schedule S and a set of due dates

For ease of presentation, we use the classical X|Y|Z three-field notation introduced by Graham, Lawler, Lenstra, and Rinnooy Kan (1979) when referring to each scheduling problem. The X field describes the machine environment, with X ∈ {1, Pm, Qm, Rm, Fm, Jm, Om}, where

                      implies that the scheduling is done on a set of m uniform machines working in parallel;

                      implies that the scheduling is done on a set of m unrelated machines working in parallel; and

                      refer to flow-shop, job-shop and open-shop scheduling systems, respectively. In all the above cases, it is assumed that m is fixed, i.e., that the number of machines in the shop is not part of the instance. If, on the other hand, the number of machines is part of the instance, we remove the ``m′′ from the X field, such that, for example, 
                        
                           X

                      indicates that the scheduling is done on a set of m identical parallel machines, where m is not fixed. The Y field includes the set of job-processing characteristics and constraints. In our framework

                     Seidmann et al. (1981) were the first to study scheduling problems using the DIF DDA method. They focus on the case where (i) the scheduling is done on a single machine; (ii) the per unit earliness, tardiness and due date assignment costs are job-independent (that is

                        Corollary 1 implies that the extension of the problem studied by Seidmann et al. (1981) to the case where every job has an individual upper bound,

                         on its assigned due date does not add any complexity to the problem as long as α ≥ γ. However, if α < γ it is exactly the individual upper bound that makes the problem hard to solve.

This was done by constructing an auxiliary (modified) instance for the problem and by using Lawler’s algorithm (Lawler, 1973) to find the optimal solution which minimizes the maximal weighted tardiness with respect to the modified instance. In what follows, we show that a similar approach can yield the same approximation result for our

                         problems, the above result holds for uniform and unrelated machines as well. One reason the problems are difficult to approximate is that the optimal objective value for an instance may be zero and any algorithm with a guaranteed approximation ratio would have to be optimal for such instances. Furthermore, the problem of finding out whether an instance has a schedule with zero tardiness on parallel machines is itself 
                           NP
                        -hard. One can easily obtain a result similar to that in Theorem 4 when the scheduling is done in flow-shop, job-shop and open-shop systems with more than two machines as in such systems the problem of whether an instance has a schedule with zero tardiness is 
                           NP
                        -hard as well. This issue provides the motivation for an equivalent formulation for the problem that has no solution with zero value. This can be done by adding some positive b > 0 value to the objective function. Although approximating such a version of the problem may be somewhat easier, the next result by Kovalyov and Werner (2002) shows that even this version is unlikely to have a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).

                     1 be the first job completed during time interval I

                     2 be the first job completed during time interval I

                     3. However, this is not always the case with time interval I
                     2. Consider, for example, a schedule S where there exists a job (say job j) that starts its processing at time t ∈ I
                     1, and whose processing time (pj
                     ) is at least

                           t
                        
                     . In such a schedule no job is completed during time interval I
                     2, and therefore we set 
                        
                           
                              S

                     . Moreover, since job j is the first to be completed during time interval I
                     3 (in S), we set 
                        
                           
                              S

We studied a scheduling problem with due date assignment where the objective is to minimize the total weighted earliness, tardiness and due date assignment penalties. For each job

                      the due date assignment cost is assumed to be equal to zero if the due date (dj
                     ) does not exceed a given threshold Aj

                     . We showed that the problem is equivalent to a two stepwise weighted tardiness problem, and thus it is strongly 
                        NP
                     -hard for a large set of special cases, even when the scheduling is done on a single machine. We then provide several special cases that are solvable in polynomial time and present an approximation algorithm for when the scheduling is done on a single machine. Since for most multi-machine systems, approximation algorithms do not exists unless

                      we provide approximation results for a slightly modified problem. Finally, we present a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to solve the 
                        NP
                     -hard problem on a single machine with uniform 
                        
                           
                              d

                           j
                        
                      and Aj
                      values. Future research will be directed toward finding out if the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm can be converted into an FPTAS, and to study other due date assignment problems, where the due date values are upper bounded.
