                  Fitness landscape theory is a mathematical framework for numerical analysis of search algorithms on combinatorial optimization problems. We study a representation of fitness landscape as a weighted directed graph. We consider out forest and in forest structures in this graph and establish important relationships among the forest structures of a directed graph, the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrices, and the numbers of local optima of the landscape. These relationships provide a new approach for computing the numbers of local optima for various problem instances and neighborhood structures.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Combinatorial optimization is beneficial for minimizing transportation costs of different goods, finding protein folding structures having minimal energy, determining the best topology for a wireless network, or designing microprocessors to minimize the communication costs among individual transistors (Pardalos, Du, & Graham, 2013). Computational complexity is a common feature of many combinatorial optimization problems (e.g., the traveling salesman problem and the quadratic assignment problem are NP-hard). Another typical feature is a large size of the solution space for even problems of moderate size. For d-partite graph matching or the multidimensional assignment problem, for example, the number of feasible solutions grows exponentially in both dimensionality d and cardinality n of the problem.

Computational complexity and very large solution space make application of exact solution techniques restrictively slow or even infeasible for such problems. So, rather than obtaining globally optimal solution, the task is simplified to finding good quality approximate solutions. Search based methods, including iterative and stochastic local searches (Hirsch, Pardalos, & Resende, 2010; Hoos & Stützle, 2005; Stützle, 2006), simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi, 1983; Pedamallu & Ozdamar, 2008), and genetic algorithm (Gonçalves, Mendes, & Resende, 2008; Holland, 1975), are widely utilized for finding approximate solutions of discrete and combinatorial optimization problems (Hvattum & Glover, 2009). A neighborhood of a given solution is a key concept in search algorithms. It is through the notion of neighborhood that the distance between two solutions, as well as the local optima (minima and maxima) are defined.

Fitness landscape theory is an important subfield of combinatorial optimization. It provides a framework for analysis of the search algorithm’s behavior on different instances of a given problem (Krokhmal & Pardalos, 2009; Stadler, 2002). In addition to combinatorial optimization, fitness landscape analysis found application in the physics of disordered systems and evolutionary biology (Reidys & Stadler, 2002). As a matter of fact, fitness landscapes originated in theoretical biology as a way of visualizing evolutionary adaptation (Wright, 1932). Later, they appeared in analysis of spin glasses and other models of disordered physical systems (Binder & Young, 1986). Reidys and Stadler (2002) also acknowledge the similarity between fitness landscapes and the potential energy surfaces used to study the folding of biopolymers (e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) in theoretical chemistry (Mezey, 1987; Neumaier, 1997).

Combinatorial landscapes are not unlike their earth counterparts. If solutions are thought as places, and a solution’s fitness (i.e., objective value) as an altitude, then local minima and maxima are like depths and peaks. Just like a walk is long if two places are far apart, the search algorithm’s run time is long when the distance between initial solution and resulting local optimum is large. Similarly to difficulties encountered traversing a rugged terrain, search algorithms are challenged by combinatorial landscapes with many local optima.

As a result, a number of fitness landscape studies examine the trends in the numbers of local optima for various problem sizes, neighborhoods, and distributions of coefficients. Other studies look at the relationship between solution’s fitness and its distance to the optima. It is widely acknowledged that careful analysis of combinatorial landscapes is a key to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the search based algorithms (Schiavinotto & Stützle, 2007).

Many important results and methodologies for fitness landscape analysis are reviewed in Reidys and Stadler (2002) and Stadler (2002). Combinatorial landscapes can be examined through a wide variety of perspectives, including probability theory and stochastic processes, dynamical systems, random graphs, and abstract algebra. In the majority of the literature on fitness landscapes, graph representations of landscapes and the respective discrete Laplacian operators (or graph Laplacians) arise in the context of undirected graphs. Undirected graphs assume the presence of edges in both directions, and so, they lead to symmetric graph Laplacians.

We argue that landscape representations via undirected graphs ignore or lose important information on which of the two solutions (edge endpoints) has a better fitness value. Yet, the theory of directed graphs (digraphs) is not nearly as well developed as for undirected graphs. Some key results in undirected graph theory do not hold for directed graphs and need to be extended for digraphs. Fortunately, a well-known algebraic result connecting the number of weak components with the multiplicities of undirected graph Laplacians was extended to digraphs in Agaev and Chebotarev (2005). It was shown that converging trees in a digraph form a directed forest known as in forest, and this structure serves as a digraph analog of an undirected graph’s decomposition into weak components.

Here we extend this important result to alternative types of directed forests and their components (specifically, out forests and diverging trees). The main contribution of the paper is the fitness landscape representation via directed graph and the important connections between local optima on landscapes and certain nodes on directed trees. The connection between landscapes’ optima and directed trees is visualized in Fig. 1
                     , which serves as a graphical abstract.

The paper is organized as follows. The key concepts related to fitness landscapes and forest structures on directed graphs are introduced in Section 2. These definitions are used to obtain general results on digraphs and landscapes in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 presents the conclusions.

Fitness landscape analysis is an important tool in combinatorial optimization. A search algorithm imposes a structure on the space of all feasible solutions. Landscapes theory studies how the imposed structure impacts the behavior and performance of the algorithm. To define a fitness landscape, we first introduce several related concepts, starting with a notion of a neighborhood of a given solution.

A distance between two solutions is another key concept closely related to the ideas of a neighborhood, an operator, and a move. When the algorithm moves from one solution to another in search for optimal solutions, it crosses multiple neighborhoods via successive application of a sequence of moves. In other words, given any two solutions

In such case, the number of neighborhoods the search crosses on its way from s to t might vary. The smallest possible number defines a distance between s and t.

As a result, we can get from t to s by simply reversing the sequence of moves, and so, the distance from t to s is the same as the distance from s to t. Thus, to guarantee that the distance is symmetric, the considered neighborhood must be commutative.

The fitness of each solution s is characterized by its objective function value 
                           
                              f

                         with local minima of P having the smallest values (and maxima the largest values) of f around them. Including a fitness function is like adding an extra dimension (e.g., height) to the solution space. Which is why the fitness landscapes are loosely compared to earth landscapes with depths at the points of local minima and peaks at the points of local maxima in the solution space.

Local and global minima and maxima, known collectively as the optima, play important role in solving combinatorial optimization problems. To solve optimization problem instance

                        , one must find its global optimal solution, i.e., a solution with the overall best fitness. The local search algorithms work by comparing solutions within a single neighborhood (rather than a whole solution set at once) while moving from one solution’s neighborhood to the next.

                              N

These concepts can formally be defined as follows:

A fitness landscape can alternatively be represented as a weighted directed graph (or digraph) without loops. To show this, we need certain graph-theoretic definitions in addition to the fitness landscape terminology introduced in Section 2.1. Here we first define basic concepts such as a path and then move to more advanced ideas such as a maximum in forest, a maximum out forest, as well as in-forest and out-forest dimensions of a digraph.

We follow the terminology used in Agaev and Chebotarev (2000, 2005), Borowski and Borwein (1989). Let

A diverging tree D is a digraph without semicircuits that has a vertex, called the root (or source), from which every vertex of D is reachable. A diverging tree has a unique root r and the indegree of r is zero, whereas the indegrees of all other vertices are one. The root of D is a global source in D.

A converging tree C is a digraph without semicircuits that has a vertex, called the sink, which is reachable from every vertex of C. A converging tree has a unique sink t with the outdegree of t is zero, whereas the outdegrees of all other vertices are one.

Given a digraph G, its spanning diverging forest is called an out forest of G, and a spanning converging forest of G is an in forest of G. The weak components of a diverging forest are diverging trees (see Agaev & Chebotarev (2000) for a proof). The weak components of a converging forest are converging trees. Fig. 2
                         shows an example of a graph and its spanning forests.

As stated in Agaev and Chebotarev (2000), every maximum out forest of G has the minimum possible number of roots or sources. The number of sources (equivalently, the number of weak components or out trees) of a maximum out forest of G is called the out-forest dimension

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

This section defines the concepts used to show the connection of the forrest structures with the row and column Laplacian matrices of a directed graph. To be able to apply a key result from (Agaev & Chebotarev, 2005), we reconcile the differences in notations between two types of directed graph Laplacians, namely a row and a column Laplacian matrices. Whereas Agaev and Chebotarev (2005) presented their finding in terms of only in-forest dimensions and associated row Laplacians, here we consider both row and column Laplacians and reformulate the key result in Agaev and Chebotarev (2005) in terms of not only in-forest but also out-forest dimensions.

                        Lemma 1 can be extended by considering the out forest structures. To accomplish this, we need additional results. First, we obtain the equalities for directed Laplacian matrices in Lemma 2. We use the relationships to establish the equalities for the respective algebraic multiplicities. Second, we prove the association between the forest dimensions. Together the results let us prove Theorem 5, which is the desired extension of Lemma 1 to out forests.

According to a well-known linear algebra result, any real-valued square matrix can be given a spectral representation via its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are said to form its eigenspace. Under spectral properties, we understand some characteristics of the eigenspace. It turns out that spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph and the numbers of local optima are closely related. This is proven in Section 3.2 by connecting a fitness landscape with the in forest and out forest structures of a digraph.

In this section, we first show how a fitness landscape can be represented via a weighted digraph. Next, we establish a correspondence between the landscape-theoretic concepts and the structures in a digraph defined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. Last, using the correspondence, we prove the results about the spectral representations of the local optima of combinatorial optimization problems.

In this paper, we showed three important results. First, a landscape of a combinatorial problem can be represented via a directed weighted graph. Second, the out-forest dimensions of digraphs are closely related to the multiplicities of the smallest and the largest eigenvalues of the corresponding column Laplacian matrices, similarly to a known relationship between in-forest dimensions and row Laplacian matrices. Third, for a broad class of combinatorial optimization problems, the landscapes lead to digraphs without loops or circuits, and the numbers of local optima are determined by the multiplicities of the smallest and the largest eigenvalues of the respective Laplacian matrices.

The weighted digraph representation that is presented in this paper leads to studying the row and column Laplacian matrices. These forms of directed graph Laplacians are asymmetric in the contrast to the symmetric graph Laplacians proposed in previous studies such as (Stadler, 2002). Our paper demonstrates that the digraph representation of a landscape opens opportunities for utilizing recent advances in theory of directed graphs. Conversely, the future studies of digraph representations of various landscapes can potentially lead to new graph-theoretic results. In Theorem 5, for example, we obtained a useful graph-theoretic result connecting column Laplacian matrices and out forests.

When proving our results, we relied heavily on the notions of in forests and out forests. These graph-theoretic structures appear to be rather useful for theoretical analyses of local search algorithms due to their capacity for summarizing the progression of local search along the objective. In addition to the out-forest and in-forest dimensions, it would be interesting to investigate other characteristics of these structures and how these characteristics are related to some features of the respective landscapes. In particular, it would be beneficial to identify graph-theoretic indicators of the quality of local optima.

Many hard combinatorial optimization problems are characterized by a large number of local optima (Grundel, Krokhmal, Oliveira, & Pardalos, 2007). For these problems, computational or analytical evaluation of the number of local optima is an important and challenging task. By proving Theorem 6, we established a new way to compute the number of local minima and maxima for a broad class of problems in combinatorial optimization. While this method is currently not suitable for computational studies of large-scale instances of hard combinatorial optimization problems, it could be applied in empirical studies of small-size instances. Importantly, this method could be useful in analytical studies of local search algorithms in cases when approximations or bounds on the multiplicities of the digraph eigenvalues can be obtained without explicitly considering the entire set of feasible solutions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we proved several important theoretical results in combinatorial optimization that help advance a general theory of combinatorial landscapes. We extended an earlier finding of Agaev and Chebotarev (2005) for in forests to both, in and out forests. Under general conditions, we established the correspondence between the local optima of landscapes of combinatorial optimization problems and the forest structures of the landscape representations via directed graphs. In the future, the established correspondence could be used to analyze fitness landscape properties (e.g., the number of extrema) for computationally difficult problems in combinatorial optimization. Additionally, our result could help establish new relationships between other landscape features and the respective digraph structures.
