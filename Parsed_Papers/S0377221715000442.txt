                  Many public healthcare systems struggle with excessive waiting lists for elective patient treatment. Different countries address this problem in different ways, and one interesting method entails a maximum waiting time guarantee. Introduced in Denmark in 2002, it entitles patients to treatment at a private hospital in Denmark or at a hospital abroad if the public healthcare system is unable to provide treatment within the stated maximum waiting time guarantee. Although clearly very attractive in some respects, many stakeholders have been very concerned about the negative consequences of the policy on the utilization of public hospital resources. This paper illustrates the use of a queue modelling approach in the analysis of elective patient treatment governed by the maximum waiting time policy. Drawing upon the combined strengths of analytic and simulation approaches we develop both Continuous-Time Markov Chain and Discrete Event Simulation models, to provide an insightful analysis of the public hospital performance under the policy rules. The aim of this paper is to support the enhancement of the quality of elective patient care, to be brought about by better understanding of the policy implications by hospital planners and strategic decision makers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Identifying methods for ameliorating excessive waiting lists for elective patient treatment have been high on the agenda for many countries with public healthcare systems. As shorter waiting times usually result in higher degrees of patient and citizen satisfaction, considerable funds have been invested in their reduction over the years. Different countries have tried to address this problem in various ways, and one interesting method entails a Maximum Waiting Time Guarantee (MWTG). A number of papers reporting the implementation of the policy in different countries and providing general descriptions of its content are available in the literature (Ashton, 2009; Hanning, 1996; Hanning and Spångberg, 2000; Johannesson, Johansson, and Söderqvist, 1998; Karlberg and Brinkmo, 2009; Siciliani and Hurst, 2005; Vrangbæk, Østergren, Birk, and Winblad, 2007; Wiley, 2005).

Introduced in Denmark in 2002, this guarantee entitles patients to treatment at a private hospital in Denmark, or at a hospital abroad, if the local public healthcare system is unable to provide treatment within the stated maximum waiting time guarantee. In such cases, the Danish region where the patient resides (and which is responsible for providing the local public hospital care), now has to cover the cost of treatment either in private for-profit hospitals in Denmark or in hospitals in neighbouring countries (Madsen, 2010). As noted by Pedersen, Christiansen, and Bech (2005), the position of the patient has been significantly strengthened through the implementation of the policy. Patients are no longer simply a passive party waiting for capacity to become available; they have now more options to choose from, and hence some decision power, which should lead to a reduction in waiting lists and waiting times.

After the introduction of a two-month maximum waiting time guarantee for the entire course of treatment (i.e. examination and treatment) in 2002, it was decreased to one month in 2007. Although clearly very attractive in some respects, many stakeholders have been concerned about the possible negative consequences of such policies, if taken too far, on the performance of public hospitals. In particular, there are claims that a one month guarantee would cause increased overflows of patients to the private sector, with a consequent inefficient use of public hospital resources. As a result, the Danish government has recently extended the maximum waiting time guarantee into one month for examination procedures and two months for the treatment.

Clearly, there exists a trade-off between short waiting times and high resource utilization in public hospitals. A maximum waiting time guarantee should limit waiting times of elective patients by offering the possibility of faster treatment in the private sector when the queues in public system are too long. However, given that the whole system is stochastic, very short queues for examination and treatment can result in some inefficiencies as shown in Worthington (1987). Specifically, resources can become under-utilised more often, because there will be a higher chance of having no patients available to fill empty timeslots in a schedule. The negative impact of the policy would be magnified if all patients use the possibility of private treatment.

However, there are other potential sources of inefficiency which can result from short waiting lists. The first one relates to a mismatch between available patients and examination or treatment session lengths. Specifically, the policy rules state that patients should be scheduled for examination and operation based on the FCFS rule. Moreover, they should receive an appointment for a particular day in the future in advance, so the hospital planner has to reserve the capacity required for the procedure based on his best knowledge about its expected process time. As overbooking is typically not allowed, this can result in sessions that are not fully booked, and hence underused capacity. It is simply difficult to match the process times of upcoming patients in a way that they cover 100 percent of available time. An example of a patient case-mix scheduled for a given day with use of this policy is presented in Fig. 1
                     . To increase the utilization of resources exemptions from the FCFS rule may occur when the expected process time of an upcoming patient fits into an empty gap in the schedule left by the preceding patients (e.g. patients 4 and 7). Hence, the longer the queue gets the better is the chance of a good fit, as there are simply more patients to choose from. The goodness of fit is likewise affected by the patient case-mix, for example it is easier to fit short procedures into a schedule than long ones.

Another way in which utilization may be lost is due to patients withdrawing from the system or rescheduling their appointments. The first event relates to the patients who have made an appointment but leave the system before the due date, not requiring examination or treatment any more. The latter event describes the situation in which the patients change their previous appointments (due to medical or personal reasons) but still need to be examined or treated on another day. In both cases, the potential loss of utilization is due to the difficulty of finding a replacement for the cancelled appointment. In practice the replacement can be found amongst newly arriving patients or patients that are already placed on a waiting list. The earlier a patient gives notice about the cancellation, the greater is the chance of finding an arriving patient to take his place. If this is not possible, the hospital planners typically contact other patients on the waiting list offering them an earlier examination or treatment. Clearly, the longer the waiting list is the higher is the chance of finding a replacement. However, if a patient gives very short notice or does not inform the hospital at all, it may be impossible to find a replacement and the capacity will not be utilized.

Given these sources of utilization losses it is easy to see that short queues can lead to inefficiencies. However, increasing the size of queues that are already long increases patients’ waiting times for ever decreasing improvements in utilization. (In fact, in practice longer waiting lists can sometimes reduce utilization due to greater no-shows or other problems associated with managing long waiting lists.) It is therefore important to investigate and compare the trade-offs between waiting times and utilization levels prior to making any changes in the policy.

Not surprisingly, waiting list management and hospital admissions have been given some attention in the literature. Whilst economists perceive waiting lists as a rationing mechanism in the absence of price rationing (Lindsay and Feigenbaum, 1984), operations researchers tend to see the waiting time as a result of stochastic demand for health services. Consequently, the latter often use stochastic modelling techniques to tackle waiting list problems. For example, Worthington (1987) investigated the implications of certain waiting list and demand management strategies using a single station queueing model. Vissers, Adan, and Dellaert (2007) used simulation to examine different admission policies in a simplified hospital setting and proposed a platform for comparing alternative hospital admission systems. VanBerkel and Blake (2007) also used a simulation to analyze the waiting list for surgery procedures and to aid capacity planning decisions at a surgical department. Goddard and Tavakoli (2008) evaluated economic aspects of managed public sector waiting lists using a single station queueing model with a simple withdrawal mechanism. They evaluated a guaranteed maximum duration of wait, pointing out that it may not always serve a welfare maximizing policy. Bekker and Koeleman (2011) combined Quadratic Programing with a time-dependent queueing model to determine hospital admissions quota for scheduled admissions that results in a stable bed demand. Knight, Williams, and Reynolds (2012) developed a simulation tool for modelling patient choice in healthcare systems where individual patient’s decision to join a waiting list at a given hospital is made upon observation of the entire system (e.g. travel distance and length of waiting list). This work is extended in Knight and Harper (2013) who used a game theoretical approach where the choice of public hospitals by individual patients is interpreted as a routing game. Griffiths, Williams, and Wood (2013) constructed a queuing model of a neurological rehabilitation unit which incorporated balking to model the dissuading effect that long waiting lists may have on arrival rates. Queueing theory approach was also used by Stanford, Lee, Chandok, and McAlister (2014) to address waiting time inconsistency in solid organ transplantation.

The process of elective treatment usually involves a specialist consultation at an outpatient clinic for which patients will normally have to wait a period of time. Some of these patients will require treatment as inpatients, for which they will again usually join a waiting list before receiving treatment. Consequently, a more detailed queueing representation of this process is likely to involve two stations. Analysis of tandem configurations consisting of service facilities with finite queues linked in series has a long history in the literature. Blocking caused by finite capacities makes exact analytical analysis of open queueing networks intractable, except for very small networks, and hence approximation approaches have been developed for these systems (see e.g. Altiok, 1982; 1989; Bierbooms, Adan, and van Vuuren, 2013; Jun and Perros, 1990; Perros, 1986). Other authors have provided useful performance bounds for such systems (e.g. So and Chin, 1992; Van Dijk and Lamond, 1988). Unfortunately, none of these models includes the waiting list mechanisms needed for the MWTG problem, such as the various sources of efficiency losses, and the waiting time guarantee which refers to total waiting time in both queues.

The primary aim of this paper is to tackle and offer insights into the MWTG problem using an innovative combination of Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) modelling approaches. The combined use of the two approaches allows us to incorporate all the important waiting list mechanisms in a tandem queue formulation. In particular, we develop a CTMC in which the additional sources of inefficiency are introduced into the queue formulation through state-dependent processing rates. In addition, we have built an associated DES model to help investigate features such as patient booking in more detail. Simulation results are used to calibrate state-dependent processing rates in the CTMC model so that it can serve as a good approximation for some more complex scenarios. The resulting tandem queue formulation can be used to model elective patient treatment under various MWTG policies. The secondary aim of this paper is to reflect upon the combined use of these methods and to highlight some of the perceived benefits of this approach.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a comprehensive CTMC formulation of the MWTG system, including terms representing losses of utilization due to sessions not being fully booked, rescheduling and withdrawals. Calibration of the CTMC model using the DES model is presented in Section 3, along with some key results from the CTMC model that provide insights into the likely performance of the MWTG policy under a range of scenarios. Next, in Section 4 we reflect on the combined strengths of analytic and simulation approaches. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the findings and concludes.

The process of elective treatment, seen from the perspective of a single public hospital can be visualised as a tandem queueing network, with the first service process representing the outpatient examination and the second service representing the operation. This two-node queuing system is depicted in Fig. 2

Population members seek medical treatment of a particular type at rate λ. Patients can only enter the system by being added to the waiting list for examination. Once they have been examined patients are found to need an operation with probability γ. Existence of a sufficiently long queue will reduce the demand for health treatment in the public sector in favour of the private one. Patients choosing to go to the private sector are represented by a balking mechanism, in which the probability of balking pb

                     2.

                      to be used in the model are obtained by dividing the weekly clinic or theatre durations by the average examination or operation durations. For example, if there is only one surgery session per week lasting for 8 hours with an average operation time of 1 hour, the scaled service rate would be 8 patients per week, i.e. the operations have a mean duration of 1/8 week. We also assume clinics and theatre sessions are single-server, with any multiple-server sessions represented as longer duration single-server sessions.

As waiting lists in the private hospital sector are usually much shorter than those in the public sector, we assume that patients’ willingness to accept the opportunity of treatment in the private sector increases with the degree of extra waiting, given by W(n
                     1, n
                     2) − W
                     max, where W
                     max is the waiting time guarantee. Consequently, the effective arrival rate to the public hospital, denoted as λ
                     eff, can be represented as a decreasing function of n
                     1, and n

If we assume the arrival process is random and that service times are exponential the system will have the Markov property and we can represent it as a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) whose states form a finite set {(n

                     2): 0 ≤ n

To represent the loss of throughput that clinics experience when waiting lists are short, the model also incorporates:

                        
                           •
                           losses of utilization due to mismatches between available patients and session lengths,

a chance that patients refuse the appointment they are offered, and that ease of finding a replacement at short notice also depends on n
                              1 and n
                              2.

Losses of utilization due to mismatches between patients and sessions are introduced into the model using state-dependent session efficiency factors 0 ≤ ξ
                     1(n
                     1), ξ
                     2(n
                     2) ≤ 1, for examination and operation sessions respectively. These factors reflect the extent to which the sessions are booked and can be estimated using a simulation model. The factors are used to scale the respective, average service rates to obtain their state-dependent counterparts

To represent the potential loss of throughput caused by patients refusing appointments and replacements not being found, we note that in practice patients will be offered appointment by letter or by phone, with phone being used if waiting lists are short or replacement patients need to be found at short notice. We therefore give patients:

                           probabilities αr

                               of rescheduling or withdrawing from their examination appointments (and probabilities βr
                               and βw
                               of rescheduling or withdrawing from their operation appointments),

with probabilities ERL
                               and EWL

After bringing terms to the left-hand side, the flow balance equations and the boundary condition take the form

                        p
                      is the steady-state probability vector, 
                        Q
                      denotes the infinitesimal generator and 
                        e
                      is a column vector whose elements are all equal to 1 (for more details see Chapter 1 in Gross, Shortle, Thompson, and Harris, 2008).

These simultaneous equations can be solved by numerical techniques (see e.g. Stewart, 2009). Because in our model we are dealing with a very large sparse matrix 
                        Q
                     , computer memory consumption has to be reduced when storing it, using a special storage scheme for the non-zero coefficients. For this reason, 
                        Q
                      was formulated using the high-level Eigen C + + library of template headers which allows for an easy definition and manipulation of sparse matrices together with methods for solving linear systems characterized by sparse matrices. In this case the equations were solved using a general purpose mathematical library for the direct solution of large sparse systems of linear equations, called SuperLU. As implied by its name, the system is solved through LU decomposition—a variation of Gaussian elimination (for more details see Li, 2005). Solutions to the steady-state probability vector 
                        p
                      can then be used to calculate steady state performance measures, such as resources utilization, waiting times and numbers of patients in both queues.

This section first describes the calibration of the CTMC model using the DES model, and then goes on to present some key results from the CTMC model that shed light on the likely performance of the MWTG policy under a range of scenarios. Because our investigations showed that the performance of the system under the MWTG policy is significantly affected by the system size, we present results using two examples of specialities (or sub-specialties) which differ in terms of capacity. In particular, we first consider a large specialty serving patients for 3 and 8 hours on each weekday for examination and treatment procedures, respectively. In this case we assume that patients arrive to the system with rate λ = 4.8 patients a day and average service rates for the two stations are 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              1
                              ′
                           
                           =
                           4.43
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              2
                              ′
                           
                           =
                           4.11
                        
                      patients per day.

Next, we investigate a small specialty (equivalently a low-demand special treatment with a separate waiting list) that offers single examination and operation sessions per week, lasting for 3 and 8 hours respectively. Because service is offered 5 times less often compared to the large system, the patient arrival rate is scaled by the same factor, i.e. λ = 0.96 patients per day. The resulting service rates are now 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              1
                              ′
                           
                           =
                           0.89
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              μ
                              2
                              ′
                           
                           =
                           0.82
                        
                      patients per day.

In each example we consider four following scenarios:

                        
                           (a)
                           All patients need an operation (γ = 1), no reschedules or withdrawals (αr
                               = βr
                               = αw
                               = βw
                               = 0),

95 percent of patients need an operation (γ = 0.95), no reschedules or withdrawals (αr
                               = βr
                               = αw
                               = βw
                               = 0),

95 percent of patients need an operation (γ = 0.95), 5 percent of patients reschedule and 5 percent withdraw (αr
                               = βr
                               = αw
                               = βw
                               = 0.05), 5 percent of patients are able to serve as replacement (ε = ω = 0.05),

95 percent of patients need an operation (γ = 0.95), 10 percent of patients reschedule and 10 percent withdraw (αr
                               = βr
                               = αw
                               = βw
                               = 0.1), 5 percent of patients are able to serve as replacement (ε = ω = 0.05).

These parameters are based on interviews with hospital planners, and the scenarios are designed to demonstrate the effects of the various causes of throughput capacity losses described in Section 1. Specifically, scenario (a) represents a baseline system in which the only losses of throughput are due to difficulties in matching available patients to session lengths, or (very rarely) the waiting list being empty. Scenario (b) has the same two causes of losses of throughput, and shows how the balance of the system changes when 5 percent of the patients leave the system after being examined (γ = 0.95). Scenarios (c) and (d) are designed to show the extent to which different degrees of further losses of throughput, due to rescheduling and withdrawing, affect the system behaviour.

To investigate the impact of changes in the maximum waiting time guarantee, each of the above cases is analysed for W
                     max = 30 and 60 days.

Before continuing, an account of available patients not matching sessions has to be included, using the session efficiency factors ξ
                        1(n
                        1), ξ
                        2(n
                        2). These efficiency factors can be estimated in a number of ways e.g., by an analysis of historical hospital booking data (if sufficient data is available) or a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Here we use a DES model with fixed examination and operation sessions, see Kozlowski (2014) for details. This exact representation as a two node system allows the patient booking procedures to be handled individually, and hence allow calculation of session usage. The utilization of each session is then compared to the number of patients at the station just before the session starts, and utilizations are averaged over a large number of observations for each value of n
                        1 or n
                        2.

The resulting estimates of efficiency factors for our two example cases are presented in Fig. 4
                        . Clearly, the longer the queue gets the better is the chance of a good fit into a schedule as there are simply more patients to choose from. Hence, we can expect that E[ξi
                        (ni
                        )] ≤ E[ξi
                        (ni
                         + 1)] for i = 1, 2. We note in passing that in general efficiency factors depend not only on queue size, but also on mean and standard deviation of procedure duration in comparison to session length. It is this combination of factors that makes the operation queue have greater efficiency for the selected case.

@&#RESULTS@&#

After the above calibration, the CTMC model can be used to analyse the four scenarios under the two MWTG policies. We note that the results presented here are specific to the systems tested. However the parameter values chosen are based on realistic systems, and hence the system performance obtained under different settings is expected to reflect the likely typical behaviour of such systems. Our main interest is in the trade-off between utilization of public hospital resources and patients’ waiting time. Consider first the results for the bigger specialty shown in Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                        .

In the baseline scenario (a) the operation station is the bottleneck as 
                           
                              
                                 μ
                                 1
                                 ′
                              
                              >
                              
                                 μ
                                 2
                                 ′
                              
                              ,
                           
                         and it is also overloaded as 
                           
                              λ
                              >
                              
                                 μ
                                 2
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        . The consequences for the MWTG policy are seen most dramatically in Fig. 6, where the average waiting time for an operation drops from 56 to 26 days when W
                        max changes from 60 to 30 days. Fig. 5 shows that even with the longer waiting lists there is some unavoidable loss of utilization due to mismatches between patients and session lengths, i.e. utilization = 97 percent, and this hardly changes at all when W
                        max = 30. Furthermore, as the examination station is underloaded in this scenario, its performance in terms of waiting times and utilization is virtually unchanged when W
                        max is reduced.

In scenario (b) 5 percent of the examined patients do not need an operation, which means that the two stations are now much more evenly loaded. Changing the MWTG from 60 to 30 days now benefits average waits for both operations (reduction from 40 to 18 days) and examinations (reduction from 18 to 12 days). There are also some slightly larger drops in utilization, see Fig. 5, although both are less than 1 percent.

Scenarios (c) and (d) also incorporate reschedules and withdrawals, and their associated losses of utilization. In both cases the examination is now the over-loaded station and hence the main beneficiary of reducing the MWTG, with average waits for examination dropping from 45 to 18 days in scenario (c) and from 40 to 17 days in scenario (d). There are also some small improvements in the average waits for operations. The main message from Fig. 5 is that reschedules and withdrawals have reduced the utilization for both stations, and for both values of W
                        max. However the further loss of utilization caused by reducing the MWTG is still only about 1 percent.

Results for the smaller specialty are shown in Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                        . As this smaller specialty is simply a scaled down version of the large specialty case, the general pattern of over-loading and under-loading of stations is the same as in Figs. 5 and 6. Hence the dominant queues across scenarios (a)–(d) are the same in Fig. 8 as they were in Fig. 6, although less marked. For example in scenario (a), the average wait for an operation is the bigger beneficiary when W
                        max is reduced from 60 to 30 (dropping from 41 to 18 days), although the average wait for an examination also drops from 17 to 11 days. The reason why the underloaded queue is now more involved is because random variation has a greater impact on congestion in the smaller specialty. The reductions in average total waiting times (i.e. for examination and operation) due to reducing W
                        max from 60 to 30 days are now 29, 29, 25 and 21 days for scenarios (a)–(d) respectively. These are very similar to the reductions in average total wait for the bigger specialty, i.e. 30, 29, 29 and 23 days, but are more evenly divided between the two stations.

However the losses of utilization in the smaller specialty are much more marked than for the bigger specialty in two ways. First, even with W
                        max = 60, the greater impact of random variation means that the utilization levels range between 83 percent and 97 percent, whereas for the bigger specialty they ranged from 89 percent to 97 percent. Furthermore the impact of reducing W
                        max to 30 days is much more dramatic, with losses of utilization at both stations of about 2 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent across scenarios (a)–(d); whereas for the bigger specialty the maximum loss was only 1 percent.

In the previous section we have shown that the CTMC model presented in Section 2, after being a subject to a suitable calibration of the state-dependent processing rates, can serve as a good quality approximation of the elective patient treatment process. In this section, we comment on and demonstrate other benefits of combining analytic and simulation approaches.

Limitations of the analytical approach often make a direct representation of some aspects of real processes elusive to obtain. In our example this concerned the booking mechanisms and the associated mismatch between patients and session lengths. Here we showed how a CTMC model with state-dependent flow rates could be calibrated using a more detailed DES model of that particular mechanism; and could then be used to investigate the policy issue of interest.

Many queueing models used in the literature assume exponential inter-arrival and process times. Thanks to the memoryless Markovian property of the arrival and service processes, these queues can easily be modelled and solved for the steady-state behaviour with the use of the associated flow balance equations. However, the exponential assumption, especially about service times, may be rather limiting for many real queueing problems. It is therefore important to investigate robustness (sensitivity) of the model to departures from the exponential assumption.

In the current study this was done using a DES model that represents the two-node tandem queueing network formulation given in Section 2. Although very simple, the model provides crucial insights into the impact of non-exponential assumptions on the system performance. This investigation showed that the findings suggested by the analytical model remain robust for more general distributions of process times (see, Kozlowski, 2014).

The solution to the flow-balance equations of a queueing system results in a steady-state probability distribution of the system being in each of its states. From these steady-state probabilities it is easy to calculate the performance measures such as utilization levels, average waiting times, average number of patients in the queues, etc. However, apart from these steady-state performance measures one can be interested in the time-dependent behaviour of the system. Unfortunately, for large-scale Markov chains transient solutions can be difficult to obtain. In such situations the DES approach can be very useful, providing a means for observing the evolution of the system over time.

The potential importance of modelling time-dependent behaviour is demonstrated in Fig. 9
                         where we use the results from individual replications to plot examples of queue behaviour. Fig. 9(i) is based on scenario (a) described in Section 3 and shows that even with a very extreme starting position (i.e. both queues empty), the system settles to consistent levels in the two queues which are those predicted by the steady-state model. Hence for this case the steady-state behaviour provides useful insights into real time behaviour, and the CTMC model can be used to obtain this behaviour much more efficiently than the DES model.

However, Fig. 9(ii) is based on scenario (b) described in Section 3, which turns out to be a much more closely balanced system. In this case it is clear that the system is taking much longer to settle to its steady-state behaviour, so much so that steady-state behaviour should not be seen as providing insights into real time behaviour. Fig. 9(iii), also based on scenario (b), emphasises this point showing a very different possible trajectory for the queue lengths over the same period. These examples warn that in some situations the steady-state results will be misleading. If the simulation indicates that it will take over 20 years to achieve steady-state, it is clearly dangerous to interpret them as if they predict behaviour over the next year or two. In practice it is likely that the underlying steady-state will never be achieved, as managerial actions or exogenous factors will bring about some other change much sooner.

The modelling of any system requires a thorough understanding of the underlying processes and interactions between them that influence a system behaviour. The CTMC and the DES modelling approaches involve different ways of thinking about the processes being modelled. Because queuing models typically take a form of flow-balance equations, a queue modeller is often required to think in terms of the rates of service and flows of the entire group of patients. On the other hand, a DES approach usually involves processing individual entities, which require a more detailed description of patient flows and interactions between individual patients. Clearly, these two views of the entire system complement each other, and thus encourage a better understanding of the modelled processes and of system behaviour.

It follows that analytic and simulation models can be used to verify one another. Whenever the two models correspond to each other exactly, one should expect the same results, subject to allowance for sampling errors in simulation. If they do not correspond exactly, one can still compare model outcomes and analyse levels of discrepancy, with any significant differences being explainable by the nature of the two models. This approach was successfully used to verify the CTMC presented in Section 2.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents an analysis of the maximum waiting time guarantee policy using a two-node continuous Markov chain model consisting of examination and operation stations. The main goal was to understand the mechanisms governing the behaviour of the system representing this policy. The trade-off between utilization of public hospital resources and patients’ waiting time is of a particular interest as one of the rising concerns of many policy stakeholders.

It has been shown in this paper that patient booking, rescheduling and withdrawing mechanisms affect the system behaviour significantly. Increased probabilities of patients refusing their appointments reduce the utilization of hospital resources, and this loss is worse for smaller waiting lists. Hence whilst reductions in the maximum waiting time guarantee will reduce waiting times, they will also reduce resource utilization levels, and to a greater extent in small specialties. In particular in overloaded systems, halving the MWTG will typically half the waiting times of patients, but at a cost in terms of loss in resource utilization which is much bigger for small specialties than for big specialties. Therefore, the trade-off between waiting times and resource utilization is case specific and will also depend on the patients’ disutility from waiting and cost of the utilization losses in the public sector. These cost factors will clearly also differ depending on the type of disease and patients’ individual characteristics.

Finally, we note that not all patients use the opportunity of the private treatment, especially when it comes to minor medical cases. In circumstances where a proportion of patients do not mind waiting longer than the waiting time guarantee, the effect would tend to increase waiting times and reduce the losses of utilization. Such scenarios could be easily introduced into the CTMC model using state-dependent arrival rates to the system.

In addition to analysing the MWTG policy, this paper has also highlighted some of the benefits of the complementary use of the two queue modelling approaches: CTMC and DES. It has been shown how a DES model can be used to calibrate the state-dependent process rates of an analytical queueing model. Thus, even if a direct representation of some complex processes in terms of CTMC is impossible, these processes may still be well represented in the CTMC model using state-dependent process rates to be calibrated using simulation results. Other benefits of using the two modelling approaches alongside each other include ease of access to the steady-state and time-dependent performance measures, analysis of the non-exponential case, as well as enhanced model verification and fuller understanding of the underlying processes.

The appendix provides equations for the probabilities of finding replacements at the operation station in the case rescheduling or withdrawal (A.1), and then defines the resulting operations events and their associated rates (A.2).
