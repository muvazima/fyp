                  We demonstrate how the problem of determining the ask price for electricity swing options can be considered as a stochastic bilevel program with asymmetric information. Unlike as for financial options, there is no way for basing the pricing method on no-arbitrage arguments. Two main situations are analyzed: if the seller has strong market power he/she might be able to maximize his/her utility, while in fully competitive situations he/she will just look for a price which makes profit and has acceptable risk. In both cases the seller has to consider the decision problem of a potential buyer – the valuation problem of determining a fair value for a specific option contract – and anticipate the buyer’s optimal reaction to any proposed strike price. We also discuss some methods for finding numerical solutions of stochastic bilevel problems with a special emphasis on using duality gap penalizations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Swing options are derivative contracts – usually between a producer or wholesaler, and a retailer – which give their purchasers the right to buy the underlying commodity at a prespecified exercise price per unit during a future term of validity. For each decision period within this timeframe the purchaser is allowed to choose the quantities delivered within prespecified bounds. Swing contracts are widely used in energy related commodity markets. In this paper we are particularly interested in electricity swing options.

Two important quantification questions arise: pricing aims at finding an exercise price such that neither the holder nor the seller of the option are disadvantaged. On the other hand, valuation of an existing contract with given exercise price should result in a fair resale price.

The valuation problem can be described (see e.g. Haarbrücker & Kuhn, 2009) by an optimization problem for the buyer, where the optimal value corresponds to the economic value of the swing option. The seller however has a different objective than the buyer: he/she tries to find an optimal offered price with respect to his/her own specification, but also needs to consider the buyer’s reaction to this offer (e.g. Broussev & Pflug, 2009). Since both agents take optimal decisions which are related to each other, the very nature of the pricing problem is bilevel and of the leader–follower type: the option seller plays the role of the leader, or upper level decision maker, when setting the price, but he/she acts in view of the reaction of the option buyer, who is the follower, or lower level decision maker. Throughout this paper, we mark all upper level decision problems of the seller by [UL] and those of the lower level option buyer by [LL]. Since future spot market prices are not known at the time of contracting, and since the buyer may make decisions at several time steps, we have to deal with a multistage stochastic bilevel optimization problem.

For this reason we will review swing option modeling as well as stochastic bilevel programming and introduce some new solution methods in the following. While bilevel programming and in particular stochastic (two stage) bilevel programming has recently made considerable advances, stochastic decision problems in electricity usually are large (in particular if formulated as stochastic optimization problems defined on tree structures) and have certain nonstandard features. This means that standard algorithms cannot be applied or lead to unacceptable computation times.

This is true even for the simplest setup, where the optimization problems of both agents are linear, given the decisions of the other level, but bilinear if all decision variables are considered at once. On the other hand the swing option problem is simpler than other typical bilevel problems in that all decisions are determined by the seller’s decision for a strike price, which is a single number. The article will predominantly discuss such algorithms that are able to deal with the complicated overall structure of the problem, but are also suitable to exploit this special feature.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews some basic facts of electricity markets, describes the swing option problem from both, the buyer’s and the seller’s view and states it as a multistage stochastic bilevel optimization problem. Section 3 gives an overview of general solution methods for bilevel problems and introduces two simple approaches, well suited for the bilevel formulation described before. The section closes with a numerical example on swing option pricing. In the appendices we add some technical details on acceptability functionals.

Because of the non-storability of electricity there is a layered structure of short term markets, reaching from day ahead to real time. In addition, also forward contracts exist in most electricity markets, with a gradual transition from forwards with maturities up to 2years to the day ahead spot market. Forward contracts fix a price for future power delivery (the strike price) over a specified period in the future.

Usually, such contracts are traded over-the-counter (OTC) as forward contracts, or in standardized form. In the latter case they are called futures. While settlement at electricity spot and OTC markets usually is physical, futures markets mostly rely on financial settlement. We will not distinguish between forward contracts and futures throughout the rest of the paper. In fact, there is no difference in the valuation of the two contract types, if the interest rate is considered as deterministic.

Given the non-storability of electric energy, the usual no-arbitrage arguments for pricing forward contracts in financial and commodity markets cannot be applied for power markets.

Other models for the spot price and/or the forward price structure – in fact the whole arsenals of econometrics and finance – have been used as well. E.g., starting with Pilipović (1998), mean reverting Pilipović spot price models with different number of risk factors have been formulated. See Eydeland and Wolyniec (2003) for a broad overview of spot and future price models.


                        Swing options – an important form of flexible delivery contracts – can be considered as the simplest and most important types of option-like electricity contracts. They are also known as flexible nomination contracts, take-or-pay contracts, or virtual power plants. See e.g. Kaminski and Gibner (1995), Barbieri and Garman (1996), Pilipović and Wengler (1998), and Pilipović (2007).

A swing option gives its buyer (or option holder) the right to get a commodity at a price K per unit, which is fixed now, but allows to choose the actual purchase quantities in a later moment of time. For electricity swing options we will state the price as K EUR per megawatthour. For simplicity we will assume that delivery takes place at equidistant periods

We see that – unlike typical financial options – swing options are flexible with respect to time and quantity and so is able to reduce both, volume risk and price risk for the buyer. In both, the gas and the electricity industry swing options have been used for many years, either as embedded options related to general delivery contracts, or in the form of separate contracts. Typical buyers in the electricity sector are public distributors with fixed retail prices, facing random load and spot prices. See e.g. Doege, Lüthi, and Schiltknecht (2006) regarding the usage of swing options as hedging instruments.

Swing contracts usually are traded bilaterally and hence may be subject to market power: often the seller of a contract will be a big producer or even a big, state owned entity. On the other hand, if market efficiency and liquidity are high, the seller’s ability to set the price might be severely limited. We will consider both cases in the following. In any case, the seller’s scope is limited by the buyer’s possibility to buy the commodity at the spot price if the swing-price is too high.

Typically, the economic risk is with the option seller, who has to contract at a time, when the information about future spot prices is very low. In addition, there might be counterparty-risk at both sides of the contract, if one of the counterparties does not fulfill all contracted conditions. Upfront payments may be agreed to reduce this risk. But generally speaking, non-compliance with agreements will not be an issue in this survey. We will also neglect other costs related to, e.g. setting up, calculating and monitoring the contract.

Two questions arise when swing options are analyzed:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Valuation: Given the exercise price K, what is the value of a swing option for the buyer?


                                 Pricing: What exercise price K should be offered by the seller?

In view of the preceding discussion it is clear that the answers, in particular to the second question, will be more complicated than in financial option pricing and involves optimal decisions of both, the buyer and the seller.

Any valuation of a contract should involve the option holder’s optimal exercise strategy. Consider a pure trader, who – in addition to buying a swing option – is able to buy and sell electricity at the spot market. His objective is to maximize the profit by taking any arbitrage opportunity between the strike price and market prices. In the basic setup the trader maximizes his/her expected value.

A simple swing option contract with exercise price K (which is set by the option seller) and constraints (2.3) and (2.4) can be described by the following multistage stochastic program:

                         is a stochastic process, its distribution has to be estimated from available data, such as past observations or economic forecasts. While the buyer needs only to estimate one- or h-step-ahead distributions, the seller is required to model the process for the whole validity period of the contract.

Stochastic optimization is an important tool for risk management in energy production and trading, see e.g. Fleten and Kristoffersen (2007), Möst and Keles (2010), and Rocha and Kuhn (2012) and hence also has been used to formulate decision problems related to swing options: the formulation (2.8) was introduced in Broussev and Pflug (2009). Haarbrücker and Kuhn (2009) proposes a similar program with additional constraints, see also Frauendorfer, Güssow, Haarbrücker, and Kuhn (2005). Using a Pilipović type spot price model, the idea in Haarbrücker and Kuhn (2009) is that the optimal value of the objective function gives the value of the swing option from the buyers view.

A market participant, optimizing (2.8), fully speculates against the issuer of the swing option, as he will only buy, when spot prices are expected to be high: this causes opportunity costs for the issuer. As pointed out for example in Broussev and Pflug (2009) and Hochreiter and Wozabal (2010) there are other market participants whose behavior differs from a pure trader: their main goal is to satisfy the demand and not to speculate. We mention demand followers with access to spot markets and demand followers without access to spot markets. Both types of demand followers – these could be retailers, selling electricity to end users at a fixed price – have to cover a (stochastic) load at future points in time.

Another class – retail clients without access to the spot market, but with access to providers with different prices – is considered in the context of classical retail pricing by Carrión, Arroyo, and Conejo (2009).

While a variety of modifications and extensions can be useful in certain situations, we will refer to formulation (2.8), because facing a pure trader/arbitrageur is a kind of worst case setting for an option seller. We also mostly abstain from using expected utility or risk adjustments for the option buyer’s optimization problem, because his/her utility is unknown to the option seller.

As an alternative, all models discussed so far can also be formulated and solved in terms of stochastic dynamic programming. In this case at least the amount of energy consumed up to time t has to be introduced as a state variable, additional to the prices. Papers on valuing swing options by dynamic programming include Thompson (1995), Lari-Lavasani, Simchi, and Ware (2001), Jaillet, Ronn, and Tompaidis (2004), Barrera-Esteve et al. (2006), Baldick, Kolos, and Tompaidis (2006).

Often dynamic programming problems are solved approximatively. This is also the case for problems related to swing option valuation. Meinshausen and Hambly (2004) extends the least-squares Monte Carlo method, originally developed for the valuation of American options (see Longstaff & Schwartz, 2001). Because the results of this method depends heavily on the price models used for simulation, different variants have been proposed in the following, see e.g. Gråvas (2004) and Boogert and de Jong (2008). Further simulation based valuation methods were proposed in Ibáñez and Zapatero (2004) and Ibáñez (2004).

Using the buyer’s decision problem (2.8) and a suitable spot price model we are able to valuate a swing contract with given strike price. Its value is given by the maximum objective value, if the maximum is positive. Otherwise the value is zero and the contract will not be concluded.

The main question from the seller’s standpoint consists in setting a suitable strike price. From a finance point of view it seems natural to search for a strike price that results in a value of zero for the buyer – such that the buyer is indifferent between concluding or denying the contract (see Haarbrücker & Kuhn, 2009).

However, there are important differences between financial derivatives and electricity derivatives. For financial derivatives, the key principle is the no-arbitrage assumption: if a contract can be replicated by some strategy involving only contracts, for which the price is already given, then the price of the new contract is determined by the other prices in such a way that there do not exist any arbitrage possibilities, i.e. no riskless positive income with zero initial capital. The fundamental result in option pricing states that the correct price can be found by looking at valuation measures, which make the discounted underlying price process a martingale. If this martingale measure is unique, one speaks about a complete market, otherwise the market is called incomplete. In the incomplete situation, an interval of prices is determined: if the price of the contract lies within this interval, no arbitrage is possible. Notice that the existence of replicating strategies is fundamental for this pricing method.

In contrast, pricing in electricity markets cannot be based on the no-arbitrage principle since for a given demand pattern – flexible or not – no replicating strategies exist: electricity is not storable and there are only very few instruments (i.e. contracts such as base and peak futures) available to partially hedge a specific contract. In such a situation, a strike price resulting in a value of zero for the buyer, might just be too high, especially in a fully competitive setting without strong market power on the side of the seller. Even the seller might be better off with a smaller strike price, because his/her profit depends on the volume of sales, which is reduced by the buyer when the price increases (see e.g. the example in Section 4.5).

Instead of the no-arbitrage principle we use two alternative approaches for modeling the decision of the option seller. Which one is more appropriate in a given situation, depends on the market power relations between seller and buyer:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Expected profit/utility maximization: If the seller is (almost) a monopolist, he/she will be able to maximize the expected profit. Of course the optimal decisions of the buyer – his/her reactions to any strike price decision of the seller – have to be anticipated.


                                 Acceptability pricing: In a very competitive market the aim is just to find the minimal strike price such that the profit and loss distribution, resulting from optimal decisions of the buyer, stays ”acceptable” for the seller.

To describe the seller’s problem in more detail we assume that he/she has the possibility to get electricity at a price

                         makes the whole a bilevel problem with the buyer’s decision as the lower level and the seller’s decision as the upper level. From a game-theoretic viewpoint, these are Stackelberg games (also called leader–follower game), where the leader determines the price, while the follower communicates his/her demand based on the price information.

                         is incomplete: it is not clear how to deal with the fact that the lower level decision variables

                         appear in both, the upper levels objective function and constraints.

Typically, in textbook examples the lower level solution y, given the upper level decision x can be calculated analytically and is unique. In this case, y can be expressed as a function 
                           
                              y
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                         of the upper level decision variable, and hence it is possible to replace all occurrences of y by 
                           
                              y
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                        . The whole bilevel problem then can be reformulated in terms of x as the only remaining decision variable.

Unfortunately the situation is more complicated for the swing problem. Analytical solutions cannot be given for realistic instances, and

                              ]
                           
                         is linear in y given K. The latter fact means that unique solutions are not guaranteed. For the sake of clarity, we review step by step some basic facts about bilevel problems.

The largest part of the bilevel literature focuses on the optimistic approach and we will follow this trend in the rest of this paper. However, see Wiesemann, Tsoukalas, Kleniati, and Rustem (2012) for a recent treatment of pessimistic bilevel optimization.

Even optimistic bilevel problems are nonconvex, and strongly NP-hard (e.g. Bard, 1991; Ben-Ayed & Blair, 1990) if the lower level feasible set depends on the upper level decision. See e.g. Dempe (1992) and Outrata (1993) for necessary optimality conditions. Note that bilevel problems can be reformulated as MPEC problems, but as was demonstrated in Dempe and Dutta (2012), local optimal solutions of the MPEC are not necessarily also locally optimal for the original bilevel formulation.

A specific intricacy of bilevel problems lies in the fact that even for very simple cases the feasible set of (2.16) can be disconnected. As a simple, but instructive example, consider a revenue maximizing upper level, determining the price x of a good, and a lower level choosing the demand y. The lower level maximizes its utility and has a budget of 14 currency units. A substitute good is available at the price of 3, hence the lower level also decides, how much (denoted by z) to buy of the substitute. Finally, the lower level is contractually bound to buy at least 1 and at most 5 units of the upper levels good. Given the price x, the lower level problem can be stated as

                         is new. The overall Stackelberg-type setup of the seller’s problems is also similar to the electricity retailing problem described in Carrión et al. (2009). However the latter paper deals with the relationship between a retailer and its clients in view of competition between retailers with different price structure. In this model clients do not have access to spot markets and take their only decision – of supplier selection – at the beginning of the planning horizon. The retailer decides on offered prices purchases on spot, as well as futures markets. In this model, the lower level (client) as well as the upper level (retailer) take here-and-now decisions. The swing option problem is more complicated at the lower level, since the option buyer has access to the spot market and is able to make time dependent decisions. Conceptually, swing option problems deal with the relation between a wholesaler and a retailer and not between a retailer and its clients. Stackelberg-type problems have also been proposed for gas-markets in order to model the relationship between pipeline operating companies and natural gas shipping companies (Dempe, Kalashnikov, Pérez-Valdés, & Kalashnykova, 2011; Kalashnikov, Pérez-Valdés, Tomasgard, & Kalashnykova, 2010). However those models are not focussed at pricing. Further bilevel models related to energy can be found in e.g. Fampa, Barroso, Candal, and Simonetti (2008) and Carrión et al. (2009).

Generally spoken, it is not possible to solve bilevel problems based on the formulations (2.8), (2.22) or (2.23) as optimization problems in function spaces. If one wants to apply numerical algorithms and solve the pricing problem with realistic data it is therefore important to discretize the formulation. Before we discuss tree-structured discretizations of these problems, we will review some methods to solve stochastic bilevel programs. We also discuss stochastic quasigradient methods in some detail, because they can be used to approximate solutions for both, the original and the discretized problem, provided that it is possible to give an estimate for the gradient of the lower level decision. Finally we propose some simple algorithms for the important practical case of a linear formulation of the swing option problem. Because stochastic gradient methods will not work for LPs, we will refer to a penalty method and a simple bracketing algorithm for our two main cases, the monopolistic and the competitive formulation.

There is a vast literature on the theory of deterministic bilevel problems and related algorithms, see Bard (1998), Dempe (2002), Colson, Marcotte, and Savard (2007) for overviews and general theory. Extreme point algorithms are suitable for small, fully linear bilevel problems (e.g. Marcotte & Savard, 1991) and exploit the fact that the optimal solution of linear bilevel problems lie in some extreme points. Because the described swing option problems are not linear, such algorihms cannot be applied. Gradient/subgradient methods (e.g. Kolstad & Lasdon, 1990; Savard & Gauvin, 1994) use subgradients or directional derivatives to construct descent directions, see (3.1) below. Because bilevel problems are hard to solve, also heuristics have been applied, see e.g. (Calvete, Galé, & Mateo, 2008).

However the most popular approach extends the upper level problem by necessary optimality conditions for the lower level decision problem and tries to solve the resulting highly nonlinear optimization problem. See e.g. Luo, Pang, and Ralph (1996) on dealing with general equilibrium constraints and Allende and Still (2012) for using the KKT conditions. We mention two possibilities for dealing with the resulting complementarity constraints: branch and bound methods and penalty methods. The latter (e.g. Aiyoshi & Shimizu, 1984; Facchinei & Soares, 1997; Harker & Choi, 2009; Marcotte & Zhu, 1996) use a penalty function in order to augment the upper level objective function by a penalization of the equilibrium or KKT constraints.

Typically, algorithms for stochastic bilevel problems are discussed in the context of one- or two-stage stochastic problems. Usually, the models are discretized and formulated such that the upper level has to decide here and now, whereas the lower level is able to wait and see. An exception is e.g. Xu and Ye (2010). Basically the main methods for general bilevel programs have be modified for dealing with (two-stage) stochastic bilevel programs: gradient descent and penalization methods were discussed already in Patriksson and Wynter (1999). Again, using necessary conditions of the lower level problem as constraints for the upper level problem is an important approach, see e.g. Facchinei, Jiang, and Qi (1999) and Liu, Xu, and Lin (2011). In the MPEC-framework some papers also deal with equilibrium constraints for Nash-equilibria at the lower level. Such approaches have also been applied to various aspects of electricity and energy markets (see Yao, Oren, & Adler, 2007; Zhang, Xu, & Wu, 2010).

The situation for multistage decision problems is different, if the lower level decision maker cannot be considered as a clairvoyant: information increases gradually over time. It is possible to reformulate stochastic programs as deterministic equivalents and typical MPEC approaches have been used in Carrión et al. (2009) and Dempe et al. (2011) for stochastic multistage bilevel problems.

Gradient/subgradient descent methods can be applied to bilevel problems, if gradients or subgradients for the optimal decisions of the lower level problem can be calculated (or estimated). This is also true for stochastic bilevel problems and a convenient method in this case is the stochastic quasigradient method, described in the following.

It should be kept in mind that the stochastic quasigradient method only works for compact, convex upper level feasible sets, which means that it is not applicable to the constraints used in our formulation (2.13) of the competitive case. However, for a strictly concave expected utility formulation of the upper level problem stochastic gradient-type methods can be used.

We begin with treating deterministic problems, i.e. special cases of (2.15) resp. (2.17). For using gradient methods the feasible set

                         has to be defined by equalities and inequalities. Suppose that the lower level problem is

                        The stochastic quasigradient method for bilevel problems was implemented e.g. in Dance and Gaivoronski (2012). However, it is not always easily possible to find gradients for the lower level solution

                        . The tree structure (related to the filtration of the process) can be defined by stating the predecessor node n− for each node n.

The tree carries the spot price process, i.e. spot prices

The spot prices and the related probabilities are estimated from historical data, see e.g. Dupacova, Gröwe-Kuska, and Römisch (2003), Pflug and Pichler (2011, Chapter 15), and Kovacevic and Pichler (2012). In addition, (2.1) is used to ensure that arbitrage between spot and futures markets is impossible, which would lead to unbounded problems.

To specify the upper level problems in a concrete way, we will assume pure expectation as the objective for the monopolistic case and the average value at risk 
                           
                              A
                           
                        V@R (expected tail loss, conditional value at risk) as defining the minimum acceptability for the full competitive case. See Appendix A for a discussion of 
                           
                              A

As we have seen, typical standard approaches for bilevel programming may fail for the multistage stochastic case because of the high dimensionality of the problems. Furthermore stochastic quasigradient methods are not able to deal with all linear formulations in a sensible way. However it is possible to exploit some special properties of the LP formulations. Two observations are critical.
                           
                              •
                              All programs (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7) are bilinear in x and y, which also means that they are linear in x given y, and in y given x.

While the dimensionality of variables and constraints may be very large, all other decisions depend critically on the strike price: when the strike price is known the lower level decisions can be calculated by solving an LP. Given the strike price and the lower level decisions the remaining upper level decisions (the hedges) can also be calculated by solving an LP.

The second observation already suggests an algorithm that will be discussed below, see Section 3.4.1. The other algorithms will reformulate our bilevel problems as ordinary bilinear optimization problems by penalizing the duality gap of the lower level problem. Standard approaches for bilinear problems, or a bracketing algorithm for the competitive case then can be used to find local optima.

The reformulated lower level optimization problem (3.4) has an objective function that is bilinear in x and y, i.e. is linear in y for given x and vice versa. All constraints are linear. Using matrix notation it can be represented in the following way

                           Notice that the primal–dual problem is a bilinear problem, which has a nonnegative objective, its optimal value 0 is obtained if and only if y (respectively v) are the optimal value of the primal (respectively dual) problem.

In the monopolistic case the objective function of the upper level problem (3.6) is also bilinear and can be formulated as

The reformulation as a bilinear problem extends the penalization proposed in White and Anandalingam (1993), where it was used for purely linear bilevel programs. Notice that

                            is bilinear in the objective but the constraints are linear. In this case sequential linear programming (see e.g. Wendell & Hurter, 1976) leads to a local solution. Algorithm 1 summarizes this approach. Recall that

                            denotes the vector of all components of x excluding the strike price K. To keep the algorithmic description simple we assume that the problem is feasible (in y) and that 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                            is chosen large enough, such that the duality gap is closed.

                            is the worst solution out of all lower level decisions that maximize the lower level objective with given K. Finally use the

For a more realistic model it is important to include the constraint (3.5), such that it is possible for the lower level to reject the contract. If this constraint is included into (3.12), the same reasoning as above will lead to a modified problem

                            is a bilinear problem with bilinear constraints. While algorithms, using branch-and-bound approaches, do exist for this type of problem (see Linderoth, 2005; Luedtke, Namazifar, & Linderoth, 2010), it might be more convenient to use a simpler method.

This is a bilinear problem itself but by some simple line search algorithm (in K) it is easily possible to find the value with sufficient precision. Finally Algorithm 1 can be extended: if

                            and solve (3.4) with this fixed K, which leads to a new value for y. Then go back to to step 4. If

In the competitive case with the upper level given by (3.7) we see that bilinear constraints, related to the

                            is piecewise constant as a function of K, and the intervals of constancy can be found by looking at the dual variables at the lower level solution. The overall problem can then be solved by solving a sequence of linear programs.

A second simple algorithm uses the fact that the strike price K is the main decision variable, determining the further decisions of both levels. A bracketing type procedure is used to find the lowest level of K such that all constraints are satisfied, and the dual gap of the lower level problem is closed. This is basically a sequence of feasibility problems that finds the minimal price, if the region

In both cases we want to analyze pricing strategies for the seller of the option. To this end we seek for the largest strike prices, such that the constraint (3.5) is fulfilled, and for the smallest strike price such that the

                        -constraint of the upper level is fulfilled. This gives a whole range of possible strike prices. If the seller has some bargaining power, he/she will be able to enforce a higher price than the absolute minimum. If the seller is a monopolist, he/she will be able to set the price such that her expected profit is maximized, hence we also calculate the optimal monopolistic solution for cases A and B.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Swing options are important types of derivatives at electricity markets, and finding a suitable strike price is a key problem for producers and traders. Because of the unique features of electricity markets the usual no-arbitrage methods for option pricing cannot be applied. As an alternative this article gave a survey of game theoretic approaches, modeling the decision process as a bilevel program, or Stackelberg-type game. After describing swing options and reviewing basic facts about (stochastic) bilevel programs we considered two basic (idealized) situations: the case of a monopolitic seller and the case of full competition. In the first case the seller of the option maximizes his/her profit, while in the second case he/she only has the aim to set the price such that a certain risk level is not exceeded (acceptability pricing). In both cases the buyer of the option is able to trade at the spot market or even reject to sign an offered contract.

We also gave an overview of literature related to solution methods (see Table 1
                     ) for (stochastic) bilevel problems. Most of the classical methods are not feasible for the swing option pricing problem: extreme point algorithms can be applied only to linear bilevel problems, gradient methods need unique solutions and the usage of KKT conditions leads to untractably large instances. Therefore we proposed simple solution algorithms that are based on discretized reformulations as bilinear problems. The analyzed algorithms for both the monopolistic and the competitive case use bilinearity, penalize the duality gap of the lower level problem and account for the basic fact that the strike price decision determines all other lower and upper level decisions. Such approaches are especially useful in the context of big practical problems.

Since riskless contracts do not exist in electricity markets, decision makers have to use an acceptability criterion for contracts. If W is the random net profit of a contract, then 
                        
                           W
                           ⩾
                           0
                        
                      would be a clear criterion for acceptance. However, such riskless profit is not possible. For financial options, the price is considered to be correct if a hedge is found resulting in 
                        
                           W
                           =
                           0
                        
                      a.s., but for electricity contracts, a hedge does not exist. An acceptability criterion accepts some W, even if 
                        
                           P
                           {

                           <
                           0
                           }
                           >
                           W
                        
                     .

The most important acceptability criterion used in practical situations is to accept W if
                        
                           (A.1)

                              W
                              <
                              q
                              }

                              α
                              ,
                           
                        
                     i.e. if the probability of a shortfall below q loss is smaller than some predetermined small value 
                        
                           α
