               Abstract
               
                  Background
                  In pediatric medicine, inadequate access to subspecialty care is widespread. Referral Guidelines are structured tools that describe criteria for subspecialty referral and may decrease medically unnecessary referrals and thereby improve access.
               
               
                  Problem
                  Variation in referral rates and suboptimal communication around pediatric subspecialty referrals leads to inappropriate and ineffective use of scarce clinical resources.
               
               
                  Goals
                  Connecticut Children×³s Medical Center prioritized the development of collaborative care tools at the interface between primary and subspecialty care, including Referral Guidelines.
               
               
                  Strategy
                  A comprehensive set of Referral Guidelines was developed and consisted of background information on a given condition, strategies for initial evaluation and management, instructions for how and when to refer, and what the patient and family could expect at the visit with the subspecialist. A key component of the initiative was the integral role of the PCP during development.
               
               
                  Results
                  Twenty-eight Referral Guidelines have been developed among 15 subspecialty areas. A novel process for active dissemination of Referral Guidelines was piloted in one medical subspecialty area and led to a reduction in overall referrals and an increase in the proportion of referrals meeting the necessary criteria.
