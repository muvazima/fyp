                  Inconsistency measures have been proposed as a way to manage inconsistent knowledge bases in the AI community. To deal with inconsistencies in the context of conditional probabilistic logics, rationality postulates and computational efficiency have driven the formulation of inconsistency measures. Independently, investigations in formal epistemol-ogy have used the betting concept of Dutch book to measure an agent's degree of incoherence. In this paper, we show the impossibility of joint satisfiability of the proposed postulates, proposing to replace them by more suitable ones. Thus we reconcile the rationality postulates for inconsistency measures in probabilistic bases and show that several inconsistency measures suggested in the literature and computable with linear programs satisfy the reconciled postulates. Additionally, we give an interpretation for these feasible measures based on the formal epistemology concept of Dutch book, bridging the views of two so far separate communities in AI and Philosophy. In particular, we show that incoherence degrees in formal epistemology may lead to novel approaches to inconsistency measures in the AI view.

                           “when you can measure what you are speaking about, you know something about it; but when you cannot […] your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind;”
                        
                         — Lord Kelvin [45]
                        
                     
                  

Measuring has been a prominent activity in advancing scientific and technological development. Not all measures are alike and good measures express intuitive notions in a useful way. In the field of deductive logical reasoning, one usually has an intuition expressing that one theory is more inconsistent than other, capturing the idea that the “effort” to restore consistency is greater in one case than the other. Also, no effort is required to restore the consistency of a consistent theory.

Based on those intuitions, there are several proposals for measuring inconsistency in knowledge bases over purely logical languages [19]. Some of these proposals involved attaching probabilities to formulas [29], or the combination of inconsistency factors [20]. Some of these measures are discrete or even qualitative, while others are more like distances, but all these measures have to behave like an information measure 
                     [6]. And to adhere to certain intuitions, a series of postulates for inconsistency measures for purely logical knowledge bases were proposed [21,22]; for example, the consistency postulate states that the inconsistency measure of a consistent base is 0.

Purely logical bases are known to be expressively limited in representing uncertainty required for real-world applications. In this work, we are interested in measuring the inconsistency of knowledge bases over logical probabilistic languages, which combine the deductive power of logical systems with the well-founded theory of probability. This kind of extension of purely logical systems can be traced back to the work of Boole [2], but has gained attention of AI researchers since the work of Nilsson [33], and has been extended to conditional probabilistic logic [37].

In AI, one of the main uses of measuring inconsistency in a knowledge base is to guide the consolidation of inconsistent pieces of information. Within propositional logic, Grant and Hunter [13] showed how inconsistency measures can be used to direct the stepwise resolution of conflicts via the weakening or the discarding of formulas.

In probabilistic bases, inconsistencies are rather common, specially when knowledge is gathered from different sources. To fix these probabilistic knowledge bases, one can, for instance, delete pieces of information, or change the probabilities' numeric values (or intervals). In this case, an inconsistency measure helps one to detect if a change approximates consistency or not. In other areas, inconsistency measures for probabilistic logic have found applications in merging conflicting opinions, leading to an increased predictive power [47,25], and in quantifying the incoherence of procedures from classical statistical hypothesis testing [41].

The issue of measuring inconsistency in probabilistic bases has more recently been tackled by Thimm [44], Muiño [31] and Potyka [34], who developed measures based on distance minimization, tailored to the probabilistic case. Potyka focused on computational aspects, looking for efficiently computable measures [34]. Muiño was driven by the CADIAG-2 knowledge base, presenting its infinitesimal inconsistency degree, however based on a different semantics [31]. Thimm [44] adapted Hunter and Konieczny's [22] desirable properties for inconsistency measures to the probabilistic setting, developing measures that satisfy a set of rationality postulates.

It was Thimm [44] who realized the importance of continuity as a Postulate for the probabilistic case, namely the property that a small change in the probability associated to formula (absent in the purely logical case) should lead only to small changes in the inconsistency measure. It was just natural that, (conditional) probabilistic logic being an extension of the classical cases, the continuity postulate was simply added to the postulates defining classical inconsistency measures.

In this work, we argue that continuity cannot hold together with classical postulates such as consistency and independence, and some of these postulates must be abandoned or exchanged for other ones that restore joint satisfiability. So the first contribution of this work is that we identify and fix the possible problem with the postulates proposed by Thimm [44].

Another contribution lies in showing that these measures of inconsistency have a direct counterpart in formal epistemology research over the coherence of an agent's degrees of belief. It is known that inconsistent probabilistic beliefs correspond to a set of bets with guaranteed loss to the agent, which is called a “Dutch Book” [8,27]. This agent's incoherence has been measured by formalizing the intuition that the greater the inconsistency the greater the corresponding sure loss, and vice versa [40,43]. Thus we interpret these incoherence measures via guaranteed losses as inconsistency measures, showing that existing measures based on distance minimization correspond to guaranteed losses that quantify an agent's incoherence. To the best of our knowledge, no clear link has been shown between these two areas.

Here is a bird's-eye view of how we achieve these goals.

After introducing probabilistic knowledge bases in Section 2, this paper develops three main contributions, in three different sections, dealing closely with three other works. In the following, we overview such contributions, together with the organization of the paper and their relation to the existing literature.

Inconsistency measures for probabilistic knowledge bases were analyzed via rationality postulates by Thimm [44]. In Section 3, we argue for the incompatibility of such desirable properties. Firstly, we introduce the problematic postulates: consistency, independence and continuity. The independence postulate claims that a free conditional — a (conditional) probability assignment that does not belong to any minimal inconsistent set — can be rule out without changing the degree of inconsistency. We also present the MIS-separability property, which deals with decomposability (through Minimal Inconsistent Sets) and implies independence. As Thimm's work regards precise probabilities, these four concepts are then introduced in this way. In a second step, Section 3 brings the first contribution of this work: the presented postulates are shown to be incompatible.

In Section 4, we search for a reasonable way to reconcile the incompatible postulates. First of all, we argue that independence is the requirement to be weakened, together with the stronger property of MIS-separability. Afterwards, the concept of free conditional is analyzed, for independence is based on it. We find that free conditional is a notion linked to classical consolidation and contraction (i.e., discarding formulas to reach consistency), and it is not suitable for probabilistic bases. The innocuous conditional concept is introduced, by investigating a natural consolidation procedure for probabilities: through widening their intervals, instead of ruling them out. The i-independence postulate is put forward based on innocuous conditionals. In a similar way, we observe that MIS (minimal inconsistent set) is a notion that fails to capture all causes of inconsistency in the probabilistic knowledge bases. We define the alternative concept of inescapable conflict, which yields the IC-separability property. We show that innocuous conditionals are to inescapable conflicts as free conditionals are to minimal inconsistent sets. At the end of Section 4, the second main contribution of this paper emerges when i-independence and IC-separability are shown to be compatible with consistency and continuity, besides other desirable properties from the literature that are then presented.

Once a consistent package of postulates is laid out, a myriad of inconsistency measures can still be considered rational. Hence, in Section 5, further criteria to evaluate inconsistency measures are discussed: computational efficiency and meaningful interpretation. On the one hand, two inconsistency measures computable through linear programs are adapted to imprecise probabilities from the work of Potyka [34]. It is shown that both measures satisfy the core postulates, and we present the additional desirable properties each one satisfies. On the other hand, we review two measures from Schervish, Kadane and Seidenfeld that quantify the incoherence of an agent using the betting concept of Dutch book [40], under the operational interpretation that her degrees of belief (probabilities) determine her gambling behavior. The third main contribution of this paper lies in showing the connection between inconsistency measures for probabilistic knowledge bases and incoherence measures for agents from formal epistemology. We prove that the two measures adapted from Potyka that are computable through linear programs are equivalent to two measures from Schervish et al. — that is, these two measures are rather efficient and have a meaningful interpretation. The final part of the section reviews other measures from the work of Schervish et al., showing that they also satisfy the postulates and are computationally feasible.

As several families of inconsistency measures are discussed throughout the paper, Table 1
                      compiles their notation, the section in which they are defined and a short explanation of each.

The problem of verifying the consistency of a knowledge base is called probabilistic satisfiability (or PSAT) [12]. Probabilistic satisfiability has been rediscovered several times, and an analytical and unconditional version was actually proposed by Boole [2]. Hailperin [14], Bruno and Gilio [3], and Nilsson [33] suggested solutions via linear programs. This linear programming approach can be easily extended to handle conditional probabilities under the semantics we are using [16]. Recent advances in algorithms for PSAT solving can be found in [17,9,28].

                     , in an alternative semantics, the latter restriction could be added to the program, although losing the linear program standard format; this is the semantics adopted by Muiño [31], for instance. De Finetti proposed an alternative setting in which the conditional probability is fundamental [8] and the satisfaction of probabilistic conditionals does not trivialize when the conditioning event has null probability. In such scenario, the consistency is called coherence, and its checking demands solving a sequence of linear programs [5].

When all interval bounds are rational numbers, PSAT is an NP-complete problem [12]; if there is a solution, there is a solution with only 
                        m
                        +
                        1
                      possible worlds receiving positive probability mass, where m is the knowledge base size. Nevertheless, column generation methods can handle large problems [26,24], and several approaches have recently appeared [28,9,17,7]. Note that this linear programming approach can be applied to other probabilistic logics (see, for instance, [1] and [23]).

Approaches to measuring inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases have been put forward by Muiño [31], Thimm [44] and Potyka [34], with different semantics for the conditionals. We follow the one adopted by Thimm and Potyka, in which a conditional is also satisfied by any measure assigning null probability to the conditioning formula. Thimm has done a groundlaying work [44], extending Hunter's postulates for inconsistency measures to the probabilistic case, which is our starting point. Potyka suggests feasible measures [34] we will review in Section 5.1, after investigating carefully the postulates. In this section, we begin with some desirable properties proposed by Thimm and then argue against their joint satisfiability.

                           :

                           )
                        . Thimm's investigation is restricted to measures

                           )
                         over knowledge bases with precise probabilities, to what we narrow our focus in this section. The author proposes some desirable properties such a function should satisfy, following Hunter and Konieczny's work for classical logic [20]. Although Thimm investigates a total of ten postulates, we describe in this section only four of these properties that we consider problematic. The first one claims that an inconsistency measure must at least discriminate between consistent and inconsistent bases:


                        
                           Postulate 3.1
                           Consistency


                           
                              
                                 I
                                 (
                                 Γ
                                 )
                                 =
                                 0
                               
                              iff Γ is consistent.
                           

A second desirable property has to do with probabilistic conditionals one can ignore while measuring inconsistency, since they are not involved with the unsatisfiability, in some sense. Some notation is needed to formalize it.


                        
                           Definition 3.2
                           A set Γ of probabilistic conditionals is a minimal inconsistent set (MIS) if Γ is inconsistent and every set 
                                 
                                    
                                       Γ
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                                 ⊊
                                 Γ
                               is consistent.

Minimal inconsistent sets can be considered the purest form of inconsistency [21], capturing its causes. The focus on MISes is derived from the seminal work of Reiter [36] on the diagnosis problem. Reiter investigated how formulas from a base could be ruled out in order to restore consistency, by choosing at least one element from each MIS, computing thusly a hitting set of their collection.

Let 
                           
                              MIS
                           
                           (
                           Γ
                           )
                         denote the collection of all MISes in Γ. Now we can define the central concept of free probabilistic conditional, following Thimm [44]:


                        
                           Definition 3.3
                           A free probabilistic conditional of Γ is a probabilistic conditional 
                                 α
                                 ∈
                                 Γ
                               such that, for all 
                                 Δ
                                 ∈
                                 
                                    MIS
                                 
                                 (
                                 Γ
                                 )
                              , 
                                 α
                                 ∉
                                 Δ
                              .

Analogously, a free probabilistic conditional of Γ is in all its maximal consistent subsets. The postulate of independence then claims that ruling out a free probabilistic conditional from a knowledge base should not change its inconsistency degree [44].


                        
                           Postulate 3.4
                           Independence


                           
                              If α is a free probabilistic conditional of Γ, then 
                              
                                 I
                                 (
                                 Γ
                                 )
                                 =
                                 I
                                 (
                                 Γ
                                 ∖
                                 {
                                 α
                                 }
                                 )
                              
                              .
                           

A stronger condition, also introduced by Hunter and Konieczny and adopted by Thimm, deals with a sort of decomposability of the inconsistency measure through its minimal inconsistent sets. We call it a property, saving the name “postulate” to the most basic properties required from every measure. The version we present is tailored from Hunter and Konieczny's work [20]:


                        
                           Property 3.5

The idea behind this property is that the inconsistency of the whole knowledge base should be the sum of the inconsistency of its parts, whenever the partition does not break any minimal inconsistent set. For instance, consider 
                           Δ
                           =

                              satisfies independence.
                           

These properties can be found in Hunter and Konieczny's work [21], in the definition of a “MinInc” separable basic inconsistency measure for knowledge bases over classical propositional logic. The measures they introduce are shown to fit such desiderata. Thimm revises the adaptation of these classical inconsistency measures to the probabilistic case and convincingly argues that they are not suitable to the quantitative nature of probabilities, since classical logic is qualitative.

To motivate the search for new inconsistency measures for probabilistic knowledge bases, while dispensing with measures from classical logic, Thimm puts forward the postulate of continuity. Intuitively, one expects that small changes in the probabilities of a knowledge base yield small changes in its degree of inconsistency. To formalize the continuity concept in precise knowledge bases, we introduce some notation, following Thimm [44].

To find inconsistency measures holding the desirable properties, including continuity, Thimm introduces a family of measures based on distance minimization, taking into account the numerical value of the probabilities. The basic idea is to quantify the inconsistency through the minimum changes, according to some distance, one has to apply on the probabilities to make the base consistent. The compatibility of consistency, independence and continuity is implicitly stated when it is proved that this whole family of inconsistency measures based on distance minimization satisfies them; and another family is proved to hold MIS-separability as well [44].

The work done by Thimm [44] has carefully analyzed the problem of measuring inconsistency in knowledge bases over probabilistic logic. Desirable properties were borrowed from classical logic [20], and the crucial postulate of continuity was added. To attend these properties, measures based on distance minimization were introduced and some important results were proved. However, under a closer examination, the proposed postulates are incompatible.

Looking at the counterexample given in the proof of Theorem 3.8 may shed some light on what is the cause of such conflict among the desirable properties. The only minimal inconsistent set in Δ is Γ, and so independence forces the degree of inconsistency of Δ to be the same as that of Γ, but this is not generally the case when inconsistency is measured via probability changing. This happens due to the fact that changing the probabilities in Γ to some consistent setting does not in general imply that Δ becomes consistent. Although Γ is the only minimal inconsistent set of Δ, there is another way to prove the contradiction. Note that Γ implies

The findings from the previous section suggest that in order to drive the rational choice of an inconsistency measure for knowledge bases, we must abandon at least one postulate among consistency, independence and continuity. We claim that a weakening of the desired properties can restore their compatibility, and in this section we investigate paths to achieve that goal. After reconciling the problematic postulates, we review other proposed properties for inconsistency measures and extend them to the general case of knowledge bases with imprecise probabilities, showing some measures to satisfy them.

The consistency postulate seems to be indisputable, since the least one can expect from an inconsistency measure is that it separates inconsistent from consistent cases, or some inconsistency from none. The answer to the question of which property we should relax to restore compatibility is thus reduced to either independence or continuity. Hunter and Konieczny have already noted problems with independence in knowledge bases over classical logic, proposing to relax it [22]. Intuition shall be inclined towards keeping continuity, for it reflects the particular quantitative nature of probabilistic reasoning. A pragmatic reason to give up independence (and so MIS-separability) is simply to keep continuity, given consistency, to save inconsistency measures based on distance minimization. In the sequel, the withdrawal of independence within probabilistic logic is argued for in a more compelling way.

The notion of free conditional and the postulate of independence are strongly related to the idea that minimal inconsistent sets are the causes of inconsistencies, as suggested by Hunter and Konieczny [20]. Thimm says that free conditionals are “harmless”, in some sense, to the consistency of a knowledge base [44]. What is behind these notions is the classical way of handling inconsistency through ruling out formulas, as Reiter proposed in his diagnosis problem [36] and as the standard AGM paradigm of belief revision defines base contraction (see [18] for a general view of the AGM paradigm). Reiter's hitting sets technique views a repair of some inconsistency set of formulas as giving up of at least one element from each minimal inconsistent set. For such repair to be minimal, no free formula should be discarded. In the AGM paradigm, the consolidation process of a belief base can be interpreted as the contraction of ⊥, the contradiction. The inclusion postulate claims that the result of a contraction is a subset of the belief base in question, and the relevance postulate forces the contraction of ⊥ to contain all free formulas of the base.

When we move from classical to probabilistic logic, there is a natural way to relax formulas without completely losing their information. Note that ruling out a probabilistic conditional

                      can still be consistently believed. When inconsistency is measured continuously, through changes in probabilities, it is this more general kind of consolidation process that is being suggested. As it is indicated in the proof of Theorem 3.8, consolidating all minimal inconsistent sets (Γ) through probability changing does not imply consolidating the whole base (Δ). We can conclude that the concepts of free conditional and minimal inconsistent set are not suitable to analyze continuous inconsistency measures based on distance minimization.

Furthermore, it seems that the definition of free conditional, and so independence, can be refined to be suitable for analyzing continuous measures, while continuity is a harder definition to be contrived to be compatible with independence. Hence, we can try to weaken independence, and perhaps MIS-separability, by modifying the notion of free conditional, instead of fully forgetting this postulate.

As both independence and MIS-separability are defined via minimal inconsistent sets, in order to weaken these properties to reach compatibility with consistency and continuity, it seems reasonable to replace MIS by an alternative concept that could reconcile the desirable properties altogether. However, to do it in a principled way, we first analyze the concept of free probabilistic conditional as to the corresponding consolidation procedure and then modify it to save independence. Afterwards, a related notion of conflict that also fixes MIS-separability is introduced.

A weaker form of independence has already been suggested in the literature. Thimm [44] defines a safe conditional as one whose atomic propositions are disjoint from those in the rest of the base. We also demand that the conditional be satisfiable in order to be safe.

                                 ψ
                               and 
                                 ¬
                                 φ
                                 ∧
                                 ψ
                               are (classically) satisfiable, so the conditional is also satisfiable.
                         The weak independence postulate then posits that ruling a (satisfiable) safe conditional out should not change the inconsistency measure of a base. Hunter and Konieczny have suggested the same weakening for independence, in the classical setting, when they acknowledge that independence may be too strong a property to require [22]. Weak independence is compatible with consistency and continuity, since Potyka's measures satisfy them [34]. Although safe conditionals are easily recognizable, we expect that they be rare in practice, due to the natural logical dependencies among propositions within a base. We are looking for a stronger, more useful notion of independence, between the safe-based and the free-based ones, hence we look for a concept between safe and free.

Besides defining free probabilistic conditional through minimal inconsistent sets, one could equivalently do it via the notion of consolidation as giving up conditionals to restore consistency. Let us formalize this concept.

                         a result that states different ways to define a free probabilistic conditional, as being part of no minimal abrupt repairs (of all maximal consistent sets) or being consistent with any abrupt repair. We say a conditional α is consistent with a knowledge base Γ if there is a probability mass π that satisfies α and Γ.

Note that the fourth statement above is the definition of free probabilistic conditional given in Section 3.1. The first and the second statements are clearly dual to each other, so we have presented two new ways of equivalently defining a free probabilistic conditional without mentioning minimal inconsistent sets, but using abrupt repair and abrupt consolidation. As it is suggested in the previous section, ruling a conditional out is equivalent to widening the corresponding interval to 
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                         — that is why we call it an abrupt repair. However, a probabilistic logic allows for a more general notion of consolidation, formalized below. To save notation, we write 
                           (
                           φ

                           ,

In other words, a consolidation of Γ is the result of widening the probability intervals of its conditionals to a consistent setting. Analogously to the maximal abrupt consolidation, related to a minimal abrupt repair, we can define a sort of consolidation with minimal changes, we call dominant.

                         of Γ is such that if some probability interval of Γ were less widened, fixing the others, the resulting base would not be consistent. In other words, it is not possible to give up strictly less information than a d-consolidation while restoring consistency; for an interval to be less widened, another must be more enlarged. In these sense, the changes in the probability bounds are minimal, and the consolidation is maximal.

From these concepts, two new definitions for free probabilistic conditional could be derived: a conditional is free if it is in any d-consolidation; or a conditional is free if it is consistent with any consolidation. We can prove these definitions are actually equivalent:

A modification of the free probabilistic conditional concept is suggested by the comparison of Lemma 4.5 with Theorem 4.2, which would yield a different postulate of independence. To not overload the concept of free conditional, we say these probabilistic conditionals are innocuous, for they are consistent with any consolidation of the knowledge base.


                        
                           Definition 4.6
                           An innocuous probabilistic conditional of Γ is a probabilistic conditional

                                 ∈

The difference between free and innocuous conditionals can be seen in the knowledge base from the proof of Theorem 3.8, as the following example shows.

                         probability intervals; furthermore, a safe conditional of Γ is clearly consistent with any consolidation of Γ:

To redefine MIS-separability, we need a new notion of minimal conflict, related to the consolidation we introduced. Note that the union of minimal inconsistent sets is equal to the union of minimal abrupt repairs of a knowledge base, so that it forms the complement of the set of free probabilistic conditionals. To be consistent, we should provide a definition of conflicting sets such that their union is complementary to the set of innocuous conditionals. A set with all probabilistic conditionals that are not innocuous would be inconsistent when not empty, but would not have the minimality we are looking for. Such a set would be analogous to the union of all minimal inconsistent sets, but we search for a more fundamental notion of conflict, that can be derived by analyzing the consolidation properties of minimal inconsistent sets.

A minimal inconsistent set is minimal regarding set inclusion, and this is related to the abrupt consolidation:

Intuitively, a minimal inconsistent set Γ is a conflict that cannot be analyzed in smaller subsets such that abruptly consolidating them implies abruptly consolidating Γ. Starting with a single inconsistent base Γ, we can find smaller subsets 
                           
                              
                                 Δ
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         satisfying both items of 4.11. We can do this recursively on the inconsistent sets 
                           
                              
                                 Δ

                         until we reach unanalyzable conflicts, which happens to be minimal inconsistent sets. So, abruptly consolidating these sets is abruptly consolidating Γ. Substituting consolidation for abrupt consolidation, we have an analogous definition of conflict:

                        Lemma 4.13 captures the intuition behind the proof of Theorem 3.8, where there is a widening that consolidates any proper subset of the knowledge base without consolidating the whole base. As it happens with abrupt consolidation and MISes, to consolidate Γ, one only needs to widen its probability intervals in such a way that each inescapable conflict is solved.

As all abrupt consolidations can be viewed as consolidations and each knowledge base is a widening of itself, an inescapable conflict is something weaker than a minimal inconsistent set:

                              If Δ is a minimal inconsistent set, then Δ is an inescapable conflict.

As inescapable conflict is a weaker concept than MIS, MIS-separability is stronger than IC-separability.

Recall that a free probabilistic conditional is defined in the standard way as not belonging to any minimal inconsistent set. We prove the analogous result for innocuous conditionals and inescapable conflicts, linking all concepts introduced in this section.

A result analogous to Proposition 3.6 follows:


                        
                           Corollary 4.20
                           
                              If 
                              
                                 I
                               
                              satisfies IC-separability, then 
                              
                                 I
                               
                              satisfies i-independence.
                           

As already mentioned, inescapable conflicts are to consolidations as minimal inconsistent sets are to abrupt consolidations. If consolidation via conditionals withdrawal, as in Reiter's and AGM approaches, can focus on the collection of minimal inconsistent sets (ignoring free conditionals), consolidation through widening probability intervals can be done by watching only for the inescapable conflicts (ignoring innocuous conditionals). All these relations among free and innocuous probabilistic conditionals, minimal inconsistent sets and inescapable conflicts argue in favor of the new proposed postulates, whose compatibility with consistency and continuity we will prove.

To replace the postulate of independence and the property of MIS-separability, we propose the weaker pair of i-independence and IC-separability towards building a compatible package together with consistency and continuity. Before proving such compatibility, the postulates have to be generalized to imprecise knowledge bases. To generalize consistency, i-independence and IC-separability is straightforward, we just enlarge their intended scope from knowledge bases in

                           K
                        , but the continuity postulate demands some notation.

Thimm actually suggests a stronger principle, super-additivity, which implies monotonicity. Since super-additivity is incompatible with normalization [44] — as also is IC-separability —, we state them as properties, and not postulates.

To attend the desirable properties, we generalize the inconsistency measures based on distance minimization proposed by Thimm [44] to the case of imprecise probabilities. Muiño introduced similar ideas under a different semantics for conditional probabilities [31]. Firstly, we define a family of p-norms.

                        -inconsistency measures satisfy the reconciled postulates and that some of them hold additional properties. Muiño has similar results, though under a different semantics [31].

Although we have compatible postulates to drive the rational choice of inconsistency measures, these desirable properties are satisfied by a myriad of functions. We may use other arguments to pick some particular inconsistency measures among those obeying the postulates. This section investigates computational aspects of measuring inconsistency through distance minimization, reviewing and generalizing measures proposed by Potyka [34] that can be handled via linear programming. In a second moment, we show how the concrete measures introduced can be justified by means of Dutch books, displaying the maximum guaranteed loss an agent would be exposed to, if stakes are limited. We also show that Dutch books offer other interesting measures.

In order to better understand the connection between Potyka's inconsistency measures and incoherence measures based on Dutch books, it is worth detailing the construction of the corresponding linear programs. Furthermore, due to such link, every property we prove for Potyka's inconsistency measures shall be inherited by the equivalent Dutch book measures presented in the next section.

Potyka emphasizes this impracticability and suggests a new family of inconsistency measures, the minimal violation measures 
                        [34], which we adapt here to the case of imprecise probabilities. In order to keep constraints linear, “violation” variables

Now we have a set of compatible postulates for inconsistency measures and two particular measures satisfying them that can be computed rather efficiently using linear programming techniques. On the one hand,

                         also satisfies super-additivity and IC-separability; on the other hand, 
                           
                              
                                 I

Nonetheless, one can argue that these measures lack some proper justification, despite satisfying some postulates and being feasible, as Capotorti, Regoli and Vattari did [4]. They claim that distances between conditional probabilities are meaningless, being only geometrical measures. This might be the case, but it would only undermine the

In formal epistemology, there is an interest in measuring the incoherence of an agent whose beliefs are given as probabilities or lower previsions over propositions or random variables — a Bayesian agent. If we have propositions from classical logic, the formalized problem at hand is exactly the one we are investigating. When the agent's degrees of belief are represented by a knowledge base, to measure the agent's incoherence is to measure the inconsistency of such knowledge base. Schervish, Kadane and Seidenfeld [39,40,38] have proposed ways to measure incoherence of an agent based on Dutch books.

Dutch book arguments are based on the agent's betting behavior induced by her degrees of belief, typically used to show their irrationality. To introduce the concept of Dutch book, we start with the unconditional case. Dutch book arguments rely on an operational interpretation of (imprecise) degrees of belief, in which their lower/upper bounds are defined through bet buying/selling prices. Suppose an agent believes that the probability of proposition

This set of bet tickets that causes a guaranteed loss to the agent is called a Dutch book.

Note that, no matter how is the weather when they arrive and pay the prizes, the total quantity Alice can receive from Bob is at most $10. Since she was losing $11 before landing and checking the weather, she will lose at least $1 in the end. Given this sure loss scenario, this set of three bets is said to be a Dutch book.

Instead of the agent (the bettor) paying for a bet ticket and eventually getting its prize back from the bettor (the agent), we can view this whole operation as a single contract between these two players.

A gamble on φ can be generalized to consider a conditioning event ψ. Consider a bet ticket that, when ψ is true, pays a prize of λ if φ is the case and returns 0 if φ is false. In other words, this bet ticket works as a gamble on φ when ψ is the case. However, suppose this bet ticket pays back to the agent the same amount that was spent in its buying if ψ is false — that is, the gamble is canceled. The following generalization of gambles capture these “conditional bets”:

We can thus denote a Dutch book simply by the absolute value of its stakes

If the set of probabilistic conditionals that represents an agent's epistemic state turns out to be inconsistent, then she is exposed to a Dutch book, and vice-versa [32]. In other words, an agent sees as fair a set of gambles that causes her a guaranteed loss if, and only if, the knowledge base codifying her (conditional) degrees of belief is inconsistent. We can check this connection in Example 5.3:

                        , which Alice violates. Consequently, she is exposed to a Dutch book, for her three probability interval assignments are not jointly satisfiable. In this way, Dutch book arguments were introduced to show that degrees of belief must obey the axioms of probability and are a standard proof of incoherence (introductions to Dutch books and their relation to incoherence can be found in [42] and [8]). Hence, a natural approach to measuring an agent's degree of incoherence is through the magnitude of the sure loss she is vulnerable to. The intuition says that, the more incoherent an agent is, the greater the guaranteed loss that can be imposed on her through a Dutch book. Nevertheless, with no bounds on the stakes, such loss would also be unlimited for incoherent agents. For instance, in Example 5.3, if stakes were $100, $100 and 
                           $
                           −
                           100
                        , Alice would have a net loss of at least $10, instead of $1, regardless of the weather on arrival. To better understand the loss a Dutch book causes to an agent, we formalize it in the following.

The linear program above can be viewed as the dual of that in lines (5)–(8), which checks the consistency of Γ, if we consider that 0 is the function being minimized in the latter, since we are interested only in its feasibility (for duality theory in linear programing, see, for instance, [46]). Note that, in (5)–(8),

                           π

                           0

                         and

                         can be inserted into A as a line of 1's. By duality theory, as the program above is feasible, it is unbounded iff (5)–(8) is infeasible. That is, if Γ is inconsistent, sure loss via Dutch book is unlimited.

Different strategies to circumvent this in order to measure incoherence as a finite loss are found in the formal epistemology literature. Schervish et al. propose a flexible formal approach to limiting these stakes generating a family of incoherence measures for upper and lower previsions on bounded random variables [40]. In this section, we are interested in two of them, which we simplify to our case.

Their whole family of incoherence measures is based on the maximum guaranteed loss an agent is exposed to via a Dutch book, varying only on how stakes are limited. The first incoherence measure Schervish et al. introduce that concerns us is when the sum of the absolute values of the stakes is lesser than or equal to one,

                           Schervish et al. [40] actually measure the incoherence as maximum rates between the guaranteed loss and the sum (the maximum) of the stakes' absolute values. Clearly, this is equivalent to maximizing the guaranteed loss when the sum of the stakes' absolute values is no greater than 1 (or these absolute values are in

                           Example 5.6
                           Recall Example 5.3, in which there are three gambles, with stakes $10, $10 and

                                 −

                              . These gambles guarantee a loss of at least $1 to Alice. But now suppose that Bob, while choosing the gambles, must do it so that the absolute values of the stakes sum up to one. He could so arrange the same gambles but changing the stakes to 1/3, 1/3 and 
                                 −
                                 1

                              . In this new scenario, Alice would have a sure loss of 1/30. Similarly, if the absolute value of each stake is limited to the interval

In fact, it can be checked (by solving the linear programs) that 1/30 and 1/10 are the greatest amount one can take for sure from Alice via Dutch book if stakes have absolute values summing up to one or are all in

Even though incoherence measures based on Dutch books from the formal epistemology community and inconsistency measures based on distance minimization from Artificial Intelligence researchers may seem unrelated at first, they are actually two sides of the same coin. The programs that compute the maximum guaranteed loss an agent is exposed to are technically dual to those that minimize distances to measure inconsistency. Nau has already investigated this matter, mentioning results similar to the following [32]:

As to Potyka's other feasible proposal,

Different strategies for bounding stakes can lead to different inconsistency measures, but our motivation in this section was not to use Dutch books to determine which measures should be adopted — that is the reason of the postulates. The point here is that these two measures (

In order to measure incoherence as the greatest guaranteed loss in a Dutch book, Schervish et al. have firstly proposed two different ways of normalizing such loss: by limiting either the agent's or the bettor's resources [39]. The authors introduce the concept of escrow as the amount committed into a gamble by the agent (or the bettor). For instance, consider a gamble on

                         to the agent. Schervish et al. call these quantities the agent's and the bettor's escrows. Equivalently, the agent's (or bettor's) escrow for a gamble is how much she (he) has to commit from her (his) resources to cover an eventual loss.

Instead of bounding the sum of the stakes, an agent's degree of incoherence can be measured, as the maximum guaranteed loss in a Dutch book, by limiting the agent's (or the bettor's) total escrow to one.

                           Again, this is equivalent to measuring incoherence as the maximum ratio between the sure loss and the agent's (the bettor's) total escrow.
                         In other words, we are limiting how much the agent (or the bettor) could lose in case that every gamble resolves unfavorably, inflicting a loss to her (him). Schervish et al. give market situations that justifies these choices [39]. We denote by

Schervish et al. contemplate in detail a whole spectrum of ways to bound the agent's escrows, the bettor's, or their sum in order to measure the maximum sure loss [40]. For each of these three quantities, the author note that the two extreme functions in their framework used to normalize the guaranteed loss are the maximum and the sum, from which six different inconsistency measures arise [38]. Note that the sum of the agent's and the bettor's escrows for a single gamble is equal to the absolute value of its stake, so

                         are two inconsistency measures from this same framework. To build the remaining two measures, escrows could be bounded via their maximum, instead of their total. Intuitively, this corresponds to limiting the quantity the agent (or the bettor) accepts to eventually lose in each individual gamble.

                              , and Alice has a guaranteed loss of at least $1. Now suppose that Bob can only choose gambles in which his (Alice's) eventual loss — the escrow — is lesser than or equal to one. In other words, his (her) maximum escrow is no greater than 1. With these constraints, Bob can choose the same three gambles, but with stakes 2, 2 and −2: his escrows are

By solving the corresponding linear programs, we would find that 1/5 and 1/9 are the greatest amount one can take for sure from Alice via Dutch book if Bob's or Alice's maximum escrow is no greater than 1, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

Handling inconsistency has been receiving increased attention in the AI community since most inference methods rely on the consistency of the premises; and such requirement is commonly violated in large bases of probabilistic knowledge. A reasonable start point to deal with the inconsistency in probabilistic bases is to know how severe it is, and how this severity changes with the probabilities. In this work, we studied different ways of measuring inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases. Three aspects were discussed: postulates the measures should satisfy, the efficiency of the methods used to compute the measures, and possible meaningful interpretations for them. As it was argued for, the independence postulate shall be abandoned in favor of continuity. The causes of such incompatibility were analyzed, and a modification of independence was proposed to restore compatibility. Inconsistency measures that can be computed using linear programs were reviewed and proved to satisfy the postulates, and we gave them a rational by means of Dutch books. Finally, we showed that other measures in the literature based on Dutch books, and computable through linear programming, also satisfy the postulates.

By restoring the compatibility of the postulates for measuring inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases, we put forward a new pair of properties one can use to formulate or evaluate measures: i-independence and IC-separability. These desirable properties are based on two new concepts: innocuous conditional and inescapable conflicts. Besides measuring inconsistency, these concepts may be useful for formalizing inference from inconsistent bases or performing probabilistic belief revision/update, for instance. Both concepts are derived from a specific consolidation procedure — the widening of probability intervals. If other consolidation methods are considered, one can define analogous concepts, even in a different logical formalism.

In AI, inconsistency measures for probabilistic knowledge bases have been based on distance minimization, while in Formal Epistemology incoherence measures for Bayesian agents were focused on Dutch books vulnerability. The connections here established can help both communities to investigate their corresponding problems under a different angle.

The introduced concepts of innocuous conditional and inescapable conflict might have practical use in measuring inconsistency only if their instances are recognizable in a reasonable time. Nothing was said here about the complexity of the computational task of finding innocuous conditionals and inescapable conflicts within a knowledge base, but they are clearly very hard problems. Thus, future work includes investigating these problems aiming at devising algorithms to solve them. It would also be interesting to propose concrete procedures to consolidate knowledge bases, as done in [35] for instance. To achieve that, one could rely on the same triplet: rationality postulates, efficiency of computation and meaningful interpretation. Another intended continuation of this work is to study principled ways of inferring probabilistic conclusions from inconsistent bases, using the ideas here presented. For instance, this could be done by defining the set of models of an inconsistent base as the set containing all models of each closest consistent base, construed as the consolidations corresponding to some inconsistency measure here studied.

The first two items are clearly dual, and the fourth one is the definition of free conditional. Suppose α is free in Γ. Note that all abrupt consolidations

                            of Γ are consistent with α. As 
                              
                                 
                                    Γ

                            is consistent, it has no MIS, and adding α cannot create a MIS, for it is free. Thus, if an abrupt consolidation does not contain α, it is not maximal.

                            is maximal, α cannot be consistent with it. As

                            is consistent, it has no MIS, and adding α creates a MIS (that contains α), which also is a MIS of Γ — hence, α cannot be free.  □
