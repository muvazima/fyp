                  As a pivotal domain within envelope protein, fusion peptide (FP) plays a crucial role in pathogenicity and therapeutic intervention. Taken into account the limited FP annotations in NCBI database and absence of FP prediction software, it is urgent and desirable to develop a bioinformatics tool to predict new putative FPs (np-FPs) in retroviruses. In this work, a sequence-based FP model was proposed by combining Hidden Markov Method with similarity comparison. The classification accuracies are 91.97% and 92.31% corresponding to 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation. After scanning sequences without FP annotations, this model discovered 53,946 np-FPs. The statistical results on FPs or np-FPs reveal that FP is a conserved and hydrophobic domain. The FP software programmed for windows environment is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fptool/files/?source=navbar.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Retroviruses are enveloped RNA-containing viruses including human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) (Coffin, 1992; Rosenberg, 2010). These viruses require membrane fusion to enter host cell cytoplasm for reverse transcription (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2004). The fusion process is controlled and executed by viral envelope glycoprotein (env) (White et al., 2008a). Env is composed of a surface and trans-membrane (TM) subunits respectively mediating receptor binding and virus-cell fusion (Barnard et al., 2006). Locating at the N-terminal of TM subunit, fusion peptide (FP) represents an absolute requirement for the fusogenic function of retroviruses (Apellániz et al., 2014). Upon fusion activation, FP must insert itself obliquely into target cell membrane to disorganize locally the structure of lipid bilayer (Epand, 2003). The interaction of FP with target cell causes a formation of an intermediate pre-hairpin structure which bridges and fuses the viral and host membranes together (Apellániz et al., 2014). In contrast with targeting later steps in the retrovirus life cycle, such as reverse transcription, integration and maturation of virions, targeting membrane fusion to block retrovirus into host cells has significant advantages for therapeutic intervention (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010). For example, it contributes to reducing the risk of undesired side effects, preventing the establishment or maintenance of latent viral reservoirs and so on (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010). Consequently, the dependence of retrovirus on FP during infection process and the advantages of fusion inhibitor make FP an available and promising drug target (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010; Münch et al., 2007). However, classical database search tools are inefficient to retrieve FPs in env sequences (Table 1
                     ) and annotated FPs in online database are not sufficient for a better understanding of FP. Thus, it is of great importance to propose a computational model to predict new putative FPs (np-FPs). This proposed FP model is helpful to accelerate identification of FPs in retroviruses by reducing the sequence dataset for biochemical experiment corroboration.

The main content of this thesis is arranged as follows. In Section 2, four procedures taken into account for the sequence-based FP model (Chou, 2011) will be sufficiently clarified. They are dataset construction, protein sample representation, FP prediction algorithm and proper evaluation methods. Then assessment results of FP model, FP software, predicted np-FPs and statistic hydrophobic properties about FP will be described in detail in Section 3. Eventually, validity of FP model, FP motif and evolutionary relationship about FP will be discussed in Section 4.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

All the retroviral protein sequences involved in this work were collected from NCBI database (Wheeler et al., 2006) and divided into two datasets. One benchmark dataset contains env sequences with FP annotations so as to complete the establishment of FP prediction model, and the other dataset includes env sequences without FP annotations for predicting potential np-FPs.

In NCBI database, there are 124 env sequences with FP annotations related to HERV, HIV, SIV, HTLV and MLV. After looking over these data for reliability, 117 sequences (Table 2
                        ) meet following criteria are qualified to be included into benchmark dataset. The criteria stress not only env sequence to be non-repetitive but also FP annotation to be experimentally validated and non-suspicious. For each one of benchmark dataset, FP or non-FP domain was considered as positive or negative sample to train the prediction model.

Except for benchmark dataset, there are also a large amount of protein sequences downloaded from NCBI. They are env sequences without FP annotations (Table 2) relevant to the five retroviruses. These sequences were prepared for predicting more np-FPs with the proposed FP model.

Two straightforward sequential samples with mathematical expressions were formulated in this work. They can truly reflect the intrinsic correlations of predicted FP with inquired env sequence. One is the observation sequence O, which was expressed as

FP model predicts np-FP domain through two phases. Firstly, it adopted HMM method (Duda et al., 2001; Bonneville and Jin, 2013) to determine the existence and rough location of np-FP. Subsequently, it performed similarity comparison for a more precise np-FP. The prediction algorithm (Fig. 1
                        ) will be described in detail as follows.

Three matrixes were defined and estimated to represent HMM model, which are A, B and Π. A stands for transition probability between states of FP and non-FP, B denotes emission probability of the residue under a state, and Π reflects the state distribution of initial residue. The elements of these matrixes were computed by Maximum Likelihood Estimate (Pfanzagl, 1994). According to FP and non-FP annotations in sequences of benchmark dataset, elements of A and B were respectively given by:

If the sequence was estimated to contain no np-FP domain, then it was the turn of the next inquired sequence. Otherwise, the rough np-FP location achieved was used to locate the np-FP precisely by similarity comparison.

Rough np-FP was changed to a longer sequence for potential np-FP candidates. The prolonged one centered on rough np-FP and extended 22 aa (amino acids) on each side. The extension length was determined by cross-validation and test on a species to ensure that real FP locates in this enlarged sequence.

                            represents exact amino acid match numbers between x and y after Smith-Waterman local alignment (Smith and Waterman, 1981). These three scores reveal the similarity or variance between np-FP candidates and training FPs or rough np-FP. On the basis of all these scores, np-FP candidate corresponding to the maximum of the first two scores together with the minimum of the last score was recognized as predicted np-FP.

FP prediction model was tested by 10-fold cross-validation (10-fold CV) and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for an accurate and comprehensive evaluation. The quantitative assessment results were measured by three indexes. They were given by:

FP prediction model has gone through tests of three validation methods and additional comparison with three classical database search tools. The classification accuracies are 91.97%, 92.31% and 94.87% (Table 2) respectively corresponding to 10-fold CV, LOOCV and self-consistency validation. The number of correctly predicted np-FPs by suggested model is much more than PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), CS-BLAST (Biegert and Söding, 2009) and HMMER3 (Finn et al., 2011) (Table 1). These results reveal that FP model proposed in this work is capable and useful for FP prediction.

FP prediction software has been programmed for windows environment to facilitate application of proposed model. It specifies FASTA as the format of input and output files. Each predicted result included in export files indicates clearly the starting and ending positions of np-FP in inquired sequence. The FP software is available to download and use for free at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fptool/files/?source=navbar.

FP model scanned three sets for np-FPs. One set contains 187,918 env sequences without FP annotations, another one includes five sequences removed from benchmark dataset for repetition or non-experimental annotation cause, and the other one has two sequences excluded for suspicious annotation reason. In the first set, FP model discovered 53,946 np-FPs (Table 2). In the second set, five predicted np-FPs are the same with corresponding FPs annotated in NCBI. In the last set, two recognized np-FPs are both consistent with literatures (Earp et al., 2005; White et al., 2008b) that FP does not contain the furin cleavage site, but locates in the downstream of this site. All the achieved np-FPs are available to download together with FP software.

                         is the hydropathy value for amino acid in position i. Positive scores of GRAVY represent hydrophobic proteins, whereas negative scores indicate hydrophilic proteins. Fig. 2
                         and Table 3
                         display the hydrophobicity properties about FPs and np-FPs involved in this work. It can be seen that 100% FPs and 96.62% np-FPs were recognized as hydrophobic domains. These results are in line with dozens of previous studies (Apellániz et al., 2014; Nieva and Suárez, 2000) that FP domain is hydrophobic.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

FP model needs to be tested from different aspects to demonstrate its validity in np-FP prediction. Firstly, the classification accuracies of this model evaluated by increasingly used and widely recognized cross-validation methods (Chou, 2011; Kohavi, 2001) are relatively high. Secondly, np-FPs searched in seven sequences removed from benchmark dataset are all in good agreement with NCBI or literatures. Thirdly, statistic hydrophobic properties are similar between FPs annotated by experimental approaches and np-FPs annotated by proposed model. These results all confirm validity of FP model to a certain degree.

Weblogo software (Crooks et al., 2004; Schneider and Stephens, 1990) was adopted to generate FP motifs of five retroviruses in Fig. 3
                        . It is obvious that FP of each virus is a conserved domain. But there are also some divergences among FPs from different viruses. For instance, FP of HERV seems less conserved than others which may be caused by small number of annotated FPs and large number of subfamilies (Belshaw et al., 2005; Gifford and Tristem, 2003) in HERV. Additionally, FPs of HIV and SIV are remarkably more similar than others which may be ascribed to the close relationship of these two viruses (Heeney et al., 2006).

MEGA software (Tamura et al., 2011) was employed to create phylogenetic tree in Fig. 4
                         to discuss the evolutionary relationship of FPs from different retroviruses. Clearly, it is consist with FP motifs, phylogeny of retroviruses (Weiss, 2006) and evolutionary relationship of immunosuppressive domain (Lv et al., 2014). Especially in highly related HIV and SIV (Heeney et al., 2006), the closest evolutionary relationship of FPs is in accordance with their remarkably similar motifs.
