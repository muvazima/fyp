                  Topic time reflects the temporal feature of topics in Web news pages, which can be used to establish and analyze topic models for many time-sensitive text mining tasks. However, there are two critical challenges in discovering topic time from Web news pages. The first issue is how to normalize different kinds of temporal expressions within a Web news page, e.g., explicit and implicit temporal expressions, into a unified representation framework. The second issue is how to determine the right topic time for topics in Web news. Aiming at solving these two problems, we propose a systematic framework for discovering topic time from Web news. In particular, for the first issue, we propose a new approach that can effectively determine the appropriate referential time for implicit temporal expressions and further present an effective defuzzification algorithm to find the right explanation for a fuzzy temporal expression. For the second issue, we propose a relation model to describe the relationship between news topics and topic time. Based on this model, we design a new algorithm to extract topic time from Web news. We build a prototype system called Topic Time Parser (TTP) and conduct extensive experiments to measure the effectiveness of our proposal. The results suggest that our proposal is effective in both temporal expression normalization and topic time extraction.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Time plays an important role in many research areas, such as information extraction, document summarization, question answering, and Web search (Alonso, 2013; Alonso & Shiells, 2013; Whiting, Jose, & Alonso, 2014; Campos, 2013). Especially, knowing the precise time of a topic is crucially important for time-sensitive Web mining tasks such as news-topic evolution tracking. However, as a Web news page usually includes many temporal expressions with various forms, we have to deal with two challenging issues in discovering topic time from Web news:

                        
                           (1)
                           How to normalize temporal expressions to a unified framework? Temporal information usually appears in Web news as temporal expressions, which can be typically classified into explicit expressions, e.g., “May 1, 2014”, and implicit expressions, e.g., “tomorrow”. Intuitively, explicit expressions can be directly found in a calendar, while implicit expressions need to be transformed into explicit expressions based on some referential time. For example, for the implicit expression “tomorrow” in a Web news page, first we need to find the current date according to the contents of the page, which can then be used as the referential time for resolving “tomorrow”. Presently, how to resolve implicit temporal expressions is still a challenging issue in temporal expression normalization (Zhao, Jin, & Yue, 2010; UzZaman et al., 2013).

How to extract topic time from Web news? Determining the right topic time for topics is very important to many time-sensitive Web mining tasks because they usually need to use topic time as a key clue to track the evolution of news topics. Moreover, topic time is also useful for news search engines as they can provide temporal-textual search services and improve the search effectiveness of time-based queries. For example, to answer the query “Find the information about the World Cup this year”, a time-aware search engine can resolve the temporal word “this year” and consequently return news pages according to both textual and temporal relevance (Lin, Jin, Zhao, & Yue, 2012; Lin, Jin, Zhao, & Yue, 2014). However, as a Web news page may contain many sub-topics as well as many pieces of temporal information, we need to devise an effective model to describe the relationship between topics and time and then extract the right topic time for a Web news page.

For the first issue (temporal expression normalization), the most important point is to select an appropriate referential time for each implicit temporal expression. Some early studies on this issue, including context-free approaches (Mani & Wilson, 2000; Wu, Li, Chen, & Lu, 2005a; Wu, Li, Lu, & Li, 2005b) and context-dependent approaches (Vazov, 2001; Jang, Baldwin, & Mani, 2004) either do not consider the context of referential time or use a strict reference-choosing mechanism for resolving implicit temporal expressions. Some recent works improve the context-dependent approach by considering document styles (Strötgen & Gertz, 2013; Strötgen, Zell, & Gertz, 2013) and the types of temporal expressions (Filannino, 2012; Filannino, Brown, & Nenadic, 2013). However, they employ tailor-made rules to determine the referential time for implicit temporal expressions. Such rules cannot adapt to various styles of Web news. For example, a Chinese news page usually has a much different style of content layout compared with an English news page. Rule-based mechanisms are also used by many participants in the TempEval competition (UzZaman et al., 2013), which focuses on evaluating the annotation on time expressions, events, and temporal relations.

For the second issue (topic time extraction), we need to develop an effective approach to extract topic time for different kinds of news texts. For example, some news articles may only include one topic (see Fig. 4 in Section 4), while others may involve several topics (see Fig. 6 in Section 4). A simple solution is to regard the publication time of a news page as the topic time (Grandi, Mandreoli, & Tiberio, 2005; Berberich, Bedathur, Neumann, & Weikum, 2007a; Berberich, Bedathur, Neumann, & Weikum, 2007b). This approach is not suitable for many time-sensitive topics, such as financial news and disaster news. For example, suppose that a news article published on January 1, 2015 reviewed the event of “512 Earthquake in China” (an earthquake happened on May 12, 2008), the most appropriate topic time for this article should be “May 12, 2008”, rather than the publication time “January 1, 2015”. Some other works (Li, Wong, & Yuan, 2003; Schilder, 2004; Wu et al., 2005a) utilize the frequency of temporal expressions appearing in a news page to determine topic time. However, frequently-appearing time expressions may not always be the right topic time. For example, in a news article reporting the celebration of the National Day of China in 2014, i.e., October 1, 2014, may include many words of “October 1, 1949” as this is the founding date of the People’s Republic of China. However, here the topic time for the article should be “October 1, 2014” but not the most frequently-appearing time “October 1, 1949”.

In this paper, we aim to propose effective solutions to normalize temporal expressions and extract topic time for Web news. Our basic idea for normalizing temporal expressions is to devise an adaptive mechanism for normalizing temporal expressions and exploit the referential relationship among temporal expressions to determine the referential time for an implicit temporal expression. In addition, we propose to model the relationship between topics and temporal expressions within a Web news page and then present the algorithm for topic time extraction. In summary, we make the following contributions in this paper:

                        
                           (1)
                           We propose a new approach that can construct referential relationship among temporal expressions and further present an effective defuzzification algorithm for temporal expressions. Particularly, we classify implicit temporal expressions into global and local temporal expressions, and use different methods to construct referential relationship for global expressions and local expressions. For fuzzy temporal expressions that have vague meanings, we develop a new method to figure out the resolution of fuzzy temporal expressions (Section 3).

We present a new algorithm to extract topic time for Web news. First, we propose a relation model between news topics and temporal expressions for different kinds of Web news. The relation model takes into account the positional dependency between news topics and temporal expressions as well as the topical dependency between them. Then, we introduce an adaptive approach utilizing a weight model and an unsupervised classification model to determine topic time for Web news (Section 4).

We develop a prototype system called Topic Time Parser (TTP) to discover topic time from Web news and conduct extensive experiments on real data sets. The results suggest that our proposal is effective in both temporal expression normalization and topic time extraction (Section 5).

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In this section, we review existing researches on temporal expression normalization and topic time extraction.

Temporal expression normalization as an important research issue in temporal information processing is defined as the abstraction and transformation of temporal expressions into the temporal objects or attributes defined by some time annotation standards such as the TIDES TIMEX2 Standard (Ferro, Gerber, Mani, Sundheim, & Wilson, 2005) and the TimeML’s TIMEX3 Standard (Pustejovsky, Knippen, Littman, & Sauri, 2005). Basically, temporal expressions are defined as chunks of texts which contain explicit or implicit temporal information. According to TERN Evaluation Plan,
                           1
                           
                              http://timex2.mitre.org/tern.html.
                        
                        
                           1
                         temporal expression normalization is described as the task of annotating appropriate temporal attributes for each temporal expression in texts.

Based on the TIMEX2 annotation standard, Wu et al. (2005b) proposed a prototype system for temporal expressions extraction and normalization, respectively. There are also some other systems developed to tackle temporal expression interpretation w.r.t. the TIMEX3 standard, including GUTime (Mani & Wilson, 2000), TARSQI-TTK (Verhagen & Pustejovsky, 2008), SUTime (Chang & Manning, 2012), Timen (Llorens, Derczynski, Gaizauskas, & Saquete, 2012), and HeidelTime (Strötgen & Gertz, 2013; Li, Strötgen, Zell, & Gertz, 2014). In addition, different methods for temporal expression extraction have been studied for articles in different languages, e.g., English (Mazur & Dale, 2009), German (Strötgen & Gertz, 2011), Spanish (Strötgen et al., 2013), Korean (Jang et al., 2004), Arabic (Saleh, Tounsi, & van Genabith, 2011), and Chinese (Li et al., 2014). Recently, normalizing temporal expressions with a language-independent approach (Strötgen & Gertz, 2013; Strötgen, Armiti, van Canh, Zell, & Gertz, 2014) was also studied.

Previous approaches have good performance in annotating of temporal expressions. However, it is still a challenging issue to normalize implicit temporal expressions. The most difficult task for implicit temporal expression normalization is to determine the correct referential time for an implicit temporal expression. Although this has been addressed by some recent works, such as the competition of temporal expression annotation in TempEval-3 (UzZaman et al., 2013), there lacks an adaptive approach that can work for various kinds of Web news pages. Many existing works use a rule-based idea that determines referential time according to document types (Strötgen & Gertz, 2013; Strötgen et al., 2013) or temporal expression types (Filannino, 2012; Filannino et al., 2013). However, this method is hard to suit for different kinds of Web news pages. As a consequence, we need to devise a new reference-time-choosing mechanism and propose an adaptive method to make temporal expression normalization adapt to different kinds of Web news pages.

Most of early works on temporal expression normalization do not give an effective referential-time-choosing method for implicit temporal expressions in texts. Specifically, the pioneer work (Lascarides, Asher, & Oberlander, 1992) investigated various contextual effects on different temporal-reference relations. Then, Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover (1995) discussed the reference-choosing issue by considering the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials, and rhetorical relations. Further, Dorr and Gaasterland (2002) presented an improved method that considers connecting words. Currently, the context-free mechanism (Mani & Wilson, 2000; Wu et al., 2005a; Wu et al., 2005b) is supposed to be the simplest way to resolve implicit temporal expressions, which takes the document creation time (Tannier, 2014) as the referential time for all implicit temporal expressions. On the other hand, some researchers suggested the context-dependent mechanism (Vazov, 2001; Jang et al., 2004) for referential time choosing, which employs context-related rules but cannot adapt to different kinds of Web news pages as well as different representation styles of implicit temporal expressions.

Many recent works in temporal expression normalization propose to use document creation time to resolve implicit temporal expressions. Some of them (Jung & Stent, 2013; UzZaman & Allen, 2010; Kolya, Kundu, Gupta, Ekbal, & Bandyopadhyay, 2013; Kolomiyets & Moens, 2013; Kolomiyets & Moens, 2010; Bethard, 2013; Llorens et al., 2012) always use document creation time as referential time, while others such as FSS-TimEx (Zavarella & Tanev, 2013) only use document creation time to initialize referential time when starting the normalization process. Based on some tailor-made rules, HeidelTime (Strötgen et al., 2013), NavyTime with SUTime (Chambers, 2013; Chang & Manning, 2013), and ManTIME (Filannino et al., 2013; Filannino, 2012) won the top three in TempEval-3. However, only HeidelTime supports the Chinese task. Li et al. (2014) proposed a Chinese-optimized version, which is named Chinese-HeidelTime. In the experiments, we will compare our design with Chinese-HeidelTime and FSS-TimEx (Zavarella & Tanev, 2013).

Regarding the defuzzification issue, both the TIMEX2 and TIMEX3 Standards take a few placeholders to express the semantic information of fuzzy expressions (Jang et al., 2004; Vicente-Díez & Martinez, 2009). However, this method cannot adapt to the situation where the fuzzy time is taken as the referential time and we need to get its semantic information instead of its vague description. Based on the human cognitive psychology, Anderson, Garrod, and Sandford (1983) presented a classical scenario-time shifting model showing that the temporal information appearing in an article is a clue to scenario shifting when people read the article. Inspired by this finding, we conduct an experimental study and find that all temporal expressions in the same scenario have strong dependency in temporal granularity, based on which we can develop effective algorithms to determine the temporal granularity in defuzzification. More details about the defuzzification algorithm are discussed in Section 3.

Recently, topic time extraction has attracted much attention from research community. For Web news processing and mining, topic time is usually used to exploit the evolution of topics as well as to detect the newest topic-related documents. Existing works can be mainly classified into two categories: the first one simply uses the creation time or the publication time of a news document as the topic time for news topics (Grandi et al., 2005; Berberich et al., 2007a; Berberich et al., 2007b), and the second one aims to detect topic time from news contents (Li et al., 2003; Schilder, 2004; Wu et al., 2005a).

More specifically, Li et al. (2003) proposed a mapping algorithm for events and temporal expressions, which provides a few basic regulations of the relation between events and time. Some works focus on the similarity among the topic time in different documents, which have been discussed in many previous work on TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) (Kumaran & Allan, 2004; Li, Li, & Lu, 2006). Here, Li et al. (2006) introduced a time-topic hybrid model to solve topic similarity computation and get a better performance in topic tracking than Kumaran et al.’s work (2004) which uses the publication time of each news page as topic time. In general, the main contributions of Li et al. (2006) can be summarized as follows: (1) they assume that the occurrence frequency of temporal information in news is a dominant factor for finding topic time and (2) they make use of the time interval adjacent to the publication time of a document to describe the topic time for multi-level-topic news.

Generally, temporal expressions appearing in the titles of Web news are more likely to be the topic time than other temporal expressions. Inspired by this idea, Jin, Lian, Zhao, and Wan (2008) proposed a position-based algorithm to extract primary time for Web pages. Here, primary time is associated with an event rather than a news article. Considering the relation between temporal information and events, Li, Zheng, and Zhao (2011) presented an approach based on an in-depth syntactic parsing for sentences to solve event-related time in news texts. Kanhabua, Romano, and Stewart (2012) presented a two-phase framework to identify relevant temporal expressions for real-world events, which is effective to extract real-world events and identify the relevant time of events.

Topic time has also been studied in temporal information retrieval (Daoud & Huang, 2013; Brucato & Montesi, 2014). To improve the performance of search engines, many researchers (Li & Croft, 2003; Diaz & Jones, 2004; Kanhabua & Nørvåg, 2010) incorporated time into language models. However, they do not consider the temporal information embedded in the contents of Web pages. Simply using the creation dates of documents cannot effectively reflect the temporal relevance between Web pages and user queries. Aimed at solving this problem, Strötgen, Alonso, and Gertz (2012) proposed a novel approach to measure the relevance of temporal expressions with respect to a user query. Similarly, Campos, Dias, Jorge, and Nunes (2012) designed an effective method to evaluate the temporal similarity between a query and a date.

Some other studies focus on the extraction of the “object-related” time, which aims to extract the temporal information associated with a certain object from Web pages. De Boer, Van Someren, and Wielinga (2010) proposed a fitted statistical model to deal with this issue, while Amitay, Carmel, Herscovici, Lempel, and Soffer (2004) used the hyperlinks embedded within news pages. The latter actually models the relationship between the objects mentioned in a news page, which also inspires our work as we can model the relationship between topics and time to extract “topic-related” time. Consequently, in Section 4, we present a dependency-based relation model between news topics and temporal information to extract topic time.

Temporal expressions in Web news pages can be generally summarized as two categories (Zhao et al., 2010).
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Explicit temporal expressions. These temporal expressions directly describe entries in some timeline, such as an exact date or year. For example, “May 2009” or “May 1, 2009” in a document are explicit temporal expressions and can be mapped directly to chronons in a timeline.


                              Implicit temporal expressions. These temporal expressions represent temporal entities that can only be anchored in a timeline by referring to an anchored temporal expression. For example, the expression “tomorrow” cannot be anchored in any timeline without referring to other time expressions. However, it can be anchored if the document has an explicit publication date. This date can be used as a reference for mapping “tomorrow” to a chronon. There are many instances of implicit temporal expressions, such as “on Thursday”, “in July”, “next week”, and “last Friday”.

Explicit temporal expressions can be normalized by many time annotation tools based on the TIMEX2 or TIMEX3 standard. In this paper, we use the TIMEX3 standard (Pustejovsky et al., 2005) to annotate temporal expressions. A portion of the normalization result for explicit temporal expressions is shown as follows.

<TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01"> May 1, 2009 </TIMEX3>

In general, an implicit temporal expression consists of two parts: modifiers and temporal nouns. For example, “ten days” is a temporal noun, while “ten days ago” is modified by the modifier “ago”. Here, we extend the modifier set based on the TIMEX3 standard, which includes verbs, conjunctions, adverbs, and prepositions that quantify or modify temporal nouns. Interestingly, we find that, no matter how many modifiers modify a temporal noun, the whole temporal expression holds the original temporal reference inferred from the temporal noun. Moreover, the key point of normalizing implicit temporal expressions is how to choose appropriate referential time according to the context; thus we need to build a reference link model to infer the referential time. For instance, Fig. 1
                         shows the reference link between two implicit temporal expressions “after one week” and “this Monday” in the following news report.

(Beijing, May 6, 2009, Xinhua News) On March 8, 2000, the company B announced that they had bought Company A. After one week, B was listed in Hong Kong Stock, becoming the first company listed in Hong Kong Stock. However, this Monday B announced its bankruptcy, because of its huge debt.
                     

Considering the referential time in Fig. 1, we can see that the full temporal reference link comes from two parts, i.e., the modifier reference link and the temporal noun reference link. Since the former is inferred by the latter, the referential time choosing of a whole implicit temporal expression strongly depends on its temporal nouns.

Therefore, in our previous work (Zhao et al., 2010), we use the Naïve Bayesian model to classify implicit temporal expressions into two classes according to the referential time of their temporal nouns. One is called Global Time (GT), which takes the publication time as the referential time and therefore is independent from the context. The other is called Local Time (LT), which is context-related, i.e., the referential time of a Local Time has to be inferred from the contextual text exactly appearing before the word specifying the local time. Table 1
                         shows some examples of GT and LT. In this paper, in addition to the Naïve Bayesian model, which is a statistic-based model, we further consider feature-based models and implement the SVM model to classify implicit temporal expressions. Particularly, we use two types of features in SVM, which are text-based features (e.g., characterized word, “this”, “last”, “that”) and position-based features (e.g., the first time in the document). We conduct a comparative experiment to compare the effectiveness of SVM and the Naïve Bayesian model, which will be shown in Section 5.3.

We use an in-memory data structure as shown in Fig. 2
                         to maintain all the referential time in a Web news article. The data structure is updated after each normalization process. It consists of two parts: Global Referential Time and Local Referential Time.
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Global Referential Time (GRT). This type of referential time is referenced by Global Time. Specifically, it is the report time or the publication time of the news document.


                                 Local Referential Time (LRT). This type of referential time is referenced by Local Time. It is updated after each execution of normalization.

We dynamically and automatically choose references for different classes of time. This is much different from previous context-free solutions that use a fixed value as well as the context-dependent solution using some inconsiderate rules. The data structure is updated after each normalization process, which can also adapt to the updates on Web news pages.

As we mentioned in Section 2, fuzzy temporal expressions refer to those temporal expressions with vague meanings. The defuzzification on temporal expressions aims to find the most appropriate explanation for a fuzzy temporal expression. Basically, fuzzy temporal expression defuzzification faces two problems: granularity selection and offset identification. Granularity selection means that we have to select a right temporal granularity for a fuzzy temporal expression, e.g., what is the most appropriate granularity for “now”? Offset identification aims to find the exact time duration of a fuzzy temporal expression, e.g., to determine the time duration of the word “recently”.

In this paper, we utilize the scenario-time shifting model (Anderson et al., 1983) as the basic tool to solve the granularity selection problem. According to this model, temporal situation shifting (or time shifting, in short) is reflected by the temporal granularities of two different scenarios, i.e., temporal expressions in the same scenario are linked by the scenario-depending relationship (as shown in Fig. 3
                        ). Therefore, the granularities of fuzzy temporal expressions can also be determined by the granularities of the time associated with scenarios. For example, suppose that there are two sentences in different scenarios as follows:


                        
                           
                              (1)
                              “He was in Hong Kong yesterday, but now he is in Beijing.”

“He was in Hong Kong last year, but now he is in Beijing.”

Obviously, the “now” in the first sentence means “today”, and it should have the same temporal granularity (day) as the “yesterday” in the same sentence. Similarly, for the “now” in the second sentence, it is more appropriate to choose “year” as its temporal granularity.

Normally, a paragraph can be considered as a single unit of a scenario, and we can construct the scenario-depending relationships based on paragraphs. In a word, we can get the temporal granularity of fuzzy time from the nearest narrative time that appears before the fuzzy time in the same paragraph. However, since there is no scenario-shifting pointing to the first paragraph, we employ an empirical dictionary to initialize the defuzzification algorithm when the first temporal expression in the first paragraph is fuzzy time. More specifically, this dictionary is constructed as a default dictionary in order to figure out the offset problem. For example, “lately” is denoted in the dictionary as below.

                        Algorithm 1 shows the details of temporal expressions defuzzification. Here, when a conflict in temporal granularity occurs during the process, we choose the coarser granularity between the previous temporal expression and the next temporal expression to imply the temporal granularity of fuzzy time.
                     

As discussed in Section 3.1, we introduce Global Referential Time (GRT) and Local Referential Time (LRT) to adaptively determine the referent of an implicit temporal expression in Web news. According to this design, we present the detailed process of normalizing temporal expressions in Algorithm 2.

The basic idea of Algorithm 2 is to use different methods to process explicit and implicit temporal expressions. For each temporal expression, we first perform the defuzzification process (Line 5). Then, if the temporal expression is explicit, we simply put it into the result list and update the data structure LRT (Lines 6–8). If the temporal expression is implicit, we transform it into an explicit time using LRT in case that it is a global time (Lines 10–11). Otherwise, we transform it using the data structure GRT (Line 13). Finally, we put the transformed explicit time into the result list and update LRT (Lines 15–16).
                     

For example, according to Algorithm 2, the temporal expressions in the news document shown in Fig. 1 can be normalized into the following format, which is annotated with the TIMEX3 standard.

In this section, we explain the algorithm of extracting the topic time of a news topic. Our basic idea is to use different relation models to model the dependency between news topics and temporal information.

Particularly, we first classify the Web news into two types: one-level-topic news and multi-level-topic news. Here, one-level-topic news refers to those news that only consist of a single specific event and related information and it normally has no sub-headings, and multi-level-topic news involves no events or reports more details about a certain event (e.g., event development, discussions, or controversy) and it normally contains a few sub-headings. In the experiments, we will use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these two types of Web news.

After the classification, we introduce different relation models for the two types of Web news, namely a position-dependent relation model for one-level-topic news and a topic-dependent relation model for multi-level-topic news. In Section 4.1, we will discuss the position-dependent relation model as well as the corresponding topic time extraction method. In Section 4.2, we focus on the topic-dependent relation model.

The one-level-topic news normally focuses on a specific event and has a complete attribute set in one sentence including Who, What, Where and When (Mencher, 2010). More interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4
                        , the news title of a one-level-topic news page usually contains most of its topic attributes. Therefore, we use a top-down approach shown in Fig. 5
                         to detect the topic time for each news page.

As shown in Fig. 5, we need to rank topic time candidates to extract the topic time for a news topic by calculating the scores of each attribute set. Typically, we can use the distance between two topic attributes in one sentence to measure the importance of their semantic dependency. Therefore, we define the distance weight between two attribute terms in one sentence, denoted as

                        , in (1). In this formula, P(wi
                        ) refers to the position of the ith attribute term appearing in the sentence s, and Len(s) is the length of s, which is the number of words in s. The function exp (x) in (1) means the natural exponential function ex
                        . Here, we assume that the topic information mainly appears in the first-half part of a sentence (Mencher, 2010); thus Len(s)/2 is taken as a threshold to determine the topic-related part in (1).

In (3), Len(ws) refers to the length of the news title (news topic). The ratio between Len(ws) and P(wi
                        ) means that, if a term appears in an early position in the title, it will contribute more to the topic weight. Additionally, we use a page-level TF-IDF model

                        (wi
                        ) refers to the term frequency of the topic attribute appearing in the sentence s. Besides, M is the number of all attribute sets in the news page and Nwi
                         is the number of all attribute sets including the attribute term wi

Based on the topic weight represented by (3), we revise (2) to calculate the score of the sentence s, as shown in (5).

Then, the score of a topic time candidate in s is defined as SC(s). We also remove the topic time candidates whose scores are less than a threshold θ, calculated by (6). Here, based on the mathematical expectation of the scores of all topic time candidates, we add a tuning factor μ to optimize the threshold θ dynamically. The influence of μ will be discussed in the experiment section.

                                             θ

Finally, we aggregate the remaining topic time candidates chronologically into a time period and return it as the topic time for the news topic.

As a result, Algorithm 3 shows the detailed procedures of extracting topic time for one-level-topic Web news.
                     

In this section, we discuss the extraction of topic time for multi-level-topic Web news. Generally, journalists are used to reporting the sustainable development of an event with a hierarchical style involving multiple sub-topics. We call this hierarchical Web news as multi-level-topic Web news, where the news content is divided into multiple sub-topic sections. In a news report, multiple sub-topic sections are usually used to describe the development of the news event. Fig. 6
                         shows an example of multi-level-topic Web news.

Based on the observations on multi-level-topic news, we can find that those news pages usually have a headline indicating the general topic of the news and have several sub-topics denoted by some specific sub-titles. Further, as sub-titles in a Webpage are commonly tagged by some emphasized HTML symbols, e.g., <Strong>, <B>, <H2>, <I>, etc., we can extract the relational structure between the news topic and the temporal information by parsing the HTML tags in the Web page.

In this paper, we employ the DOM-tree (Crescenzi, Mecca, & Merialdo, 2001) to represent the structure of a multi-level-topic Web page, as shown in Fig. 7
                        .

The relational structure of Fig. 7 can be denoted in Fig. 8
                        . As shown in Fig. 8, all the temporal information is included in different sub-topics and the semantics of the temporal information completely depend on its sub-topic. Owing to the time variation along with the sub-topic shifting, we cannot conduct a direct mapping between news topics and topic time, which means that the position-dependent relation model is not suitable for multi-level-topic Web news.

In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to extract the topic time of a multi-level-topic Web news document, as shown in Fig. 9
                        , where we take Fig. 8 as the example. The approach shown in Fig. 9 consists of four steps:
                           
                              (1)
                              
                                 Local Cluster. All the temporal information included in one sub-topic is to be clustered.


                                 Sub-Topic Time Extraction. All the time clusters obtained by the first step are ranked according to the similarity between the sub-topic and the cluster. The most relevant cluster is recognized as the topic time for the sub-topic.


                                 Global Cluster. All the sub-topic time in the same topic level is further clustered.


                                 Topic Time Extraction. All the time clusters obtained by the third step are ranked according to the similarity between the topic and the cluster. The most relevant cluster is recognized as the topic time for the news document.

In this paper, we calculate the similarity between topics and time clusters using a vector

                                 ,

                                 ,

                                 ,
                                 
                                    G
                                    ⇀

Third, we consider the temporal order among the sub-topics in Local Cluster and Global Cluster. Our basic idea is that all the temporal information in one cluster should be sequential because the multi-level-topic news is usually chronologically reported by journalists. Therefore, the binary vector 
                           
                              S
                              ⇀
                           
                         is used to model the sequential feature for temporal information. Here, we use the symbol 
                           
                              t
                              
                                 i
                              
                              s
                           
                         and 
                           
                              t
                              
                                 i
                              
                              e
                           
                         to define the start and the end date of the temporal information ti
                         respectively, and subsequently the vector is defined by (9).

Finally, as discussed in the previous section about the scenario-time shifting model, the granularity of temporal information is consistent with the granularities of the scenario-associated time in one scenario (cluster); thus we use the vector 
                           
                              G
                              ⇀
                           
                         to model the granularity feature for clustering. In this paper, the feature value is set to 0 (day), 1 (month), or 2 (year), according to the results of temporal expression normalization. Here we consider week as the day granularity and season as the month granularity in order to simplify the vector. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 9, we remove the reference feature 
                           
                              C
                              ⇀
                           
                         and the granularity feature 
                           
                              G
                              ⇀
                           
                         when extracting sub-topic time from local clusters. This is because that 
                           
                              C
                              ⇀
                           
                         and 
                           
                              G
                              ⇀
                           
                         will affect the similarity comparison among different sub-topic time when we extract topic time from the global clusters.

For the clustering method involved in our approach, we use the HAC (Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering) algorithm (Han, Kamber, & Pei, 2011) to obtain local clusters and global clusters. The cluster centroid used in HAC is calculated by the K-means algorithm, which is defined in (10).

In this paper, we use cosine similarity to measure the similarity between clusters. The cosine similarity function is widely used to quantify the similarity between two sets. Note that we aim to measure the similarity between different local clusters as well as between global clusters. Specially, considering that there are different ways to aggregate the similarities between two clusters, we introduce four mechanisms that are based on different linkage criteria. These four mechanisms are defined from (11)–(14) and are named Single-Linkage, Complete-Linkage, Centroid, and Group-Average. Here, d(ci, cj
                        ) refers to the distance between the cluster ci
                         and cj
                         and

                         is the cosine similarity function. We will evaluate the performance of these four mechanisms in our experiments.

In summary, we present the detailed algorithm of determining the topic time for multi-level-topic Web news in Algorithm 4.

Based on the approaches discussed above, we can figure out the general algorithm for extracting topic time from Web news pages. Algorithm 5 shows the process of determining topic time for both one-level-topic news and multi-level-topic news.
                     

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

In this section, we discuss the performance evaluation of our algorithms. We aim to measure the effectiveness of our proposal for normalizing temporal expressions and topic time extraction.

We use two real data sets in the experiments.


                        Dataset 1: The first data set
                           2
                           
                              http://www.icl.pku.edu.cn/icl_res/default_en.asp.
                        
                        
                           2
                         consists of 3,148 People’s Daily news articles published in January, 1998 (Zhao et al., 2010). This data set is used to measure the performance of temporal expression normalization (Algorithm 2). It contains 2,816,612 characters as well as 967,884 words, and 21,176 words are manually annotated as temporal expressions.


                        Dataset 2: The second data set
                           3
                           
                              https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2005T14.
                        
                        
                           3
                         consists of 1,033,679 Chinese news articles provided by LDC (Catalog Number LDC2005T14) from Chinese Gigaword Second Edition. This data set contains 43,582 documents from the ZaoBao Newspaper and 990,097 documents from the XinHua News Agency. We use this data set to measure the accuracy of topic time extraction (Algorithm 5). The news articles in this data set are about different categories such as business, sports, world, and entertainment.


                        Table 2 shows the statistics on Dataset 2 (the LDC data set). Here, we use SVM to classify news articles. The detailed experiment about SVM-based news classification will be discussed in Section 5.4.

In this paper, we aim to prove our methods can make a positive effect in discovering topic-related temporal information from Web news, so we have implemented a prototype system which is called Topic Time Parser (TTP). As shown in Fig. 10, TTP includes four modules, three of which are kernel portions and discussed in this paper. Here, with regard to the Topic Extraction module, we use the linguistic knowledge based approach to extract topic information from Web news (Zhao, Jin, & Yue, 2008). For temporal expression extraction, we use ICTCLAS
                           4
                           
                              http://ictclas.nlpir.org/.
                        
                        
                           4
                         (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System), which is widely used in Chinese language processing and supports temporal expression tagging. Fig. 11 shows the user interface of TTP. Given a file path that stores the news articles, the TTP system can automatically extract the type of each article as well as its topic time. All the results are also recorded in a text file for performance analysis.

In this experiment, we first evaluate the feature-based classifier (SVM) and the statistic-based classifier (Naïve Bayesian, NB) for classifying implicit temporal expressions. To speed up the model training process, we define a few terms as seeds to enlarge the training dataset, such as “this month” and “last month”. Fig. 12 shows the performance of these two models on classifying implicit temporal expressions.
                        
                        
                        
                     

As shown in Fig. 12, the statistic-based model (NB) outperforms the featured-based model (SVM) in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. This indicates that features about implicit temporal expressions are difficult to be modeled in feature-based models especially for Chinese news articles. For example, “一天后” (“after one day”) is much similar to “后天” (“the day after tomorrow”) in texts, but the former is a Local Time and the latter is a Global Time.

For the evaluation of normalization, we compare our algorithm with four existing methods, including Chinese-HeidelTime,
                           5

                           5
                         FSS-TimEx (Zavarella & Tanev, 2013), Context-Free Mechanism (CFM), and Context-Dependent Mechanism (CDM). The outputs of all the algorithms are evaluated in terms of the annotated time of Dataset 1. The Context-Free Mechanism (CFM) uses the publication time or report time as the unique referent for normalization. This policy is adopted in many traditional systems (Mani & Wilson, 2000; Wu et al., 2005a; Wu et al., 2005b). The Context-Dependent Mechanism (CDM) regards the nearest narrative time as the referent in temporal expression normalization. Note that Chinese-HeidelTime needs to specify the document creation time and the document type (NARRATIVES, NEWS, COLLOQUIAL, or SCIENTIFIC) in the initialization procedure, thus we use the news publication time tagged in each news document as the document creation time. In addition, all the documents are with the type of “NEWS”. In addition, we use the metric accuracy to measure the effectiveness of each method, which is defined by (15).

                        Table 3
                         shows the results on Dataset 1. As the temporal expressions in Dataset 1 have already been annotated, we can measure the accuracy of each algorithm. The results in Table 3 indicate that our approach outperforms all the competitive methods. Specially, our approach improves the accuracy up to 15.2% than CFM and 16.3% than FSS-TimEx. Error samples by Chinese-HeidelTime show that some specific temporal expressions are not covered by its rules. For example, the temporal expression of “今天” (“today”) should be considered as a Local Time when it appears as a part of multi-level-topic news, but Chinese-HeidelTime chooses the document creation time as the referential time for this temporal expression. Note that Chinese-HeidelTime does not provide the interface to get the information about referent updating. Therefore, we are not able to include in Table 3 the average referent updates per article of Chinese-HeidelTime. FSS-TimEx performs context-aware normalization on implicit temporal expressions. However, it has a poor accuracy because of its high error rate in recognizing global time. CDM only concentrates on the nearest words when choosing referential time, resulting in a poor accuracy. Generally, CDM can also be regarded as a rule-based method, and thus it cannot adapt to different kinds of articles. Further, our approach introduces fewer updates than CDM while keeping a higher accuracy. Although the CFM method does not introduce referent updating operations because it simply uses the publication time or report time as the referential time, its poor performance shows that it is not suitable for practical applications.

With respect to the defuzzification, we evaluate our approach on fuzzy temporal expressions on Dataset 1 in terms of different metrics. We ask two students to evaluate the results and a result is labeled acceptable in case that the Cohen’s Kappa score (Cohen, 1960) is over 0.84. Then, we define the following metric acceptable ratio to measure the performance of our algorithm, which is defined by (16). The results are shown in Table 4

As Table 4 shows, our algorithm is effective to defuzzify over 84% of fuzzy temporal expressions on average. Specially, the ratio of “As referent”, which refers to the proportion of the correct referential expressions detected by the defuzzification algorithm among all the results, suggests that our approach is able to find 22.4% more correct referents for the global time.

In this experiment, we run all the algorithms on Dataset 2. We first use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the news articles in Dataset 2 into two classes: one class of one-level-topic news and the other of multi-level-topic news. The features used in the SVM model are shown in Table 5.


                        Table 6 shows the classification results. The SVM model performs well in classifying news articles, especially for the one-level-topic news.

To evaluate the performance of our proposal and comparative methods, we define a criterion to evaluate the correctness of the extracted results. Here, the topic time annotated manually and the topic time extracted by algorithms are denoted as

                                 Irrelevant: T′ – (T′∩T) > 10 days.
                              

The reason that we use 10days as the threshold is to make the comparison consistent with the comparative methods (Li et al., 2006), where they also use 10days as the threshold to extract topic time.

We compare our algorithm with three baseline methods, which are described as follows:

                                    FT(Frequent Time): The second method extracts the highest frequency of all the temporal information within 10days to the publication time as topic time (Li et al., 2006).


                                 
                                    MT(Merged Time): The third method recognizes the time period which is merged from all the temporal information within 10days to the publication time to represent the topic time (Li et al., 2006).


                        Table 7
                         presents the extraction results for the one-level-topic news. As shown in Table 7, our algorithm has the best accuracy among all the algorithms. In particular, it outperforms the second best method, namely FT, by more than 20% in accuracy. Note that FT does not consider the relationship between topic time and news topics, which will lead to poor performance because of topic-irrelevant time. Besides, the MT method, is not acceptable to the one-level-topic news while the PT method does not perform well in some high time-sensitive news articles (e.g., business) because the publication time is normally later than the topic time.

The factor μ in (6) ranges from 0.3 to 2.0. Note that we do not consider values below 0.3 because wen found in our experiments that a very small value of the threshold θ in (6) cannot effectively filter topic time candidates. For each value of μ, we estimate the accuracy of topic time extraction on four different corpus selected from the LDC2005T14 dataset documents randomly, namely DOC_zbn_199812, DOC_zbn_200011, DOC_xin_199502, DOC_xin_200408, which contains 1000, 2000, 4000, and 9509 documents, respectively. As shown in Fig. 13
                        , all the results displayed in four different tests almost have the same trends. In particular, the accuracy increases rapidly with a certain value of μ (μ = 0.6), and then decreases after the optimal value (μ = 1.3). Since the LDC corpus is a set of common news articles, the selection of μ is applicable to other news collections.

To evaluate the effectiveness of linkage criteria on clustering, we cluster news documents with each linkage criteria on 10 different data sets (generated randomly from the original large data set). Table 8
                         shows the results. Here, we use precision, defined by (17), to estimate the performance of each criterion.

Since the clustering result for the first time has a great impact on the following results in the HAC algorithm, the precision of 10 tests for each linkage criterion varies significantly. In general, the performance of Group-Average criterion is superior to the others.


                        Table 9
                         shows the experimental results on multi-level-topic news. Since irregular temporal expressions appear more likely in multi-level-topic news, we can see that all the algorithms get relatively low accuracies compared with the results for one-level-topic news. However, our approach still performs better than all the other algorithms. The reasons are threefold. First, our approach does not rely on the publication time, which is no more helpful to infer the topic time from multi-level-topic news. Second, the topic-dependent relation model in our algorithm can eliminate noises (e.g., those temporal words with high frequency but not related with the topics) during the topic time extraction procedure. Finally, our approach considers the correlation between extracted topic time and all the news topics in different levels.

To evaluate the overall performance, we implement all the algorithms in our prototype system TTP and conduct comparative experiments on Dataset 2 with three systems built according to existing approaches. The first system to be compared, denoted as CDM
                        +
                        FT, adopts the CDM approach (which shows good performance in normalization), and the FT mechanism (which performs well when extracting topic time from one-level-topic news). The second system is named CDM
                        +
                        MT, which employs CDM and MT. Note that the MT approach has the second-best performance in extracting topic time from multi-level-topic news. The third system is denoted as Chinese-HeidelTime
                        +
                        FT, which uses Chinese-HeidelTime and FT. We do not consider Chinese-HeidelTime
                        +
                        MT, because it is difficult to merge temporal expressions outputted with different granularities in Chinese-HeidelTime.

The results are shown in Table 10
                        , where we use the commonly-used metrics including precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate the performance. The definitions of these metrics are given in (18).

Note that if a news article does not contain a temporal expression, we simply regard the publication time as the topic time of the news article. As Table 10 shows, our TTP system is superior to the other three systems in terms of all the metrics.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach to discover topic time from Web news. In particular, we present the dynamic-choosing mechanism to determine the referential time for implicit temporal expressions, as well as a scenario-dependent time-shifting method for temporal expressions defuzzification. Further, we propose new relation models between topics and topic time and corresponding algorithms to extract the topic time for Web news. We conduct comparative experiments with different existing methods on a large real data set containing 1,033,679 Chinese news articles as well as a small real data set to measure the performance of our proposal, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal with respect to various metrics.
