                  Background
                  In complex diseases, alterations of multiple molecular and cellular components in response to perturbations are indicative of disease physiology. While expression level of genes from high-throughput analysis can vary among patients, the common path among disease progression suggests that the underlying cellular sub-processes involving associated genes follow similar fates. Motivated by the interconnected nature of sub-processes, we have developed an automated methodology that combines ideas from biological networks, statistical models, and game theory, to probe connected cellular processes. The core concept in our approach uses probability of change (POC) to indicate the probability that a gene’s expression level has changed between two conditions. POC facilitates the definition of change at the neighborhood, pathway, and network levels and enables evaluation of the influence of diseases on the expression. The ‘connected’ disease-related genes (DRG) identified display coherent and concomitant differential expression levels along paths.
               
               
                  Results
                  RNA-Seq and microarray breast cancer subtyping expression data sets were used to identify DRG between subtypes. A machine-learning algorithm was trained for subtype discrimination using the DRG, and the training yielded a set of biomarkers. The discriminative power of the biomarkers was tested using an unseen data set. Biomarkers identified overlaps with disease-specific identified genes, and we were able to classify disease subtypes with 100% and 80% agreement with PAM50, for microarray and RNA-Seq data set respectively.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  We present an automated probabilistic approach that offers unbiased and reproducible results, thus complementing existing methods in DRG and biomarker discovery for complex diseases.
               
            

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

Cancer is a prototype of a complex disease in which emergent phenotypes arise from the breakdown of complex cellular systems that are induced by multiple molecular and environmental perturbations [1–5]. While complex diseases may be the result of a range of molecular perturbations that can strongly vary between patients, they often dysregulate similar components of the cellular system [1,6–8]. Gene expression array platforms, such as microarray and RNA-Seq, have been routinely used in the study of complex diseases [9–12]. These platforms have been useful in assessing the collective behavior of cellular systems in response to disease perturbations by identifying a subset of significantly changing genes, which are likely to play a role in the disease [11,13]. Expression platforms produce high-dimensional data by simultaneously screening thousands of genes [13–15]. To reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data and identify the differentially expressed genes, ‘frequentist’ approaches employ fold change cutoffs and statistical significance levels [46]. The basis of selecting threshold values for differential genes selection is empirical, and variations in cutoff levels have been shown to significantly alter the interpretation of the results [17]. Recognition that use of thresholds and assumptions of independence may lead to loss of potentially important players in impacted pathways [14], and alternative approaches that rely on networks and pathways have emerged. Pathway analysis is a term broadly used to describe approaches, in which prior knowledge about biological networks is used in order to reduce the complexity of the data set and to extract features relevant to the biological changes [12,15,16]. Among common features in pathway-based approaches, one may include the use of pathway knowledge bases, creation of mathematical or statistical models for input data, and methods for scoring or evaluating the level of changes in pathways [17]. The majority of these approaches obtain their signaling, metabolic and protein–protein interaction network data from publically available knowledge bases such as, KEGG [18], Pathway Commons [19], PANTHER [20] and Reactome [21].

List-based network analysis is the most common methodology, which uses a subset of expression array genes called ‘seed’ to create the network [22,23]. These methods are useful because using the full set of genes for classification (disease vs. healthy, for example), or multi-way classification (cancer sub-typing, for example) is ill advised; due to the high dimensionality of the data sets and low sample numbers [18]. The basis of picking threshold values in list-based analysis for seed genes selection in these approaches is empirical, and variations in cutoff levels have been shown to significantly alter the interpretation of the results [22]. Use of thresholds may also result in the elimination of relevant but sub-threshold genes, thereby increasing the potential for incomplete or incorrect results [22]. Although their performance does not depend on statistical thresholds, their efficacy deteriorates due to increased noise sensitivity that comes from the (very many) genes that do not change much between the phenotypes.

In addition, though seed gene identities can be combined as binary values (present or absent) in the network context, there is no canonical mathematical basis for combining p-values and fold changes as graded values that could represent changes at a sub-network level [19,17]. In order to strike a balance between sensitivity and selectivity of genes in pathway-based methods, it is necessary to delicately evaluate pathway level changes. The diversity of assumptions that underpin these approaches limit the options for meaningful comparison—for example, different biological investigations may use different levels for significant fold change, or threshold for p-value, utilize specific clustering methodology, and employ unique pathway selection approaches.

We propose a global network-based probabilistic approach to enhance the detection of differentiating properties in an automated manner. This approach does not make primary use of thresholds. However, we note that our computational steps make secondary use of threshold in order to speed up processing, and to streamline interpretation of final path analysis results. A comparative overview in 
                     Fig. 1 identifies the key differences of our probabilistic approach with the commonly used list-based, or direct, methodology. In order to assign the probability values, the idea is to assign a probabilistic response to the following question: given a gene and two sets of gene expression values for the gene, corresponding to change between two conditions (set A and set B), what is the probability that a given (unlabeled) expression values can be correctly assigned to the correct set (set A or set B)? This probability is called ‘Probability of Change’ (POC), and the name is suggestive of the rationale. If expression values in sets A and B are sufficiently different (i.e. a change has occurred because of the disease), a robust discrimination model can be built. The graded response represented by POC can be adapted readily to the network setting. Moreover, we show that POC succinctly captures the essential features of the frequentist gene-expression measures (p-value and fold change) into a single score.

The architecture of biological networks has been the subject of intense study. These networks have been shown to be scale-free, and wherein the empirical degree distribution has heavy tails. For example, it has been heuristically noted that most nodes in the network have low degree (most genes interact with at most 5 other genes) while a few nodes have a very high degree. Several methods for identification of hubs have been proposed and compared by Vallabhajosyula et al. [24]. A useful heuristic for capturing all hubs in networks is to capture the top 10% of the overall nodes formed the heavy tail of the distribution—in most cases studies, hubs are within the top 5–8%. To identify dysregulated genes, we traverse the biological networks using ‘hub’ genes and proteins, which are well-conserved proteins that have been shown to play an important role in the robustness of biological networks by acting as ‘problem distributors’ [3,17]. Dysregulation of hubs and the paths between hubs have been shown to be responsible for the fragility of biological networks [21]. As a result of these vital network properties, disease-related genes have been shown to be in close proximity to hubs [1,9,25].

We tested our platform using breast cancer subtyping data sets—a well-studied complex disease [26]. Our results identify disease-related genes to be predominantly independent of platform and primarily dependent on the disease network. The concepts used in building the core of this platform can be extended to applications in other ‘omics’ arenas.

@&#METHODS@&#

This section describes a multistep methodology for the identification of molecular pathways in complex diseases in genomic expression platforms such as RNA-Seq and microarray. The output from the process is a list of disease-related genes that are associated through a directed interaction. Probability of Change (POC), a concept with roots in game theory, is used to measure changes in gene expression levels between two conditions (breast cancer subtypes, for example). Changes reported by POC do not distinguish between down or up regulation of genes. Instead, the reported value is the probability that an alteration in gene expression between two conditions (either up or down) is detected. Weights based on POC are derived successively for nodes, edges, neighborhoods, and paths. No threshold is applied during network analysis, but computational efficiencies are gained by scoring hubs, and by limiting calculations to ‘active’ hubs—i.e. hubs with a high probability of change in their respective neighborhoods. Connected and directed paths, where genes interacted with highly active hubs, are identified as ‘prominent’ features. The ‘weighted network’ is subsequently used to reduce the dimensionality of expression data and to identify ranked ‘disease-related genes’. The process is repeated for each pair of subtypes and final list of ranked features is assembled across subtypes. The ranked disease-related genes are then provided as input to a standard feature selection algorithm and the efficiency of classification is evaluated using an un-seen data set. Finally, the results obtained from our approach are evaluated for precision, and accuracy compared to PAM50. Furthermore, consistency in the two different expression array platforms (microarray and RNA-Seq) is evaluated.

In the current iteration of our implementation, there is a computational limit on the size of the directed biological network used—the number of the genes that have directed regulatory information in databases (reference DB) limits the number of genes in the network. Moreover, due to fundamental differences in methodology and assumptions, the only achievable comparison is at the level of results. To evaluate the effectiveness our approach, we adopted three key steps. First, we used a well-studied breast cancer subtyping data set and compared our results with the wealth of publicly available literature. Second, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the POC score in capturing the gene expression changes, we compared the POC scores for all genes with their respective frequentist counterparts (such as fold change and p-value). Finally, we used standard machine learning approaches to identify a subset of disease-related genes that can be used as biomarkers and tested the effectiveness of these biomarkers in re-classifying an unseen test data set. We compared our results with well-documented breast cancer intrinsic gene-sets and random sub-sets of genes.

The discrete steps involved in identifying significantly altered subsets of disease related genes are identified in 
                     Fig. 2 and the workflow detailed in Supplementary Fig. S1. The input to the platform consists of expression values for using RNA-Seq or cDNA microarray platform. The output is a set of genes with the following properties: (a) the genes are involved in regulation [19], (b) the genes are part of a directed regulatory path; and (c) the genes along the path have the highest probability of exhibiting relative and coherent changes within a sub-network. The formulation of each step is described in the sections that follow.

To minimize the risk of over-customizing the platform for cancer subtyping during development, we used an independent data set representative of a different type of complex disease (sepsis, SIRS and septic shock: GSE13904 [27]) for the platform’s unit testing and module integration.

Microarray and RNA-Seq gene expression data sets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE7390 [28]) and TCGA data portal (Level 3 Breast Carcinoma RNA-Seq data set) [26] respectively. Intrinsic subtypes for both data sets were classified using PAM50 signature [29]. For each subtype, data were randomly split into a training set consisting of 80% of the values, and the remainder assigned to a test set. Our computational experiments identified a minimum of 10 samples as a requirement for robust training during the classification step. Therefore, for a subset with less than 10 samples, the entire subset was used as a training set. To contrast with the frequentist approach, relevant values for the microarray and RNA-Seq data set were calculated using GEO2R and DESeq [30] package respectively.

Curated biological interaction data (STRING, Reactome and the National Cancer Institute Pathway Interaction Database (NCI-PID)) used in our platform was obtained from Pathway Commons on 30 August, 2014 [19]. The interaction data was used to divide the network into directed and undirected sub networks based on the presence or absence of interaction directionality.

The interactions obtained from Pathway Commons were resolved into a Simple Interaction Format (SIF) [19], that represents gene/protein interactions as simple pairwise interactions. The genes and their interactions were selected in an inclusive manner meant to represent the maximum possible number of genes in the given study—they were not selected to represent the disease outcome. Undirected interactions such as ‘Co control’, ’Interacts with’, ’In same component’ and ‘Reacts with’ formed part of the undirected network while directed interactions such as ‘Component of’, ‘Metabolic catalysis’, ’Sequential catalysis’, and ‘State change’ formed the directed network. Isolated nodes were removed from both networks and multiple edges between nodes were replaced by a single edge. The degree distribution of the nodes in the directed and undirected network followed the power law similar to scale-free networks (shown in Supplementary Fig. S2).

The POC paradigm is based on the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) [31], a model that is used in game theory to calculate probability of binary response preferences (globally) using paired comparison data. For measuring change in expression values, it is defined as the log-likelihood of a gene expression change between two subtypes—a score of zero signifies no change and score of one signifies consistent change in expression between two subtypes. For increased clarity, we focused our description of POC for the case of two specific subtypes, but we note that a POC is calculated for each pair of subtypes.

Given gene ‘X’ and given a pair of expression values for Luminal A and Luminal B drawn from the set of experimental expression values Luminal A and Luminal B, BTL can be used to obtain an estimate of rankings and scores for all expression values for gene X. The ranking can then be used to obtain an overall probability that X’s expression values have changed. Expression values for a gene are viewed as response potency (on an exponential scale), and a probability is estimated using the following formula for each pairwise comparison is described in Eq.

                         is the number of times gene ‘iʼs expression value was greater in condition ‘A’ as compared to condition ‘B’, and m is the total number of comparisons. We say that LumA ‘beats’ LumB when the global expression value of LumA is greater than absolute expression value of LumB (as in Eq. (1)). Note that the scores are not dependent on the number of samples since the formulation of the model normalizes the computation by the number of samples in each condition [33]. However, it is relevant to note that for robust computation of POC, a minimum of 10 samples (similar to the minimum needed for classification) is required.

For the purpose of graphical illustration, and in order to evaluate the relationship between POC and existing measures, it is useful to select a threshold for probability of change (POC). This threshold is not used in the computational pipeline; the threshold is used in figures (list figures). A POC of 0.5 (a 50% probability that change has occurred; similar to the flip of a fair coin) is used as the threshold value. Once a global ranking is obtained, we identify the fraction of times expression values from LumA appear in the top 50% of the globally ranked list and designate this value as the probability of change.

When two interacting genes (identified by SIF) change together between subtypes, there is a greater likelihood that the interaction is more robust. A POC for this concomitant change (edge POC) can be defined by comparing two subtypes–similar to above. Edge POC is computed by using the list product of expression values of interacting genes. If gene i and j interact, and

                         are subjected to the same analysis as that used for node values. An Edge POC score close to zero represents weak coherent interaction, while a score close to one represents strong (coherent) interaction. The POC scores for both edges and nodes were calculated using the R BradleyTerry2 package [31].The calculated POC scores for the nodes and edges were then used as weights in the directed and undirected network.

Hub interaction score (HIS) measures the level of activity in the neighborhood of the hub in response to disease perturbations. HIS is a distance function between two hub-neighborhoods. It that has been adapted from the Wasserstein metric/Earth Movers Distance (EMD) [34]. For a given hub neighborhood, the HIS represents a unique measure of perturbation in the activity levels of hub neighborhoods in two different conditions (subtypes). The goal of the HIS is to identify active hubs by comparing the ‘hub activity’ to a ‘random background’. A higher HIS score indicates a greater likelihood of coherent changes in the hub and its neighbors (similar to party hubs). Detecting active hubs enables us to better target the subsequent optimization and avoid highly expensive and unnecessary computations. Based on degree distributions in our gene networks, (at most) approximately 10% of nodes can be considered as hubs. The neighborhood of the hubs (at 10%) provides complete and overlapping (redundant) coverage of the full expression data network (see supplementary Fig. 2a and b). As a result, concerns over possible miss of an active hub are mitigated. In our computational experiments, selection at the 15% and higher level for hubs resulted in no change to the selection of active hubs (data not shown). The undirected network in the ‘Disease condition’ P, comprising the hub and its neighbors, and a topologically identical ‘Background’ undirected network Q, where edge and node weights are obtained by a uniform random selection of weights from the entire undirected network are compared and HIS is defined in Eq.

                        is the measure of expression changes (gene POC values) when conditions P and Q are compared. Intuitively, the “differential” state (Q) is compared to an initial state (P) in which the system is in quasi-equilibrium and every gene in the “neighborhood” under consideration has an equal chance (50/50) of experiencing change. The “ground distance”,
                           
                              
                                 d

                        , is measured by the edge POCs (
                           
                              
                                 d

                                 j
                              
                           
                         is inversely proportional to POC for the corresponding edge)—therefore, a low probability of change means “further away”, and a lower probability of affecting change at the target gene. The state Q has a probability of change that is computed according to POC. The set of values F={f
                        
                           ij
                        }is then computed to minimize HIS in the formula that defines EMD. This unique measure is the “minimum work” required for the translocation of an initial “mean state” to the new “differential” state.

The mathematical assumptions for this measure are met in practice. We assume that each sample of our gene expression data is drawn from the same family of distributions, but perturbed possibly due to disease—a non-restrictive assumption in practical terms. Moreover, we assume that the perturbation function belongs to a reasonable family of functions F—reasonable means that the function is not pathological.

Path analysis identifies the directed paths connecting pair of representative hubs that display significant changes between disease subtypes. To find the paths with highest level of change, we use probability propagations calculated using a probability transition matrix—by analogy to discrete Markov methods. Gene expression probabilities (node values) are treated as probability of change 
                           p
                        , and are propagated along edges (messages) to downstream nodes where they are accumulated. For the intensity of propagation the edge values computed earlier are utilized (represented by matrix 
                           M
                        ). The measure of the message intensity at stage i is computed through a multi-step transition and multiplication described in Eq. (4).

                        where the number of transition steps is no more than four—all hubs are separated by at most four intervening genes. It is noted that the probabilities will propagate beyond the stated length—along longer path scales. By our construction, the propagation along the longer paths is mediated by at least one hub, and influence of longer scales can be assembled by concatenating the “most changed” paths between pairs of hubs. This view is consistent with the notion that hubs play key roles in enabling efficient communication in biological networks.

Next, we identify the nodes having a Markov transition score greater than a value that could be obtained by ‘random chance’ as a result of bias in the directed network topology. To compute random probability measure, we create a large ensemble of directed networks with the same topology, but with node and edge values obtained by randomly sampling from an empirical distribution obtained from the original disease network. Significantly altered genes are identified as genes in the directed sub-networks whose transition scores show a change greater than three standard deviations (3σ) from the random ensemble. Deviation of 3σ indicates a less than 0.003 probability that the detected change in the path is due to chance alone. The Markov chain transitions are calculated using the Python package ‘pykov’. Representative reporter genes are identified from the entire directed network for every pairwise subtype comparison.

Genes identified as ‘disease-related’ are pooled from all individual pairwise subtype comparisons and are analyzed for the potential to identify biomarkers. The sklearn ‘Feature ranking with recursive feature elimination and cross-validation’ package is used to perform the classification and cross-validation [36]. Input matrix of reporter gene expression values are normalized and rescaled between −1 and +1 using Python-sklearn MinMaxScaler’ preprocessing tool [36].

Biomarkers for each data set are identified from reporter gene-sets using Python sklearn’s ‘feature selection with elimination’ algorithm. The deterministic power of the biomarkers in differentiating breast cancer subtypes is estimated using sklearn’s ‘Multi-class one vs. the rest Classifier’ (based on linear support vector machine) [36]. Results of the classifier for both the test and training data set (which includes 10-fold cross-validation) is presented as a classification report containing the precision, recall, and overall f-scores of for each subtype. Functional pathway enrichment and oncogene analysis was accomplished using DAVID [37] and cBioportal cancer genomic [11] tools respectively.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated framework that uses the graded function of POC for the discovery of disease-related genes and biomarkers. In the discussion of these results, the breast cancer data set is used to evaluate the capacity of the platform to differentiate breast cancer subtypes. In addition, the overall efficacy of POC in generating gene candidates with discriminatory power is evaluated using standard methods of machine learning.

An all vs. all pairwise comparison of breast cancer subtypes was performed, using GEOquery and limma R packages from Bioconductor project. The results from the package included absolute fold change (AFC) and adjusted p-value for all pairwise subtype comparisons. Corresponding POC values for the genes were calculated for all pairwise subtype comparisons. Computations with POC in our framework do not use any threshold values, but for comparison purposes, a POC of larger than 0.5 was used—0.5 indicating a 50–50 change of detecting change in expression (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for the distribution of POC scores). Results based on POC values were predominantly concordant with results obtained by significant p-value (p-value <0.05) and AFC threshold (AFC>2x) tests. Over 90% of the genes with POC value over 0.5 were found to have significant p-value (<0.05), with AFC>2. For genes with POC<0.5, one or both of the following conditions existed: the gene had an AFC<2X (
                        Fig. 4a), or had a non-significant p-value (Fig. 4b).

When the p-value for differential expression was <0.05, the POC value tracked more closely with the ability to separate gene expression values rather than fold change. In some genes with p-value <0.05 and higher than 2x fold change, the POC remained lower than 0.5. These cases were subjected to a more detailed analysis. The analysis revealed that the POC measure favored separability of expression values more favorably than AFC. Genes with small fold changes were found to have low POC values unless the changes in gene expression were highly coherent. The same analysis also revealed that a number of genes with distinctive differential profiles would have been eliminated from further analysis due to a two-fold limit used by many frequentist methods. Higher POC values were indicative of statistical significance as well as coherent change.

Dispersion plots of POC vs. fold change and POC vs. p-value illustrate the corresponding relationship (
                        Fig. 3a–f). The association between the POC and p-value follows a reciprocal relation:

                           t
                        , indicating a strong inverse correlation. The relationship between POC and AFC is strongly linear when the POC is low, but dispersed at higher AFC values. For sub-types Luminal A vs. Luminal B (Fig. 3a) – ER+ breast cancer subtypes that are physiologically similar – the range of AFC varied from no change to approximately 4x, while POC remained below 0.5. For the same subtypes, the POC vs. p-value plot shows that very few genes (<10 with AFC>2) attained a significant p-value (Fig. 3d). The plots exhibit that only a few genes were identified as having significant changes (p-value <0.5) and an AFC>2. High POC values, obtained for the aforementioned genes, were approximately near 0.45—indicating the absence of definitive high-probability changes. Fig. 3b and c illustrate the variations in POC with fold change and p-values, for Luminal A and other physiologically dissimilar subtypes such as Basal-like and Normal-like, exhibited favorable trends. Generally we found that higher POC values are observed when the corresponding genes have significant p-value and AFC>1.5. For well distinguishable subtypes, there is a compact and well-defined correlation between genes with POC<0.5 and genes that are considered not to be significantly changing according to standard analysis. Comparison of any subtype with normal-like subtype (Fig. 3b and e) indicated several genes with higher POC values. Some of these genes had p-value <0.05 and AFC>1.3—although, not all genes with p-value <0.05 and AFC>2 had>0.5 POC. Luminal A vs. Basal subtype (Fig. 3c and f) had a large number of genes showing difference of two-fold or more and p-value <0.05—that is highly correlated with high POC genes.

We examined the relationship between absolute fold change (AFC) and corresponding POC scores (Fig. 4). For clarity, we limited the comparisons to microarray probes involving Luminal A vs. all the other subtypes in this figure. The microarray probes were divided into two scatter plots based on p-value significance, with statistically significant probes (p-value <0.05) plotted in Fig. 4a and the remainder (p-value >0.05) in Fig. 4b. More than 90% of the genes with POC>0.5 were found to have a significant p-value with AFC>2. Similarly, most genes with POC<0.5 exhibited non-significant adjusted p-values, or AFC<2, or both. While POC broadly captured the p-value and fold change, we noted some cases in which genes with statistically significant changes and high fold values did not have a high POC. A detailed analysis in these cases revealed that the expression values for these genes had a high scatter and variance—indicating that POC favors consistency over average fold change.

Some representative discordant instances were characterized using five examples shown in Fig. 4c–e, corresponding to p-value <0.05, and Fig. 4f–g corresponding to p-value >0.05. Fig. 4c identifies a gene ‘CRABP1’ (that participates in retinoic acid-mediated differentiation and proliferation processes [38]) with significant p-value and greater than two-fold AFC, but a low POC value. POC scores favor consistent change (higher interquartile difference and less variance, for example), over high AFC. Fig. 4e is a box plot of gene CA12 (related to zinc metalloenzymes, that participates in many biological processes including respiration, acid–base balance and calcification [39]) with a high POC value but AFC<2. The interquartile difference between the two subtypes was reflected in the POC measure indicating a case that should be considered in more detail, but the gene would have been eliminated from consideration under standard measures. Intermediate between these two cases (Fig. 4d) is a gene with an AFC slightly below 2-fold. This gene would have also been eliminated from further consideration according to standard criteria, yet its interquartile difference appears to be better discriminated than FAXDC2 (part of the fatty-acid biosynthesis and oxidation process [40]). Overall, for genes with p-value <0.05, the POC provides an effective measure of detecting change and is not impacted adversely by low AFC.

Next, we considered genes with p-value >0.05 and high POC in detail. Our comparative statistical analysis illustrated that these genes were eliminated as a result of low sample count (normal-like sample counts are low). This property of POC may has no impact on false discovery rates. While these genes are not eliminated in this first stage, the inclusion of their graded values in the context of network neighborhoods in the subsequent analysis yields combined scores that exclude them from further consideration as disease-related genes. Finally, the case of POLR2L (part of machinery that catalyzes transcription of DNA into RNA [41]) illustrates the concordance of p-value <0.05 and high AFC with high POC value; as should be expected (Fig. 4h).

In order to generate the list of biomarkers, hubs and their immediate neighborhood were scored using the Hub Interaction Score (HIS) and ranked for consideration according the procedures outlined in Section 2 (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for the variation of HIS scores with degree distribution). Typically, only the top 50% of the hubs yielded significant path scores. 
                        Table 1 lists the total number of disease-related genes identified from these sub-networks in the microarray and RNA-Seq data set. In most cases, pairwise comparisons between breast cancer subtypes revealed a higher number of recognized disease-related genes when using the RNA-Seq data set as compared to the microarray data set. This was consistent with the higher overall POC values we observed in the RNA-Seq data. Despite the differences in microarray and RNA-Seq techniques, approximately 75% of the disease-related genes identified, using path analysis were common to both data sets for most pairwise subtype comparisons. However, when comparisons were made between a disease and the normal-like subtype across all subtypes, the fraction of common genes dropped to less than 50%. This may be partly explained by the observation that normal-like subtype may not have been well-defined across platforms [29]. The complete list of all significant genes identified from both data sets can be found in Supplementary Files S6 and S7. Individual pairwise analysis of the subtypes resulted in the identification of 503 unique biomarkers within the microarray data set and 688 within the RNA-Seq data set.

The number of paths selected in each pairwise comparison correlated well with the reported physiological similarities between the subtypes Table 1. For example, a smaller subset of disease-related genes were identified for Luminal A and Luminal B, which have similar disease physiologies [42]. A larger set was identified for Luminal A and HER2, which are physiologically dissimilar. Significantly, our approach was able to consistently identify similar disease-related genes across the two different expression platforms.

We used the seed genes identified in the path analysis to train the classification machine for discrimination among subtypes. The feature selection algorithm identified 46 biomarkers (genes) in the microarray data set and 59 biomarkers in the RNA-Seq data set. 
                        Fig. 5 shows the hierarchical clustering of expression values of the disease-related genes from both data sets for all breast cancer subtypes using a heat map. The genes identified by our methods are strongly linked to cancer. For example, the heat-map in Fig. 5a displays clustering in AR, MYB, MAPT, TTK, EVOVL4, and PNMT genes, which are microtubule maintenance genes known to be affected in some forms of breast cancer [43]. A complete list of reporter and biomarkers genes is provided in Supplementary Files S7 and S8 respectively. Supplementary Fig. S5 shows network map of genes, which are found to be common among different analyses and their interactions. Genes such as CYP24A1, MAPT, ESR1, KIT, TTK, CDK1, AURKB, CDC20, and BCL2 were found to be common across RNA-Seq and microarray sets. Genes such as BCL2, CCNE1, CDC20, ESR1, and MAPT were identified to be common across RNA-Seq feature and PAM50 sets. Genes such as ERBB2, ESR1, CDC20, MAPT, MDM2, and BCL2 were common across microarray and PAM50 sets. When genes in the immediate neighborhood of these biomarkers were taken into account, the overlap with PAM50 was found to be close to 80%. 9 out of the 46 microarray biomarkers have been implicated in various cancers as reported in the Sanger Cancer Gene Census [11,44].

To test the discriminatory power of biomarkers in subtyping the unseen breast cancer samples, a support vector based classifier was trained using the training data set. The biomarkers were used to classify samples in the training as well as the test datasets. Note that 10-fold cross-validation was performed during all training. 
                        Table 2 and Supplementary Table S10 indicates that the biomarkers obtained from microarray analysis classify all the samples with 100% precision and 100% recall, suggesting that these biomarkers could be used to differentiate the disease with efficacy identical to PAM50. For RNA-seq, Table 2 indicates that the biomarkers classify all the samples with 81% precision and 78% recall, suggesting that these biomarkers could effectively differentiate the disease under most conditions but do not match microarray biomarkers in precision or recall. Our accuracy of results, obtained using an automated approach with no threshold values, were comparable to the results obtained for biomarkers identified from published breast cancer intrinsic subtyping genes obtained from Mackay et al. [45] (Supplementary Tables S11 and S12 in Supplementary File 1).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Our overall goal was to provide an automated framework that removes the need for statistical thresholds, and uses concomitant gene expression changes along directed regulatory paths as an indicator of disease rewiring. Disease conditions modify signaling and regulatory pathways and these perturbations are subsequently dissipated across the disease network through hubs. By studying how the hubs dissipate these signals and by tracing the changes occurring in the hub-hub sub-network, we identified key paths and disease-related genes that are affected during the course of the disease.

POC provides an effective measure for identifying changing expression levels. It is effective in the network setting and succinctly captures the essential features of ‘frequentist’ methods (p-value and fold change) into a single score. ‘Frequentist’ statistical methods such as t-test, ANOVA, and Fisher exact test, have been developed to assess the statistical significance of the gene’s differential expression. The Student’s t-test is the most commonly used statistics that is used to measures the significance of differential expression of the gene as a p-value [46]. The fold change metric, on the other hand, provides insight into levels by which the gene has changed between two disease conditions. These measures, taken together or individually, are commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data by providing a selection criterion. POC aims at providing a probabilistic measure for the gene changes between conditions. A POC score is not used as a threshold, and a gene and its POC value is retained throughout the computational process. POC scores were independent of the directionality of gene change (up- or down- regulation) and were not used as thresholds for feature selection. We used pairwise pathway analysis to identify an initial candidate list for subtyping (Fig. 5 and Supplementary File S6–S9). In most cases, pairwise comparisons of disease phenotypes revealed a higher number of disease-related genes in the RNA-Seq data set as compared to the microarray data set. This result may have been due to higher overall POC values in RNA-Seq data. The higher POC values could be traced to higher accuracy of RNA-Seq detection methods [52].

Based on functional analysis performed using functional analysis tool DAVID [37], the set of breast cancer disease genes from microarray data set, and in RNA-Seq data set, were assessed to be a significant OMIM disease. Functional pathway analysis revealed the enrichment of several pathways that were previously implicated in breast cancer. These include ErbB signaling pathway [48–50], Insulin signaling pathway [53], cell cycle pathways [55], p53 signaling pathway [53-55], and TGFβ signaling pathway [54–57]. Regulation of cell cycle and programmed cell death were among the GO biological process that had significantly changed.

Our algorithm’s ability to automatically rediscover genes that previous studies have suggested to be strongly linked to this cancer is extremely promising. Nine biomarker genes were found to be common between RNA-Seq feature genes and the microarray feature genes. These genes are CYP24A1, MAPT, ESR1, KIT, TTK, CDK1, AURKB, CDC20 and BCL2. Between the RNA-Seq analysis and PAM50 set, genes including BCL2, CCNE1, CDC20, ESR1, and MAPT were identified as common. Genes common between Microarray feature set and PAM50 feature set include ERBB2, ESR1, CDC20, MAPT, MDM2 and BCL2.

Many of these genes identified as part of our analysis are part of vital cellular programs that indicate the hallmarks of various cancers. Mutation or expression level modifications of these genes can lead to cellular rewiring which contributes to the overall cancer oncogenesis. 9 out of the 46 microarray feature genes have been implicated in various cancers (as reported in the Sanger Cancer Gene Census) ERBB2, a feature gene identified in our analysis, is a well-documented breast cancer gene that has been implicated in other cancers, such as ovarian, and non-small cell lung carcinoma, as well [47]. Other feature genes identified from our analysis such as PCM1, KIT, PTPN11, CBLB, and BCL2 have been shown to be mutated in other cancers such as leukemia [44]. The gene RET has been implicated in medullary thyroid cancer [48]. Similar analysis on the RNA-Seq feature genes revealed that 10 of the feature genes were cancer genes. Most cancer genes, for example FGFR1 and IL2, were implicated in some form of lymphoma, whereas genes such as BCL2, BLM, CDK6, ZBTB16, KIT, and ACSL6 were implicated in leukemia [44].

In the RNA-Seq heat map, genes such as PCM1, MAPK14, PTPN11, CBLB, RPL31, RPL38, and RPL13 exhibit a distinctive behavior (Fig. 5b). The changes in the expression levels of these genes support the view that ribosomal protein synthesis between subtypes undergo a significant change. This result has also been noted in other analysis of breast cancers where the differential expression of ribosmomal protein levels affects the mTOR and PI3K pathway [42]. The microarray heat map also displays large changes in AR, MYB, MAPT, TTK, EVOVL4, and PNMT genes. A majority of these genes are known to play a role in the maintenance of microtubules, which are known to be affected in some forms of breast cancer [49].

The feature genes obtained from the microarray data set were able to differentiate the disease subtypes more accurately than those from the RNA-Seq data set (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10). Feature genes classified the samples from the blind data set into breast cancer subtypes with 100% accuracy (Table 2). With the RNA-Seq data, we were able to achieve 81% accuracy in the test set, while the training set was classified with 100% accuracy (Table 2). This was similar to the accuracy obtained for features genes derived from previously published intrinsic breast cancer gene list (Table S11 and S12 in Supplementary File 1). The smaller training set in our training may partially explain these results, and we expect higher accuracies once our computational resources are expanded to use larger sample sizes. Additionally, Dillies. M.A et al. [50] have suggested that the microarray data sets have more consistent normalization methods than RNA-Seq analysis. RNA-Seq analysis is a newer technology that lacks consensus around the normalization methodologies. The level 3 RNA-Seq data set utilized in our work measures the levels of the gene in units of RPKM, a measure that, along with proper normalization, remains the subject of a vigorous debate. Although our study of the empirical distribution of RPKM values suggested the use of log scale for both the feature selection, careful examination of the distribution of values remains a necessary task for improved normalization. With proper normalization for RNA-Seq, we expect to achieve results that are on par with microarray in terms of robustness.

Some limitations of the current study relate to sample size, and the use of only the ‘directed’ part of the gene expression results. Larger sample sizes (typically greater than 10) improve the accuracy of POC scores significantly. However, the collection of larger sample datasets is constrained by the cost of these techniques. Thus careful examination of POC value in studies having lower sample sizes may be required. In these cases, our approach is similar to existing semi-automated approaches. Another limitation that impacts our analysis is the lack of curated network information of all the genes in the genomic data sets. Although this limitation applies to any method of analysis, there appears to be a stronger bias for genes involving directed interactions [51]. Only 25–30% of the genes were used in the path analysis because the remaining genes did not have curated directed information, or no interacting partner could be found in the network. As a result, it is possible that several disease-related genes were excluded from path analysis because they were not part of the directed network. Future work in curating these networks will improve the accuracy of our analysis. Moreover, in future, a more advanced version of our algorithm could include undirected interactions between genes that extend the analytic capabilities of our approach. As indicated earlier, more computational resources would be needed in order to extend our training set beyond the 50 samples – a larger set would be more optimal. The smaller training set in this study may explain, at least in part, the relative lower accuracy of the RNA-Seq predictions.

The POC measure can be adapted to incorporate temporally changing gene expression values. For instance, this measure can be used for studying temporal changes in gene expression values in patients suffering from sepsis, septic shock and SIRS (the data set we used for calibration, for example). Further, the path analysis can be modified to incorporate genes in the network for which no value was reported in the genomic data set. This modification will allow for the discovery of new disease-related genes, which could not have been identified from the genomic data alone. An extension of our approach can enable the analysis of microRNA modulations in complex diseases. MicroRNA analyses are typically performed independent of the functional analysis. The influence of microRNA on gene expression levels is analogous to that of a hub on its interacting partner. The path analysis algorithm can be extended to include the effect of microRNAs on its immediate interacting partners, which could shed light on how these changes shape the complex disease network.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

We have developed a new automated methodology to uncover biomarkers for complex disease conditions by identifying concomitant gene expression changes with direct regulatory interaction along paths. The breast cancer biomarkers that were selected using our methodology are able to differentiate samples in microarray and RNA-Seq data sets into breast cancer subtypes with promising accuracy and precision. Further extensions for studying complex interactions between directed and non-directed interacting elements as well as time course studies is planned.
