@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As information and communication technology has evolved, data exchange has always been an essential and important process. People exchange signals, messages, or data files with each other. The relatively recent emergence of mobile devices has changed our life-style in general. People using mobile devices such as smartphones or tablet computers are constantly creating data. The popularity and mobility of mobile devices have made the exchange of data more convenient [1]. The traditional limitations of mobile devices (e.g., low computing power, limited memory and storage space, or insufficient battery life) have been mitigated with the advent of cloud computing, remote storage, and application services. Various built-in data transmission mechanisms (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, and Near Field Communication [NFC]) also facilitate the easy exchange of data between mobile devices. However, in a local wireless communication network, data exchange between mobile devices is performed as a peer-to-peer communication [2]. Each mobile device is considered as a candidate, and each has a different hardware status (e.g., central processing unit [CPU] loading, memory usage, storage space, battery life, Wi-Fi signal strength, etc.) which may affect the performance of the data exchange. The selection of a reasonable mobile device with sufficient computing resources to facilitate round-robin data exchange is an interesting process worth exploring.

Real-world problems are typically hard to resolve because uniquely optimal solutions do not exist, so the condition and relevant status of the decision-maker are used to differentiate between solutions. In this study, we focus on the mobile device's system profile which indicates the status of a variety of factors, any or all of which may influence the data exchange performance between mobile devices. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) [3] is one approach to solving multi-dimensional problems. MDCA can support decision making by resolving problems encountered when selecting between various candidates. To enhance MCDA effectiveness in a round-robin data exchange scenario, an adaptive mechanism is employed to store previous rounds’ results, to evaluate the current context status, and to adaptively adjust parameters for the next selection round. Status item are the criteria which are evaluated via the multi-criteria decision analysis method to rank the candidates in order. The ranking order supports the decision-making process for selecting a reasonable candidate.

To date, mobile operating systems have yet to include a built-in, automatic optimal selection mechanism to assist data exchange between devices. Users are therefore required to carry out a device-by-device selection process for each round of data exchange. However, because hardware statuses vary among mobile device systems, evaluating user selection time is an NP problem, and it depends on user preferences or considerations. This study proposes an optimal mobile device selection approach for round-robin data exchange via the monitoring of the hardware status of each mobile device's system profile. The approach can be implemented as a built-in system mechanism that does not require user intervention. At the completion of each data exchange round, an adaptive function adjusts the criteria evaluation in order to obtain a more adaptive ranking order of candidate mobile devices for the next round. The contribution of this study is to provide an approach which is easily implemented in a mobile device and can always select the optimal candidate device during a round-robin data exchange in a local wireless communication network.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related studies. Section 3 presents a new approach for round-robin data exchange over a mobile wireless communication network. A case study is detailed in Section 4, and the experiments and a relevant discussion are contained in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions.

This section contains a review of related literature, including studies on mobile data exchange and multi-criteria decision-making.

Various built-in data transmission mechanisms such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Juxtapose (JXTA) have been designed to support data exchange between mobile devices [2]. Cao et al. [4] proposed a blood glucose monitoring system using Bluetooth and a 3G mobile phone network. The system automatically detects the real-time blood glucose status of diabetic patients, which is immediately transmitted to a monitoring center via Bluetooth transmission protocols. If a patient's status is abnormal, their mobile phone's GPS is used to obtain their location, and the proposed system sends an alert to the monitoring center. Kim and Jung [5] used Wi-Fi Direct to implement a “smart meeting” Android application called CyberOffice, which facilitates presentations even when beam projectors and computers are unavailable. Lin et al. [6,7] used SIP to construct a distance education system for m-learning. Rajkumar et al. [8] used JXTA/JXME to design a healthcare management system for mobile streaming applications, which allows patients and healthcare workers to exchange messages and transmit data over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Tsai et al. [9] designed a mobile social software (MoSoSo) based on a P2P network architecture using Juxtapose (JXTA) and Juxtapose for Java MicroEdition (JXME). This MoSoSo application allows students to exchange data using mobile devices. Barolli et al. [10] proposed a JXTA-based P2P platform designed to utilize the capabilities of Java, JXTA and P2P technologies to support distributed and collaborative systems. The platform communicates with remote devices via JXTA, and controls a learning environment for more effective learning.

In exploring data security, some studies have used symmetric encryption methods to encrypt data and enhance the security of mobile data exchange. Qian et al. [11] used data encryption standards (DES) and chaotic encryption to design a new image encryption schema for protected image security and reliability. Arnedo-Moreno et al. [12] explored the security of JXTA-based applications and found that the message transmitted in the protocol should be encrypted with DES in advance in order to ensure the security of the transmission process. Cheng et al. [13] produced an authentication image using the HMAC One Time Password algorithm (HOTP) and mobile system time for user identification authentication. The authentication image was encrypted with DES to protect against data counterfeiting. Since some form of security mechanism is always required in a mobile transmission environment, this study uses symmetric encryption to protect the exchanged data.

Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is useful when the problem has multiple alternative solutions [14]. MCDA is divided into two categories based on the property or attribute of a solution. One is multi-objective decision-making (MODM), and the other is multi-attribute decision-making (MADM). Multi-attribute decision analysis selects specific attributes from available solutions to make a decision. Işıklar et al. [15] examined the current mobile phone market in general to determine how to achieve the most accurate decision when purchasing a phone. Denguir-Rekik et al. [16] proposed a ‘‘Feedback Based Diagnosis System” (FBDS): a multi-criteria decision making support system designed to help marketers analyze cyber consumers’ feedback and/or evaluations gathered via classic recommendation systems. Xu [17] explored multiple attribute decision-making in a group, and proposed an automated approach to reaching consensus. Chiu et al. [18] designed a hybrid Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) model, combining the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP), and VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) methods to solve a customer satisfaction issue caused by interdependence and feedback problems among dimensions and criteria in an e-store business.

Multi-attribute decision analysis includes the Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality method (ELECTRE), the Analytic Hierarchy Process method (AHP), Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method [3]. ELECTRE was proposed by Benayoun et al. [19]. The purpose of ELECTRE is to construct the difference between the solutions to facilitate a choice by the decision-maker. ELECTRE methods are developed in two main phases. In the first phase, the outranking relations are constructed for a comprehensive comparison of each pair of actions. In the second phase, the recommendations are elaborated from the results obtained by an exploitation procedure from the first phase. The nature of the recommendation depends on the problems: choosing, ranking or sorting. Liu et al. [20] used ELECTRE to evaluate segment risk. Afshari et al. [21] applied ELECTRE methods to seven criteria for selecting the best personnel. Chi et al. [22] modified the ELECTRE method to address the problem of comparison when the threshold is too high. Ke and Wu [23] used a utility-based ELECTRE method to select an optimal solution for a problem-solving process, while Ke and Chen [24] used a utility-based ELECTRE method for selecting an optimal solution in a message negotiation process.

This section describes an approach for the selection of mobile devices in terms of adaptive multi-criteria decision analysis, including mobile device profile formalization, a relational utility model [25,26], selection order discovery via a modified ELECTRE method [22–24], and an adaptive mechanism for round-robin data exchange.

The procedure of the proposed approach is shown in Fig. 1
                     . At the start of a round for a round-robin data exchange, mobile devices in a local wireless network are identified as candidates for selection. A selection order is discovered via multi-criteria decision analysis (MDCA), and a suitable mobile device is recommended. The initiating mobile device exchanges data with the recommended mobile device. The status of the recommended mobile device is evaluated, and an adaptive mechanism is applied to adjust an adaptive parameter for device selection in the next round of data exchange to complete the current round.

Mobile device profile formalization is an initial task in the proposed selection approach. A utility-based reputation model [25,26] is used to formalize the status items of a mobile device profile. Let

Once the mobile device profile formalization is complete and a relational utility model is applied, the mobile device will obtain the expected value of the status item of interest. Based on various status items of interest, selecting the most suitable mobile device from a large number of candidates requires multi-criteria decision analysis.

For the second task, this study modifies an ELECTRE method [22–24] to discover the selection order for candidate actions. The first reason for using the ELECTRE method is that the data exchange process is round-robin. While the ingenious and complex AHP might have served as an alternative, the hierarchies defined in the AHP typically involve significant discussion, research, and discovery by the participants involved, making it unsuitable for this study. The second reason for employing the ELECTRE method is that, although there are many good MCDM methods (e.g., TOPSIS and PROMETHEE [27]), Aruldoss et al. [28] noted that the ELECTRE method is useful for solving the issues inherent in environmental valuation and environmental management. Mobile device selection in a round-robin process is similar to animal behavior in conditions in which an environmental iteration is driving the decision to select a desirable solution. For example, turning of the seasons causes changes in the weather which induces humans or animals to migrate or select a more desirable natural habitat. The selected natural habitat may differ based on various environmental factors. ELECTRE methods selects the best alternative via pairwise comparison of all alternatives within the decision problem. Therefore, the ELECTRE-based approach is useful for solving the issues inherent in environmental valuation. In the natural world, each migration of the human or animal provides clues that can be used to prepare for the next migration. The ELECTRE-based approach also retains certain clues which can be used to prepare for the next mobile device selection, which assists in the environmental management.

If there are p candidate mobile devices which involve q status items, the matrix Q of expected utility values can be shown as Eq. (2).

This section introduces a modified ELECTRE method to monitor the system profile of a mobile device. A utility model formalizes the status items in the system profile in order to construct an expected utility matrix, which presents the status items as the criteria to be evaluated. For Steps 1–9, the approach discovers the ranking order of candidate mobile device support in order to select a suitable mobile device for data exchange. After the data is exchanged, Steps 10–12 employ an adaptive mechanism to store the previous selection round's results, evaluate the status items of the current mobile devices, and adjust an adaptive matrix for the next selection round.

Based on the experiments of previous studies, the current study extends the functionality of mobile service with the proposed implementation of an optimal mobile device selection approach. This section presents a case study detailing the steps of that approach.

First, the hardware property statuses of mobile devices’ profiles are obtained, including battery life, storage usage, memory usage, central processor unit (CPU) usage, and Wi-Fi signal strength. The experiment uses five mobile devices as the selection candidates. The status item values are shown in Table 1.
                        
                     

The status item values in Table 1 are transformed into a matrix T, as shown in Eq. (14):

This case study describes how a modified ELECTRE method can be used to monitor mobile device system profiles. A utility model formalizes the status items in the system profile to compile an expected utility matrix, which presents the status items as the criteria to be evaluated. In Steps 1–9, the approach discovers the ranking order of candidate mobile devices in order to select a suitable device for the data exchange. After the data is exchanged, Steps 10–12 apply an adaptive mechanism to store the results of the previous round, evaluate the status items of the current mobile devices, and adjust an adaptive matrix for the next selection round.

Current mobile operating systems do not yet have a built-in automatic optimal selection mechanism to facilitate the exchange of data between mobile devices in a local wireless communication network. Users must therefore perform a device-by-device selection process for each round of data exchange. This study proposed an optimal mobile device selection approach which monitors the hardware status of the mobile device system profile in order to facilitate round-robin data exchange. The approach can be implemented as a built-in system mechanism requiring no user intervention. This section describes some experiments and discusses the process of data exchange between candidate mobile devices in a collaborative sharing environment.

This study has conducted experiments involving various aspects of mobile data exchange described in the relevant literature [1,2,29]. The data transmission mechanisms, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Juxtapose (JXTA), used between mobile devices for data exchange in a mobile wireless data communication network were presented in [2]. Mobile device management methods, including central policy, access control, and mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) network, used between mobile devices for data exchange in a mobile P2P network were described in [1]. Security issues were also discussed in [29], including the advanced encryption standard (AES), triple data encryption standard (Triple-DES), and data encryption standard (DES). The current study conducted experiments to evaluate a candidate recommendation ranking order via the VIKOR, TOPSIS and ELECTRE methods. Since the hardware status of candidate mobile devices varies, this study created a simulation mode to retain the hardware status of each candidate mobile device. The experiments in the simulation mode compared the recommendation effectiveness of the chosen methods. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3.
                        
                     

The results indicate that if a user wants to exchange data with the best candidate mobile device, the VIKOR, TOPSIS and ELECTRE methods all recommend the same candidate. For example, in Round 1, mobile device {2} is unanimously recommended as the best candidate for data exchange; in Round 2, device {3} is unanimously recommended. The recommended best candidate mobile device from each MDCA method also matches the expected top ranking device, based on the evaluation of the hardware status of each candidate. This study employed the ELECTRE method, in accordance with Aruldoss et al.’s [28] suggestion that the ELECTRE method is useful for solving the issues inherent in environmental valuation and environmental management. The pseudocode of the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 2.
                        
                     

Based on the three studies noted above [1,2,29], this study constructed an experimental platform for the implementation of relevant services or approaches. The development environment used Google Android SDK 4.0.3, Google Android Development Tools (ADT) version 20.0.3 (Google, 2012), Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.7, and Eclipse Classic version 4.2.1. The test platform for the experiment was an Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF201. Time was measured in seconds. The sizes of test data were 1MB, 10MB, 20MB, 50MB, 100MB and 200MB. File size was measured in megabytes. Text was the data file type used. The optimal mobile device selection approach proposed in this study was also implemented in this experimental platform for testing and evaluation. Fig. 3
                         shows the three test platforms preparing for data transmission.


                        Table 4
                         shows the comparison of the transmission times of JXTA protocols in experiments with these three devices.

In Rounds 1–3, the transmission speed of Device A was greater than that of Device B, and that of Device B was greater than that of Device C. In Rounds 4 and 5, the transmission speed of Device A was greater than that of Device C, and that of Device C was greater than that of Device B. It is inferred that some system jobs resulted in heavy loading on Device B, slowing down its data transmission rate. In Round 6, the transmission speed of Device A was greater than that of Device B, and that of Device B was greater than that of Device C. It is inferred that Device B had finished some jobs and recovered its normal data transmission rate. The experiment results show that system jobs may influence a device's data transmission rate. The proposed approach can be used to improve round-robin data exchange performance.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Barolli et al. [10] employed JXTA in a P2P platform for file resource sharing between heterogeneous devices. The peer group mechanism strengthens the security of data exchange and collaborative processing. The advertisement of a peer group shows service and file resource sharing in the platform. A peer in the peer group can query the desired service or file resource index. The peer can then access the support service or file resource. In this study, the experiments demonstrate that the JXTA protocol provides more functionality in Android-based smart devices, including transmission from one device to another, and from one device to multiple devices. The experiment results in [2] suggest that the transmission speed of Wi-Fi Direct is faster than that of JXTA, and that JXTA is faster than Bluetooth. Based on the characteristics of various data transmission protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and Juxtapose (JXTA), JXTA is suitable for mobile P2P data transmission. In mobile peer-to-peer networks, data transmission may require some form of management mechanism. The role-based access control model is suitable for this. The central policy defines rules regarding user, role, permission and session. The device follows the RBAC model to achieve optimal data transmission between discrete mobile devices [1]. The security issue is worth exploring. AES is a suitable cryptographic technology for mobile P2P networks, particularly since its processing speed has been shown to be faster than that of either DES or Triple-DES [29].

This study employed the ELECTRE method for several reasons. First, the data exchange process in this study is round-robin, rendering the AHP method unsuitable because of the significant participant involvement required to define its complex hierarchies. Second, among the many available MCDM methods, the ELECTRE method has been shown to be useful for solving environmental valuation and environmental management issues [28]. As noted earlier, the selection of a mobile device in a round-robin process is similar to animal behavior changing environmental conditions which prompt a search for a more suitable habitat. Various factors determine which environment is selected as the more desirable habitat. Since the ELECTRE-based approach selects the best alternative via pairwise comparison of all alternatives, it is useful for solving environmental valuation issues. As in the natural world where certain clues are retained from one migration to the next, the ELECTRE-based approach also retained clues that facilitate the selection of the next mobile device. As such, this study provides an optimal approach to mobile device selection for a round-robin data exchange.

Since current mobile operating systems still lack built-in automatic optimal selection mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of data between devices, the users themselves must carry out a device-by-device selection process for each round of data exchange. The hardware status varies from one mobile device to another, making the evaluation of user selection time an NP problem which depends on user preferences or considerations. The approach proposed in this study can be implemented as a built-in system mechanism requiring no user intervention.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The contribution of this study is to provide an optimal mobile device selection approach for round-robin data exchange in a local wireless network. This approach is based on monitoring the hardware status in the system profile of each candidate mobile device. Hardware status was found to have a significant influence on data transmission time between mobile devices in different rounds. Based on the experimental results, the proposed approach can be used to improve the data transmission time of JXTA protocols in multiple devices. A case study implementing optimal mobile device selection approach step by step demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method. As a built-in system mechanism, the approach requires no user intervention. Future work will focus on the influence of mobile system hardware interruption, since such an interruption can cause a system to crash and stop the data exchange process.
