@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Queueing network (Jackson, 1957; Walrand, 1988) models are extremely relevant to modern communication systems, systems of data processing, etc. Most queueing network models consider Poisson arrivals and/or exponential services. However, it is known (Heyman & Lucantoni, 2003) that the Poisson arrival model is adequate for real streams of customers in only a few cases. More relevant streams can be defined using the Markovian arrival process (MAP) (Lucantoni, 1991; Neuts, 1979). For more information about queueing networks, see Walrand (1988) or the introduction of work (Massey & Whitt, 1993). For more information about MAP, see Chakravarthy (2010).

In this paper, we consider an open queueing network with MAP and general service time distributions at network nodes. The number of servers at each network node is infinite. Such models cannot be applied directly to real systems in most cases, but results of their analysis can be used to obtain some characteristics of real systems while using only a limited number of servers. For example, in Section 7, we estimated the optimal number of servers that guarantees a customer loss probability that is below a given level. For more information about analysis of finite-server networks and models with losses see Alnowibet and Perros (2009), Izady and Worthington (2011), Shi (1995). Some results on infinite-server models can be found in Holman, Chaudhry, and Kashyap (1983); Machihara (1986); Massey and Whitt (1993); Smith (1972).

Analysis of the model is performed under the asymptotic condition of growing fundamental rate of arrivals. This condition can be considered as one of the heavy-traffic conditions (Iglehart & Whitt, 1970; Kingman, 1962; Reiman, 1984). We obtain a Gaussian approximation for the stationary multi-dimensional distribution of the number of customers at network nodes (Section 5.3). This result successfully correlates with well-known results of diffusion approximations (Borovkov, 1967; Iglehart, 1965). However, the proposed approach allows for more accurate (but not Gaussian) approximations using high-order asymptotic derivations (see Section 5.4).

The mathematical model of the queueing network considered is described in Section 2.

In Section 3, the main method of analysis – multi-dimensional dynamic screening – is presented. The main difference between the proposed method and conventional methods is the change in the direct study of the multi-dimensional process of the network states in that the analysis of another (screened) process is used that is specially constructed to be more simple for investigations as well as adequate for the original process under study. Kolmogorov equations are derived for the screened process in Section 4.

The solutions of the derived Kolmogorov equations are obtained under the asymptotic condition of infinite growth of arrival rate (Section 5). It is shown that the number of customers at network nodes can be approximated by multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Parameters of this distribution are derived in Section 5.3. In Section 5.4, the third-order asymptotic approximation is presented. This approximation is more accurate than the Gaussian one but it has some limitations. The problems and discussions about the applicability of the obtained approximations are presented in the conclusion.

Numerical results are presented in Section 6. They validate the applicability of the obtained approximations and also enable the determination of the applicability range.

The problem of determining the optimal number of servers at the network nodes is presented in Section 7. The results obtained for the infinite-server network are applied to the finite-servers model with customer loss. Optimal number is the minimal number of servers at each network node that guarantees that the probability of customer loss is not more than a given value.
                  

Consider a queueing network with K nodes. Each node is a queueing system with an infinite number of servers. A customer that arrives at the network enters into the kth node for service with probability vk
                     , where 
                        
                           k
                           =

                     . All servers at one node have independent and identically distributed service times with cumulative distribution functions Bk
                     (x), where k is a node number. When the service is completed at the kth node, the customer moves to the node ν with probability rkν
                      or leaves the network with probability r

In Section 5, we will consider the arrival process of the network defined by the matrices in the form N
                     D
                     0 and N
                     D
                     1, where parameter N has a large value (theoretically, we suppose that N → ∞). Therefore, the fundamental rate of this process is equal to Nλ and it grows infinitely while N → ∞. For practical use, we consider values of the parameter N that are large enough.

We cannot perform a direct analysis of the process i(t) for evaluating the queueing network. Therefore, in Section 3, we present a new simplistic method of multi-dimensional dynamic screening, wherein the process i(t) is analyzed by means of studying another stochastic process that is specially constructed for its analysis. This method was successfully applied for analyzing a network with renewal arrivals (Nazarov & Moiseev, 2013a).

Direct analysis of the multi-dimensional non-Markovian process i(t) is very difficult when considering a queueing network. Therefore, we use a special technique of analysis – multi-dimensional dynamic screening (Nazarov & Moiseev, 2013a). We introduce the basic principles of this method here.

                      time axes (Fig. 1) that are numbered from 0 to K. Let us mark 0 on the axis as the epochs of customers’ arrivals. The axes with numbers from 1 to K correspond to the nodes of the network. On these axes, we mark the events of the screened point processes for which generations are defined as follows.

Let the network be empty at some time moment t
                     0. Let us fix some time moment T > t
                     0. Consider a customer that arrives at the network at the moment t where t
                     0 < t < T. Denote by S
                     0(t) a probability that the customer departs from the network before the moment T and by Sk
                     (t) the probability that the customer is served at the kth node at the moment T (for all k from 1 to K). It is obvious that

                     Here, 
                        θ
                      is a probability distribution that determines the state of the underlying Markov chain of arrival process at the initial instant t
                     0. In this paper, we use θ equal to the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov chain because the object of our investigation is a stationary regime of the network evolution. Therefore, we assume that θ satisfies the system of linear equations (1).

Problem (6), (7) cannot be solved directly by using matrix exponent because the matrices D and D
                     1 are not commutative: D · D
                     1 ≠ D
                     1 · D. There are some approaches for obtaining a solution to this problem, e.g., the Magnus expansion (Magnus, 1954). In this paper, we use another approach for obtaining the solution to the problem (6), and in the expansion form, (7). These expansions seem similar in a quick view, but properties of the solution in the Magnus expansion form are required for a detailed study; this can be an objective for future work.

In this section, we will obtain an asymptotic solution for problem (6), (7) under the asymptotic condition that the fundamental rate of arrivals grows. To do this, we make the following substitutions in Eq. (6): N
                     D
                     0 instead of the matrix D
                     0 and N
                     D
                     1 instead of the matrix D
                     1. Thus, we obtain the matrix differential equation

                     Here, N is the parameter that grows infinitely, and therefore, the value of the fundamental rate of the arrival process Nλ grows infinitely too. The initial condition for this asymptotic problem is the same as expression (7).

In the subsections below, we obtain two asymptotic approximations for the function h(u, t) when the value of the parameter N is large enough. We name these approximations as the first-order and the second-order asymptotic solutions. The first approximation provides the estimation of the means of the multi-dimensional stochastic process under study. The second one provides the estimation for the variance and covariance of the process components. In Section 5.4, we consider asymptotic analysis of the third order, which provides more accurate results.

Consider the asymptotic condition of high-rate arrivals: N → ∞. Let us make the following changes to the variables in problem (8), (7):

                        Stage 1. Let ε → 0 in Eq. (10). We obtain the following equation

                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       f
                                       1
                                    
                                    
                                       (
                                       w
                                       ,
                                       t
                                       )
                                    
                                    D
                                    =

                        Comparing this equation with the first one in system (1), we can draw a conclusion that the function f
                        1(w, t) can be represented in the form

Substituting this expression into (24), we obtain the final form of the function f
                        2(w, t) as expression (21). The theorem is thus proved.

Let us make in formula (21) substitutions that are inverse to changes (18). Using expression (16), we obtain the following expression for the vector characteristic function h(u, t) of the probability distribution of the number of events in the multi-dimensional screened process n(t) that occurred before the time moment t (see Section 3):

In practice, we cannot use the real Gaussian distribution for approximation of the number of customers because Gaussian variables can be negative. In addition to this, the number of customers is a discrete variable. Therefore, we must cut all negative values from Gaussian distribution, perform discretization and then normalize the result so that the total probability is equal to 1. Such a distribution is called as normalized non-negative discrete Gaussian distribution and the approximation constructed on this distribution is named as the second-order approximation or, for simplicity, the Gaussian approximation.

Using the technique described for the asymptotic analysis, we can obtain more accurate approximations for the distribution of the number of customers at the network nodes in the stationary regime. In this section, we present the analytical results of the third-order asymptotic analysis without any derivations because they are too long.

The formula for the third-order approximation h
                        (3)(u) for the characteristic function h(u) of the number of customers at the network nodes in the stationary regime is as follows:

To construct the approximation based on formula (28), we must find the inverse Fourier transform for this expression, then cut negative values, perform discretization, and normalize the result. We then name the resulting multi-dimensional distribution as the third-order approximation of the number of customers at the network nodes.

To determine the accuracy of the obtained approximations, we performed simulations of the networks’ evolution for numerous concrete examples of the networks and then we compared their results with values obtained from approximations (27) and (28). Here, we introduce one example that demonstrates the properties of the approximations.

We choose the fourth node of the network for the demonstration of basic results. This node is interesting because the average number of customers in the stationary regime of the network’s evolution is approximately equal to N. Therefore, using the results for this network node, we can demonstrate the main properties of the obtained Gaussian approximation (27) and the third-order approximation (28) for various values of the parameter N.


                     Fig. 2
                      demonstrates the marginal probability distributions of the number of customers that are constructed on both simulation results and analytically calculated values of obtained approximations for values of parameter N equal to 1, 5, 10, and 20. These values were chosen as well-demonstrating of the general trend of the approximation.

We characterize the accuracy of the approximations using the Kolmogorov distance (Kolmogorov, 1933), which has the following form for discrete distribution:

                      is the empiric distribution of the number of customers at the network node based on the results of the system evolution simulation.

Values of the Kolmogorov distances d
                     2 for the Gaussian approximation and d
                     3 for the third-order approximation are presented in Table 1
                      for various values of the parameter N. We can see that the growth of the arrivals rate (parameter N) causes the approximations to be more accurate. If we suppose that Kolmogorov distances less than 0.05 are applicable, we can draw a conclusion that the Gaussian approximation is applicable for values of the parameter N (or, in other words, the average number of customers in the node) equal to 10 or more, and the third-order approximation is applicable for values N ≥ 1.

It is easy to see that the third-order asymptotic approximation is more accurate than the Gaussian one. The Kolmogorov distance for the third-order approximation is less than that for the Gaussian one by up to 3 times and it is applicable (Kolmogorov distance less than 0.05) already for values N ≥ 1. Therefore, the third-order approximation decreases the low bound of the approximations applicability down to about 10 times. On the other hand, the calculation of the third-order approximation is more complicated than the Gaussian one and there is no reason to apply it for large values of the parameter N (e.g. for N ≥ 20).

The infinite-server queueing models are not exactly adequate for real systems because in practical usage we deal with finite numbers in most cases. However, we can use the results obtained in the relevant studies for models with a finite number of servers.

Let us consider a network with loss of customers. When such real systems are under construction, we would like to guarantee that the probability of customer loss is below some given level while using the minimal possible number of servers. Denote the given admissible maximum of the probability of the customers’ loss by ploss
                     . Let us find minimal numbers of servers

                      we call as the optimal number of servers for the entire network.

We consider the stationary regime of the network evolution. Therefore, we can use the multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution (27) for approximation of the multi-dimensional distribution of the number of customers at the network nodes.

The problem of calculation of the probability that a Gaussian vector falls into the hyperellipsoid with the uniform density was studied in the paper Nazarov and Moiseev (2013b). Here, we describe basic results and calculate optimal number of servers for numerical examples from Section 6.

Let us consider the hyperellipsoid, which is defined by the following matrix equation of dimension m:

                      we obtain r ≈ 4.297.

We obtained the approximation of the stationary distribution of the number of customers at the nodes of the queueing network

                                 (
                                 G
                                 I
                                 /
                                 ∞
                                 )

                      under the condition of high-rate arrivals. It is shown that this distribution can be approximated by the multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with means and covariance matrix that are derived in the paper (Section 5.3). Numerical results show that this approximation has enough accuracy for marginal distributions of number of customers at each node of the network when the average number of customers in the node is about 10 or more.

In Section 5.4, the higher order approximation is presented. This approximation is more accurate than the Gaussian one and it is applicable when the average number of customers in the node is about 1 or more. Therefore, in this case, we can talk about non-asymptotic applicability of the approximation.

A problem of the application of the obtained results is considered in Section 7. The results derived for the infinite-server network are applied to obtain the optimal number of servers at the network nodes with limited number of servers and with loss of customers. These optimal numbers guarantee that the probability of customer loss at any node of the network is not more than a given value.

The obtained Gaussian approximation is more simple to use both as an approximation of the distribution and also for calculation of the optimal number of servers. On the other hand, the higher-order approximations give more accurate results and can be applicable in case the rate of arrivals does not have a large value. These facts should be taken into account when we choose the approximation formulas.

Similar results were obtained for networks with renewal (Nazarov & Moiseev, 2013a) and semi-Markov arrivals (Moiseev, 2015).
