                  Flows with suspended particles is a challenging task and important in many applications such as sedimentation, rheology and fluidized suspensions. The coupling between the suspending liquid flow and the particles’ motion is the central point in the complete understanding of the phenomena that occur in these applications. Finite Element/Fictitious Domain is an important class of method used to solve this problem. In this work we propose a simple object oriented implementation for simulations of flows with suspended particles in the plane using the Fictitious Domain method together with Lagrange multipliers to solve the Navier–Stokes and rigid body equations with a fully implicitly and fully coupled Finite Element approach. To have an efficient implementation for Fictitious Domain/Finite Element method, we introduce a new topological data structure that is concise in terms of storage and very suitable for searching the elements of the mesh intersected by the particles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Flows with suspended rigid particles occur in many different applications, from sedimentation problems to the manufacturing of ordered monolayer of micro and nano particles. The evolution of the particles position is a central point in the complete understanding of the flow of these suspensions. One way of analyzing the flow is to use a moving grid to discretize the Navier–Stokes equations that wraps around all suspended particles. This method requires remeshing and is not very efficient in the case of many particles. An alternative is the Fictitious Domain approach that was first proposed by Glowinski et al. [1], latter improved by Goano et al. [2] and recently extended to handle particle flotation by Lage et al. [3]. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved on a fixed mesh and the particles move over it. This approach avoids the need to remesh around the rigid particles, solving the entire problem on a single fixed mesh. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved on the entire domain, but inside each particle, the flow is constrained to be a rigid body motion using Lagrange multipliers.

The implementation of particle flows methods based on Fictitious Domain/Finite Element is quite complex, since the degrees of freedom associated with each individual particle (linear and angular velocities) cannot be written in terms of elemental degrees of freedom. Moreover, the governing equations changes as the overlap of particles over finite elements varies during the flow. Therefore, an efficient implementation requires a topological data structure to optimize the searching procedure of the mesh elements intersected by the suspended particles in the fluid flow simulation. This detection is fundamental to identify where the Lagrange multipliers are active or not in the Fictitious Domain/Finite Element method [2].


                     Contributions: In this work, we present an object-oriented implementation for the 2D Fictitious Domain/Finite Element method using non-structured meshes with triangular and quadrangular elements. The use of object-oriented programming (OOP) has been recognized as an useful coding technique for scientific computing [4–7] and in particular for Finite Element Methods [8–16]. This implementation uses important concepts of OOP, such as modularization, inheritance and encapsulation. As a consequence we provide a simple interface to the data structures and algorithms required to simulate particle flows.

To have an efficient implementation for the 2D Fictitious Domain/Finite Element method using Lagrange multipliers, we also propose a new topological data-structure, called Compact Tri-Quad Representation, that gives a suitable balance between time and memory complexity for modeling a hybrid 2D mesh. Other data structures have been proposed in the literature in order to reduce the memory use on Finite Element Method implementations [17]. The Compact Tri-Quad Representation’s main characteristic is the conciseness in terms of storage without loosing its efficiency to answer adjacency and incidence relations queries. To answer such queries among the topological entities of the mesh (faces, edges and vertices), this data structure uses integer tables (implemented as containers) and integer formulas to implicitly represent some adjacency and incidence relations.


                     Paper outline: The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Ficticious Domain formulation for fluid flow simulations with suspended particles. Section 3 presents the Compact Tri-Quad Representation data structure. Section 4 proposes the object oriented framework for a simple implementation for the 2D Fictitious Domain/Finite Element method. Section 5 shows the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes this work by making some remarks and suggestions for future developments.

                        Formulation review:
                      In this paper, we propose a programming approach to simulate flows with suspended rigid body particles using the formulation presented by Lage et al. [3]. Here, we briefly review the differential formulation of the problem.

To efficiently handle with the topological relationship between particles and mesh elements, which is the basic query needed to implement fully coupled particle flow simulations based on Fictitious Domain methods, we propose a new topological data structure to represent the simulation domain that we call Compact Tri-Quad Representation or simply

                     , several modifications have been proposed in order to extend the range of objects to be modeled. Among those, Braid [19] introduced the concept of loop and Mäntylä [20] defined the Half-Edge data structure. Guibas and Stolfi [21] proposed a generalization to include non-orientable 2-manifolds implemented as the Quad-Edge data structure. Lopes [22] defined the Handle-Edge, a data structure that extends the Mäntylä’s Half-Edge to represent explicitly the boundary of a combinatorial surface.

According to Brisson [23], a topological data structure can model the objects using an explicit or an implicit representation of cells. The Quad-Edge and the Facet-Edge do not explicitly represents each cell, while the Winged-Edge, the Half-Edge, the Handle-Edge are examples of data structures with explicit representation of cells. Another widely used dimension-independent data structure with an explicit representation is the Indexed Data Structure with Adjacencies by Paoluzzi et al. [24].

Traditional non-manifold models are also very common in Finite Element applications, but usually for simulation of structures. Weiler [25] was the first to propose a non-manifold data structure, called Radial-Edge. After that, several modifications have been suggested to deal with specific applications. Some substantial contributions to non-manifolds representation include the works of Wu [26,27], Yamaguchi and Kimura [28], Gursoz [29], Rossignac and O’Connor [30], Cavalcanti et al. [31], and Lee and Lee [32]. More recently, de Floriani and Hui [33] presented a very concise data structure for non-manifold manipulation, called NMIA, which is an extension of the Indexed data structure with adjacencies, and Pesco et al. proposed the Handle-Cell 
                     [34], which is an extension of the Handle-Edge, to deal with general 2-dimensional cell complexes. All the above structures represent the cells explicitly.

The data structures cited above are very suitable to represent unstructured meshes on Finite Element Method implementations, but they are not efficient in terms of memory costs. Thus, the development of concise data structures has been recognized as an important challenge [17]. In this context, Rossignac et al. [35] proposed a concise data structure, called Corner-Table, which uses only two tables of integers and a set of rules to represent triangular surfaces; and, Espinha et al. [17] introduced a concise data structure for tetrahedral meshes.

The CTQR data structure has been created to represent 2-manifolds. It extends the Corner-Table 
                        [35] by its ability to deal with hybrid 2D meshes [36], composed by triangles and quadrangles, and at the same time can be considered as a concise version of the Handle-Edge 
                        [37]. It uses generic containers instead of pointers or static arrays. Similarly to the Corner-Table, it explicitly represents a few adjacencies and incidence relations between cells and uses a set of rules to obtain the others. However, CTQR has a very different and important characteristic that is a low memory consumption without loosing the efficiency in terms of computational complexity of the topological queries.

                         data structure uses the concept of half-edge 
                        [20] (see Fig. 2
                        ) to represent the association of a face (2D-element) with one of its bounding edges, or equivalently the association of this edge with one of its vertices. Any access to the elements of a face is performed through its half-edges, denoted by 
                           
                              he

                         represents triangles and quadrangles by storing the starting vertex of each half-edge. The half-edges, the vertices and the faces are indexed by non-negative integers. Each face is represented, according to its type, by 3 or 4 consecutive half-edges that define its orientation. The indexing rules for the half-edges are the following: all half-edges belonging to faces of the same type (triangle or quadrangle) comes in sequence, and half-edges of triangle come before the quadrangle ones.

The association of each half-edge

                         is on the boundary or not.

It is important to observe that classical FEM implementations can use also two-dimensional arrays (one for quadrangles and other for triangles) to represent the connectivity of an specified element with its neighbor in the mesh [38,39]. The first index of the two-dimensional array is the register of an edge in an element (oriented in counterclockwise direction, for example) and the second index is the identifier of the element. The value stored in each entry of these arrays is an element identifier.

The Extra Vertex Container is very important since it optimizes not only the vertex star computation (we will define the vertex star later), but also the boundary traversal. Many simple numerical operators such as derivative, are based on the computation of the star of a vertex and the elements on the boundary are very important to represent the boundary conditions.

                         is the number of edges on the mesh. Explicit edge representation is essential in many applications. In computer graphics, simplification algorithms based on edge collapses usually need an additional data structure to store the collapse coast of each edge [40]. Using

                         this information may be stored on the edge map. In finite elements codes, some well know kind of elements (such as biquadratic quadrangular elements) needs to represent degrees of freedom defined over the element edges, which may be easier handled if an explicit representation of the edges is provided [38].

The boundary of a combinatorial 2-manifold is a set of combinatorial 1-manifolds without boundary, i.e., a set of closed simple curves. In Finite Elements/Fictitious Domain methods, the explicit knowledge of the boundary curves of the simulation domain is very important to the imposition of boundary conditions and to the build efficient particle-boundary collision algorithms. In CTQR, such representation is done by storing in the container

All data structures described in the introduction of this section provide different trade-offs between memory usage and time complexity of basic operations such as identifying a topological entity, accessing its vertices, computing its stars, etc. When handling huge amount of data, a programmer has always to balance the memory consumption with the time complexity. We compared CTQR with the Handle-Edge 
                        [22] and the Corner-Table 
                        [35]. We choose these two data structures because CTQR is a concise representation of the first and an extension of the second. From this point, we assume that the object has

                         triangular faces. For the memory comparisons, we will only consider the memory used to store the topological information.

To represent the topology of this triangular mesh, the Handle-Edge uses 4 pointers per face, 13 pointers per edge and 4 pointers per vertex. To estimate the memory consumption of the model in terms of the number of vertices we can use the Euler characteristic formula:

                        ] containers. We also notice here, that the classical FEM implementations using the data structures 
                           
                              Nodes

                         together with the neighbor representation described in Section 3 have the same time complexity of the Corner-Table since they store equivalent topological information.

Conceptually, the Corner-Table represents only triangles and the Handle-Edge faces with any number of vertices. The CTQR represents meshes with triangles and rectangles, that is suitable for Finite Element Methods implementations using hybrid meshes.

The CTQR and the Corner-Table has a low memory complexity when compared to the Handle-Edge, but they are not adequate to support remeshing operations since they use containers instead of pointers. But remeshing is not necessary for the Finite Element/Fictitious Domain methods.

As a conclusion, we could say that the CTQR proposal gives a suitable balance between time and memory complexity to a hybrid 2D mesh representation.

For the Finite Element/Fictitious Domain implementation, it is also useful to use additional containers to store vertex and face related geometrical and/or physical attributes.

Observe that it is not necessary to define an additional container to represent geometric and physical properties over edges since the edge map

                         can easily be used to store any edge related data.

Our Finite Element computational framework was developed in C++ programming language and uses object oriented design to encapsulate its structuring concepts. In other words, by means of the structuring capabilities of C++, the most important parts of our finite element simulation program are independently designed. In our proposal, the description of meshes, finite element spaces, and linear algebra objects are encapsulated which allows a very modular and reusable approach in programming finite element softwares.

Although some of the concepts proposed in this work are present in [11], the goals of our work are quite different. We did not intend to develop a general propose finite element library. Our aim is to have a simple and reusable Finite Element/Fictitious Domain implementation based on the Lagrange multipliers formulation that can be applied to simulations of flows with suspended particles.

We divide the description of our framework in two stages. Section 4.1 describes the object oriented implementation to simulate problems modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations and Section 4.2 reports its extension to Fictitious Domain applications like flows with suspended particles.

The relationship between the most important structuring concepts used to simulate Newtonian incompressible flows is shown in Fig. 6
                        . In that figure, we use the UML notation to represent these relationships [42]. The description of the classes in this section follows this figure from left to right.


                        
                           Gauss points, FEM basis and Element classes:
                         In our code, the Element class manages the representation of different types of elements that may be used to perform the computation of Navier–Stokes solution.

The representation of an element is based on the definition of its geometry, its local nodes indexation and the numbering of degrees of freedom defined over each node. We adopted the following convention: we first label nodes and degrees of freedom defined over vertices, then the ones over the edges and finally the ones defined over the face. An example of the adopted nodes codification is shown in Fig. 7
                        .

In fact, the indexation of degrees of freedom is closely related with the choice of the finite element approximation space used to compute the unknowns of the problem. Based on the indexation information, the Element class access the FEM basis class, that has the implementation of a collection of static methods with the algebraic definition of different basis functions and also their derivatives computed on the local coordinates 
                           
                              (
                              ξ
                              ,
                              η
                              )
                           
                         defined inside each element. Fig. 7 shows the local coordinate system adopted in our implementation for triangular and quadrangular elements.

We implemented biquadratic and bilinear basis function for quadrangular elements and quadratic and linear functions for triangular elements. Fig. 7 shows, in gray, the nodes used to build the bilinear (for quadrangles) and linear (for triangles) basis functions. The gray nodes together with the white ones are used to define the biquadratic (for quadrangles) and the quadratic (for triangles) basis functions. We observe that, if necessary, other sets of basis functions can be easily added to the FEM basis class.

Finally, the Element class access the Gauss points class that stores constant tables with the definition of Gauss points and weights, represented in the local system of coordinates. The Gauss points are used to perform the numerical integration of the integral terms that appears on the variational formulation of the problem. In our code, its available one table with 9 Gauss points and weights to integrate over the quadrangles and one table with 6 points and weights to be used to approximate integrals defined over triangles. In order to include new sets of Gaussian Quadrature points and weights to the code, the user needs only to define new tables. It is important to note that the Element class does not represent an element of the mesh, which is the goal of the Mesh class.


                        
                           Mesh and Dof Handler classes:
                         The Mesh class is a wrapper to the 
                           
                              CTQR
                           
                         data structure and is used to represent the domain’s mesh discretization. It encapsulates the access to all topological queries among the cells of the mesh. The Mesh class together with the local description of its elements, given by the Element class, makes possible to code the global indexation of the mesh nodes and its degrees of freedom in a table. In other words, the Dof Handler class builds and stores tables of integers with the global indexation of nodes and degrees of freedom and manages their relationship with the local indexation tables, defined on the Element class. For example, given a local node or degree of freedom and the index of an element, Dof Handler answers the global index of this node or degree of freedom and vice versa. Fig. 8
                         shows an example of local–global indexation mapping.

The global indexation is closely related to the sparsity of the Finite Element matrix that describes the discrete version of the system of differential equations to be solved. There are many works that propose improved methods to create the global indexation of nodes and degrees of freedom as the one by Bangerth [11]. The Dof Handler class abstraction creates an interface that makes it possible to change the global numbering algorithm, without affecting the rest of the code.


                        
                           FEM Map class:
                         In finite element codes, the algebraic equations are evaluated in a computational domain that is described using a local system of coordinates. However, it is necessary to map the local and global coordinate system. The FEM Map class is responsible to perform the computations necessary to perform this change of coordinates system, from the local 
                           
                              (
                              ξ
                              ,
                              η
                              )
                           
                         to the global 
                           
                              (
                              x
                              ,
                              y
                              )
                           
                         system using isoparametric mapping.

In practice, the main task managed by this class is, given an element id, to evaluate and cache the previous computed solution for the unknowns, the basis function values over the Gauss points and the inverse of the Jacobian Matrix that describes the change of coordinates from local system of the element to the global physical system.

We observe that those data are only temporarily cached on this class since, as we will see on FEM core class description, the main finite element loop runs over the mesh elements. All data necessary to perform those computations are provided by the Dof Handler class.


                        
                           FEM core class:
                         The central class on our finite element code is the FEM Core class, that derivates from FEM Map. This class manages the main finite element loop: the one in which the non-linear system of differential equations is solved by the Newton’s method, that requires the evaluation of the global Jacobian matrix and residual vector.

The assembly loops are performed over the mesh elements. Given an element, the contribution of its degrees of freedom to the Jacobian matrix (the residue vector) are computed and later added to the matrix (vector). The Jacobian matrix is a sparse squared matrix which size is 
                           
                              #
                              dof
                              ×
                              #
                              dof
                           
                         and the residue vector has dimension 
                           
                              #
                              dof
                           
                        , where 
                           
                              #
                              dof
                           
                         denotes the number of global degrees of freedom on the mesh. An entry 
                           
                              (
                              i
                              ,
                              j

                         on the Jacobian matrix is non-zero if and only if the nodes associated to the degrees of freedom indexes i and j are both incident to at least one element. The assembly of the residue vector is shown in Algorithm 6.

The main simulation loop runs over the time and is responsible to solve Newton’s method at each time step. Once Newton’s method succeeds, the solution is updated and the simulation continues to the next time step. The loop proceeds until it reaches the maximum time or Newton’s method fails.

Observe that the algebraic expressions of the differential equations related to the problem’s physics are implemented in this class. If one needs to develop an even more modular code, these computations can be moved to other class that will inherits FEM core elements and will be the responsible for the physical description of the problem.

The object oriented implementation we developed for Fictitious Domain simulations of flows with particles is quite similar with the one presented in the previous chapter. The main difference is that we need to include a description for the particles and also to maintain updated a search structure that changes with time. The search structure must answer efficiently when an element or a node is inside any particle, or reciprocally which elements or nodes are inside a given particle. The class relationship on the code is shown in Fig. 9
                        .


                        
                           Particle and Search classes:
                         The particle class describes the degrees of freedom of a particle. Given a particle, each of its degrees of freedom is locally indexed, and their association with a globally defined identifier is managed by the Dof handler class. By convention the global indexation of the particle’s degrees of freedom begins after the indexation of the flow degrees of freedom.

One of the most important class in our Fictitious Domain code is the Search class. We use the power of the 
                           
                              CTQR
                           
                         data structure and the adjacency structure between elements of the mesh to develop the particle-element search structure, which uses the 
                           
                              CTQR
                           
                         integer container 
                           
                              FA
                              [
                           
                        ] to store the index of the particles inside an element 
                           
                              e
                           
                        . Supposing that the particle displacement is always smaller than the characteristic size of the mesh’s elements, we can update efficiently the search structure in each time step, using the 
                           
                              CTQR
                           
                        , only testing elements that are inside any particle in the current step, and also its neighboring elements, computed using the data-structure. This makes a huge reduction in the number of tests needed to update the structure and reduces its complexity from

                         is the average number of elements that are inside or have a neighbor inside a particle. We also observe that particle flow simulations needs to compute particle–particle and particle boundary collision. With the use of the 
                           
                              CTQR
                           
                         data structure and together with the proposed search structure, the collision tests are straightforward since we only need to check collisions between particles that are over the same element (for particle–particle cases) and collisions of particles over boundary elements (for particle-boundary cases).

The update algorithm is sketched in Fig. 10
                        . The left picture on the image shows an hypothetic search configuration on a given time t. The elements that lie inside the particle are shown in light gray, and together with its neighbors (the dark gray elements) they are the elements that must be tested by the algorithm. The image at right shows the search structure after the update process.

We divided our tests in two parts. The first part of tests aims to evaluate the efficiency of the particle-elements search algorithm and no physics is solved through the Finite Elements/Fictitious Domain methods. The particles move using an explicit Euler time integration. In the last part, we analyze the efficiency of our software in a Finite Elements/Fictitious Domain simulation. All tests were performed on an iMac with a quad-core Intel Core i5 2.5GHz processor and 4GB DDR3 1333MHz of RAM.

                        . When the particle hits the boundary, the velocity vector is reflected according Snell’s law. The marked elements represent those overlapped by the particle. The graphic shows the time consumed by the search routine as the particle moves through the domain. It falls as the particle reaches regions of larger elements. The search time varies with the local mesh discretization since the procedure looks for overlapped elements in the neighborhood of the previous particle position.


                        Fig. 12
                        (a) shows the average search time for the complete particle path as a function of the total number of elements. Since the element size is non-uniform and the mesh is unstructured, the search cost is not a linear function of the number of elements of the mesh. Fig. 12(b) shows the behavior of the algorithm in an analogous test using an uniform and structured mesh of quadrangles, also shown in the figure. The number of elements in the neighborhood of the particle is almost constant for each time step and the total search time varies linearly with the number of elements.

                         shows a snapshot of cases with different number of particles moving with prescribed kinematics, using a mesh with 512 elements. The graphic shows the mean time spent by the search procedure to locate all particles. It varies linearly with the number of particles (see Fig. 14
                        ).

We now present results of flows with suspended and floating particles obtained by the use of the Finite Elements/Fictitious Domain formulation proposed by Lage et al. [3] and the computational approach described in this paper. We discuss the performance of our implementation in the next paragraphs by studying the result of a prototype fluidized bed with seven particles. Fluid flows from the bottom towards the top of the 2D channel due to an imposed pressure difference.

                        Table 3
                         shows the performance of our code in the fluidizided bed case with seven particles and without particles respectively in the first 50 time steps of the simulation. In both tests we measured mean time to build the Jacobian Matrix, to build the Residue Vector and to solve the linear systems of each Newton’s method iteration. Observe that the most expensive operation is the evaluation and assembly of the Jacobian Matrix and that its mean execution time remains almost the same in both cases – the variation is around 5%. The solution of the linear system of equations at each Newtons step takes approximately 30% more time in the flow with particles. In this case, the Jacobian matrix loses the banded structure of the pure Navier–Stokes solution, which compromises the solution efficiency. Moreover, since the particles move along the finite element mesh, the structure of the matrix changes with time. The total simulation time however, decreases more than two times in the simulation without particles. This fact shows that the assembly algorithm is almost independent of the number of particles but suggests that the Fictitious Domain formulation for flows with embedded particles has stronger non-linearities. In fact, Newton’s method needed 2.05 iterations to converge in the test with particles and only 1.12 iterations without particles.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This work proposed a simple object oriented architecture for 2-dimensional simulations of flows with suspended particles in the plane using the Finite Element/Fictitious Domain method. From the authors’ knowledge, this is the first object oriented architecture proposal for this method. This architecture uses modularisation, inheritance and encapsulation to provide a simple set of methods for the C++ classes that facilitates the specific particle flows application programming.

To have an efficient implementation, it also introduced a new topological data structure, the CTQR. All topological data structures described in Section 3 provide different trade-offs between memory usage and time complexity of basic operations such as identifying a topological entity, accessing its adjacency and incidence relations. The CTQR data structure provides a suitable choice of containers and integer rules to reduce the memory consumption without loosing the efficiency in terms of computational complexity of the topological queries. Morevover, CTQR is simple to implement and easy to use, and it could be extended to represent unstructured hybrid volumetric meshes. It’s main limitation is that it is not suitable to perform mesh refinement or simplification in a massive way, since it uses containers of integers instead of pointers. However, this is not the case for this Finite Element/Fictitious Domain application, where remeshing is not the point.

The authors plan to continue this work by extending their implementation to 3D flows and also to modify the implementation in order to deal with suspended and floating particles in a free surface flow. In addition, the authors intend to parallelise the 2D and 3D implementation improving the work of Blasco et al. [43] by using suitable concise topological data structures, since a low memory usage is very important to better distribute the mesh data on different processors [44].
