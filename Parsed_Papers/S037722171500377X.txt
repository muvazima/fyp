                  In this paper, we are interested in the label ranking problem. We are more specifically interested in the recent trend consisting in predicting partial but more accurate (i.e., making less incorrect statements) orders rather than complete ones. To do so, we propose a ranking method based on label-wise decomposition. We estimate an imprecise probabilistic model over each label rank and we infer a partial order from it using optimization techniques. This leads to new results concerning a particular bilinear assignment problem. Finally, we provide some experiments showing the feasibility of our method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, machine learning problems with structured outputs received an increasing interest. These problems appear in a variety of fields, including biology (Weskamp, Hullermeier, Kuhn, & Klebe, 2007), natural language treatment (Bordes, Glorot, Weston, & Bengio, 2012), image analysis (Geng, 2014), etc.

In this paper, we deal with the problem of label ranking, where one has to learn a mapping from instances to rankings (complete orders) defined over a finite number of labels. Various ways have been proposed to solve the problem, most of them intending to reduce the initial complexity of the problem. Some approaches propose to fit a probabilistic ranking model with few parameters (Mallows (Cheng, Hühn, & Hüllermeier, 2009), Plackett–Luce (Marden, 1996)) using different approaches (Cheng, Dembczynski, & Hüllermeier, 2010a; Meila & Chen, 2010). Other approaches tend to decompose the problem. Ranking by pairwise comparison (RPC) (Hüllermeier, Furnkranz, Cheng, & Brinker, 2008) transforms the problem of label ranking into binary problems, combining the results to obtain the final ranking. Constraint classification and log-linear models (Dekel, Manning, & Singer, 2003; Har-peled, Roth, & Zimak, 2002) learn, for each label, a (linear) utility function from which the ranking is deduced. More recently, some authors (Cheng & Hüllermeier, 2013) have proposed to solve the problem by performing a label-wise (rather than a more classical pairwise) decomposition.

Additionally, some authors (Cheng, Rademaker, De Baets, & Hüllermeier, 2010b) have discussed the interest, in preference learning problems and in label ranking in particular, to predict partial orders rather than complete rankings. Such an approach can be seen as an extension of the reject option (Bartlett & Wegkamp, 2008) or of the fact of making partial predictions (Corani, Antonucci, & Zaffalon, 2012). Such cautious predictions can prevent harmful decisions based on incorrect predictions. In practice, current methods (Cheng et al., 2010b) exploit pairwise information and consist in thresholding a pairwise comparison matrix containing probabilistic estimates. It has been recently shown that such methods, when coupled with parametric probabilistic models (Plackett–Luce and Mallows), are particularly interesting, as they are guaranteed to produce semi-orders, thus avoiding the presence of cycles in predicted relations.

In this paper, we retain the recent ideas of label-wise decomposition, and explore how partial predictions can be obtained from them. More precisely, we propose to learn for each label an imprecise probabilistic model of its rank, and use these models to infer a partial prediction, using robust optimization techniques. Note that imprecise probabilistic approaches are well tailored to make partial predictions (Corani et al., 2012), as well as to deal with incomplete data (Zaffalon, 2002a).


                     Section 2 introduces the problem and our notations. Section 3 shows how rank can be predicted from imprecise probabilistic models. Section 4 presents the proposed inference method based on bilinear optimization techniques. Finally, Section 5 shows some experiments on synthetic data sets.

The usual goal of classification problems is to associate an instance x coming from an instance space 
                        X
                      to a single (preferred) label of the space Λ = {λ
                     1
                     
                        
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                        
                     
                     λk
                     } of possible classes. Label ranking problems correspond to the case where an instance x is no longer associated to a single label of Λ but to a total order over the labels, that is a connected, transitive, and asymmetric relation ≻
                        x
                      over Λ × Λ, that amounts to give a rank to each label λ
                     1
                     
                        
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                        
                     
                     λk
                     . Hence, the space of prediction is now the whole set 
                        
                           L
                           (
                           Λ
                           )
                        
                      of complete rankings of Λ that contains 
                        
                           |
                           L
                           (
                           Λ
                           )
                           |
                           =
                           k
                           !
                        
                      elements (i.e., the set of all permutations). Fig. 1
                      illustrates a label ranking data set

                      with k = 3.

We can identify a ranking ≻
                        x
                      with a permutation σ
                     
                        x

                           …
                           ,
                        
                     
                     k} such that σ
                     
                        x
                     (i) < σ
                     
                        x
                     (j) iff λi
                     ≻
                        x
                     
                     λj
                     , as they are in one-to-one correspondence. σ
                     
                        x
                     (i) is the rank of label λi
                      in the ranking ≻
                        x
                     . In the label-wise decomposition method introduced later on, we will often refer to the assignment matrix y
                     
                        x
                      of ranking, which is a k × k Boolean matrix (y
                     
                        x, ij
                      ∈ {0, 1}) of elements y
                     
                        x, ij
                      such that

                      has rank j (σ
                     
                        x
                     (i) = j), and constraints (1) ensure that each label has a different rank (hence defining a proper order). We denote by Y the set of all possible assignment matrices. Note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between assignment matrices, permutations and complete rankings. In the following, we will use these terms (rankings, permutations, assignment matrices) interchangeably.

                      also means that estimating directly P
                     
                        x
                      is in general not doable, except for very small problems. The most usual means to solve this issue is either to decompose the problem into many simpler ones or to assume that P
                     
                        x
                      follows some parametric law. In this paper, we shall focus on a label-wise decomposition of the problem. To simplify notations, we will drop the subscript 
                        x
                      in the following when there is no possible ambiguity.

This section explains how the original label-ranking problem can be reduced to ordinal regression problems in a label-wise manner. Indeed, since in when an observation is precise (i.e., corresponds to a complete ranking over all labels), each label can be associated to a unique rank, a natural idea is to learn a probabilistic model pi
                     : K → [0, 1] with K = {1, 2
                        
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                        
                     
                     k} and where pij
                      = pi
                     (j) is interpreted as the probability P(σ(i) = j) that label λi
                      has rank j.

A first step is to decompose the original data set 
                        D
                      into k data sets

                      then comes down to solving an ordinal regression problem. A natural way to estimate the expected cost cij

                      to rank j is then to consider a distance

                     These distances are often used in label-ranking, since D
                     1 is connected to Spearman’s footrule and D
                     2 to Spearman’s rank correlation (Spearman’s ρ). In the sequel, we focus on the D
                     1 distance, yet all presented results extend to D
                     2 in a straightforward way. Note however that other distances or losses such as Kendall’s tau that are not label-wise decomposable cannot fit the current framework.

Precise estimates for pi

Rather than relying on precise estimates in all cases, we propose to consider an imprecise probabilistic model, that is, to consider for each label λi
                      a polytope (a convex set)

                           These models indicate that we have precise information about λ
                           1 and believe its rank is 2, while knowledge about the two other labels are imprecise. We nevertheless know that λ
                           2 should not have rank 2, while there is much more imprecision about λ
                           3.

This approach requires to learn k different models, one for each label. This is to be compared to the RPC (Hüllermeier et al., 2008) approach, in which k(k − 1)/2 models (one for each pair of labels) have to be learnt. There is therefore a clear computational advantage for the current approach when k increases. It should also be noted that the two approaches rely on different models: while the label-wise decomposition uses learning methods issued from ordinal regression problems, the RPC approach usually uses learning methods issued from binary classification.

However, as for the RPC approach (and its cautious versions (Cheng, Hüllermeier, Waegeman, & Welker, 2012; Cheng et al., 2010b; Destercke, 2013)), the label-wise decomposition requires to aggregate all decomposed models into a single (partial) prediction. Indeed, focusing only on decomposed models

                      nothing forbids to predict the same rank for multiple labels. In the next section, we focus on how to describe a set of potentially optimal solutions given the uncertain costs

                     . To do this, we introduce a new way to handle the well-known assignment problem when costs are uncertain.

                      that minimizes the overall cost c. One can easily see that this results in an assignment problem, which can be modelled with binary optimization variables yij
                      equal to 1 iff label i is assigned to position j:

                     Solving the above optimization problem can be done by using the well-known Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) which has complexity 
                        
                           O

                     . However, in our case the costs are uncertain and belong to polytope 
                        
                           C
                           =
                           
                              ×
                              
                                 i
                                 =
                                 1
                              
                              k

                     . A classical approach for such problems, such as the one used in robust optimization (Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, & Nemirovski, 2009), would seek minmax solutions of the problem (Deineko & Woeginger, 2006), yet this would not give us a partial prediction reflecting our lack of information about the costs. Also, recent works suggest that minmax solutions are likely to be sub-optimal in Machine learning problems (Hüllermeier, 2014).

Let us denote by Y the set of binary matrices that are feasible for (AP) (the set of possible assignment matrices). Given two binary matrices y and y′ feasible for (AP), we say that y dominates y′, which is denoted y≻y′, if

Ideally, we would want to retrieve the full Pareto set of non-dominated solutions

                      for all elements of 
                        Y
                     . By doing this for every pair of labels, we then obtain a partial order. Note that as all elements of 
                        Y
                      are proper rankings, there is no risk of inferring cyclical relations.

                     Proposition 1 provides us with a first approach for finding relations between pairs of labels. However, the result suffers from two drawbacks. First, it amounts to solve a bilinear mixed-integer program, which is 
                        
                           NP
                           −
                           h
                           a
                           r
                           d
                        
                      to solve in general. Second, the sufficient condition is too restrictive. Indeed, when probabilities are precise (i.e., when 
                        C
                      is reduced to a singleton), we would like that our approach returns the full set 
                        I
                      defined in (8), determining a unique optimal solution (or a set of solutions with equal minimal costs, if the optimal solution is non-unique). Unfortunately, Proposition 1 fails to include all relations in 
                        
                           I
                           ,
                        
                      even when probabilities are precise and when there is only one optimal solution. Namely, let

We must now deal with the second issue, the one of conservatism. We can address this issue of Proposition 1 by restricting the number of elements considered in constraint (9) to a relevant subset of 
                        
                           Y

                     Proposition 3 indicates how to get an outer-approximation that is likely to not be too conservative, but does not solve the complexity issue. The next result shows that we can use Proposition 2 in a slightly modified way to integrate the constraint given by Eq. (11), therefore keeping the complexity of computing w(i
                     1, i
                     2) polynomial. Its proof can be found in Appendix E.

This section shows results of some experiments done on several synthetic data sets. In particular, our goal was to compare our proposed approach with the construction of an inner approximation of the Pareto front, obtained by sampling precise distributions within sets 
                        
                           P

                     .

The data sets we used in the experiment are presented in Hüllermeier et al. (2008). There are two types of data sets (Hüllermeier & Cheng, 2009):

                           
                              •
                              synthetic data sets consisting in multiclass data sets issued from the UCI machine learning repository (Bache & Lichman, 2013) that have been transformed into label ranking data by a procedure proposed in Hüllermeier et al. (2008). To obtain this transformation, a naive Bayes classifier is first trained on the entire data set. Then, for each instance, the labels are ordered according to the predicted class probabilities;

real-world data sets issued from the bioinformatics fields where the outputs are qualitative profiles of yeast gene expressions. More details can be found in Hüllermeier et al. (2008).

All these data sets are described in Table 1
                        .

As explained in Section 2, the problem of label ranking is decomposed in a label-wise manner into k ordinal regression problems. Logistic regression is used as a base learner. For each classifier, and thus for each label λi, B bootstrap replicates of the learning set are used to provide B precise estimates of p

The results of our method are compared to those obtained with a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This one consists in computing several solutions (linear orders) of (AP) using precise costs computed from randomly sampled distributions within 
                           
                              P
                              i
                           
                        . Note that this procedure provides a set of complete orders that form an inner approximation of 
                           Y
                         (a subset of 
                           Y
                        ).

In a first experiment, we compare the approximation quality of the two methods using the vehicle data set. The number of labels in this case is limited (four labels) so that the enumeration of all possible rankings remains possible (24 possible rankings). The exact Pareto set 
                           Y
                         of non dominated solutions can thus be determined and compared with the approximations given by both methods. For this experiment, half of the data set has been used for training, the other part being kept for the test. Parameter α was set to 95 percent. The number of bootstrap replicates was fixed to 100 and we used 100 random samplings in the MC approach. The distributions of the deviations between the cardinality of the exact set 
                           Y
                         and the cardinality of the approximate ones are shown in Fig. 3 for both methods.

It can be seen that the approximation quality is generally good for both methods. The difference of cardinalities for the MC approach seems to be slightly smaller than for the cautious approach, but the MC approach, even with a high number of random samplings, provides no guarantees that the result will be exact (in fact, there are a few experiments in which the MC approach underestimate significantly the size of 
                           Y
                        ). On the contrary, the cautious approach guarantees that the result is a superset of 
                           Y
                        . It should also be noted that these good results are obtained using Algorithm 1 and only one filtering element y
                        * obtained by random sampling. From this, it appears that adding further filtering elements is unnecessary in most cases, yet adding some further filtering elements when producing very partial rankings may help to improve the approximation quality.

In this section, we illustrate the behavior of the MC and the cautious approaches using the five data sets described in Table 1. The result of each method being a partial order, we use two specific measures proposed in Cheng et al. (2010b) to evaluate the performances of the methods. The first one, correctness, quantifies how the predicted (partial) ranking matches the true ranking, whereas the second one is intended to measure the degree of completeness of the relation. A good method predicting partial orders should see its correctness increase as the completeness decrease, and there is usually a trade-off to be found between the two criteria. They can be formally defined as follows. Let

In the experiments, we used the following settings to obtain the probability sets 
                           
                              P
                              i
                           
                        : we produced 100 Bootstrap samples from the initial training data sets, resulting in 100 estimations p
                        
                           i
                         of the rank probabilities for each label λi
                        . To get confidence intervals of increasing size (and thus sets 
                           
                              P
                              i
                           
                         of increasing sizes), we varied the value from 0 to 0.95. Note that, by convention, when α is set to zero, only the most central value of the 100 p
                        
                           i
                         is kept, so that precise costs are used and the completeness is equal to one.

The results of the experiments are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5, and are mean values computed over five repetitions of a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. In the Monte Carlo approach, the final partial order from which correctness and completeness are computed is obtained by keeping the pairwise preference relations common to all orders resulting from the sampling. From these experiments, the following conclusions may be drawn:

                           
                              1.
                              As expected, for both methods, an increase of α leads to a greater abstention but to a significant improvement of the correctness. The abstention is thus done on poorly reliable predictions. This shows the interest of the use of imprecise probabilities when solving a label ranking problem through a label-wise approach.

The performances of the two methods are very similar when the number of labels is small (iris, authorship, vehicle) but show some qualitative differences when the number of classes, and thus the number of possible rankings, grows. The cautious approach allows to reach a better correctness while keeping the completeness at a reasonable level. Beyond the theoretical guarantees it gives of being cautious, this confirms the interest of our approach.

Finally, let us note that the closeness of the results again indicate that using Algorithm 1 and only one filtering element y
                        * was sufficient for the considered data sets. We can conjecture that adding further filtering elements will become more interesting as the number of labels grows, yet it should be noted that in the label ranking setting, the number of labels is typically limited (compared to, e.g., instance ranking or object ranking problems, where considering millions of items to rank is not unusual).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Label ranking is a hard learning problem with structured outputs where making cautious (partial) and reliable predictions may be preferable to making complete yet partially unreliable ones. To reduce the complexity of the problem, we consider a label-wise decomposition, while we consider using sets of probabilities to make cautious predictions about the label ranks.

This leads us to consider an assignment problem with imprecise costs from which we want to extract a Pareto front (i.e., the set of undominated rankings). Such a problem is in general 
                        
                           NP
                           −
                           h
                           a
                           r
                           d
                        
                      to solve, however for the specific case of label-wise decomposition, we provide a new (to our knowledge), elegant and efficient (polynomial) solution to the problem, that provides an outer approximation of the Pareto front.

Our experiments on benchmark data sets show that the approach is sound, and does not provide overly conservative predictions, something we may fear with outer-approximation. In fact, most of the time it will provide exact solutions. Experiments also seems to indicate that the interest of the approach increases with the number of labels to rank. In future experiments, we also plan to integrate missing data, since though label-wise decomposition tends to perform better than pairwise decomposition when no data are missing, it is also more sensible to missing data than pairwise approaches (Cheng, Henzgen, & Hüllermeier, 2013). Yet there are different ways into which missing data can be considered within imprecise probabilistic inferences (Zaffalon & Miranda, 2009), hence considering them is beyond the scope of this paper.

As a perspective to this work, we plan to work on developing efficient methods to find other outer-approximations. As an example, we may search to tell which rank each label can take within 
                        Y
                     . Such an approximation would be able to express some situations that pairwise comparisons cannot, for example it is possible to perfectly represent the Pareto set 
                        
                           Y

                      by giving the possible rank of each label, while it is impossible to exactly represent it with pairwise comparisons. Note that the converse is also true, as there are Pareto sets that can be exactly represented by pairwise comparisons, but cannot be represented exactly by giving the set of ranks a label can assume. Also, finding efficiently which rank a label can assume in 
                        Y
                      is a trickier problem, as it becomes difficult to exploit the ordinal structure of ranks.

                        Proof
                        If we forget about constraint (11) that filters dominated solutions, then we get back

                            and can use the proof of Appendix B. However, we do not want to compute z(i
                           1, i
                           2), but w(i
                           1, i
                           2).

In fact not all solutions to (B.1)–(B.3) must be considered in the computation of w(i
                           1, i
                           2). We need to check which of these enumerated solutions satisfy (11). From the definition of dominance, we must check that there exists
