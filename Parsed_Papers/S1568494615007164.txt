               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, we consider a recently proposed model for portfolio selection, called Mean-Downside Risk-Skewness (MDRS) model. This modelling approach takes into account both the multidimensional nature of the portfolio selection problem and the requirements imposed by the investor. Concretely, it optimizes the expected return, the downside-risk and the skewness of a given portfolio, taking into account budget, bound and cardinality constraints. The quantification of the uncertain future return on a given portfolio is approximated by means of LR-fuzzy numbers, while the moments of its return are evaluated using possibility theory. The main purpose of this paper is to solve the MDRS portfolio selection model as a whole constrained three-objective optimization problem, what has not been done before, in order to analyse the efficient portfolios which optimize the three criteria simultaneously. For this aim, we propose new mutation, crossover and reparation operators for evolutionary multi-objective optimization, which have been specially designed for generating feasible solutions of the cardinality constrained MDRS problem. We incorporate the operators suggested into the evolutionary algorithms NSGAII, MOEA/D and GWASF-GA and we analyse their performances for a data set from the Spanish stock market. The potential of our operators is shown in comparison to other commonly used genetic operators and some conclusions are highlighted from the analysis of the trade-offs among the three criteria.
