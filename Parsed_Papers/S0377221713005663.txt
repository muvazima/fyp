                  In this paper, we study the optimal policies of retailers who operate their inventory with a single period model (i.e., newsvendor model) under a free shipping offer where a fixed shipping fee is exempted if an order quantity is greater than or equal to a given minimum quantity. Zhou et al. (2009) have explored this model, and we further investigate their analysis for the optimal ordering policies which they did not sufficiently develop. Based on the investigation, we extend the base model in order to deal with the practically important aspect of inventory management when the exact distribution function of demand is not available. We incorporate the aspect into the base model and present the optimal policies for the extended model with a numerical example. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the extended model and analyze the impacts of minimum free shipping quantity and the fixed shipping fee on the performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Recently, fast growing online shopping highly fragments customers’ orders, and a shipping fee accounts for a significant portion of a payment in the fragmented orders. A shipping fee has the increasing influence on customer purchase decisions. The growing importance of a shipping fee in online business has been confirmed by a number of surveys and researches.
                        1
                        According to Mulpuru, Hult, Evans, and McGowan (2010) and PayPal (2008), the top reason customers abandon their shopping cart is high shipping fees, and around 25% of customers give up placing orders due to high shipping fees. Knowledge@Wharton (2012) empirically suggests that the free shipping option is more effective to prevent customers from abandoning the items added to their online shopping carts than price discount is.
                     
                     
                        1
                      With the increasing influence of a shipping fee, the free shipping option is widely adopted as an important marketing tool of electronic retailers (or e-tailers). There are various forms of running free shipping promotions.
                        2
                        Some retailers offer unconditional free shipping – that is, they do not charge shipping fees regardless of what or how much a customer orders. Some run an exclusive free shipping service on a membership basis (e.g., Amazon’s Prime service).
                     
                     
                        2
                      By far, the most common form is value-based or quantity-based free shipping, which is the offer that a shipping fee is not charged if the order size or value exceeds a certain threshold level. This approach has a couple of advantages over other options. The minimum free shipping quantity or value can generate additional sales by encouraging customers to order more to avoid the shipping fee. Moreover, the increased order quantity in turn allows e-tailers to achieve economies of scale in fulfilling the orders. In this paper, we focus on this most popular approach free shipping offer with the minimum order quantity (or amount) in particular.

Despite the increasing importance of free shipping promotions, the literature on the topic is very scarce. Boone and Ganeshan (2011) investigate how to structure free shipping strategies from the e-tailer’s perspective. Among the various forms of free shipping offers, they focus on the value-based free shipping strategy. They suggest how the e-tailer optimally determines the free shipping threshold level of a product for its customer and replenishes the product from its supplier simultaneously. There are some papers written from the perspective of customers who respond to a given free shipping offer from an e-tailer. Yang, Essegaier, and Bell (2005) explore how a product price and a free shipping threshold level interactively affect the purchase behavior of an online shopper who repeatedly purchases a non-durable product. They model the shopper as a rational person who tries to maximize the long term profit under the free shipping offer. Hua, Wang, and Cheng (2012) investigate a free shipping model in the context of business-to-business (B2B) e-Commerce. They assume that a customer (referred to as “retailer” in the paper) subsequently sells the product purchased from an e-tailer (referred to as “supplier” in the paper) to its customers in the downstream of the supply chain. They determine the optimal lot sizing and the optimal price to the downstream customers under the value-based free shipping promotion from the e-tailer. Leng and Parlar (2005) provide a more holistic view (i.e., a coordinate model between an e-tailer and a customer). They present a Stackelberg game model where an e-tailer as the leader of the game determines the threshold level and a customer as the follower decides the order quantity.

In this paper, we explore the value-based free shipping strategy in the context of newsvendor setting. There are two important papers in this stream. Zhou et al. (2009) present ordering policies under the given free shipping offer from an e-tailer. They suggest optimal policies for the single-period case and a heuristic policy for the multi-period case. Hua et al. (2012) discuss a newsvendor model with free shipping option when the ordering cost follows the quantity-discount cost structure and the retail price can affect either the location or scale of the demand distribution, and presented a procedure – not a policy – to determine the optimal price and the order quantity.

This paper is particularly based on the single-period model in Zhou et al. (2009). We further elaborate their insufficiently developed analysis for their model (especially, the optimal ordering policies which include an undetermined decision variable). Furthermore, we make the base model more practical by extending the base model in the following way: Gallego and Moon (1993) introduce the distribution-free approach as a practical extension of a newsvendor model. The traditional newsvendor model can be solved when the distribution function of the demand is known. However, it is often very hard or impossible to figure out the demand distribution in practice. The distribution-free approach allows us to determine the optimal order quantity for the worst case when only the mean and variance of the demand distribution are available. We incorporate this distribution-free approach to the base model.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the base model and our new optimal policy. In Section 3, we discuss the extension of the base model into the distribution-free model. Section 4 presents computational experiments for evaluating the performance of the distribution-free approach and the effects of minimum free shipping quantity and the fixed ordering cost.

In this section, we consider the single-period stochastic inventory replenishment problem with free shipping option. We first introduce some notation, derive the total expected cost function, and then present the optimal policies for the order quantity when the demand distribution information is available to the decision maker.

The notation used in the paper is given in Table 1
                        . Then, the total expected cost function C(S∣I) can be expressed as

                        Like the classic newsvendor model, this cost function consists of the ordering cost (c(S

                        I)), the overage cost (h

                        −
                        D)+]), and the underage cost (s
                        E[(D
                        −
                        S)+]). One additional term is the fixed cost K: the indicator function 1
                        
                           I<S<L+I
                         is 1 if S
                        ∈(I,
                        L
                        +
                        I) and 0 otherwise, and thus, K is included in the cost function only when the order quantity S
                        −
                        I(>0) is less than L. Since (S
                        −
                        D)+
                        =(S
                        −

                        −
                        S)+, the cost function above can be rewritten as follows:

We remark that this quantity-based free shipping model covers both the value-based and quantity-based free shipping option.

                           In practice, the value-based free shipping option is more common than the quantity-based option. However, the minimum free shipping value (FSV) can be converted to the minimum free shipping quantity (FSQ) by 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          FSV

                               for a given price p.

We next discuss optimal ordering policies for the single-period stochastic inventory system with free shipping option presented in Section 2.1. We first start with the following intuitive lemma, which is a restatement of Lemma 3.2 in Zhao and Katehakis (2006):

As mentioned earlier, Zhou et al. (2009) explored the optimal policies for the base model above. However, they did not fully develop the policies due to the following reasons: (i) their optimal policy description includes undetermined variables, and (ii) they identify inappropriate ranges of the initial inventory level I by which the optimal order quantity is determined.

First, they introduce the notation q as an order quantity less than the minimum free shipping quantity L, and hence, q is an intermediate variable that should be determined during the analysis (i.e., q is a decision variable in their analysis). However, their analysis is not fully explained how to obtain the quantity but simply incorporates the undetermined variable q into the policies – in other words, optimal order quantities and policy description contain the decision variable q. Second, they indicate that the optimal order quantity is

                        L), and 
                           
                              K
                              +
                              ψ
                              (

                        . We remark that the third one is the cost at the global minimizer of ψ(·) (i.e.,

                        ) if the fixed shipping charge K should be paid; in other words, this is the minimum expected cost if we order less than L. These functions allow us to graphically identify the decision points (or policy descriptors) in Proposition 1.

The two cases (i) and (ii) in Proposition 1 have the similar structure. When the initial inventory level I is below

                         (the global minimizer) is always greater than L. We can achieve the minimum expected cost without the fixed charge by ordering up to

                        . If I is greater than and close to

                        , avoiding the fixed charge K by ordering slightly more is more beneficial than achieving

                         with the fixed cost; thus, L, which is the minimum quantity to avoid K, is therefore the optimal order quantity until I reaches a certain level. If I is greater than the certain level, any positive orders only increase the cost because of the convexity of the cost function, and thus, ordering nothing is the optimal policy in this case.

The difference between the two cases is the third interval of case (i) in Proposition 1 (i.e., S″−

Then, the small cost K could encourage one to order up to

In the previous section, we consider a single-period inventory control model with free shipping option and the fixed charge under the situation that the full demand distribution information is available. We now discuss the same problem but there is no assumption on the demand distribution except its mean μ and variance σ

In this section, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on the minimax distribution-free approach. From this experiment, we present its effectiveness and performance, and understand the impacts of the minimum free-shipping quantity L and the fixed cost K.

We first evaluate the performance of the solution approach based on the minimax criterion over the optimal solutions with known demand distributions through the numerical study as follows: A set of 5000 problem instances is randomly generated, and all the parameters for each instance are drawn from the uniform distributions with parameters in Table 2
                        . For each instance, we evaluate three different demand distributions, which are uniform, triangle and normal distributions, and compare them with results from the distribution-free approach. In case of triangle distributions, we need the additional parameter for mode which is drawn from U(750,900).

We evaluate the effectiveness of the distribution-free policy by calculating the percentage gap between the average costs due to a distribution-free policy and an optimal policy, which we denote Δ

                         such that

                                       i

                                       Average costs by the distribution-free approach

                                       Optimal average costs

                        where i
                        =1 (uniform distribution), 2 (triangle distribution) and 3 (normal distribution). In Table 3
                        , we report the minimum (MIN), 1st/2nd/3rd quartile (Q
                        1, Q
                        2 and Q
                        3 respectively), the maximum (MAX) and the average (AVG) ratio Δ
                           i
                         for the 5000 problem instances.

The results indicate that the percentage gap Δ
                           i
                         is less than 1% for most of cases, and we further remark that even the 95th percentiles of Δ
                           i
                        s are less than 1% for i
                        =1, 2, 3 in this experiments, and hence they show the effectiveness of the distribution-free approach for the concomitant problem. However, we also observe that there exist some problem instances which induce the higher percentage gap Δ
                           i
                         more than 5%. In addition, the application of the distribution-free approach to the normal distribution results in better performance than to other distributions. Since the normal distribution is widely used or well approximated for inventory control problems in business practice (Silver, Pyke, & Peterson, 1998), its significant outperformance further justifies us to utilize the distribution-free ordering decision in the situation that it is difficult to estimate the exact demand distribution.

We next present the impact of demand variability on the performance of the distribution-free approach. In this experiment, we assume that the demand follows the normal distribution, and choose 1000 random instances in the same manner as the previous experiments. For each instance, we vary the coefficient of variation c
                        
                           v
                         from 0.1 to 1.0 in increment of 0.1, and calculate the percentage gap Δ3 as shown in Fig. 3
                        .

As presented in Fig. 3, the larger variance of demand may induce the slightly larger variability of Δ3; however, as we discuss above, the percentage gaps are less than 1% even for c
                        
                           v
                        
                        =1 for most of cases. What seems interesting is that, as the demand variability increases, the possibility that we observe fairly large gap Δ3 may decrease, and eventually the gap becomes less than 1% in this numerical study. This may indicate that the distribution-free approach can be robust even for the cases with higher demand variability.

In this section, we discuss the impact of two key parameters in free shipping option – the minimum free shipping quantity L and the fixed charge K – on the performance of the distribution-free approach. For this experiment, we use the normal distribution, and fix the other parameter values as follows: c
                        =30, h
                        =10, s
                        =100, I
                        =100, μ
                        =800, and σ
                        =0.2×
                        μ.

We first analyze the impact of the minimum free-shipping quantity L, and introduce the ratio 
                           
                              λ
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    μ
                                 
                                 
                                    L
                                 
                              
                           
                         indicating that the lower λ implies larger L relative to the mean demand μ. The ratio λ is varied from 0.5 to 10 in increment of 0.5, and we conduct this sensitivity analysis with several values of K. Fig. 4
                        (a) plots the average value of Δ3 for 1000 randomly generated instances for each λ. This figure indicates that the performance of the distribution-free approach is less likely to be affected by the parameter λ except some low λ cases with high values of K (for example, λ
                        ⩽1.5 and K
                        ⩾7000 in this example).

We next analyze the impact of the fixed charge K, and vary the values of K as K
                        ∈{100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10,000}. As like the numerical test above, we perform the sensitivity analysis of K with several values of λ. Fig. 4(b) also indicates the similar results we observed from the sensitivity analysis with λ: i.e., we observe moderate performance degradation of the distribution-free approach for the cases with small λ and large K while Δ3 is less than 1% regardless of λ. We note that larger K may either discourage customers to purchase items (maybe because it may not be economical to place an order) or encourage them to place more than L (to avoid such the high fixed shipping charge).

We now discuss what can possibly lead to the performance degradation of the distribution-free approach observed from the numerical experiments. Evidently, positive gaps of Δ
                           i
                         are observed in the experiments due to the different policy descriptors (or decision points) between the base model and the distribution-free model. We further investigate possible scenarios under which we expect the performance degradation of the distribution-free approach so as to better understand the results from the numerical experiments. Before the detailed discussion, we let the subscript BS refer to the base model and let the subscript DF refer to the corresponding distribution-free model. We first discuss a scenario due to the discrepancy of the global optimal inventory level

                        , the customer should have ordered L. In this case, the customer pays K that should have been avoided if the customer knew the exact demand distribution, and hence, this error is influenced by K. Indeed, the degradation increases in proportion to K in small λ, and Fig. 4 confirms this. Interestingly, there are cases that the gap Δ

                        ⩾
                        ψ(S
                        0). As mentioned earlier, the condition K 
                        ⩾
                        ψ(S
                        0) is equivalent to the condition for the case (ii) in Proposition 1. Observe that under the case, no ordering decision incurs a fixed charge K for either the base model or the distribution-free model, implying that the gap is irrelevant to K thereafter. Furthermore, as λ increases (or L decreases) for a given K, the condition K
                        ⩾
                        ψ(S
                        0) can be satisfied more easily; hence, we can also observe that

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we investigate a single-period stochastic inventory system under a value-based free shipping option with a minimum free shipping quantity L and a fixed shipping cost K. We present the optimal policies where the two different ones are suggested depending on the relation between L and K. Furthermore, we extend the base model by incorporating the distribution-free approach. In this approach, only the first two moments of a demand distribution are required to determine an order quantity under the situation that it is hardly estimated to obtain the exact demand distribution. We then perform extensive numerical experiments in order to evaluate the performance or effectiveness of the distribution-free approach and analyze the impacts of L and K on the performance. Our numerical experiments suggest that the distribution-free approach has fairly good performance (less than 1% on average). Interestingly enough, the maximum gap Δ
                        i
                      decreases as c
                     
                        v
                      increases; thus, this approach could be robust even for large c
                     
                        v
                     . In addition, the gaps Δ
                        i
                      are small and stable for small L whereas they increase in proportion to K for large L. This indicates that the information on the underlying demand distribution becomes more valuable when L and K are large.
