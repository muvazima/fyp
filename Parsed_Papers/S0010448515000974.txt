                  We define the Average Curve (AC) of a compatible set of two or more smooth and planar, Jordan curves. It is independent of their order and representation. We compare two variants: the valley AC (vAC), defined in terms of the valley of the field that sums the squared distances to the input curves, and the zero AC (zAC), defined as the zero set of the field that sums the signed distances to the input curves. Our formulation provides an orthogonal projection homeomorphism from the AC to each input curve. We use it to define compatibility. We propose a fast tracing algorithm for computing a polygonal approximation (PAC) of the AC and for testing compatibility. We provide a linear-cost implementation for tracing the PAC of polygonal approximations of smooth input curves. We also define the inflation of the AC and use it to visualize the local variability in the set of input curves. We argue that the AC and its inflation form a natural extension of the Medial Axis Transform to an arbitrary number of curves. We propose extensions to open curves and to weighted averages of curves, which can be used to design animations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Motivation: The concept of average of scalar values plays a central role in statistics  [1] and hence in a broad variety of application areas. It also extends naturally to points  [2]. But, extending the notion of an average to a set of 
                        n
                        >
                        2
                      planar curves is non-trivial.


                     Theoretical contributions: We define the Average Curve (AC) of any “compatible” set of 
                        n
                      smooth Jordan curves (i.e., simple loops) in the plane and propose it as the mathematical formulation of their average.

We define the Gap between the input curves and provide a formulation and also a sufficient condition for compatibility that is based on the Gap Relative Projection (GRP).

We define the inflation of the AC and show that it helps to convey the local variability in the input curves at any point along their AC. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the use of the AC and inflation for statistical shape analysis and visualization. The thickness of the inflation is a more useful statistical indicator of local variability than the thickness of the gap.

We compare two variants: (1) the valley AC (vAC) defined in terms of the valley of the field that is the sum of the squared distances to the input curves and (2) the zero AC (zAC) defined in terms of the zero set of the field that is the sum of the signed distances to the input curves. They are nearly identical for the configuration of Fig. 1.


                     Construction algorithm: Our Trace algorithm for computing the polygonal approximation (PAC) of the AC is independent of the order and representation of the curves. It produces consecutive samples along the AC incrementally, while traversing each curve only twice.


                     Implementation: We present a linear-cost algorithm for computing the PAC from finely sampled polygonal approximations of smooth input curves. We use it to show the effectiveness and limitations of the AC and to compare its vAC and zAC variants.


                     Extensions: We propose extensions of the AC to open curve segments and to the weighted average of curves, which we illustrate by showing patterns of curves or frames of curve animations.


                     Applications: We anticipate that the availability of a precise mathematical definition for the average of a set of curves (and ultimately of surfaces) will have benefits in a broad set of application areas.

For example, it may play a role in legal matters and in coastal studies, as a tool for providing precise definitions of shorelines in spite of their periodic fluctuations and for tracking the evolution of their average (rather than of their extrema) over time  [3].

Shape averaging also has important industrial applications. For example, being able to compute the average shape of a set of machined parts is fundamental for assessing the statistical consistency of a manufacturing process  [4]. Early efforts in developing formal models of statistical tolerances for CAD are discussed in  [5].

Many aspects of medical research, surgery planning, and diagnosis are based on comparing the anatomy of a particular patient to the average anatomy of a population  [6]. Hence, it is important to have a precise definition of that average anatomy and algorithms for computing it.

Finally, artists often prefer overdrawing (rather than erasing and redrawing or manipulating control points) to modify a curve locally. In digital approaches that support such an interface  [7], it makes sense to define the final curve in terms of the (possibly weighted) average of the overdrawn strokes.

Other applications of shape averaging are illustrated in  [8] (which proposes to define the average as a minimizer of an elastic deformation energy).

We illustrate applications of the AC to the statistic analysis of medical scans and of the weighted average to the design of animations of a smooth curve defined by several control curves.

We discuss prior approaches for computing averages of curves in terms of: (1) correspondence, which establishes a mapping between all input curves, and (2) construction, which defines a point of the average in terms of each set of corresponding points on the input curves and possibly of the corresponding normals. We also mention approaches that define the average in terms of fields or concatenations of input segments.


                     Arc-length or Landmark correspondence: Inferring correspondence from a normalized arc-length parametrization may lead to unacceptable artifacts  [9]. Inferring correspondence from landmarks (salient features, extrema, inflections)  [10,11] either requires tedious user input or delicate heuristics for matching possibly incompatible sets of landmarks on different curves. The solution proposed here does not reply on arc-length parametrization or on landmark matching, but requires that the curves be smooth and compatible (i.e., reasonably parallel).


                     Generalized Fréchet correspondence: An

                           (

                                 2

                           )
                        
                      algorithm for computing the Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves was proposed in  [12], extended to more general curves in  [13] and to more than two curves in  [14]. An 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           
                              
                                 k
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      algorithm for computing a mean curve for a set of 
                        n
                      polygonal curves, each of complexity 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           k
                           )
                        
                     , was proposed in  [15]. It minimizes its maximum Fréchet distance to each input curve. Unfortunately, small changes in the input curves can lead to large changes in the Fréchet metric (see Fig. 2.4 of  [16]) and hence in the mean. To overcome this drawback, for two curves, measures that compute the summed and average Fréchet distance have also been proposed  [16]. The solution proposed in this work has complexity 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           n
                           k
                           )
                        
                     , but assumes that the input curves are polygonal approximations of smooth and compatible input curves.


                     Normal or Radial correspondence: When one of the curves can be chosen as base so that each other curve is its normal offset   [17] or its radial offset   [17], the resulting correspondence (ortho map, normal map   [18,19]) is a homeomorphism. Unfortunately, the average obtained by using these correspondences is asymmetric: it depends on which curve is chosen to be the base. The solution proposed here is symmetric: it computes the AC as a new curve that is independent of the order of the input curves and establishes a normal map from the AC to each input curve.


                     Minkowski correspondence: The Minkowski average establishes a correspondence between points with the same normal. Realtime rendering approaches have been proposed for the weighted Minkowski average of two  [20] and of more  [21] polygonal solids. Unfortunately, it fails to satisfy many desirable properties of the average curve that AC has. For example, the Minkowski average of a non-convex curve 
                        C
                      with itself is not 
                        C
                      (their AC is).


                     Other approaches to correspondence: Correspondence between two curves can also be established by minimizing the integral of distance between corresponding points  [22], by adapting the sampling step to the local curvature  [23], or by minimizing the affine transformations that map corresponding pieces  [24].


                     Construction: Many approaches use a construction based on the centroid of the corresponding points. The medial axis  [25] and its variations (as discussed in  [26]) do not. Similarly to the medial axis construction, the solution proposed here constructs points on the AC as normal offsets of the corresponding (i.e., locally closest projection) points on the input curves. A variant that constructs the centroid of the corresponding points yields nearly identical results, but a different parametrization.


                     Averaging discrete points: The algorithm proposed in  [27] computes a polygonal average 
                        C
                      for an unordered set of discrete sample points by initially aligning 
                        C
                      with the least-square fit line and then iteratively moving its vertices towards weighted averages of samples that have close projections on 
                        C
                     . The authors of  [27] point out that there is no guarantee of uniqueness or existence. Applying this solution to a sampling of all input curves will, in general, not yield the AC, but the duality between the two approaches is intriguing.

Our algorithm implements a fixed-point iterative scheme to converge to a point on the AC and this may be viewed as an extension of Moving Least Square techniques for computing a surface that interpolates a point cloud: set of input points or surfels (points associated with surface normals)  [28,29]. In a future 3D extension of the vAC, the desired “average” surface may be defined by several surfaces, each one defined by its cloud.


                     Zero set of a field: An average of two curves was defined in  [30] as the zero set of a heat field. The result is similar to the Ball Morph  [26]. A linear and cubic interpolation of density in medical scans was discussed in  [31] as a mean to produce interpolating cross-sections, which were defined on each slice as zero-sets of a 3D field. This principle was exploited in  [32] to define morphs between pairs of curves and between pairs of surfaces. When using a signed distance field, the mid-course curve of such a morph corresponds to the zAC of two curves. We extend this approach to more than two curves, propose the vAC variant, present the Trace algorithm and its efficient implementation for tracing the AC, and define the GRP to increase the set of configurations for which Trace produces the desired result.


                     Median trajectories: Given a set of polygonal trajectories, a median trajectory is constructed  [33] by concatenating selected segments of input trajectories.

We consider an input set {
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                     } of 
                        n
                      smooth curves. We propose two formulations of their AC: vAC and zAC.

                                 (
                                 x
                                 −
                                 
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                                 )

                     . Hence, we define the Valley Average Curve (vAC) as the valley of the scalar height field

                     Definition of compatibility: We say that the input curves are compatible if there exists a curve, 
                        C
                     , such that the GRP map from point 
                        P
                      to its GRP,

                     , is a homeomorphism

                        2
                        In other words, the GRPs establish continuous and bijective correspondences between the AC and the input curves.

The problem with this definition is that it can be tested only if a suitable curve 
                        C
                      is found. Hence, we define below a sufficient, although not necessary, condition for compatibility (which we call strong compatibility) that can be verified without computing 
                        C
                     .

                      passes through a local minimum. If the normal map from each curve to the other is a homeomorphism, the two curves are said to be normal compatible   [19] (NC). The equivalent and more descriptive term of projection homeomorphic was used in  [18]. Two curves are NC if the minimum of their LFS  [37] exceeds their Hausdorff distance  [38] divided by 
                        
                           (

                           )
                        
                     . (See  [19] for a formal proof and intuition.) NC is a more constraining condition than BC  [35].


                     Gap compatibility and strong compatibility: We say that the input curves are gap compatible if the GRP, 
                        
                           
                              P
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                     , is unique for all 
                        i
                      and for all points 
                        P
                      in the gap.

We say that the input curves are strongly compatible if each pair is normal-compatible.

                     Strong compatibility implies gap compatibility: If the input curves are strongly compatible, the spikes of 
                        
                           
                              C

                      are pairwise disjoint and their union is the gap. Indeed, each endpoint of a spike lies on another input curve, wlog

                     . Since 
                        
                           
                              C

                      and 
                        
                           
                              C

                      are normal compatible, the spikes never cross (see Corollary 1 of [19]).

Given that the above holds for any choice of curve 
                        
                           
                              C

                     , any point 
                        P
                      of the gap lies on exactly one spike of each curve.

Hence, strong compatibility implies gap compatibility.


                     Conjectures: We advance the following conjectures for strongly compatible configurations: (1) the restriction of 
                        Q
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      along each spike (i.e., the value of 
                        Q
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      as a function of arc-length parameter along the spike) has a local minimum and (2) there is only one local minimum per spike.

We have proven the conjecture for sections of the gap where the input curves are locally straight (see Section  4).

Our experiments strongly suggest that the conjectures are true for more general configurations, but we do not have a formal proof.


                     Comparing vAC and zAC: For a typical valid input, the vAC and zAC are nearly identical. In fact, they are provably identical in sections of the gap where the input curves are parallel (constant radius offsets  [39] of each other). A slight difference can be observed (see Fig. 6
                     ) in sections of the gap where corresponding GRPs have tangents with significantly different orientations.


                     Important properties: Both variants of the AC satisfy the following properties: (1) The AC is a non-contractible Jordan curve in the gap. (2) The AC is uniquely defined and independent of the order of the input curves. (3) The AC is independent of the representation and parametrization chosen for each curve. (4) In places where all input curves are close to each other and locally parallel, the GRPs, 
                        
                           
                              P
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                     , are nearly collinear and the corresponding point on the AC is close to their centroid. (5) The AC passes through all points that are contained in all input curves. (6) The AC commutes with similarity transformations.


                     Definitions of inflation: With each point, 
                        P
                     , of the AC, we associate a radius, 
                        r
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                     , that captures the local variability (i.e., deviation of the input curves from their AC). We define the inflation as the infinite union of the disks of center 
                        P
                      on the AC and of radius 
                        r
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )

                        The envelop of the inflation can be computed as the radial offset of the AC  [17].

                     . Relation to the MAT: Consider configurations of two curves. The Medial Axis (MA) of their gap is the set of the centers of all maximal disks  [25] in the gap. The two curves are compatible if and only if the MA of their gap is a Jordan curve (has no bifurcation). The Medial Axis Transform (MAT)  [25,40] of the gap augments the MA with a radius function that is identical to r(P), regardless of whether we use the

                     ).

Hence, we view the AC and its inflation as a natural extension of the MAT to an arbitrary number of curves.

Before presenting our algorithm for tracing the AC of compatible curves and for testing compatibility, we discuss the special case where the input curves are not Jordan curves, but infinite lines. We do so because our trace algorithm for tracing the PAC is based on the closed-form expressions for computing the closest projection of an arbitrary point 
                        P
                      onto the AC of lines. But our formal vAC and zAC definitions of the average of a set of lines may have other applications.

We consider a set

                     , and that has for tangent a vector 
                        T
                      orthogonal to

                     .

Thus, the valley of lines is a line and its representation can be computed it in closed form.


                     
                        T
                      is undefined for special configurations. For example, for two orthogonal lines, 
                        
                           
                              Q
                           
                           
                              L
                           
                        
                      has radial symmetry. Conveniently, these configurations are excluded, since we assume that the input is strongly compatible.

                        =

Computing point

                      fails in situations where the vectors

                      are (nearly) parallel, because the minimizer, 
                        S
                     , may be (nearly) at infinity, which leads to (numeric instability or) a division by zero. To address this problem, we have devised a robust and fast computation for the closest projection, 
                        V
                     , of

                        V
                        =

                        N
                      is orthogonal to 
                        T
                     , and solve for the value of 
                        s
                      that minimizes

The details of ProjectZ for projecting onto a zAC of lines are shown in Algorithm 2. Note that we do not require normalization of the computed

                     Comparing the vAC and zAC of lines:   Fig. 8
                      shows the vAC and the zAC of a set of four lines in two configurations. Note that the vAC and zAC are identical when all lines are parallel.


                     Using prior art for tracing the AC: One may consider using previously proposed tracing algorithms to compute the vAC as the valley of 
                        Q
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      in the gap.

The concepts of ridges and valleys have applications in non-photo-realistic rendering  [43], image analysis  [41], shape recognition  [44], and other areas. The literature on extracting valley and ridge curves of height fields is vast. Existing techniques can be classified into sampling methods  [45], tracing methods  [46] and differential equation solving methods  [47]. Many prior techniques rely on a regular sampling of the plane and approximate the height field by a piecewise linear field. To obtain smoother approximations of the valley, one could approximate the field by a B-Spline function and use a variation of the tracing approach of [48].

Similarly, we could produce an approximation of the zAC by sampling 
                        D
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      on a regular grid and using zero-set (iso-curve) tracing algorithms (see for example  [49]).

Instead of these approaches, we propose below an efficient algorithm (Trace) that works from the input curves directly and traces the AC by producing points that lie exactly on the AC. The algorithm is almost identical for the vAC and zAC.

                      on the vAC or on the zAC of the tangent lines. We view the AC as the set of fixed points of the Project operator, applied to points in the gap.

                      until the distance between consecutive locations of 
                        P
                      falls below a small threshold (we use 10−6 of the diagonal of the minimum axis-aligned bounding box containing the input set). The process is illustrated in Fig. 9
                     . We found that 3 iterations suffice to converge in all cases that we tested. Therefore, Snap(P) can be implemented in closed form as: 
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  


                     Trace algorithm for computing the PAC: Our Trace (Algorithm 4) builds a polygonal approximation (PAC) of the AC incrementally, one vertex at a time. We compute the first (seed) vertex of the PAC as Snap
                     
                        
                           (
                           S
                           )
                        
                     , where 
                        S
                      is the left-most point of the input set. This step requires traversing each curve once, before the tracing of the PAC starts. Other, more robust, solutions may be used. For example, one may consider a small set of seed candidates randomly chosen on the input curves and select the one for which the minimum distances to the other curves have the smallest sum.

Then we repeat the following process. We consider the last vertex 
                        U
                      of the PAC (the last one appended). We use the GRPs 
                        
                           
                              U

                        U
                      to compute the tangent lines to the input curves and the direction 
                        T
                      of their AC using the formulation of the normal 
                        N
                      of the AC of lines, as provided in Algorithm 1 or 2.

                            and 
                              T
                            if these are saved as the results of the previous snap.
                     
                     
                        T
                      is the tangent to the AC at 
                        U
                     . We compute a candidate point 
                        P
                        =
                        U
                        +
                        e
                        T
                      as an extrapolation of 
                        U
                      along the tangent to the AC. Then, we compute a new vertex 
                        V
                        =
                        s
                        n
                        a
                        p
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      and appends it to the PAC. It will serve as 
                        U
                      for the next iteration.


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

The sampling density, and hence the number of samples appended to the PAC are controlled by the step size 
                        e
                     . For example, we set it to 1/300 of the average length of the input curves if we wish to create an AC with about 300 vertices. To increase performance, we provide the option of increasing 
                        e
                      automatically in segments of the gap where the distance from 
                        U
                      to its GRP is large, but a large step size may reduce the smoothness of PAC. One may of course subdivide the PAC to produce a smoother curve.


                     Trace stops (i.e.,  Closed becomes True), when the distance from the new vertex 
                        V
                      to the first vertex of the PAC is less than 
                        e
                     . We test whether 
                        V
                      projects onto the interior of the first edge of the PAC. If so, we do not append it.

                      of 
                        U
                      and the closest projection

                      of 
                        V
                      is a homeomorphism.


                     Justification of correctness: The correctness of Trace hinges on the following assumptions: (1) Snap 
                     
                        
                           (
                           S
                           )
                        
                      of the left-most point 
                        S
                      always lies on the AC. (2) Each candidate 
                        P
                      lies in the gap. (3) Each candidate 
                        P
                      has a GRP on each input curve. (4) The extrapolation 
                        P
                        =
                        U
                        +
                        e
                        T
                      followed by Snap 
                     
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      yields a point further than 
                        U
                      along the AC (so that Trace always moves forward).

Assumption (1) is true, since 
                        S
                      is on the boundary of the gap.

Assumption (2) may fail (for example, when 
                        e
                      is large and the gap is turning). We have considered testing whether 
                        P
                      lies in the gap and reducing 
                        e
                      if it does not, but our experiments indicate that this precaution is not necessary.

Assumption (3) is guaranteed if the input curves are strongly compatible.

We do not have a mathematical proof of (4). Our experiments (Fig. 10
                     ) indicate that the basin of attraction of each short segment of the AC (i.e., the set of points of the gap that snap to it) is a thin cross-section of the gap that is nearly straight and orthogonal to the AC.


                     Parametrization of the gap: This observation suggests a natural parametrization of the gap: a point 
                        P
                      of the gap is represented by 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           h
                           )
                        
                      where 
                        s
                      is the arc-length parameter along the AC of point 
                        V
                      returned by Snap 
                     
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                      and where 
                        h
                      is the distance from 
                        P
                      to 
                        V
                     .


                     Centroid variant: An interesting variant of the AC may be obtained by replacing each point 
                        P
                      of the AC by the centroid, 
                        G
                     , of its GRPs. Although the shape of that variant is nearly identical to the AC, it provides a more natural relation between 
                        G
                      and the corresponding points 
                        
                           
                              P
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                     . It may be viewed as an extension of the Midpoint Locus variation  [50] of the medial axis.

In this section, we present simple extensions of the AC to weighted averages and to open curves.


                     Weighted average of curves: To compute a weighted vAC (resp. zAC) of 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      with weights 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 w
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      that sum up to 1, we replace, in ProjectV (resp. ProjectZ), the formulations of the sum of the squared distances (resp. of signed distances) by a weighted sum.

The choice of the weights or their variation with time or some other parameter depends on the application.

For example, this solution may be used to support the design and animation of the morph between two curves. Fig. 11
                      shows a superposition of a series of frames of such an interpolation. These may also be used as a pattern of curves or as a tool to parametrize the gap.

Our solution extends to morphs defined by more than two curves, for example by using the paradigm proposed in  [21] for a Bézier path in the space of polyhedra. But here, instead of using a weighted Minkowski sum, we use a weighted sum of (signed or squared) distance fields and trace the corresponding AC.

Because scaling and addition of (squared) distance fields behave as their equivalent operators on scalars or points, various formulations developed for motions or (parametric or subdivision) curves defined by control points may be trivially adapted to produce motions or patterns of curves that are defined by several control curves. For example, we can use Bézier weights or time parametrized weights derived from the Neville algorithm  [51], so as to ensure that the animation interpolates all control curves with proper timing.


                     Open curve segments: We have extended the AC to sets of oriented open curve segments (which we call strokes). To test this extension, we have developed an interactive system where the user draws the input strokes. We use a light smoothing filter to remove trembling, pixel quantization, and time-dependent sampling artifacts.

We extend each stroke at each end with a half-line that abuts the stroke with tangent continuity. We start with the Snap of the centroid of the start points of the strokes. We then perform Trace until we pass the Snap of the centroid of the end points.

Optionally, one can trim the AC to the part that has a homeomorphic normal map with each input stroke. Examples are shown in Fig. 12
                     .

Statistical analysis of families of shapes is used in medicine to facilitate diagnosis and support research. For example, in  [52], the authors study the variability of femur heads (using 3D models reconstructed from CT images) and quantify variations between femurs with and without Cam Femoroacetabular Impingement. As another example, PCA is used in  [53] to compute a statistical shape atlas that complements anatomical features (acquired from X-ray scans) to compute patient specific femoral bone shapes.

To illustrate a possible application of the VA in this domain, we used a set of input curves that each approximate the projected silhouettes of a portion of the femoral head. We have traced these curves from images in Fig. 15 of  [54]. We compute the average and variability of the first three curves, and also overlay the fourth curve, that corresponds to a complex cam-type deformity, on top of this information (Fig. 13
                     ) to show how the anatomy of a patient may be compared to a statistical model of a family of shapes.

So far, we have presented our definitions, properties, and algorithms assuming that the input curves are smooth. Our algorithms assumed that we can compute the closest projection of point 
                        P
                      on any input curve and (to verify compatibility) that we can compute the tight cone of the normal directions spanned by points along any segment of any input curve.

Instead, the implementation used to demonstrate the proposed approach and to produce the illustrations for this paper involves Piecewise Linear Curves (PLC) that closely approximate a set of smooth input curves.

Our implementation follows closely the Trace algorithm presented above. We describe below the specific details that have been customized for PLCs.

                      to the PAC, we perform a local compatibility test. Let

                        L

                     . It all segments pass the test, we declare that the segments that correspond to the portion 
                        
                           (

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we report performance measurements and show a variety of results in an attempt to illustrate what types of inputs that produce a valid VA and what inputs are declared incompatible by our implementation of Trace.


                     Convergence of Snap: The average number of iterations of 
                        P
                        =
                        
                           ProjectV
                        
                      that were needed to converge to the AC from an arbitrary point 
                        P
                      in the plane was 2.03.


                     Overall performance: We used a machine with 8 GB of RAM and a 2.2 GHz quad-core processor. Our single threaded implementation performs an average of 15,590 Snap operation per second on an input set of 768 vertices. Performance drops to 8104 operations when we double the vertex count.


                     Incremental solution: ​Switching to the incremental, rather than global, computation for the GRP improved the performance of Trace by a factor of 7 when the input has 768 vertices, by a factor of 14 when the vertex count is doubled, and by a factor of 38 when it is quadrupled.


                     Diversity of input sets handled by Trace: We tested Trace on a large number of configurations of input curves. A typical example is shown in Fig. 1.


                     Trace works (i.e., yields a Jordan curve that has homeomorphic normal-maps to each input curve) for a variety of configurations, including configurations where the curves are far from similar (see for example Fig. 14
                     ). Since Trace performs a local analysis, it also works for configurations that are locally compatible, but where the curves may self-cross once or more (Fig. 15
                     ).


                     Examples of incompatible configurations where Trace may fail:
                     Trace may declare an input set to be invalid for several reasons. We provide two representative examples.

The wart is an example of configurations where the Medial Axis of the gap has a bifurcation. Our construction may fail in such configurations because no AC exists that establishes a normal map homeomorphism to both input curves. The two images in Fig. 16
                      show how the normal map may jump (be discontinuous) when moving along the gap. Although one could construct some form of an “average curve” ignoring such jumps, the result would not capture the local variability of the input curves.

The GRP confusion is an example of configurations where the gap is not an annulus. Because our Trace algorithm works on a local section of the gap at a time, it may create a valid AC for some of such configurations, but may fail to start properly (as shown in Fig. 17
                     ) or be confused when these overlaps are local.

In this paper, we report the following contributions. We propose two variants of the Average Curve (AC) of a set of smooth and compatible input curves. The valley Average Curve (vAC) variant is defined in terms of the valley of a height field that is the sum of the squared distances to the input curves. The zero Average Curve (zAC) variant is defined in terms of the zero set of a height field that is the sum of the signed distances to the input curves.

We provide closed form expressions for computing the vAC and zAC exactly when the input curves are lines and for computing the closest projection onto them from an arbitrary point in the plane. We propose an algorithm that traces a polygonal approximation (PAC) of the AC (vAC or zAC). It does not use a regular grid sampling of these height fields. Instead it computes candidate points via tangent extrapolation and snaps them onto the AC using 3 steps that each compute the closest projections onto the input curves, the associated tangent lines, and project the candidate point onto the AC of these tangent lines.

To avoid the cost of a global search for the closest projection and to avoid using erroneous closest projection onto segments of input curves that are closed in the plane but distant along the curve, we define the gap between the curves and the gap restricted projection (GRP).

We define when an input configuration is compatible and also propose a sufficient compatibility condition that may be checked without constructing the AC.

We illustrate the generality of our solution by showing a broad range of valid input configurations, which include input sets where the curves each self-cross once or multiple times.

We provide the details of an implementation of our algorithm designed to work on densely sampled polygonal approximations of smooth input curves. It has linear space and time complexity and is fast enough to provide real-time feedback by re-computing the AC at each frame during the interactive editing of the input curves.

We anticipate that the theoretical contributions and practical implementations described here will impact various fields in metrology, CAD, GIS, and medical modeling by providing an important building block and practical tool for statistical shape analysis.

We also hope that this initial investigation will fuel various extensions. These include formal definitions of the exact AC for coarse polygonal curves, a graceful extension for computing the AC in portions where the curves are not compatible, and extensions of to curves and surfaces in 3D.

The problem of computing the average of planar curves was first investigated by some of the authors of this paper at the 9th McGill-INRIA Workshop on Computational Geometry. We thank SPM reviewers for excellent suggestions that have helped us to improve the paper and thank Leo Rossignac-Milon for asking whether our initial solution could be extended to weighted averages of curves.
