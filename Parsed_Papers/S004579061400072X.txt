                  This work provides a novel dynamic ring-based routing scheme for correlation data aggregation named Ring-Based Correlation Data Routing (RBCDR) scheme. In this scheme, first, nodal data is routed to rings which have abundant energy in minimum hops, and then all data aggregation is processed along the ring, after that, the aggregated data is routed to the sink with shortest route. Compared with current research, RBCDR scheme has higher network lifetime. RBCDR scheme processes data aggregation in non-hotspots regions which have abundant energy and then routes all aggregated data to the sink, achieving less data sent to the sink and thus decreasing the energy consumption in hotspots near the sink, therefore, it significantly improves the network lifetime. Through theoretical analysis and simulation results, our scheme is proved to improve network lifetime by 200–340%, compared with sink-centered baseline version data aggregation scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The main function of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to sense the physical phenomenon in monitoring environment [1]. Data sensed by multiple nodes may be highly correlated [1,2]. For instance, when monitoring ambient temperature, temperature sensed by neighboring nodes may be spatially and temporally correlated, thus, there is no need to send all sensed data to the sink [3]. Meanwhile, in many applications, sink only needs average (maximum or minimum) temperature. In such an application scenario, multi node data can be gathered into one data packet, thereby greatly reducing the energy consumption of the nodes and avoiding network congestion, so as to improve the network performance. Thus, correlated data aggregation research has important implications. Extensive research work has been devoted to provide energy-efficient routing algorithms for correlated data gathering [4–6].

The main goal of correlated data aggregation route is to decrease network transmitting data amount by correlated data aggregation, and thus to decrease nodal energy consumption, improve network lifetime and avoid network congestion, achieve overall performance improvement [1,2]. Several routing techniques to handle the correlated data aggregation problem have been proposed [2–4]. The main goal in [4] is to decrease total amount of transmitting data to decrease network energy consumption, however, subsequent studies found that only reducing the total energy consumption does not necessarily improve the life of the network. In most studies, the network lifetime is defined as the first death of nodes in the network [5], if the energy consumption is not balanced, some nodes may die early, resulting in low network lifetime. Therefore, subsequent correlated data aggregation research not only considers the data correlation, but also energy consumption balancing [6,7]. In recent research, correlated data aggregation route is always studied with energy consumption, network lifetime and other performance metrics such as data reliability and delay, to improve overall performance [3,8].

There are a lot of strategies about data aggregation routing, but it is worth noting that although data aggregation can reduce data amount to the sink and thus decrease energy consumption, to the best of our knowledge. Currently, the proposed data aggregation route schemes have failed to make full use of the data aggregation characteristics to improve network lifetime greatly. Meanwhile, the practicability and scalability of current proposed schemes still need further study.

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic ring-based routing scheme for correlation data aggregation named Ring-Based Correlation Data Routing (RBCDR) scheme, which is simple and practical. RBCDR scheme can improve network lifetime greatly, and the main innovations are:
                        
                           (1)
                           RBCDR scheme is an energy efficient route scheme which can improve network lifetime greatly.

Our previous research on energy hole phenomenon in WSNs [9] has found that, even data load is decreased through correlated data aggregation, there is still energy hole in the network, which seriously affects network lifetime. In this paper, RBCDR scheme changes the traditional sink centered data aggregation method, data route is not directly to the sink, instead, it is routed to selected ring region with abundant energy, after the ring region receives the entire network data, data is route along the ring to one node, finally, the entire network aggregated data is sent to the sink. In this way, RBCDR scheme processes data aggregation in regions with abundant energy and only sends the aggregated data to the sink, which minimizes the energy consumption in sink hotspots, and thus it can greatly improve network lifetime. According to our theoretical analysis and simulation results, RBCDR scheme can improve the network lifetime by more than 2 times and the larger network, the better performance.

In addition, RBCDR scheme has good energy efficiency. This paper carefully analyzes the energy consumption situation in the network, through dynamically selecting regions with abundant energy as ring routes, the network energy consumption is balanced, and the energy efficiency is improved by more than 5 times.
                        
                           (2)
                           RBCDR scheme does not require new data aggregation schemes, current mature algorithms can be adopted, which is really functional.

The first stage of RBCDR scheme is processed in ring regions with high remaining energy, since nodes in these regions have higher remaining energy. In the second stage of RBCDR scheme, the total data aggregation is processed in rings with abundant energy. Therefore, in RBCDR scheme, data aggregation is processed by nodes with high remaining energy, so, in data aggregation route, there is no need to construct ingenious data aggregation tree to aggregate data to minimize energy consumption, we can adopt simplest route schemes (e.g. the shortest route combined with data aggregation scheme), although the simple route schemes do not have good data aggregation and more energy consumption is consumed, since the energy consumption is in non-hotspots, there is no effect on network lifetime.
                        
                           (3)
                           We provide extensive theoretical analysis and simulations to confirm the good performance of our scheme. Theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In the comparison simulations, for a medium-scale sensor network, our scheme improves network lifetime by more than 2 times, moreover, with larger network and higher data correlation, the network lifetime can be improved by more times. Meanwhile, our scheme improves energy efficiency by 2 times.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the related works are reviewed. The system model is described in Section 3. In Section 4, the details of dynamic ring-based correlation data aggregation scheme are presented. Performance analysis is provided in Section 5. Section 6 is the comparison and analysis of simulation results. We conclude in Section 7.

According to the data aggregation method and goal, in [3], the scheme of correlated data gathering can be roughly classified into three categories: routing-driven, coding-driven, and fusion-driven.


                     Routing-driven schemes: This kind of schemes [10–14] does not explicitly consider data fusion as an additional requirement when designing route. The goal of such schemes is to minimize the total transmitting data amount sent to the sink. Data aggregation is only processed when routes encounter. Most routing-driven schemes adopt a full aggregation model, namely, all child nodal data is aggregated into one data packet at parent node [3], gradient based routing [11], Hybrid On-demand Distance Vector Multi-path (HODVM) [12], Enhanced Real Time with Load Distribution (ERTLD) routing protocol [13], and PEGASIS [14] are proposed for this kind of algorithms.


                     Coding-driven schemes: This kind of schemes [15–17] focuses on coding decreasing transmitting data amount by coding compression under the premise that only partial aggregation can be achieved. In such schemes, data compression is based on implicit or explicit side information and once compressed, data cannot be further aggregated. Therefore, such schemes focus on efficient origin data coding compression and energy efficient route protocols. Once compressed, the data is supposed to be minimized and there is no need for further in-network fusion or the fusion can be greatly decreased.


                     Fusion-driven schemes: This kind of schemes heavily depend on data correlation to aggregate data in routing as much as possible [3]. The goal of these schemes is to arrange high correlation data into one route for data aggregation. Different from coding-driving schemes, fusion-driven schemes allow multiple aggregation only if it is beneficial [3].

Distributed compressive sensing (CS) is another compression method based on the observation that a relatively small number of random projections can contain most of its salient information which is difficult to conclude from the above three correlated data gathering schemes [18]. In recent years, many CS based data gathering schemes have been proposed [18]. In [18], Wu et al. proposed a compressive sensing based energy efficient clustering routing data gathering scheme for large-scale wireless sensor networks, a similar study can reference introduction of Literature [19].

In addition, there are many metrics can be used to measure the performance of a routing scheme supporting data fusion [3], as the following:


                     Aggregation ratio: This is the ratio of the amount of outgoing data to that of incoming data at a fusion node. Aggregation ratios depict the effectiveness of the fusion operation. Depending on the specific fusion operation [3].


                     Energy consumption. By reducing the amount of data (as a result of fusion) to be forwarded from one node to another, routing schemes aim to reduce the energy consumption in the entire network [3].


                     Network lifetime. Network lifetime is always defined as the first node die time in the network [3,9].

Besides, scalability, delay, and adaptively are also key requirements for routing schemes in wireless sensor networks [3]. According to the main focus metrics of data fusion schemes, they can be classified into the following four schemes.
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Minimum aggregation ratio optimization scheme: Most of current proposed data fusion schemes belong to this class [6,7], and mainly belong to Coding-driving schemes [15–17], since most coding-driving data fusion schemes aim at minimizing aggregation ratio. Besides, other schemes such as fusion-driven schemes and routing-driven schemes also belong to this class [10,14].


                              Energy consumption optimization scheme: Such as fusion-driven schemes and routing-driven schemes [10,20].


                              Reliable aimed scheme: Ref. [3] addressed the problem of offering desired reliability to fused information with minimum energy consumption. To increase the information reliability, their scheme is to repeatedly transmit data on fusing routes without acknowledgments (ACKs). They theoretically obtain the optimal number of transmissions for each node to minimize the total energy consumption and they also propose practical, distributed approximation algorithms for chain and tree topologies.


                              Integrated multiple metrics optimization data fusion scheme: Ref. [2] proposed a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) to efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by exploiting the correlation of visual information observed by different camera sensors.

Although there are many data fusion schemes which can greatly reduce nodal transmitting data amount and improve network lifetime, to the best of our knowledge, these schemes do not consider the Energy hole problem in WSNs, thus, no matter what performance these schemes achieve, according to our theoretical and simulation results, there is up to 60% remaining energy in these schemes, and this part of remaining energy has nothing to do with which data fusion scheme is adopted. Therefore, in this paper, we change previous way where focus on data fusion route structure, instead, we propose a novel ring-based data aggregation scheme which takes full advantage of remaining data, and thus greatly improve network lifetime and energy utilization efficiency.

The network model used in this paper can also be seen in [21], that is, with n homogenous sensors are deployed in a circular region with the sink (base station) situated at the center. The node distribution follows a homogenous Poisson point process with a density of ρ sensors per unit area. Uniform event generation: Every sensor has a data packet to be reported in a fixed time or round, so network lifetime can be defined as round. All sensed data must be sent to the base station using correlation data aggregation routing which is proposed by this paper.

For data aggregation, we adopt the lossless step-by-step multi-hop aggregation model introduced in [3]. In this approach, each source node aggregates its data with that of its child nodes in a step-by-step fashion. This aggregation model has been widely studied and applied, as can be seen in [2,3]. In such aggregation model, the aggregation of κ multiple inputs with source node si
                         is performed sequentially, that is, incoming data is aggregated with existing data in order of arrival, and data transmission takes place after data from all child nodes has been received and aggregated.

According to the typical energy consumption model [9]. Energy consumption for transmitting sees formula (3) and energy consumption for receiving is represented by formula (4).


                        Eelec
                         represents transmitting circuit loss. Both the free space (d
                        2 power loss) and the multi-path fading (d
                        4 power loss) channel models are used in the model, depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver. εfs
                         and εamp
                         are respectively the energy required by power amplification in the two models. The energy consumption for receiving l-bit packet is as shown in formula (4).

The optimization goal of our RBCDR scheme is to maximize network lifetime. The lifetime of the network can be defined as the time elapsed until the first sensor node in the network depletes its energy (dies) since once a sensor node dies, the sensing capability of the network starts degrading [9]. Assume the energy consumption for one round data collection of node si
                         is ei
                        , then the lifetime of si
                         is ti
                        
                        =
                        Ei
                        /ei
                        , Ei
                         is the nodal initial energy. Since the network structure in this paper is homogeneous network, then all sensor nodes have the same initial energy and can be represented by E, then we get ti
                        
                        =
                        E/ei
                        . Since the network lifetime is defined as the first node die time, then, this paper is to maximize the lifetime of node which has the minimum lifetime in the network, namely, to minimize the energy consumption of node which has the maximum average energy consumption in each round data collection, that is:

In this section, we first analyze the data load under current data aggregation schemes and then give the motive of this paper. The data aggregation route is similar with data route which only collects data, as shown in Fig. 1
                         
                        [22], the only difference is that data aggregation route processes aggregation when routing. The following Theorem 1 gives the nodal data load at different distances from the sink, in the situation that the network adopts sink-centered lossless step-by-step multi-hop correlated data aggregation model introduced in [2].

                              Considering the nodal distance from the sink is x, then the data transmission amount in one round data collection is as the following:

                        Fig. 2
                         shows the nodal energy consumption at different regions under sink-centered lossless step-by-step multi-hop correlated data aggregation model [2], we call this scheme as sink based correlated data aggregation scheme (SBCDAC) below. Fig. 3
                         shows the ratio of nodal data load without correlated data aggregation scheme to nodal data load with correlated data aggregation scheme. Based on the above analysis, we can get the research motive.
                           
                              (1)
                              Data aggregation can greatly reduce nodal energy consumption and improve network lifetime. Compared with network without data aggregation schemes, the nodal energy consumption is largely declined after aggregation, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the energy consumption near the sink declines as much as 4–7 times, namely, the network lifetime is improved by 4–7 times.

Although correlated data aggregation can decline network energy consumption, as can be seen from Theorem 1 and Fig. 2, the energy consumption near the sink is still very high, where is the network hotspots, and there exists Energy hole phenomenon which affects network lifetime seriously. When the network dies early because of energy hole, there is still much remaining energy in nodes away from the sink, therefore, if this part of energy can be fully used, the network performance can be improve obviously.

In previous data aggregation schemes, there is data correlation among packets which are sent to the sink, and there is space for further aggregation to decrease nodal data load. In traditional data aggregation schemes, the data aggregation is processed at the sink, that is to say, the data aggregation is processed at the sink with a large amount of redundant data, and these redundant data will cause large data load in the routing, especially for nodes near the sink. Therefore, if there can be one in-network data aggregation before sending to the sink, the energy consumption near the sink can be decreased, for nodes away from the sink, although this data aggregation increases the energy consumption, it does not matter their lifetime, since there is abundant remaining energy in this region, and in this way, the network lifetime can be greatly improved. Compared with other complex routing schemes, which carefully consider about data correlation aggregation routing strategy and data transmission order, our scheme only adopts the simplest shortest route strategy, which has good applicability.

The main idea of RBCDR scheme is as the following: Since the energy consumption near the sink is the maximum in traditional correlation aggregation schemes, network lifetime is determined by these hotspots lifetime. Therefore, RBCDR scheme changes the traditional sink-centered data collection routing scheme, in RBCDR scheme, first we select one region with low energy consumption, and then construct a ring route in this region (as the ring route in the shadow of Fig. 4
                        ). This ring route is the entire network data aggregation center, and all data is sent to the ring route. Then, all data in the network aggregate into a data packet along the annular route. At last, all network data is aggregated into one packet and then sent to the sink. Compared with current research, RBCDR scheme has the following advantages:
                           
                              (1)
                              After all data aggregated in the ring route, the packet that is sent to the sink cannot be re-aggregated. Therefore, the data load for hotspots is the minimum, namely, the hotspots data load is minimized, then the energy consumption for hotspots is largely decreased, and the network lifetime can be double improved.

Since the ring route undertake all data aggregation, its energy consumption is very large. So, by dynamic changing the ring route location, we can select node with maximum remaining energy, and thus balance the energy consumption of ring route into the entire network, achieving balanced energy consumption. In this way, the outer remaining energy is fully used and network lifetime is improved, so is energy efficiency.

Therefore, the overview structure of RBCDR scheme is as shown in Fig. 4, the ring route divides network into two regions: (A) Inside ring region, which means that its distance to the sink is shorter than ring route to the sink; (B) Outer ring region, which means that its distance to the sink is longer than ring route to the sink. First, RBCDR scheme selects the ring where ring route locates according to energy consumption situation, assume the selected ring is ring k, then, the full routing process of RBCDR scheme consists of the following steps.
                           
                              (1)
                              Route from sink to ring k. First, the system selects ring k as the ring route based on the network energy consumption situation. Then, the sink launches centrifugal routing to ring k, namely, selects the farthest neighboring node as next hop until k hops.

Construct ring route. The first node at ring k (marked as node A) is as the ring route initiating node, and the node A selects farthest neighboring node which is k hops to the sink as the next hop, by the left hand rule (or the right hand rule) [23], and so on, until along the ring route to the initiating node A.

The determination of hops to ring route for other nodes. After the construction of ring route, system sets the hops to ring route as 0 for nodes in ring route, and for other nodes, it is set as infinity. Then nodes in ring route start broadcasting packet to neighboring nodes, and then neighboring nodes add the hops by 1 after receiving it, and continue forward broadcasting, meanwhile, the neighboring node compare itself hop number with the (broadcasting hop +1), if the (broadcasting hop +1) is smaller than current recorded hop, then set current recorded hop as (broadcasting hop +1), go on this process until all nodes aware of its hops to the ring route.

Routing inside ring region. Except for nodes in the first ring, other nodes adopts centrifugal routing, namely, route to farther neighboring node away from the sink until to one hop region within ring route, as orange nodes region shown in Fig. 5
                                 .

Routing in outer ring region. Nodes in this region adopt centripetal routing, that is, node will route to nearer neighboring node near the sink until to one hop region within ring route, as green nodes region shown in Fig. 5. It is worth noting that routing inside ring and routing in outer ring is processed simultaneously.

Routing in one hop region of ring route. Nodes in this region directly send data to nodes in ring route (as white nodes region shown in Fig. 5).

Routing along the ring. When all data is sent to nodes in ring route, nodes in ring route randomly select one initiating node and starts two directions (in the clockwise direction and counterclockwise direction) routing along the ring, in the end, routing of these two direction encounter at one node and data of all nodes is aggregated into one packet.

Routing from ring route to the sink via shortest route. The aggregated data packet is sent to the sink via shortest route.

Based on previous analysis, the following algorithm for the RBCDR scheme is introduced in detail. In Algorithm 1, the received data packet is automatically aggregated with current owned data, and the aggregated data is sent to the next hop until data of all child nodes is received. Since the nodal data aggregation process is the same; Algorithm 1 does not explicitly point out, but implies the data aggregation process (see Table 2
                        ).

The essence of RBCDR scheme is to process data aggregation in non-hotspots and then send aggregated to the sink, to achieve less energy consumption in hotspots and network lifetime improvement. Therefore, in RBCDR scheme, data of the entire network is aggregated in the ring route, and thus the energy consumption in ring route is much higher than other regions, to solve this problem, we dynamically change ring route to balance energy consumption to improve network lifetime. This section is to determine the probability of being selected as ring route according to energy consumption in different regions of the network in RBCDR scheme, and thus optimize RBCDR scheme.

                        >
                        w, it can be calculated according to inference 1. Fig. 6
                         shows the nodal data load for different regions when w changes. For nodes inside ring route region, the data is from nodes near the sink to ring route, since there are more nodes near ring route than regions away from ring route, so when data is routed to ring route, there are more nodes in outer layer undertake data forwarding, and thus the nodal data load increases moderately. However, for nodes outer ring route region, there are fewer nodes near the ring route than region away from the ring, so for regions which are closer to ring route, the amount of data increases rapidly. Overall, if w is nearer to the sink, the inside ring route region undertakes smaller data amount, and outer ring route region undertakes more, if the sink is the ring route, it is equivalent to sink based correlated data aggregation scheme (SBCDAC). Otherwise, if w is farther from the sink, the nodal data load inside ring route increases and for outer ring route regions, the data load declines. After centrifugal and centripetal routing, all nodal data is sent to one hop region of ring route, as shown in Fig. 5.

According to Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, Fig. 7
                         shows the nodal data load and final data packet length under different ring route locations. As can be seen from Fig. 7, (a) The aggregated data packet is far bigger than data load in ring route; (b) As w increases, the nodal data load in ring route declines, but the data load in the entire network increases.

According to Theorem 5 and Theorem 6, Fig. 8
                         shows the average nodal data load in ring route when w locates at different regions in the network (the first ring near the sink is not as the ring route), as well as data load for the first ring which is not as ring route. As can be seen from Fig. 8, nodal data load in ring route is far bigger than non-ring route region.

As can be seen from previous discussion, if the ring route locates at ring w, the average nodal data load in ring w is

                        Fig. 9
                         shows the nodal data load in the first ring under different w, for other regions, Fig. 9 shows the average data load after all other regions act once as ring route. As can be seen from Fig. 9: (a) if the network radius is large. (e.g. R
                        =500m), although the first ring is not ring route, its data load is higher than outer regions; (b) For the probability εk
                         of each region acts as ring route equals, the data load is not balanced in different regions, thus, the data load can be balanced through different εk
                        , and thus improve network lifetime.


                        Inference 2. In RBCDR scheme, if only the first ring is not ring route and other ring acts as ring route with the same probability, the ratio of maximum nodal data load in sink based correlated data aggregation scheme (SBCDAC) to that of RBCDR scheme is as the following:

Then the maximum nodal data load ratio of these two scheme is formula (13), thus proved.□


                        Fig. 10
                         shows the maximum nodal data load ratio of SBCDAC scheme to RBCDR scheme. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the maximum data load in SBCDAC scheme is three times more than that in our RBCDR scheme, since the network lifetime is determined by the node which has the maximum energy consumption, and the nodal energy consumption is in linear correlation with nodal data load, this result actually indicates that our RBCDR scheme theoretically improve network by up to 3 times (in practice, since nodes are randomly deployed, the actual performance is often not as good as theoretical result). However, as can be seen from Fig. 9, if the probability of different regions as ring route is all the same, although RBCDR scheme can improve network lifetime, the energy consumption is not balanced, and thus network lifetime is affected. Therefore, we will discuss how to select appropriate εk
                         to maximize network lifetime in next section.

The energy efficiency is the proportion of effectively used energy in the network. Previous research has already pointed out, in WSNs, when the network dies, there is up to 90% remaining energy. The following analysis gives the energy efficiency in RBCDR scheme.

As can be seen from network optimization Algorithm 2, the maximum energy consumption gap between nodes is Θ, if the energy consumption in the first ring is the maximum, and energy consumption in other regions is smaller than that in the first ring by Θ, the energy efficiency is the minimum, which is the minimum energy efficiency in RBCDR scheme, the calculation is as the following:

Take an arbitrary region which is at x from the sink with width dx and angle dθ
                              , since dx and dθ
                               is very small, the number of nodes in this region can be calculated as: ρxdxdθ
                              . The remaining energy for each node is the gap between the first ring, namely, Θ. Then, the total remaining energy in this region is: Θρxdxdθ
                              . Therefore, the total remaining energy in the network is

                        Fig. 11
                         shows the ratio of energy efficiency in RBCDR scheme over SBCDAC scheme. As can be seen from Fig. 11, the energy efficiency in RBCDR is more than 2 times of that in SBCDAC scheme. That is because RBCDR scheme takes full advantage of remaining energy in regions far from the sink, and thus greatly improve network energy efficiency, therefore, it achieves balanced energy consumption and network lifetime improvement.

OMNET++ is used for simulation verification. OMNET++ is an open network simulation platform that provides open source, component-based, modular simulation platform for large network, which has been widely recognized by academics [24].


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the data load in different regions when the ring route is in the second ring and in the fifth ring, as we have analyzed in Section 5, the data load in ring route is far bigger than that in other regions.


                        Fig. 13
                         shows the nodal data load in different regions after each ring acts as ring route once. As can be seen, in RBCDR scheme, the nodal data load in different regions is basically the same, which means balanced load. While in sink based correlated data aggregation scheme (SBCDAC), the nodal data load in regions near the sink is far bigger than that in other regions, which means unbalanced load. Moreover, in RBCDR scheme, the maximum nodal data load is much smaller than that in SBCDAC scheme, which indicates that the network lifetime is greatly improved.

Corresponding to Figs. 12 and 14
                         shows the nodal energy consumption in different regions when the ring route is in the second ring and in the fifth ring. Since the nodal energy consumption is in linear relationship with nodal data load, so the energy consumption relationship is similar as in Fig. 12. Similarly, Fig. 15
                         shows the energy consumption comparison between RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme, as can be seen, the network energy consumption is more balanced in RBCDR scheme and the maximum nodal energy consumption is far smaller than that in SBCDAC scheme.

Correspondingly, Fig. 16
                         shows the three-dimensional energy consumption map under no data aggregation scheme, Fig. 17
                         shows that in SBCDAC scheme, Fig. 18
                         shows that in RBCDR scheme when ring route is in the third ring, and Fig. 19
                         shows that after a period of operation. As can be seen from these figures: (a) Schemes with data aggregation can decrease nodal energy consumption; (b) RBCDR scheme can achieve more balanced energy consumption than other schemes, and thus it can greatly decrease network maximum nodal energy consumption and improve the network lifetime.


                        Figs. 20 and 21
                        
                         respectively shows the nodal data load and energy consumption comparison between RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme under different correlation coefficient C. As can be seen from the simulation result, under different correlation coefficient, RBCDR scheme has far better performance than SBCDAC scheme. Figs. 22 and 23
                        
                         respectively shows the ratio of nodal data load and energy consumption under RBCDR scheme over SBCDAC scheme, as can be seen, in our scheme, it is only half (even less) of that in SBCDAC scheme.

The simulation scene in Fig. 24
                         is adopt RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme under 1000 nodes, 1100 nodes until to 1500 nodes. The same with Fig. 21, it shows the nodal data load and energy consumption comparison between RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme under different correlation coefficient C. As can be seen from the simulation result, under different correlation coefficient C, RBCDR scheme has far better performance than SBCDAC scheme. Fig. 25
                         shows the ratio of maximum nodal energy consumption under SBCDAC over RBCDR scheme when different number of nodes is deployed. Obviously, the maximum nodal energy consumption in our scheme is under half of that in SBCDAC scheme. The ratio of maximum is 3.4 in Fig. 25, which means RBCDR scheme of network lifetime is SBCDAC scheme of 200–340%. In Fig. 25, the reason for there is a little uptrend of the black curve between 1100 and 1300 as follow: In the literature [21], we confirmed in wireless sensor networks, node density in a certain range has very little impact on network lifetime. Therefore, from Fig. 24 that node density and energy consumption is a random change without rules. So from the point of view of theory, the ratio of maximum nodal energy consumption under SBCDAC over RBCDR scheme is not regular, so in Fig. 24, the value of ratio varies irregularly.


                        Figs. 26 and 27
                        
                         respectively shows the maximum nodal energy consumption and the ratio of maximum energy consumption under RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme. As can be seen from the simulation results, the bigger correlation coefficient C refers to bigger data correlation, and thus the transmitting data amount can be less, then the energy consumption is less, as shown in Fig. 26. The simulation result in Fig. 27 shows that our RBCDR scheme has far smaller maximum nodal energy consumption than that in SBCDAC scheme.


                        Figs. 28 and 29
                        
                         respectively shows the maximum nodal energy consumption and the ratio under different nodal transmission radius r in RBCDR scheme and SBCDAC scheme, as can be seen, the maximum energy consumption under different r in RBCDR scheme is much smaller than that in SBCDAC, namely, its lifetime is far higher than that in SBCDAC scheme. In Fig. 28, there is a upper curves when the r at 90m. The reason is: we confirmed in article [21]: when a node selects different transmission radius r, the network lifetime will be different, but there will be an optimized r to maximize the network lifetime, therefore, in Fig. 28 When r
                        =90m, compared with other transmission radius, r can maximize the network lifetime, and then its energy consumption is the lowest, thus forming the experimental results shown in Fig. 28.


                        Fig. 30
                         shows the left energy ratio under different nodal density. As can be seen, in our RBCDR scheme, it is only 30%, while it is about 60% in SBCDAC scheme, which shows that our scheme double the network energy. Fig. 31
                         shows the ratio of left energy under different correlation coefficient C, as can be seen, our scheme has less left energy under different correlation coefficient C, which indicates our scheme greatly improve network energy efficiency and thus verifies the effectiveness of our scheme.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have addressed the problem of aggregate correlated data over intermediate nodes on route to the sink. Previous research mostly focuses on data correlation to aggregate data as much as possible, and then minimizes transmitting data amount. Different from previous research, we focus on correlated data route reconstruction at system level, by fully using remaining energy in non-hotspots, we can greatly improve network lifetime and energy efficiency based on current correlation data aggregation schemes. We believe that our research proposes a new idea and can be a great enhancement for current correlation data aggregation schemes. We have proposed a Ring-Based Correlation Data Routing (RBCDR) scheme. RBCDR scheme changes the traditional sink based data aggregation route schemes, instead, we route data to ring route which has abundant remaining energy and aggregate correlation data along ring route step by step, after this process, the aggregated data is sent to the sink. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime (maximum nodal energy consumption), and energy efficiency. Evaluation results show that, by integrating data aggregation operations in the routing process, the proposed scheme can greatly improve the network lifetime by up to 200% and double energy efficiency, which has important significance for wireless sensor network security.
