                  We study a class of vector optimization problems with a C-convex objective function under linear constraints. We extend the proximal point algorithm used in scalar optimization to vector optimization. We analyze both the global and local convergence results for the new algorithm. We then apply the proximal point algorithm to a supply chain network risk management problem under bi-criteria considerations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Vector-valued optimization stems from multi-objective programming, multi-criteria decision making, statistics, and cooperative game theory (Handi, Kell, & Knowles, 2007; Jahn, 2003). Such optimization problems have been extensively studied and applied in various decision-making contexts. Let C ⊆ Rm
                      be a convex, closed and pointed cone with int(C) ≠ ∅. We define the partial orders ⪯ and ≺ as follows, for any u, v ∈ Rm
                     , 
                        
                           u
                           ⪯
                           v
                           ⟺
                           v

                           v
                           ⟺

The interested reader is referred to Pardalos and Hearn (1999, Chap. 10), and Ehrgott (2000) for the detailed modeling in this regard.

Since the seminal work by Moreau (1965), proximal point algorithms have been successfully applied to scalar optimization problems (Liu, Sun, & Toh, 2012). Since then, they have well used in the optimization literature (Martinet, 1970; Meng, Zhao, Goh, & De Souza, 2008; Rockafellar, 1976b). Recently, proximal point algorithms have also been extended to multi-criteria and vector optimization problems (Villacorta & Oliveira, 2011), albeit without the numerical tests and applications. In this paper, we propose a proximal point algorithm for vector optimization, with a specific application to a supply chain network risk problem with bi-criteria considerations.

The classical iterative methods for solving scalar optimization problems proposed for solving multi-criteria optimization problems seek a Pareto optimum by starting from a non-Pareto optimal point. Further, to compute a point satisfying the first-order conditions for Pareto optimality, descent-type methods that are independent of the scalarization approaches have been proposed for solving multi-criteria optimization (Bello Cruz, 2013; Bello Cruz, Lucambio Perez, & Melo, 2011; Qu, Goh, & Chan, 2011; Qu, Liu, Goh, Li, & Ji, 2014b). Bello Cruz et al. (2011) discuss the convergence of the gradient method for differentiable quasiconvex multi-objective optimization. Bello Cruz (2013) presents a subgradient method for vector optimization problems without using scalar-valued objectives. Different from the descent-type methods, our method aims at extending the proximal point methods to vector optimization problems with linear constraints. Proximal point algorithms are already widely used in the literature. To obtain a weak Pareto optimum, Bonnel, Iusem, and Svaiter (2005) extend proximal point algorithms to vector optimization and present both exact and inexact versions, in which the subproblems are only solved approximately. Villacorta and Oliveira (2011) propose an interior proximal method based on the generalized distance function for vector optimization. Qu, Goh, Souza, and Wang (2014a) propose a proximal algorithm for solving convex multi-criteria optimization with linear constraints. Bento, Cruz Neto, and Soubeyran (2014) present a proximal point-type method for multicriteria optimization with the help of a variable scalarization function. Our method is in line with the two methods in Bento et al. (2014); Bonnel et al. (2005) that we seek to extend the classical iteration methods for scalar optimization to vector optimization. The main difference between our method and that in Bonnel et al. (2005) is that we focus on finding weak Pareto or Pareto optimal solutions for linearly constrained vector optimization, while the method in Bonnel et al. (2005) aims at finding weak Pareto solutions for vector optimization without constraints. There are two differences between our method and the method in Bento et al. (2014). The authors Bento et al. (2014) establish the variable scalarization function with 
                        
                           C
                           =
                           
                              R
                              +
                              m
                           
                        
                     . We present the algorithm by assuming that C ⊆ Rm
                      is a convex, closed and pointed cone with int(C) ≠ ∅. Moreover, Bento et al. (2014) assume the problem is unconstrained. Our method allows for linear constraints.

The primary contributions of this paper are as follows. We extend the proximal point algorithm to a vector optimization setting and demonstrate the power of the new algorithm in solving vector optimization problems. We prove global convergence for the new algorithm and analyze its convergence rate. We apply the new method to supply chain network risk management, where conflicting bi-criteria considerations can affect performance.

This paper is thus organized as follows. Section 2 presents some preliminaries on the notations, and proximal point algorithms. Section 3 extends the proximal point algorithm to a vector optimization setting and presents the convergence of the new algorithm. The convergence rate for the new algorithm is also presented in this section. An application to a supply chain network risk management problem is presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.

                     The next theorem follows directly from Theorem 2.2 of Jahn (1984) (see also Jahn, 2003; Luc, 1987). In Theorm 2.2 of Jahn (1984), the scalarization function is implicitly defined. In this paper, as we explicitly present the scalarization problem (2.1), for the sake of completeness we provide the proof.

In this case, the proximal point algorithm presented in this paper collapses to Algorithm 1 given in Qu et al. (2014a). Therefore, the method in this paper is a generation of that in Qu et al. (2014a).


                           Theorem 2.1 shows that a Pareto optimum or weak Pareto optimum of (1.1) is equivalent to finding an optimum of (2.1). In the following section, we present a proximal point algorithm for solving the vector optimization problem (1.1) based on the scalarization optimization problem (2.1). We note that this method mainly focuses on finding one solution. Recently, there have been many methods proposed to obtain a solution of vector problems by extending the classical iteration methods (for example, gradient-type methods, Newton-type methods, proximal point-type algorithms) for scalar optimization (Bello Cruz, 2013; Bello Cruz et al., 2011; Bonnel et al., 2005; Qu et al., 2011; Qu et al., 2014a, 2014b). Our method is in line with these ideas. However, when there is a need to obtain the Pareto surface (the Pareto optimal solution set), our method may fail. This can be shown by the following example proposed by Antoni and Giannessi (2014).

                            is a Pareto optimum to the lower problem from Theorem 2.1(3). Therefore, in this case, the optimal solution to the corresponding bi-level problem (2.4) is

                                       This together with (3.2) is the augmented Lagrangian method in the literature for solving the linearly constrained scalar optimization (Hestenes, 1969; Powell, 1969), where γk
                                        is the Lagrange multiplier and θ > 0 is the penalty parameter for the violation of the linear constraints. In Rockafellar (1976a), it was shown that this augmented Lagrangian method is exactly the application of proximal point algorithm to the dual problem of the linearly constrained scalar optimization. Therefore, in Gu, He, and Yuan (2014); Rockafellar (1976a), this augmented Lagrangian method for solving linearly constrained scalar optimization is also named as the proximal point algorithm.

                                       } is convergent. Hence, the first assertion of Theorem 3.1 is true.

The above conclusion means that any accumulation point of {xk
                                       } is a feasible solution of (1.1). Therefore, it follows from the above proof and Theorem 2.1(2) that this conclusion holds.

Similar to the proof of Theorem 2.1(4), we can show that this conclusion is true.

It follows from Remark (2) of the proximal point algorithm and Theorem 2.1(3) that this assertion holds.□

Before we analyze the convergence rate for the proximal point algorithm in Section 3.1, we state the next lemma.

                           Lemma 3.2
                           
                              Suppose the sequence {(xk, γk
                              )} is generated by the proximal point algorithm in 
                              
                                 Section 3.1
                              
                              , then there exists a positive integer qk
                              ,

                     . We propose two bi-criteria optimization approaches which considers three statistics: the expected value, variance and conditional value-at-risk measure at a specified confidence level.

Consider a supply chain network comprising a producer, multiple suppliers, and multiple customers. The producer purchases parts from the suppliers in the network and assembles several families of products to meet customer demand. Let ρi
                      be the disruption probability for supplier i, that is the parts ordered from supplier i cannot be delivered due to disruptions with probability ρi
                     . Denote Ps
                      as the probability when a disruption scenario s is realized. Suppose each scenario s ∈ S comprises a unique subset Is
                      ⊂ I of suppliers who can deliver parts without disruption, where I is the index set of the suppliers and

We present some numerical tests using the proposed algorithm in Section 3.1 to solve the above two models. All codes are written in Matlab 7.10 with built-in solver “fmincon” to solve the approximation problems. The tests are conducted on a DELL computer with Intel(R)Core(TM)i5-2400 processor (3.10 gigahertz) and 4.00 gigabyte of memory on a Windows 7 platform. We discuss the implementation details for the proximal point algorithm in Section 3.1 that is the solution to the optimization subproblem and the stopping criterion. For this purpose, we rewrite the integrality constraints by introducing m strictly quadratic convex constraints, that is replacing the constraints zi

For the numerical tests of Models 1 and 2, the definitions for the parameters can be found in the literature of Sawik (2011), where dj
                      is uniformly generated from the set [100, 500]. Therefore, from the above discussion, the variance is equivalent to a convex quadratic function and optimising the conditional value-at-risk measure is equivalent to solving a linear optimization problem. To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in this paper, we compare the performance of the algorithm of this paper with Algorithm 2 of Qu et al. (2014a). With m suppliers and n customer orders, Table 1
                      lists the numerical results for the applications of the algorithm on this paper and Algorithm 2 of Qu et al. (2014a) to Models 1 and 2 respectively. In the numerical tests, the maximum number of customer orders n is set at 100. The specified confidence level α under the conditional value-at-risk measure is set at 0.99. The number of iterations (“Iter”) and computing time in seconds (“CPU”) are reported in Table 1. Generally, the proposed algorithm in this paper outperforms Algorithm 2 of Qu et al. (2014a) on CPU time, suggesting that the algorithm is efficient and the theoretical assertions about the new algorithm are verified.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A proximal point algorithm was proposed for linearly constrained C-convex vector optimization. By using a compact subset of the positive polar cone of C, we show that a (weak) Pareto optimal solution of (1.1) can be reduced to solve the scalar convex problem (2.1). Then a proximal point algorithm is presented based on this result. The main feature of our approach is to solve a convex scalar subproblem at each iteration. We show that when the chosen set is a subset of the quasi-interior of C
                     * or the objective function is strictly C-convex or A is column full rank, a Pareto optimum of (1.1) can be obtained. Every time, the algorithm can only find one (weak) Pareto optimal solution. Hence, the choice of an initial solution may yield different solutions. However, if there are infinite (weak) Pareto optimal solutions, it is difficult to find the entire solution set. Further studies of the proposed proximal point algorithms can be extended to vector bi-level problems commonly found in supply chain networks, which have characteristics that complicate the vector optimization that is described in Section 1.
