               Abstract
               
                  This article investigates new score and accuracy functions for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). The novelty of these functions is that they allow the comparison of IVIFNs by taking into account of the decision makersâ€™ attitudinal character. The new attitudinal expected score and accuracy functions extend Xu and Chen's score and accuracy degree functions, and verify the following set of properties: (1) boundedness; (2) monotonicity; (3) commutativity; and (4) symmetry. These novel functions are used to propose a total order on the set of IVIFNs, and to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision making selection process in which the final result depends on the decision maker's risk attitude. In addition, a ranking sensitivity analysis with respect to the risk attitude is provided.
