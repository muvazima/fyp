                  Model risk has a huge impact on any risk measurement procedure and its quantification is therefore a crucial step. In this paper, we introduce three quantitative measures of model risk when choosing a particular reference model within a given class: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Each of the measures has a specific purpose and so allows for flexibility. We illustrate the various notions by studying some relevant examples, so as to emphasize the practicability and tractability of our approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The specification of a model is a crucial step when measuring financial risks to which a portfolio, or even an institution, is exposed. Common methodologies, such as Delta-Normal or simulation methods, are based on the choice of a particular model for the risk factors, including for instance, equity, interest-rate or credit risk. Even when using historical methods, we implicitly rely on the empirical distribution as the reference model. However, it is observed that the final risk figure is often quite sensitive to the choice of the model. The hazard of working with a potentially not well-suited model is referred to as model risk. The study of the impact of model risk and its quantification is an important step in the whole risk measurement procedure. In particular, in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, understanding model uncertainty when assessing the regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions seems to be crucial. The main goal of this paper is precisely to propose some ways to quantify model risk when measuring financial risks for regulatory purposes. We stress that our objective is not to measure risk in the presence of model uncertainty, but to quantify model risk itself.

The question of the impact of model risk has received increasing attention in recent years. In particular, the significance of minimum risk portfolios has been questioned when studying the problem of optimal asset allocation: several authors (among them El Ghaoui et al., 2003; Fertis et al., 2012; Zymler et al., 2013) have recently considered this issue from a robust optimization perspective.

Our approach to assessing model risk is very general. It is based on the specification of a set of alternative models (or distributions) around a reference one. Note that Kerkhof et al. (2010) propose measuring model risk in a similar setting by computing the worst-case risk measure over a tolerance set of models. Our approach differs, however, as we introduce different measures of model risk, based on both the worst- and best-case risk measures, in order to serve different purposes.

Examples of the set of alternative models we can consider include parametric or non-parametric families of distributions, or small perturbations of a given distribution. If we believe in a parametric model, we can consider all distributions within the family whose parameters are in the confidence intervals derived from the data. By doing this, we are accounting only for the estimation risk (see Kerkhof et al., 2010). If, on the other hand, we completely believe in some estimated quantities, without relying on confidence intervals, we can consider all possible distributions of any form which are in accordance with those quantities. We can also consider those distributions which are not too far from a reference one, according to some statistical distance (the uniform distance, for instance), or all joint distributions that have the same marginals as the reference one. This latter example leads to the relevant problem of aggregation of risks in a portfolio (see Embrechts et al., 2013). We could even specify different pricing models if the portfolio contains derivatives.

Note that the scope of our approach is very wide, going beyond issues pertaining just to statistical estimation. Furthermore, the assessment of model risk should not be confused with the analysis of statistical robustness of a risk measurement procedure (as in Cont et al., 2010), even though the two concepts are related. Indeed, the reference distribution is an input in our approach, while in Cont et al. (2010) it is the result of a statistical estimation process which is part of the definition of robustness itself.

In order to assess model risk, we introduce three different measures: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Our aim is to provide a quantitative measure of the model risk we are exposed to in choosing a particular reference model within a given class when working with a specific risk measure. All three measures are pure numbers, independent from the reference currency. They take non-negative values and vanish precisely when there is no model risk. Each of the measures we propose has a specific purpose and therefore can be used in different contexts: whilst the absolute measure is cardinal and gives a quantitative assessment of model risk, both the relative measure and the local measure are ordinal and allow for comparison of different situations, which may have different scales. If we consider different possible models as references, the use of the relative measure is probably the more natural measure to use as it will give a clear ranking between the alternatives. When the reference model is almost certain, the local measure becomes an obvious choice as it focuses on the very local properties around the reference model.

The measures of model risk we propose can be applied in different contexts. To briefly illustrate this flexibility, we mention here two examples: first, GARCH Value-at-Risk (VaR) procedures and then, computation of Additional Valuation Adjustments (AVA).

Firstly, within the standard GARCH approach for market VaR estimation, the mean 
                        
                           μ
                           ^
                        
                      and standard deviation 
                        
                           σ
                           ^
                        
                      (or volatility) of the returns are estimated using a GARCH model; moreover, the innovations, i.e. the returns standardized by the estimated means and volatilities, are assumed to be normally distributed. Therefore, the VaR is computed under the assumption that returns are normally distributed with parameters 
                        
                           μ
                           ^
                        
                      and 
                        
                           σ
                           ^
                        
                     . The model risk that arises from the normality assumption can be quantified using one of the measures presented in this paper. As alternative models, we may consider all distributions (not necessarily normal) with mean 
                        
                           μ
                           ^
                        
                      and standard deviation 
                        
                           σ
                           ^
                        
                     .

Secondly, let us consider the recent Capital Requirements Directives (CRD) for the financial services industry, enforced since 2013 in the EU. Under the CRD, financial institutions are required to calculate AVA in all situations in which the market value of an asset is not clear. This should reflect the model risk involved in the valuation of the position. In particular, the last draft of the Regulatory Technical Standard
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Available at www.eba.europa.eu.
                      issued by the European Banking Association proposes that: “institutions shall calculate the model risk AVA by determining a range of plausible valuations produced from alternative appropriate modelling and calibration approaches.” (Article 11). So, by formally replacing risk measures with valuations in our framework, the measures of model risk we propose could be effectively used for this purpose.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, as a motivating example, we show how the Basel multiplier can be seen as a rough measure of model risk. In Section 3 we present the definition and the main properties of absolute and relative measures of model risk. Some examples, using alternative sets of distributions based on fixed moments or small perturbations, are provided in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss local measures of model risk and Section 6 concludes.

In this section, we start by looking at the Basel multiplier, introduced by the Basel Committee as an ingredient in the assessment of the capital requirements for financial institutions. As we will see, this multiplier is closely related to probabilistic bounds giving some upper limit to classical risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall. These preliminary remarks will motivate our approach when introducing some measures for model risk in the next section.

Within the Basel framework, financial institutions are allowed to use internal models to assess the capital requirement due to market risk. The capital charge is actually the sum of six terms taking into account different facets of market risk. The term that measures risk in usual conditions is given by the following formula:

The constant λ is called the multiplier and it is assigned to each institution by the regulator, which periodically revises it. Its minimum value is 3, but it can be increased up to 4 in the event that the risk measurement system provides poor back-testing performances. Given the magnitude of λ, it is apparent that in normal conditions the second term is the leading one in the maximum appearing in (1).


                        Stahl (1997) offered a simple theoretical justification for the multiplier to be chosen in the range [3, 4]. Here, we briefly summarize his argument. Let X be the random variable (r.v.) describing the Profits-and-Losses of a portfolio due to market risk. If the time-horizon is short, it is usually assumed that

                        , a). We can see that for usual values of α (i.e. from 1 percent to 5 percent), the ratio broadly lies in the interval [3, 4]. Therefore, if the VaR computed under normal assumptions is multiplied by λ, we obtain an upper bound for the worst possible VaR compatible with partial information (mean and variance) we have.

We can then extend this argument to the Expected Shortfall.

                        (see Fig. 1, b) we see that a proper multiplier for the Expected Shortfall would be in the range [4, 8].

The second inequality in (2) is sharp, i.e. it cannot be improved for any q. However, the first inequality is certainly not sharp and this means that the upper bounds for VaR and Expected Shortfall that we derived above are not optimal ones.

Better results for the bounds can be achieved by using the Cantelli inequality which concentrates on a single tail. A possible version of this inequality states that for a standard r.v.

Indeed, we will recall later that the sharp bound is, in this case,

We can plot the ratio between the sharp upper bound and the risk measure computed under Gaussian hypotheses and compare it with the ratio we obtained before, using the Chebishev bounds. The results are in Fig. 2
                        . We can notice that for the Expected Shortfall, the actual ratio (i.e. the one based on the sharp bound) is much lower than the ratio based on the Chebishev bound and the actual multiplier should be in the range [3, 4] for the Expected Shortfall as well. This also means that assessing the impact of model uncertainty using Chebishev bounds can give us misleading answers regarding the Expected Shortfall.

Therefore, it becomes apparent that an accurate analysis and understanding of the sharp bounds for the considered risk measure is essential in the assessment of model risk. Any other bounds may lead to an inaccurate assessment of the model risk and as a consequence to potential errors in any associated decision process. For that reason, in this paper we introduce different measures of model risk based on sharp bounds (both lower and upper bounds). The explicit computation of those bounds will then be a crucial step.

In this section, we introduce two different notions of measures of model risk. We will work with a given risk measure, a given reference model and a set of alternative models. Our aim is to provide a quantitative measure of the model risk we are exposed to in choosing this particular reference model within a given class when working with a specific risk measure. Two measures are introduced: the absolute measure of model risk provides a cardinal measure whilst the relative measure of model risk is ordinal and allows for comparison between various situations.

We first introduce some basic notation and assumptions to be used here and in the sequel to this paper. A probability space

                        satisfy these assumptions. We stress that Value-at-Risk is defined over all random variables, while the Expected Shortfall requires an integrability condition on the left tail of X. More generally any law-invariant coherent risk measure falls in our framework, a chief example being the class of spectral risk measures (see Acerbi, 2002). In view of the law invariance property, we can alternatively regard a risk measure as a functional directly defined on a suitable set of distributions. Indeed, with a slight abuse of notation, we can set ρ(F) = ρ(X) for X ∼ F.

We now introduce two measures of model risk. Both measures are associated to a risk measure ρ, a r.v. X
                        0, to act as a reference distribution hypothesis, and a set 
                           L
                         of r.v., to act as alternative distribution hypotheses. In this paper, we do not discuss the selection procedure for the reference distribution, and refer to Alexander and Sarabia (2012), where some specific criteria are reviewed.

The absolute measure is a concept which in a sense generalizes the Basel multiplier: indeed, by multiplying ρ(X
                        0) by AM + 1 we reach the maximum risk that is attainable within 
                           L
                        . So, if we interpret 
                           L
                         as a set of possible departures from the reference model X
                        0, then AM quantifies how bad the worst possible case is. Plainly, AM ≥ 0 with AM = 0 (i.e. no model risk) if and only if X
                        0 has already a worst-case distribution, i.e.

                                 )

It is apparent that, for given ρ and X
                        0, the larger 
                           L
                         is the greater AM is, as 
                           
                              
                                 ρ

                                 (
                                 L
                                 )
                              
                           
                         is increasing in 
                           L
                        . This justifies the qualifier absolute that we give to AM, even though it comes in the form of a ratio.

By contrast, RM has a relative behaviour. Indeed, the difference

                              We note that this measure is also non-negative and vanishes precisely when there is no model risk. However, it is expressed in terms of a given currency and depends on the scale of the risk X
                              0. Since AM = MK
                              /ρ(X
                              0), the absolute measure proposed here is a unit-less version of MK
                              , normalized by the size of the risk. We think that this normalization allows us to use AM also as a comparison tool between different situations.

In the different context of derivative pricing, Cont (2006) proposed a measure of model risk which is based on the computation of extremal prices using a set of pricing measures. The obtained measure is formally similar to our definitions.

In the next proposition, we collect some basic properties of the two measures of model risk previously introduced. For any

                        Such an inequality can be partly explained by the fact that the model risk associated with (X
                        1 + X
                        2)/2 is due both to the model risk of the marginals and to the model risk of the joint distribution.

Thanks to (9), we see that other possible properties for RM (like monotonicity, continuity, etc.) are inherited from similar properties of the risk measure. Subadditivity, a property which is fulfilled by all coherent risk measures, is an exception. Indeed, if we know that ρ(X
                        1 + X
                        2) ≤ ρ(X
                        1) + ρ(X
                        2), and that

In this section, we illustrate both measures of model risk and study the following example: we consider a r.v. X
                     0 with a reference distribution in the set 
                        
                           
                              L
                              
                                 μ
                                 ,
                                 σ
                              
                           
                           ,
                        
                      which corresponds to the set of all r.v. with mean μ and standard deviation σ, and we estimate both measures of model risk for two measures of risk, namely VaR and Expected Shortfall. Without any loss of generality, as previously discussed, we can restrict our attention to the particular case where the set of r.v. is 
                        
                           L

                     .

                        L
                      that will be useful for the rest of the paper.

Adopting a similar approach for the Expected Shortfall is not so easy since Lemma 4.2 gives a result on the extremal quantiles, but not on the extremal Expected Shortfalls. However, a recent result by Berstimas et al. (2004) (Theorem 2) using arguments from convex analysis gives the following identities for the extremal Expected Shortfalls on the set

                           Remark 4.8
                           As mentioned earlier, we cannot use Lemma 4.2 to obtain the Extremal Shortfalls. However, we may wonder whether the Extremal Shortfalls in (11) are obtained as Expected Shortfalls of some extremal distributions. Since the Expected Shortfall is monotone with respect to the stop-loss order (see for instance Bäuerle and Müller, 2006), we look at the extremal distributions for the stop-loss order on the set

                              . Following Hürlimann (2002), we use the fact that the stop-loss transform for a distribution F is defined as:

We numerically compute both measures of model risk for standard (i.e. in 
                           
                              L

                        ) r.v. following the normal or Student-t distribution. We are especially interested in the dependence of the measures on the order α of the Value at Risk or the Expected Shortfall. This dependence is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4
                        
                        .

It is natural to expect that using a reference fat-tailed distribution (Student-t) yields lower model risk than starting with a normal one. While for the Expected Shortfall this is true for any practical

                         value of α, for the Value-at-Risk this holds only for α small enough (α≲1.5 percent).

We can also notice that the relative measure of model risk, for both VaR and Expected Shortfall and for both distributions, goes to 1 as α → 0. In other words, as we go further in the (left) tails, any given distribution departs more and more from the worst case. We think this is a general behaviour, although we offer no proof for this claim.

The graphs in Fig. 5
                         compare the absolute (a) and relative (b) measure of model risk for VaR and Expected Shortfall, using a normal reference distribution. We see that in both cases the Expected Shortfall has a lower level of model risk. By taking a Student-t as the reference distribution we obtain a similar behaviour. This is probably at odds with what we would expect: indeed, it is often said that Expected Shortfall is more sensitive to the model choice than VaR as the former depends on the whole left tail.

                         Instead, at least with respect to our two measures of model risk, the opposite proves true.

In this section we introduce a local measure of model risk, by taking the limit of the relative measure RM on a family of perturbation sets that shrink to the singleton {X
                     0}. This measure attempts to assess model risk for infinitesimal perturbations.

                              provided the limit exists.

The limit defining LM is evidently in the form 0/0; however, if it exists, then it is in the interval [0, 1] as RM(X
                        0, L
                        ɛ) ∈ [0, 1] for any ɛ. The local measure describes the relative position of ρ(X
                        0) with respect to the worst and best cases for infinitesimal perturbations.

In what follows, we will consider the case ρ = VaR
                           α
                         for some α, so that

                         is the set of all r.v. and we will make no reference at it in the definition of 
                           
                              L

This result is quite natural as the set of perturbations is in a sense asymptotically symmetrical around X
                        0. Therefore the relative measure of model risk converges to 1/2. However, we stress that this is true only in the limit ɛ → 0 and not for a fixed ɛ.

                           Remark 5.3
                           We stress that (1 − θ)F
                              0 + θFY
                               is in general not the distribution of (1 − θ)X
                              0 + θY, even if we assume X
                              0 and Y to be independent. Rather, it is the distribution of (1 − IA
                              )X
                              0 + IAY, where A is an event of probability θ, independent from both X
                              0 and Y, and IA
                               denotes its indicator function.

                              This result allows us to compute the relative measure of model risk with respect to 
                                 
                                    L

                               for finite values of ɛ.

As an illustration we compute the local measure of model risk when X
                        0 is standard normal or Student-t (see Fig. 6
                        ). Consistent with the observations we made in the last section, regarding the relative measure, we see that starting with a fat-tailed reference distribution yields a lower local measure with respect to a normal distribution only when α is small enough.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The study of the impact of model risk and its quantification is an essential part of the whole risk measurement procedure. In this paper, we introduce three quantitative measures of the model risk when choosing a particular reference model within a given class: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Each of the measures we propose has a specific purpose and so allows for flexibility in their use. We obtain explicit formulae in some interesting cases, in order to emphasize the practicability and tractability of our approach. However, our contribution is not limited to the study of these particular examples and our measures of model risk can be applied to more general settings.
