                  Coronary bifurcation lesions are complex. Whether a critical condition exists in the stenotic side branch (SB) of bifurcation lesions, according to the Medina classification, is unassessed. Computational models of coronary bifurcations were developed with different stenosis severities and locations, in order to study the flow distribution and wall shear stress (WSS) in the SB. It was found that bifurcation lesion type (1,0,1) had a flow ratio of 0.25, much less than the corresponding normal ratio of 0.47, and the 0.46 and 0.39 ratios computed for lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), respectively. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) was associated with a 47% reduction from normal coronary flow, resulting in coronary branch steal. Blood flow to the SB decreased as the stenosis severity increased and approached the carina, in the proximal, distal, and side branches. Similarly, WSS values decreased with increasing stenosis severity. Bifurcation type (1,0,1) had the lowest WSS values in the SB, and were below the 0.5Pa threshold for atherosclerotic growth. In conclusion, the results suggest that lesion type (1,0,1) is at the greatest risk of coronary branch steal, leading to potential ischemia, as well as further atherosclerotic growth. This is counterintuitive to the Medina classification, where bifurcation type (1,1,1) is usually considered the most severe.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries. Abnormal thickening of the vessel wall, referred to as atherosclerosis, is a progressive disease that can lead to significant luminal narrowing, resulting in a reduction of blood flow and inducing ischemia. Pathological examination of diseased vessels has indicated that arteries that bifurcate are more likely to develop atherosclerotic lesions [1,2]. Coronary bifurcation lesions are defined as the vascular narrowing of one or more of the three branches of the bifurcation, namely the main branch proximal (MBP), the main branch distal (MBD), and the side branch (SB). Coronary artery bifurcations are prone to the development of atherosclerotic plaque, due to hemodynamic factors such as unsteady and disturbed flow [3].

Currently, there are at least seven classifications that categorize bifurcation lesions [4–10]. The Medina classification [6] is a simple and straightforward system of classification that has been adopted as the preferred system to classify bifurcation lesions in the clinical setting. A critical luminal narrowing of 50% or greater in any of the three vessels is assigned the binary value 1. Otherwise, the vessel receives a value of 0. In this context, it becomes apparent that the Medina classification is purely an anatomical classification scheme (
                     Fig. 1) [11]. The primary advantage of the Medina classification over other classification schemes is that it is easy to remember.

The term SB is reserved for vessels considered less important than the main branch, typically the daughter vessel with the smallest diameter. In numerous cases, however, such as in the bifurcation of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the SB, specifically the left circumflex artery (LCX), is as important as the main branch [4]. In particular, occlusion of the SB has been recognized as a contributing factor for the etiology of myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence, post-intervention [12–14]. A recent clinical study conducted by Hahn et al. [14] found that the presence of a moderate SB stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was an independent predictor of SB occlusion post-PCI, after main vessel stenting.

Gould et al. [15] introduced the novel concept of coronary branch steal, where blood flow is directed away from the stenotic daughter vessel during hyperemia, due to the interaction of stenoses proximal and distal to the bifurcation carina with the non-stenotic branch. As a result, flow through the stenotic distal branch is decreased to below resting control values. In cases of non-occluding partial stenoses where collateral flow may not be fully developed, the potential for steal-induced ischemia significantly increases. This is very important from a clinical perspective. It becomes evident that a further understanding of the critical nature of the SB in bifurcation lesions is required, in order to improve overall patient outcome.

There is little information available about the impact of stenosis severity and location on coronary flow distribution in bifurcations, in the context of coronary branch steal. The aim of this work is to investigate coronary branch steal in the critical side branch of coronary bifurcation lesions, according to the Medina classification [6]. Emphasis is placed on analyzing multi-lesion configurations with a SB stenosis, in order to investigate which lesion type, if any, presents significant coronary branch steal. To further investigate the critical SB, the impact of stenosis severity and location on WSS in the SB is analyzed. While significant work has been done analyzing WSS in coronary arteries and its impact on plaque progression, there are fewer studies conducted to evaluate WSS in bifurcation lesions [16–22]. To date, only the works of Binu et al. [21] have analyzed WSS in diseased bifurcations according to the Medina classification, but have not studied WSS in the SB of true bifurcation lesions. Therefore, using computational fluid dynamics, coronary bifurcation models are studied with various stenosis severities and lesion locations, in order to investigate the flow and WSS distributions in the critical SB.

The geometric models of the coronary bifurcation presented in this work simulated the bifurcation of the LMCA into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the LCX. For computational purposes, the geometry of the coronary arteries was simplified to a cylindrical conduit, with diameters corresponding to clinical arteriography data. The dimensions of the idealized coronary arteries were 4.2mm for the MBP, 3.2mm for the MBD, and 3mm for the SB [23]. The diameters of the simulated coronary arteries had a fractal ratio of 0.67, thus satisfying Finet׳s law of coronary bifurcations [24]. The bifurcation angle between the centreline of the MBD and SB was 75°, corresponding to typical anatomical values [25].

To ensure fully developed flow at the inlet and downstream of the lesions, the branch lengths were extended, and determined based on the respective diameters of the mother and daughter vessels. A MBP length corresponding to 15D
                        MBP was utilized, and the daughter vessels had branch lengths of 12D
                        MBD and 11D
                        SB for the MBD and SB, respectively, measured from the center of the bifurcation to its end. It is known that the hydrodynamic entrance length, L, for achieving 98% fully developed flow is approximated by the following equation: L=0.05ReD [26,27], where Re is the Reynolds number and D is the vessel diameter. For the LMCA, this would correspond to an entrance length of approximately 32.8mm (using a Reynolds number of 156, calculated from a maximum flow rate of 1.7mL s-1) The extended branch domain used for computational analysis provided sufficient length for a parabolic-like profile to be established, and thus, the assumption of fully developed flow was reasonable.

The stenosis geometry was modeled using the geometry of experimental work completed by Ahmed and Giddens [28], with Gaussian symmetric surface morphology. The total lesion length was restricted to 6mm, lending to a more focal stenosis. To investigate the variance of flow and WSS, vessels with mild to moderate stenoses were used for the first set of analyses. Lesions of different diameter stenoses, 22.5%, 30%, and 50%, were utilized to construct models associated with the Medina classification. The same percent diameter stenosis was imposed in the MBP, MBD, and SB, for each model. Stenoses were positioned at the bifurcation carina. Nine geometric models were created for this computational study. Examples of the computational configurations can be seen in 
                        Fig. 2(a).

The second set of simulations investigated the effect of lesion location on flow distribution and WSS. Diameter stenoses of 50% were imposed on the vessels, according to the Medina classification. Stenoses were placed at the bifurcation carina, as well as 0.003m and 0.006m away from the carina, for a total of nine geometric models. Examples of the implemented configurations are shown in Fig. 2(b).

Only true bifurcation lesions were considered for analysis, defined as the occlusion of two or more vessels, where one of the vessels is the SB.

Hemodynamic analyses were conducted using COMSOL 3.5 (Burlington, MA, USA), a multi-physics simulation software used for engineering applications. The governing equations of blood flow in the computational domain were solved using the finite element method. For both sets of analyses, blood was taken to be Newtonian (a commonly used assumption [18,29,30]), and the flow was modeled using the incompressible and transient Navier–Stokes equations

                         the velocity vector (ms−1), p the pressure (Pa), and µ the viscosity of the fluid (Pas). The Newtonian properties of blood were µ=0.0035Pas, and ρ=1060kgm−3 
                        [31]. The assumption of Newtonian flow in this study can be considered valid, as the vessels׳ diameters were greater than the 100µm threshold considered for microcirculation. As a result, the shear rate was higher than 100s-1, the critical value below which non-Newtonian behavior dominates [32]. Furthermore, studies conducted by Johnston et al. concluded that a Newtonian model was a good approximation for blood flow and sufficient for use in numerical studies, rather than implementing a non-Newtonian fluid model [33].

To solve the governing equations, boundary conditions representative of the physiological conditions were required. Blood flow was considered to be unsteady, with a fully-developed laminar profile, resulting in a parabolic velocity distribution at the inlet [22]. The use of an extended branch domain allowed for a parabolic inlet velocity profile to be implemented. A time-dependent velocity profile for a healthy LMCA was obtained from literature, as shown in 
                        Fig. 3 
                        [34]. The waveform velocity has a period of T=0.8s, where 0<t (s)<0.25 is systolic flow and 0.25<t (s)<0.8 corresponds to diastole [35]. The arterial flow at peak diastole in the MBP was 102.2mLmin−1.

It has been clinically observed that blood flow, in the presence of coronary disease, is modified due to downstream vascular resistance adaptation. In order to reflect the resulting reduction of flow, the inlet flow was reduced, according to stenosis severity as it is clinically observed. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is used to assess the physiology of coronary lesions and its response to vasodilatory agents, and is defined as the ratio of myocardial flow in the presence of a stenosis to the myocardial flow without a stenosis. A FFR value of less than 0.75 indicates functionally significant lesions [36]. Utilizing the FFR definition, one can characterize the resulting flow variation in the presence of an arterial lesion from the normal flow during the cardiac cycle. According to a clinical study conducted at Tokyo Women׳s Medical University [37], the following FFR values are within the physiological range of diseased arteries with varying stenosis severity: 0.95 for a 22.5% diameter stenosis, 0.85 for a 30% stenosis, and 0.78 for a 50% stenosis. Therefore, the reduced inlet velocity was estimated, as followed:

For the vessel outlets, a commonly used outflow boundary condition was employed; specifically, a zero gauge pressure was applied at the MBD and SB [16,38]. Since the lesions located in the MBP, MBD, and SB are far from the outlet, flow in a nearly fully developed state can be re-established.

The computational domain was meshed using COMSOL 3.5, and mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out for three different mesh densities. Fluid domains were discretized into coarse, medium and fine meshes, with 64,581, 95,595 and 163,442 tetrahedral elements, respectively. Unsteady simulations were performed and velocity field variations were assessed. Simulation results showed only a peak difference of 6% between the medium and fine mesh densities, compared to a 9.5% difference between the coarse and medium mesh. Considering the nominal difference in the velocity fields between medium and fine mesh densities, and the resulting discrepancy of computing time, a medium mesh density of approximately 95,000 elements was used for analysis.

The flow ratio, defined as the ratio of the maximum flow of the SB to the MBP during the cardiac cycle, was calculated using the following equation:

@&#RESULTS@&#

The influence of specific stenosis geometric parameters on flow conditions and WSS distribution in the critical SB were investigated. More specifically, stenosis severity and plaque proximity to the bifurcation carina were analyzed, in order to assess their implication on coronary branch steal, the potential for disturbed shear stress and the associated continued atherosclerotic growth.

The effect of stenosis severity was analyzed using percent diameter stenoses corresponding to mild and moderate lesions. Models with a 22.5%, 30%, and 50% diameter stenosis were investigated. First, blood flow distribution from the MBP to the SB was established for a typical healthy LMCA. Simulation results yielded a flow ratio of 0.47 for maximum flow during diastole. Conservation of mass dictates that the flow distribution through a bifurcation would be approximately 0.5. The value determined in this simulation was reflective of the difference in diameters of the MBD and SB. Flow ratios were similarly determined for all true bifurcation lesion types, and for each stenosis severity. The computed ratios of maximum blood flow in a stenotic SB to the maximum blood flow in the MBP are presented in 
                        Table 1.

According to the Medina classification, bifurcation lesion type (1,1,1) is identified as the riskiest and most severe lesion. As shown in 
                        Fig. 4(a), however, lesion type (1,0,1) resulted in significantly less blood flow to the stenotic SB than lesion type (1,1,1), particularly as the severity of the stenosis increased. When a 50% diameter stenosis was imposed on all branches, lesion type (1,0,1) had a flow ratio of 0.25, much less than the 0.46 and 0.39 ratios computed for lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), respectively. It was also interesting to observe that blood flow in the stenotic lesion type (0,1,1) remained relatively stable, despite a significant increase in stenosis severity from the healthy state (Fig. 4(b)). While lesion type (1,0,1) had a SB flow reduction of 47% at a 50% stenosis, lesion type (0,1,1) had only a 2% decrease of flow to the SB.

Plaque proximity to the bifurcation carina was investigated to enhance current understanding of its effect on flow distribution to the SB. Vessels with a 50% diameter obstruction were analyzed, where the stenosis location varied between 0 and 6mm from the bifurcation carina. The ratio of the maximum flow in a stenotic SB to the maximum MBP flow was computed in a similar manner to the first set of analyses. The resulting flow ratios are provided in 
                        Table 2 and graphically in 
                        Fig. 5(a). It can be observed that vessels with lesions located immediately proximal or distal to the bifurcation carina, that is, lesions directly at the carina, resulted in less blood flow to the stenotic SB. The computed flow ratios further confirmed the initial findings that lesion type (1,0,1) presented more severe reduction in SB flow than lesion (1,1,1), in the context of flow distribution. Lesion type (1,0,1) consistently resulted in the lowest flow ratios for all lesion locations analyzed, in comparison to the other Medina bifurcation lesion types. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the percent reduction of flow to the SB was not as severe as with variance of the percent stenosis diameter. It is interesting to note, however, for lesions located 6mm away from the carina, there was only a small appreciable reduction in flow for lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), with a variance of −2% and 2%, respectively. Lesion type (1,0,1), however, still exhibited significantly decreased flow perfusion to the SB, with a 36% reduction from normal flow values.

The effect of stenosis severity on WSS distribution and magnitude was also assessed. To illustrate the variation of WSS, WSS was computed along the outer wall of the SB, downstream from the lesions. Previous investigations indicated that more critical WSS values occur along the outer wall of the vessel, rather than the inner wall [40]. WSS values along the generation line A–A′, as shown in 
                        Fig. 6(a), were determined at peak diastolic phases. WSS distribution for all stenosis severities can be seen in Fig. 6(b–d).

Examination of the WSS along the outer wall of the SB for different degrees of stenosis confirmed that the lesion severity significantly affected WSS magnitude and distribution. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the magnitude of WSS decreased with increasing arterial stenosis. For 22.5% and 30% diameter stenoses, fully developed flow was re-established relatively quickly (Fig. 6(b and c)). The post-stenotic region of the 50% diameter stenosis, however, was irregular and complex before fully developed flow was re-established. Similar to the flow distribution studies, WSS values along the SB outer wall was lowest for lesion type (1,0,1), rather than the (1,1,1) lesion.

Next, WSS distribution along the outer wall of the SB was determined for a healthy LMCA, in order to determine the amount of WSS reduction in diseased vessels. After developed flow was re-established downstream from the carina, a steady-state WSS value of 1.76Pa was measured for the side branch. As shown in 
                        Fig. 7, lesion type (1,0,1) had the greatest reduction of WSS. For the most severe case, the (1,0,1) lesion type had a 73% reduction of WSS, compared to a 30% and 45% reduction for lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1), respectively.

The effect of lesion location on WSS distribution and magnitude was also investigated in a similar manner. The distribution of WSS along the SB outer wall is presented in 
                        Fig. 8(a–c).

Similar to the previous set of analyses, the post-stenotic flow region was highly irregular before fully developed flow was re-established. It was observed that WSS decreased as the lesion was positioned closer to the bifurcation carina. As illustrated in Fig. 8, stenoses located immediately proximal or distal to the carina had the lowest WSS values. The distribution of WSS along the SB outer wall was lowest for lesion type (1,0,1), after fully developed flow was restored, regardless of the plaque proximity to the bifurcation carina.

Comparison of the WSS values to a typical, healthy LMCA is presented in 
                        Fig. 9. As expected, the reduction of WSS was greatest for lesion type (1,0,1), rather than lesion (1,1,1), or (0,1,1).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The results of the analyses conducted provide insight into cases of coronary disease where clinical intervention is often controversial. In particular, in cases of mild and moderate stenoses, when intervention is not always attempted, the potential for further complications can arise. Clinical studies have indicated the critical nature of the SB in coronary artery bifurcations, particularly when considering the LMCA bifurcation, and the LCX. Despite the critical nature of the SB, previous investigations have not focussed on quantitatively analyzing the influence of a stenotic side branch on flow distribution from an interventional perspective. This was the first study of its type to investigate true bifurcation lesions with a stenotic SB, in the context of the Medina classification, analyzing both the flow through the SB and its WSS distribution. The results of the simulations presented previously aid in the identification of significant disease, from the potential for coronary branch steal and atherosclerotic development. A greater understanding of the critical SB can assist in employing a potentially more effective treatment strategy.

CFD analysis was conducted to study the blood flow distribution through various coronary bifurcations, in the context of the Medina classification. To further understand the critical nature of the SB, the ratio of maximum diastolic flow of the SB to the MBP was analyzed. The results demonstrated that lesion type (1,0,1) resulted in the lowest percentage of blood flow to the stenotic SB. As the stenosis severity increased, the percentage of flow to the SB decreased. For a 50% diameter stenosis, only 25% of the MBP flow was directed to the SB for lesion type (1,0,1), a resulting drop in blood perfusion to the SB of approximately 50%. This reduction in flow corresponds to the phenomenon referred to as coronary branch steal [15]. Coronary branch steal can induce ischemia, due to the restriction of oxygenated blood to the myocardium, leading to potentially irreversible cellular damage. In cases of non-occluding partial lesions, such as those considered in this study, where collateral perfusion may not be well-developed, the ramifications of branch steal become clinically important [41]. Ischemia induced by coronary branch steal can lead to increased myocardial vulnerability, resulting in a decreased capacity for additional myocardial perfusion in response to cardiac stress.

From an interventional standpoint, the results of the two flow distribution studies where plaque proximity to the carina and stenosis severity were analyzed, are potentially important. It is evident that lesion type (1,0,1) results in significant coronary branch steal, though clinically the stenosis severity is considered only moderate. Stenosed vessels such as these are considered to be at the threshold for intervention, and some clinicians may choose not to intervene. FFR is typically utilized in bifurcation lesions to assist in clinical diagnosis, but cumulative effects related to branch steal may result in an overestimation or underestimation of disease severity, when FFR is measured across a branch stenosis [15,42]. Therefore, significant complications may be present in bifurcation lesions that could be underestimated by FFR. This idea is of clinical importance when a patient presents with a (1,0,1) bifurcation lesion, as the results indicate that this lesion type, and not the (1,1,1) configuration, is the most severe of the Medina bifurcation types. Furthermore, it was found that a moderate stenosis of 50% in the MBP and SB resulted in a critical condition in the SB, due to severe blood flow reduction. Therefore, additional intervention may be needed in cases frequently treated less aggressively and without percutaneous intervention.

The flow distribution to the SB in lesion types (1,1,1) and (0,1,1) was not as critical as those presented in type (1,0,1). In configuration (1,1,1), there was a small decrease in the perfusion to the stenotic SB, but only a maximum decrease of 17% was observed from healthy coronary flow. Lesion type (0,1,1) had stable blood perfusion to the SB, regardless of stenosis severity or location. For this configuration, a critical condition in the stenotic SB did not develop.

Overall, from the perspective of flow distribution, and the resulting potential for steal-induced ischemia, it appears that the Medina classification does not identify the riskiest disease in a clinical setting, with lesion type (1,0,1) having the greatest potential for ischemia-related complications. This is counter-intuitive to the classification, for which a (1,1,1) lesion is expected to be more severe. While lesion type (1,1,1) had a decrease in blood perfusion to the SB, it is likely not severe enough for ischemia-induced myocardial vulnerabilities.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a causal link between alterations of hemodynamic parameters at various sites within the vascular system and the early development of atherosclerosis [43,44]. It is well known that angulations and bifurcations within the coronary arterial tree result in significant hemodynamic alterations, leaving the associated coronary arteries more prone to atherosclerotic growth [1,18]. The presence of arterial stenoses further amplifies hemodynamic interferences. These hemodynamic alterations will result in abnormalities in the WSS distribution along the vessel wall. It has been well established that arterial regions exposed to low and non-uniform WSS are more prone to the growth of atherosclerotic pathologies [17,45,46]. Studies indicate that atherosclerosis is localized to regions of disturbed flow, where WSS values are lower than 0.5Pa in magnitude [43].

Numerical analyses were performed to assess the influence of hemodynamic disturbances associated with different configurations of bifurcation pathologies on WSS. From a clinical standpoint, the results of these studies are important, as further plaque interference can lead to additional complications, such as a worsening of atherosclerotic symptoms or total lumen occlusion, leading to MI. In the first set of analyses, stenosed bifurcations with a 22.5%, 30%, and a 50% diameter stenoses were considered, which correspond to mild and moderate stenoses in angiographic thresholds for arterial intervention. It was observed that lesion type (1,0,1) exhibited the lowest WSS values for all models. Low WSS regions, which are linked to atherosclerosis progression, occur within the recirculation zone immediately distal to the stenoses. These regions of low WSS were observed for all lesion types, and for stenoses with a percent diameter of 30% and 50%, the WSS magnitude within the recirculation zone was lower than the 0.5Pa threshold value. Interestingly, after fully developed flow was re-established downstream, only lesion type (1,0,1) had stabilized WSS values lower than 0.5Pa, at a 50% diameter stenosis. While lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1) had reduced WSS values for this configuration, they were well above the threshold for plaque growth [43]. Similar results were seen when plaque proximity to the bifurcation carina was analyzed. Lesions located immediately proximal or distal to the carina had the greatest influence on WSS, and exhibited lower values for all models. Lesion type (1,0,1), however, was the only configuration that had stabilized WSS values lower than the threshold value of 0.5Pa.

The results of this study indicate that while investigations reporting the critical nature of the SB are relevant, it is largely dependent on the lesion configuration. With regards to atherosclerotic progression, lesion type (1,0,1) is at the greatest risk for continued atherosclerotic growth, and potential for total vessel occlusion, particularly since its downstream WSS values are lower than the threshold value. Lesion types (1,1,1) and (0,1,1) are at risk for continued plaque progression, but the risk for plaque growth is not significant further downstream of the lesion, where WSS values are within the healthy range. While a potentially critical condition can result in the SB of all lesion types studied, due to low WSS values, it is type (1,0,1) that is most critical from a clinical standpoint, due to severe flow reduction and exposure to low WSS. In this context, it is apparent that the Medina classification is not as intuitive as initially proposed, as it does not identify riskier disease, with lesion type (1,0,1) posing the greatest risk for further atherosclerotic disease and branch steal complications.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

There were some limitations in the present study. First, the geometries used in this work were a series of idealized three dimensional axisymmetric stenoses, with an idealized left main coronary artery bifurcation. The geometric model was based on a planar, straight vessel representation, while coronary arteries are often curved. Vessel curvature can skew the velocity profile, impacting WSS values. It is important to note, however, that the motivation behind this study was to investigate the effect of lesion configuration on the hemodynamics of the SB. By using straight vessels, the study only investigates the effect of the lesion configuration on the flow distribution and WSS.

In this study, the percentage and length of the stenoses were fixed. Clinically, lesions vary significantly, with diffuse disease occurring in various places along the vessel. Relative stenosis severity should be considered to determine its impact on flow distribution, and, in particular, branch steal. A relatively focal lesion of 6mm was used in this investigation. The length of stenoses can vary between 10 and 20mm, with longer lesions commonly found [47]. From a clinical perspective, a longer lesion length will result in a greater pressure drop; the lower the perfusion pressure, the more functionally significant the lesion is. For the domain investigated in this study, however, focal lesions are acceptable, as the primary focus of the study was the effect of lesion configuration, and, therefore, the use of diffuse disease was not essential.

The compliance of the vessels was not taken into account in this study, and the vessel was considered as a rigid wall boundary. Since the tissue simulated in this study was diseased, this was a reasonable assumption. The compliance of healthy arterial tissue is typically between 7% and 10%, while peak compliance for diseased tissue is characteristically around 3% [48,49]. In this case, the compliance of the vessel would not significantly affect the flow profiles, and therefore is not essential to take it into account.

The inlet velocity profile was assumed to be parabolic, and fully developed flow was established. To assess the use of fully developed flow, an additional simulation was conducted to investigate the effect of a non-parabolic velocity profile on flow distribution. The most severe configuration, lesion type (1,0,1) with a 50% diameter stenosis, was utilized, with a plug velocity profile applied at the inlet. In order to assess the development of the inlet profiles downstream, velocity contours were formulated 0.035m from the inlet. There was very little variation between the contours, indicating that fully developed flow had been largely established in the MBP with an inlet plug profile. A weighted percent difference yielded a maximum variation of 1.6%. Similarly, velocity contours were formulated for the primary region of interest, namely, the side branch. The offset was 0.0165m, half of the total length of the branch. Similar to the MBP, the amount of variation between the two profiles was not significant. A maximum variation of less than 1% was found between the plug and parabolic profiles. The results of this simulation indicate to the authors that the use of fully developed inlet flow is reasonable. With an inlet plug profile, it was apparent that flow became approximately 98% fully developed prior to the bifurcation carina. Consequently, it is the opinion of the authors that the use of fully developed flow at the inlet is justified, and the conclusions drawn from the numerical results remain unchanged.

As previously stated, blood was assumed to be Newtonian in this study. Numerical investigations were conducted to investigate the effect of Newtonian versus non-Newtonian viscosity models on wall shear stress values [50]. The non-Newtonian behavior of blood was modeled using the Carreau model. Numerical simulations indicated minimal differences between the non-Newtonian and Newtonian models (with differences ranging from 0.803% to 6.74%). While small differences were found, the results of the numerical simulation indicated that the assumption of Newtonian flow was justified, and did not affect the conclusion of the study.

Future work should consider the use of patient-specific arterial geometry, as well as patient-specific flow values for the inlet boundary condition, rather than baseline velocity reductions extrapolated from typical diseased FFR values. Furthermore, non-zero pressure values at the outlets should be implemented, to account for the downstream vascular bed in the modeled domain. The inclusion of patient-specific data and the downstream vascular bed will provide more physiological results.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study analyzed the influence of stenosis severity and location on coronary branch steal and time dependent WSS, in order to investigate the critical nature of the stenotic SB in true bifurcation lesions, according to the Medina classification. The results of the investigation demonstrated that the presence and relative location of lesions in coronary artery bifurcations produced a significant impact on the flow and WSS distribution in the SB. In particular, it was found that blood perfusion to the SB in lesion type (1,0,1) was significantly reduced, corresponding to the phenomenon of coronary branch steal. Examination of the WSS distribution showed that regardless of the plaque location or stenosis severity, lesion type (1,0,1) resulted in the lowest values of WSS. It was apparent that a critical condition developed in the SB of lesion type (1,0,1), while the stenotic SB remained relatively stable in lesion types (0,1,1) and (1,1,1). These observations support the notion that lesion type (1,0,1) presents riskier and more detrimental disease, which is counter-intuitive to the Medina classification. Further studies focussing on realistic representations of the coronary bifurcation and plaques should be performed, with more diffuse disease, to further investigate and verify the results regarding the critical side branch.
