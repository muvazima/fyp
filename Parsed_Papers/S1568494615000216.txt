                  This paper examines the problem of output feedback control of a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy fishery system. The considered system is the continuous age structured model of an exploited population that includes a nonlinear stock–recruitment relationship. The effort is used as control term, the age classes as states and the quantity of captured fish per unit of effort as measured output. In order to stabilize the stock states around the references equilibrium, which means biologically the sustainability of the fish stock, the output feedback controller is adopted, rather than a controller based on the state observer. An algorithm based on the linear matrix inequality is proposed to compute the static output feedback gain. Simulation results of the continuous fishery systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design.
