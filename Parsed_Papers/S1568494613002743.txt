                  In this paper, we address the minimum energy broadcast (MEB) problem in wireless ad-hoc networks (WANETs). The researches in WANETs have attracted significant attentions, and one of the most critical issues in WSNs is minimization of energy consumption. In WANETs the packets have to be transported from a given source node to all other nodes in the network, and the objective of the MEB problem is to minimize the total transmission power consumption. A hybrid algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and local search is presented to solve the MEB problem. A power degree encoding is proposed to reflect the extent of transmission power level and is used to define the particle position in PSO. We also analyze a well-known local search mechanism, r-shrink, and propose an improved version, the intensified r-shrink. In order to solve the dynamic MEB problem with node removal/insertion, this paper provides an effective simple heuristic, Conditional Incremental Power (CIP), to reconstruct the broadcast network efficiently. The promising results indicate the potential of the proposed methods for practical use.
