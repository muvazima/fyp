               Abstract
               
                  A combined MEMS Inertial Navigation System (INS) with GPS is used to provide position and velocity data of land vehicles. Data fusion of INS and GPS measurements are commonly achieved through a conventional Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Considering the required accurate model of system together with perfect knowledge of predefined error models, the performance of the EKF is decreased due to unmodeled nonlinearities and unknown bias uncertainties of MEMS inertial sensors. Universal knowledge based approximators comprising of neural networks and fuzzy logic methods are capable of approximating the nonlinearities and the uncertainties of practical systems. First, in this paper, a new fuzzy neural network (FNN) function approximator is used to model unknown nonlinear systems. Second, the process of design and real-time implementation of an adaptive fuzzy neuro-observer (AFNO) in integrated low-cost INS/GPS positioning systems is proposed. To assess the long time performance of the proposed AFNO method, wide range tests of a real INS/GPS with a car vehicle have been performed. The unbiased estimation results of the AFNO show the superiority of the proposed method compared with the classic EKF and the adaptive neuro-observer (ANO) including a pure artificial neural network (ANN) function approximator.
