                  Non-profit organizations like the Meals On Wheels (MOW) association of America prepare and deliver meals, typically daily, to approximately one million homebound individuals in the United States alone. However, many MOW agencies are facing a steadily increasing number of clients requesting meal service without an increase in resources (either financial or human). One strategy for accommodating these requests is to deliver multiple (frozen) meals at a time and thus make fewer deliveries. However, many of the stakeholders (funders, volunteers, meal recipients) value the relationships that are developed by having a client receive daily deliveries from the same volunteer. Further, meal recipients may be concerned with the quality of food delivered in a frozen meal. In this paper, we develop a method for introducing consolidation into home meal delivery while minimizing operational disruptions and maintaining client satisfaction. With an extensive computational study, the savings associated with various levels and types of disruptions are detailed. The question of whether delivering frozen meals will enable an agency to both save money and deliver meals to a larger client base is also studied.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

On a daily basis, non-profit organizations like the Meals On Wheels Association of America (MOW) deliver approximately one million meals throughout communities in the United States. Within each of these communities, many individuals aged 60 and older rely on government funded programs like MOW to meet their dietary needs for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. In addition to the aging population, MOW serves individuals who are incapable of sustaining themselves due to medical limitations. The assistance MOW provides helps their clients remain comfortable in their homes instead of requiring them to relocate to subsidized housing or nursing homes, either at personal or government expense. Individuals who wish to receive free or reduced-cost meal assistance must qualify, where the qualification process also determines the number of meals the individual should receive in a week. To deliver meals, MOW relies on a workforce comprised of both professionals and volunteers from each community, and routes between 800,000 and 1.2 million volunteers annually in the United States (Meals On Wheels Association of America, 2009).

MOW is seeing a steadily increasing demand for meals. From 1980 to 2002, the demand for meals in the United States increased by 290 percent. While contributions from private organizations and cost reduction efforts have helped MOW to increase the number of meals it delivers, their capabilities have not grown at the same rate as demand. As a result, MOW agencies are often forced to put some or all of the clients deliveries on a wait-list, although this is clearly undesirable. Similarly, MOW anticipates a significant increase in the number of seniors in America that face the threat of hunger (8.3. million in 2010, 9.5 million projected in 2025), and has stated that its vision is to end senior hunger by 2020 (Meals On Wheels Association of America, 2012).

One strategy for reducing costs and widening its client base that some MOW agencies have undertaken (while there is a national association, agencies are locally owned and operated) is to deliver frozen meals. An official from New York City stated, “for us it’s really been about creating a more efficient system and not having anyone on a waiting list.” That same official mentioned that by delivering frozen meals twice a week to 40 percent of its recipients they were able to reduce the number of professional drivers they paid from seventeen to three (Kelley, 2008). Similarly, delivering frozen meals has enabled MOW agencies to serve recipients in rural areas that, given limited driver resources, were too costly to reach on a daily basis (Gibson, 2004). By using frozen meals, MOW agencies find the benefits of consolidating deliveries that many other transportation providers have already discovered. However, while frozen meals allow for considerable cost savings, there are several operational challenges.

While the primary purpose of a MOW agency is to provide nutritious meals to those who cannot provide one for themselves, many agencies and their supporters (both volunteers and funders) also see themselves as providing human interactions and relationships to those who may otherwise have little human contact (Kyle, 2012). As an example, many MOW agencies like to invoke the slogan “more than just a meal.” Thus, while there are some clear efficiencies that can be gained by delivering frozen meals, some funding agencies that support MOW programs are reticent to support their delivery as they fear doing so will diminish the health monitoring capabilities of Meals On Wheels. Further, many have claimed that the quality of the frozen meals delivered is too inferior to hot meals (DeSio, 2008) to justify any savings realized.

Like major parcel delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS, MOW faces the problem of making home deliveries in large sized communities, containing demand at varied locations, and with delivery routes limited by vehicle capacity. However, while industry leaders in parcel delivery have the engineering and financial resources to invest in technology that handles these routing scenarios and to answer strategic what-if questions regarding how deliveries are made, many community based MOW agencies do not. Creating a good set of routes that are repeated on a daily basis can be difficult enough without an advanced routing algorithm. Consolidating deliveries on those routes may require the creation of a unique route for each day of service, putting an even greater strain on the MOW agency’s limited operational resources.

This paper presents a methodology that MOW agencies can use to effectively introduce frozen meal delivery, which in turn allows for consolidation, into their delivery operations while limiting operational disruption and client dissatisfaction. Transportation costs incurred by executing daily routes with and without consolidation are compared in an extensive computational analysis that details the operational disruptions and quality of service metrics that most impact these costs. It is found that the impact on savings from consolidation when operational disruptions are prohibited is much smaller than when high standards for quality of service metrics are enforced. However, even with high quality of service standards, the savings are significant, with transportation costs often reduced by more than 20 percent. For MOW agencies that are operating at such tight margins, those savings can have a very significant impact. One of the primary objectives of MOW agencies is to serve meals to as many individuals as possible. Thus the second part of the computational study focuses on whether consolidation can increase the number of meals delivered while still reducing transportation costs. The study also examines how operational disruptions impact the potential for consolidation to both increase access and reduce costs.

While this work is presented in the context of its inspiration, Meals On Wheels, the methodology and results presented are pertinent to any organization that wishes to quantify the tradeoffs between consolidating deliveries and maintaining high levels of customer service, such as a mail delivery or LTL carrier. Various initiatives to reduce operating costs of the United States Postal Service (USPS) have been proposed, in particular the elimination of Saturday delivery (Hicks, 2013). However, reducing operating costs through the elimination or consolidation of service days without upsetting customers is likely to be very difficult for the USPS. The methodology presented here allows for operational consolidation while minimizing the change from current routing (likely to be important for any postal carrier), maintaining a consistent client-provider relationship (important for both the carrier and customer), and limiting the number of days between service (important for the customer). Further, it shows that the USPS may be afforded some flexibility in selecting how to reduce service, as eliminating Saturday delivery may be less attractive since it leaves two consecutive days without service. Eliminating service on other days of the week would have no difference in terms of routing, while limiting the number of days between service. As the USPS continues to explore various possibilities for service consolidation, the methodology developed here is certainly applicable.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Some of the earliest work on the home meal delivery problem was presented in Bartholdi, Platzman, Collins, and Warden (1983), which used space-filling curves as the basis of a system that could be implemented on two rolodex cards. While this work is fundamentally different from ours, the emphasis on operational ease is shared. In the setting of this problem, clients currently receive hot meals five days a week and the agency has an established set of delivery routes that are executed daily. Based on those routes, the approach presented in this paper can maintain consistency with historical operations by ensuring that a client remains on the same route as before, and that clients are seen in the same order.

Introducing consolidation into daily delivery routes is reminiscent of vendor-managed inventory or the Inventory Routing Problem (Andersson, Hoff, Christiansen, Hasle, and Løkketangen, 2010); (Campbell, Clarke, Kleywegt, and Savelsbergh, 1998). However, we consider constraints that have not been included in the inventory routing problem. For example, this approach can support fixed routes (Beasley, 1984; Erera, Savelsbergh, and Uyar, 2009) by serving the clients in the same order on every route. Such a restriction can have many operational advantages, including making it easier to synchronize the meal preparation and vehicle loading process. This problem is inherently periodic and thus shares characteristics with the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP). A review of the PVRP may be found in Francis, Smilowitz, and Tzur (2008), with numerous algorithms developed to solve this problem recently, including the use of variable neighborhood search (Hemmelmayr, Doerner, and Hartl, 2009), a hybrid genetic algorithm (Vidal, Crainic, Gendreau, Lahrichi, and Rei, 2012), a set covering heuristic (Cacchiani, Hemmelmayr, and Tricoire, 2014) and an ant colony optimization model (Yu and Yang, 2011). However, like the work on the PVRP with Service Choice (Francis and Smilowitz, 2006; Francis, Smilowitz, and Tzur, 2006; 2007), the number of times an individual is visited is not an input to our model but a decision variable, allowing for additional flexibility in the delivery plan. We further extend the flexibility enabled by the PVRP with Service Choice to allow for multiple deliveries to be made in one visit, while maintaining consistency of service.

Another advantage of executing the same delivery route every day is that such a delivery system is inherently equitable for meal recipients. MOW is concerned with ensuring that its clients are treated equitably and thus the methodology presented in this paper maintains equity by ensuring that when one client receives a hot meal, all do. Equity is also considered in the distribution of supplies in a disaster relief setting in Huang, Smilowitz, and Balcik (2012), Tzeng, Cheng, and Huang (2007) and a review of how equity has been considered in other routing problems that appear in the nonprofit or public sector may be found in Balcik, Iravani, and Smilowitz (2010). To the best of our knowledge there has been no work done on Inventory Routing Problems that consider equity issues.

With equity in mind, this approach can also enforce various quality of service-type metrics. For an agency that is concerned with the quality disparity between frozen and hot meals, this approach can ensure that each client receives at least a minimum number of hot meals. For an agency that wishes to maintain the relationships their drivers have with clients this approach can enforce a maximum number of days between visits and that a client is always visited by the same driver. Quality-of-service metrics were also studied in the context of inventory routing in Coelho, Cordeau, and Laporte (2012), including driver consistency where each customer is seen by one driver. To help foster relationships between clients and delivery persons we also enforce such a rule; the benefits of such a delivery system are discussed in Smilowitz, Nowak, and Jiang (2013).

To determine the potential efficiencies associated with delivering frozen meals, the problem of introducing consolidation is formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP). Different variants of this MIP are considered, based on the constraints to be enforced, e.g. fixed routes, a maximum number of days between deliveries to a client, etc. By formulating the variants as MIPs, specialized algorithms are not needed; instead, we leverage the efficiency of commercial MIP solvers such as Gurobi (Optimization, 2012), that have become very effective at solving large-scale instances of hard optimization problems. Along with formulating MIPs of the different variants, a characteristic of the fundamental problem is exploited to limit the solution space, allowing for shorter computational times and suggesting managerial implications regarding consolidating hot meal preparation to certain days. Finally, a heuristic for reducing the feasible region of the MIP is proposed that leads to significantly shorter solve times without sacrificing solution quality.

For MIP instances or variants that cannot be solved in reasonable run-times with a commercial solver, Integer Programming-based (IP-based) heuristics are presented. These heuristics leverage techniques from machine learning, namely k-means clustering (Marsland, 2009). IP-based heuristics have proven to be very effective at quickly producing high quality solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems, including those in network design (Crainic, Hewitt, Toulouse, and Vu, 2014; Hewitt, Nemhauser, and Savelsbergh, 2010), and vehicle routing (De Franceschi, Fischetti, and Toth, 2006; Doerner and Schmid, 2010; Salari, Toth, and Tramontani, 2010). By using an IP-based heuristic, the same algorithmic framework can be used for each problem variant, only the integer program solved at an iteration need change to reflect the constraints to be enforced.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, the problem of introducing consolidation is presented along with several constraints used to limit operational disruption and client dissatisfaction. In Section 4 the heuristic used in this study is developed. In Section 5 techniques proposed for reducing the time required to solve the integer programs executed in the course of the heuristics presented in Section 4 are proposed. Section 6 contains the results of an extensive computational study of the benefits associated with consolidation under various settings and the solution techniques proposed. Finally, Section 7 provides managerial insights based on the results.

We next describe the problem of introducing consolidation into routes that are executed by a set of delivery vehicles, v ∈ V, every day, t, over a planning horizon, T, to deliver M meals to each individual, and how this problem is modeled as a MIP. This research was motivated by discussions with a Meals On Wheels agency in Rochester, NY that delivers meals during the work week (partially because of the availability of its volunteer and paid drivers) and only receives funding to deliver five meals to each individual. Thus, one week consisting of five days (i.e. |T| = 5) is used for this problem and M = 5. However, the work presented in this paper can be easily adapted to agencies that deliver seven meals over seven days a week or that seven meals over five days a week.

In this work, it is assumed that the solution for a week can be used repeatedly to provide service over a longer period, such that frozen meals left at the end of one week may be used in the following week. Each day the set of delivery vehicles begin at a common depot, D, visiting a set of clients, I, delivering a single meal to each, and returning to the depot. To preserve the quality of the meals delivered, they are stored in a container which can hold at most K meals. In the computational study in Section 6, K is the same for both frozen and hot meals. The cost of traveling from client i to client j is denoted by cij
                     .

By delivering frozen meals and, in particular, multiple meals on a single day, the delivery route may skip a client on certain days. Thus, the decision variable

                      the number of hot meals delivered by vehicle v. Because hot and frozen meals cannot be in the same meal container (and each vehicle carries at most one container), delivering a hot meal to one client on day t precludes delivering frozen meals to any client that day by that vehicle. Thus, the variable rvt

                     The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with travel. Constraints (1) and (2) ensure that each client is seen by exactly one delivery person during the week. Constraint (3) ensures that each client receives enough meals, whereas constraint (4) ensures that a client is not delivered a hot or frozen meal on a day unless the delivery vehicle visits them on that day. Note that an individual can receive at most M frozen meals or one hot meal in one delivery. We note that because at most one hot meal can be delivered at a time, when M > |T| we force the delivery of frozen meals during the planning horizon. Constraints (5) and (6) together ensure that if one client receives a hot meal on day t then no other client receives a frozen meal on that day. Note constraint (5) also ensures that when hot meals are delivered on a day, every client receives a hot meal that day. Constraint (7) ensures that vehicle capacity for meals is not exceeded. Constraints ((8)–(11)) are standard routing constraints. From a complexity perspective, when |T| = 1, all

                              i
                              c
                           
                           
                              v
                              t
                           
                        
                      variables can be fixed to zero, as there is no incentive to deliver frozen meals instead of hot meals. This special case of the HMCD is the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, a well-known NP-Hard optimization problem, proving that the HMCD is NP-Hard as well.

While the HMCD ensures that each client receives a certain number of meals a week, it requires little else. From the delivery agency’s perspective, it may yield delivery routes that vary significantly by day, which could complicate administrative tasks. From the client’s perspective, the use of frozen meals limits the number of deliveries and the time for interaction between client and volunteer, harming this relationship. Also, some clients only receive frozen meals, which they may enjoy less than hot meals. Thus, we next discuss constraints that can be added to the model to mitigate negative side effects associated with delivering frozen meals. Then, in Section 6 an extensive computational study is reported regarding how different combinations of these constraints impact costs.

The modifications to the model discussed in this section are meant to minimize the degree to which consolidation can change the daily operations of the Meals On Wheels agency. This can be done by ensuring that the new set of routes for the delivery vehicles follows a pre-defined order throughout the week, by fixing the assignment of clients to drivers, or by maintaining consistency with respect to the order clients are visited in the current daily routes. We note that while our motivating application involves a five day planning horizon, these constraints may be used without change if the planning horizon is instead seven days.

Fixed routes, or a set of routes that visit locations in the same order every day, often offer advantages over routes that vary by day. For home meal delivery, a fixed route can make it easier to synchronize the meal preparation and vehicle loading process (e.g., when clients request vegetarian or kosher meals). Similarly, while some routes are executed by volunteers, some are done by professional drivers, with the same driver executing the route every day. In this case, even though some clients may be skipped on some days, ensuring that they are always visited in the same order can make executing the delivery route easier. Thus, to ensure the delivery routes follow a fixed ordering of clients, we define the variable

                              Constraints (13) and (14) are standard ordering constraints, with the first ensuring that either i precedes j or j precedes i, and the second ensuring for a triplet i, j, k the “ordering” i → j → k → i is not allowed. Finally, constraint (15) ensures that daily travel corresponds to the ordering prescribed for the week. These are referred to as the fixed route constraints.

The model focuses on introducing consolidation into routes that are already executed on a daily basis by the same MOW provider, and, typically, in the same order on every day. However, the HMCD, even with the fixed route constraints above, may change the vehicle, and therefore the driver, that services a client. A driver may have developed a bond with his or her clients and disrupting that bond in the interest of operational efficiency may be undesirable. In this case, an agency may prefer to keep clients assigned to the same vehicles as on the currently established routes. Consistency with clients is maintained by adding the constraint:

                              This is referred to as the client consistency constraint. When these constraints are added to the HMCD, it separates into a single-vehicle variant of the problem for each vehicle.

The HMCD may also change the order in which clients are visited on currently established routes, even with the fixed route constraints above. As with the developed client relationship, a driver may have an established route that he or she is familiar with and disrupting that route may add some intangible operating costs. Therefore, it may be of interest to keep the order in which clients are visited the same as on the currently established routes. Consistency with order of clients is maintained by adding the constraint:

While consolidation has been shown to yield tremendous savings in many settings, Meals On Wheels is primarily focused on the wellness and betterment of its clients. Thus, the client experience within a meal delivery program that delivers frozen meals is of utmost importance. The human interactions and relationships offered by Meals On Wheels may be maintained by limiting the number of days that can elapse between visits. Also, a minimum may be placed on the number of hot meals that each client receives as most prefer these to frozen meals.

One of two algorithms is used to introduce consolidation into daily delivery routes, with the choice of algorithm dependent on whether client consistency is enforced. Each algorithm is based on solving restrictions of the HMCD, and thus can be used (unchanged) when the model is extended to include other constraints such as the fixed route or delivery frequency constraints. In describing these algorithms, the constraints described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are collectively referred to as operational considerations.

                              are added to the HMCD, the problem separates into a single-vehicle variant of the problem for each vehicle. In this case, consolidation is achieved by solving |V| restrictions of the HMCD, one for each vehicle, which we do to (near-) optimality with a commercial integer programming software package. Specifically, Algorithm 1
                               is executed.

When client consistency is not enforced, the HMCD does not separate by vehicle, leaving an optimization problem that, for realistically-sized instances, is difficult to solve to near-optimality with off-the-shelf software. As a result, we use the heuristic presented in Algorithm 2
                               to introduce consolidation into daily delivery routes. This heuristic begins by executing Algorithm 1, which optimally introduces consolidation into routes, one route at a time. As such, Algorithm 2 begins with the best possible set of routes when client consistency is enforced and then looks to improve upon them.

Thus, the heuristic then repeatedly solves restricted versions of the HMCD in which certain values are fixed. These restricted versions are created by first partitioning the set of vehicles into subsets,

That is, all but the delivery quantity variables are fixed for a subset of vehicles. Then, for the remainder of the vehicles, a subset of the client-assignment variables are fixed (but none of the routing variables are fixed).

We note that our implementation of Algorithm 2 uses a limit on total execution time as a stopping criteria (Step 2) and in the experiments reported on later that execution time was limited to one hour.

The k-means clustering algorithm (Marsland, 2009) is used to partition the vehicles and clients into the subsets. The purpose of k-means clustering is to partition n data points into k clusters such that each data point is in the cluster whose mean is closest. While determining the optimal set of k clusters for a fixed k is NP-Hard, many computationally effective and efficient heuristics have been developed. In particular, we use the heuristic k-means + + (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007) which has been shown to have approximation guarantees. To use the k-means + + algorithm to partition a set of objects into groups each object must be represented by a data point. Once this representation of each object is determined, the k-means + + algorithm may be executed to cluster the data points into groups. The representations for vehicles and clients is discussed next.

To partition the vehicles into groups a 2|T|-dimensional data point is created for each vehicle containing the average (x, y) coordinates for that vehicle for each day over the problem horizon. Assume the coordinates (xi, yi
                              ) are given for each client and that vehicle v sees mt
                               clients on day t. The average coordinates for each day are calculated as

The algorithms discussed in Section 4 repeatedly solve instances of problems that are identical in structure to the HMCD. Thus, to improve the ability of these algorithms to find high quality solutions, techniques for reducing the time required to solve this problem are discussed next. The first technique fixes the days when hot meals can be delivered while the second fixes the number of deliveries that occur during the week.

Some analysis of the disruption constraints discussed above can be useful in restricting the solution space of the HMCD. When guaranteeing a minimum number of hot meals and a maximum time between visits, the scheduling options can be limited without losing efficiencies. For example, given a time horizon of five days (|T| = 5), if at least two hot meals must be delivered to each individual (H = 2) and at most two days are allowed between visits, then there is an optimal solution to HMCD where hot meals are delivered on days two and four (Tuesday and Thursday). Because changing the day on which a route is executed does not have an effect on the cost of that route, any feasible solution that satisfies the constraints of two hot meals and at most two days allowed between visits may be converted to a solution where deliveries occur on Tuesday and Thursday. While this observation has algorithmic implications in that instances of the HMCD may be solved in much less time by fixing rvt
                               variables, it also has practical implications. Specifically, it implies that an agency only needs to prepare hot meals on specific days and thus resource requirements for meal preparation may be re-allocated.

This observation may be generalized into a lemma that considers any time horizon or meal delivery schedule. We use t
                              max to represent the minimal value of the maximum number of days between visits given a time horizon of m days (|T| = m) and n minimum hot meals (H = n). The value of t

This may be repeated for all vehicles v ∈ V. Changing the day on which a route is executed does not have an effect on the cost of that route, so the cost of this new solution is the same as the original solution. This new solution is still feasible because the number of hot meals delivered to each client during the time horizon remains the same, while there are t
                                    max or fewer days between deliveries, satisfying this constraint. Thus, any optimal solution to the HMCD can be translated to a solution where the first hot meal is delivered on day

This lemma may be extended beyond the MOW problem, simplifying the solution methodology for any type of service consolidation, allowing for delivery on certain days to be fixed. Implementing Lemma 5.1, when it applies, only requires restricting the HMCD further by fixing the appropriate rvt
                               variables (which indicate whether vehicle v delivers a hot meal on day t) to zero or one.

Unlike the previous technique, which does not render infeasible all optimal solutions to an instance of the HMCD, our next can, and thus is a heuristic. This technique first solves an integer program that is a variation of the HMCD, minimizing the number of deliveries (

This yields the fewest number of deliveries, γ, that still satisfy the constraints regarding the delivery of meals to clients, capacity of vehicles, and any other operational considerations enforced. Next, the HMCD is solved with the constraint

                              Note the routing constraints (8)
                              (11) do not add additional constraints on the number of deliveries, so the HMCD with constraint (20) is feasible. However, one can construct examples where all optimal solutions to an instance of the HMCD require more than γ deliveries and thus the procedure is in fact a heuristic. We omit such an example for brevity.

In this section we study three questions:

                        
                           •
                           Are the techniques for reducing the time required to solve an instance of the HMCD that are discussed in Section 5 effective? This question is answered in the affirmative in Section 6.2.

Given a set of clients that are currently being served, what is the savings potential of delivering frozen meals, as doing so enables consolidation and some deliveries to be skipped on some days, as compared to delivering a hot meal every day to each of those clients? This question is answered in Section 6.3.

Given a set of clients that are currently being served and another set of clients that are currently on a wait-list, by delivering frozen meals how many wait-listed clients can be served a meal while still reducing costs as compared to delivering a hot meal every day to each currently served client? This question is answered in Section 6.4.

While answering these questions, the impacts of the operational constraints discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are also analyzed by considering different combinations of these constraints to enforce. The experimental setting for the computational analysis is next discussed.

To derive a robust analysis with respect to the source and scale of instances used in our experimental study, two sets of instances from the literature are used and modified to reflect the nature of Meals On Wheels’ operations. The first set consists of the 14 Christofides instances from Christofides and Eilon (1969), whereas the second consists of the 19 instances from Golden, Wasil, Kelly, and Chao (1998). We note that the instances from Golden et al. (1998) are substantially larger than those from Christofides and Eilon (1969), with an average of 343.57 clients in an instance, whereas in the Christofides and Eilon (1969) instances the average number of clients is 113.42.

Specifically, instances from both sets are modified so that each client has a demand of one unit per day (in our context, a meal) and each volunteer vehicle has a capacity of eight (the size of a meal container according to a local agency). The number of vehicles is then adjusted so that the utilization of each vehicle is roughly 90 percent. Details of the resulting instances from each set can be found in Table 6.1
                        a–c.

To perform a thorough experimental analysis of the impact of the operational constraints discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, different combinations of the constraints are considered by adjusting the right-hand-side values. Specifically, for each constraint the settings presented in Table 2
                         are considered when executing Algorithm 1 or 2. However, only combinations of settings that are sensible are considered (e.g. experiments are not run where three hot meals are required and three days are allowed between deliveries as requiring three hot meals ensures at most two days between deliveries). The operating environment of the agency that motivated this research is such that they currently only deliver meals on weekdays and deliver one meal to each client on each day. Thus, for all experiments we have |T| = 5 and M = 5.

In a practical application of the algorithm, the initial solution will be the set of pre-existing daily routes currently used by the provider that are executed every day of the problem horizon, delivering a hot meal to each client on each day. Given that pre-existing routes do not exist for the modified instances, a heuristic that is similar to the work presented in De Franceschi et al. (2006) is used to create these daily routes. We note that our implementation of this heuristic produced routes with costs that are within 5 percent of the costs associated with the best known solution for the instances presented in Christofides and Eilon (1969). As such we felt that it was reasonable to use this heuristic to generate the daily routes that are used in Step 1 of Algorithm 1 and when Algorithm 2 executes Algorithm 1 to create a starting solution. Note that most MOW providers do not utilize advanced routing techniques such as this heuristic, and thus their current daily routes may not be as cost efficient.

After the heuristic establishes the baseline daily routes providing service to every client on each day, either Algorithm 1 or 2 is applied, depending on whether client consistency is enforced in that experiment (as discussed in Section 4) to introduce consolidation. Then, comparisons can be made between the cost of the solution produced by the appropriate algorithm with the costs of the baseline routes. When solving integer programs in the context of executing either Algorithm 1 or 2, Gurobi 4.6 (Optimization, 2012) is used with the optimality tolerance parameter set to 1 percent. When solving instances of HMCD in the course of executing Algorithm 1, solution time is limited to 10 minutes. When solving restrictions of HMCD in the course of executing Algorithm 2, solution time is limited to one minute. Finally, the complete runtime for Algorithm 2 is limited to one hour. All times reported in this section are in seconds.

First, we jointly analyze the computational impact of the techniques proposed in Section 5 for reducing the time required to solve an instance of the HMCD. Specifically, we analyze the impact of implementing Lemma 5.1, wherein the days on which hot meals are delivered are fixed, and the heuristic for solving instances of the HMCD, wherein the number of deliveries is fixed. To do so we solve each instance of the HMCD encountered in the course of executing Algorithm 1 for each modified Christofides instance four times, according to the following configurations:

                           
                              •
                              No-hot meal, no-delivery: Without fixing the days on which hot meals are delivered or the number of deliveries,

Yes-hot meal, no-delivery: With fixing the days on which hot meals are delivered, but not the number of deliveries,

No-hot meal, yes-delivery: Without fixing the days on which hot meals are delivered, but with the number of deliveries fixed,

Yes-hot meal, yes-delivery: With fixing the days on which hot meals are delivered and the number of deliveries.

As mentioned before, fixing hot meal delivery days is achieved through constraining the appropriate rvt
                         variables to take on the value zero (or one). Fixing the number of deliveries corresponds to adding constraint (20) to the HMCD.


                        Table 3
                         reports, by configuration, the average time (Time) spent solving each of the HMCD instances and the percentage of them solved (percent Solved) to an optimality tolerance of 1 percent in a time limit of sixty seconds. We see that individually the techniques are effective, with each on its own reducing the time spent solving instances and increasing the percentage solved. However, jointly, they are most effective, reducing the time spent solving instances by over 30 percent while also solving over 20 percent more to an optimality tolerance of 1 percent.

As discussed above, fixing the number of deliveries through constraint (20) can render the optimal solution to an instance of the HMCD infeasible. However, a comparison of the primal solutions produced by solving the HMCD both with and without constraint (20) indicated that solutions produced when the constraint was added were only 0.12 percent worse. Thus, for all future experiments this heuristic was used along with fixing the days on which hot meals can be delivered.

In the following analysis we determine the savings potential of delivering frozen meals, which in turn enables consolidation, and how the different operational settings discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 impact that potential. This is done by executing the appropriate algorithm (Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2) with the appropriate operational considerations to produce a solution with consolidation. The cost of executing that solution is then compared with the cost of the initial solution fed to the algorithm in order to calculate the savings. The results are divided into those wherein client consistency is maintained and where it is not.

We first examine in Fig. 1
                         the relationship between the number of clients in an instance and the savings potential. We report the average savings over all instances from both sets (Christofides and Eilon, 1969; Golden et al., 1998) and all constraint settings with respect to operational considerations and client dissatisfaction depicted in Table 2. We see that while the savings do not increase monotonically in the number of clients, there are typically much greater savings with larger numbers of clients. We also see that while enforcing client consistency does not impact savings for the smaller, Christofides and Eilon (1969) instances, it does with the larger instances from Golden et al. (1998), and the magnitude in the savings difference tends to be larger with larger numbers of clients. We note that all results presented after Fig. 1 are averages over both sets of instances.

We next focus on the impact of the operational disruption constraints discussed in Section 3.1. Note we did not consider enforcing order consistency without enforcing fixed routes as it seemed unlikely a MOW agency would want to ensure that clients are seen in the same order as in the current set of daily routes yet allow the routes to vary from one day to the next. Similarly, if client consistency was not enforced then order consistency was not either as the two constraints are, as defined in this paper, incompatible. Finally, we note that the results presented in Table 4
                        a and b are averages over all settings for the client dissatisfaction constraints with respect to delivery frequency and hot meal.

As might be expected, using frozen meals leads to considerable cost savings. However, these results show that significant cost savings (27.78 percent) may be found solely through consolidation and without changing delivery routes other than to skip some deliveries on some days. From a managerial perspective, this is important as it indicates that operational costs may be reduced with minimal change management required for the pool of drivers. We next see that if an agency wishes to maintain the client-volunteer relationship, ensuring that routes are fixed does not significantly reduce savings. However, by allowing both new client-volunteer relationships to develop and routes to vary by day, greater (7.77 percent more) savings can be found.

While the impact on drivers may be minimized, consolidation also leads to clients receiving more frozen meals and fewer visits. Thus, we next focus on the impact of the client dissatisfaction constraints discussed in Section 3.2. As before, we separate the results into those where client consistency was enforced (Table 5
                        a) and those where it was not (Table 5b). These results are averages over all settings for the operational disruption constraints.

As these constraints directly impact the degree to which consolidation can occur, they have a much greater impact on savings than the operational disruption constraints. As might be expected, savings decrease as less consolidation is allowed (either because more hot meals are required per week or fewer days between deliveries are allowed). However, a 19 percent cost savings still results when a minimum of three hot meals are required. Allowing two frozen meals per customer is equivalent to removing one day of service to each customer. While this is not a drastic adjustment to MOW operations, with such tight margins, even a savings of 19 percent can be significant. With respect to the degree of consolidation in our results, we find that the heuristic produces solutions that deliver at or near the maximum number of frozen meals possible given the constraint setting. For example, in the more flexible settings where up to three days are allowed between deliveries, nearly four frozen meals are delivered in the average visit. Averaging over all constraint settings, the number of frozen meals delivered in a typical visit is 2.23.

Next, the analysis turns to whether consolidation can enable both savings and an expansion of the client set served. For these experiments, assuming |I| clients are in an instance, 0.1*|I| new clients are randomly distributed across the region spanned by the original |I| clients. However, only the original |I| are served by the initial delivery routes. The “extra” 0.1*|I| clients model the wait-list that many agencies have for clients they cannot currently fit into their delivery routes.

To apply Algorithm 2 to an instance that contains both the original and extra clients a “dummy” vehicle is created that executes a route that visits each of these extra clients. To model that it is undesirable for a client to be on this route, the transportation costs (cij
                         parameters) for this vehicle are set to large multiples of the original transportation costs.

A modified version of Algorithm 2 is executed on this instance, with the dummy vehicle included in each vehicle subset, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    V
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 i
                              
                              ,
                           
                         and each client subset, 
                           
                              
                                 I
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    
                                       V
                                       ¯
                                    
                                    i
                                 
                                 )
                              
                              ,
                           
                         containing all of the clients served by this vehicle. Thus, when solving restrictions of the HMCD in the course of executing Algorithm 2, clients may be moved from one real vehicle to another, as well as from the dummy vehicle to a real vehicle. However, clients who are initially served (in the set I) cannot be moved to the dummy vehicle.

By modeling a “waiting list” of clients with this dummy vehicle, it is possible that a client only receives one or two meals over the time horizon. This is in line with how agencies operate, as some clients may be assigned delivery on fewer than five days a week if that is what the current routes will allow. We also note that we do not enforce the hot meal constraint for the extra clients. Finally, we note that in the steps of Algorithm 2 wherein consolidation is introduced into single routes with steps similar to those seen in Algorithm 1, clients on the waiting list remain with the dummy vehicle. Put another way, we introduce consolidation into each daily route before considering moving clients off the “waiting list.”

Because the client dissatisfaction constraints had the greatest impact on savings, the analysis presented next focuses on their impact on savings and the potential to serve more clients. To that effect, Table 6
                         presents savings in routing costs (Savings), which reflect the difference in routing costs between the solution produced by Algorithm 2 that includes deliveries to clients that were initially on the wait-list and the routing costs of the initial daily routes which do not include wait-listed clients. Because the two solutions include a different number of meals delivered, the savings in cost per meal is also reported in Table 6. For solution p that delivers Mp
                         meals at a total cost of Cp
                        , the cost per meal is calculated as CPMp
                         = Cp
                        /Mp
                         and the savings in cost per meal between solutions p and q is calculated as (CPMp
                         − CPMq
                        )/CPMp
                        .

Finally, Table 6 also reports the percentage of wait-listed client deliveries that are made (percent Wait-list Deliveries). To illustrate the calculation of percent Wait-list Deliveries, suppose there are 10 wait-listed clients. With a planning horizon of 5 days, there are 50 potential wait-list deliveries. If the solution produced by Algorithm 2 makes 30 of those deliveries then the percentage of potential wait list deliveries is 60 percent.

Similar to the results in Table 5a and b, Table 6 indicates that the more the client dissatisfaction constraints preclude consolidation, the smaller the savings. However, we note that the average costs of the routes with the wait-list deliveries never exceeds the cost of the initial routes. This can be partially attributed to the large savings per meal, which also decreases as consolidation is limited by the client dissatisfaction constraints.

Lastly, the performance of Algorithm 2 for instances with clients on a wait-list is studied. Table 7
                         reports the average utilization of vehicles in the initial set of daily routes (initial utilization) and in the final solution that includes deliveries to wait-listed clients (final utilization). The results indicate that Algorithm 2 is taking advantage of nearly all the capacity provided by volunteers to serve meals to clients that are initially on the wait-list. Coupled with the savings results also seen in Table 7 this suggests our approach to handling wait-listed customers is effective. Finally, comparing the results across different numbers of clients in an instance suggests that Algorithm 2 is able to produce savings for all instance sizes.


                        Fig. 2
                         illustrates the performance of Algorithm 2 on the modified instances from Christofides and Eilon (1969) both with respect to savings and the number of wait-listed clients served over the course of its execution. Recall that when we discuss savings in these experiments we are comparing the routing costs of a solution produced by Algorithm 2 that includes deliveries to clients that were initially on the wait-list and the routing costs of the initial daily routes which do not include wait-listed clients. To create the figure, results for all experiments were averaged with times rounded to the nearest hundred. Note that Algorithm 2 first introduces consolidation into routes one at a time by executing Algorithm 1 and that during these steps, clients are left on the wait-list. Fig. 2 indicates that this initial pass at introducing consolidation yields significant savings, which the algorithm then immediately trades for deliveries to clients on the wait-list. However, after about 10 minutes, the savings remain relatively constant, as the algorithm searches for ways to increase the number of deliveries made to clients on the wait-list without sacrificing savings. A similarly-constructed figure illustrating the performance of Algorithm 2 on the modified instances from Golden et al. (1998) displayed the same behavior.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper a model and solution methodology are presented that will enable home delivery companies to balance the efficiencies gained from consolidation with customer satisfaction and ease of operation metrics. The results provide several insights that may be beneficial to a MOW agency manager, or any transportation provider interested in consolidating loads while minimizing operational disruption.

                        
                           •
                           The order in which clients are served and the assignment of drivers to clients do not have to be altered in order to reduce costs through consolidation. This may have a greater impact on providers of other types of transportation services that are focused more on limiting operational disruption and less on customer service. However, while MOW agencies may be more client-centric, a methodology that does not impact their service providers is likely to be viewed favorably.

While savings from consolidation decrease as customer service requirements increase, a non-negligible benefit may be found even with a minimal amount of consolidation. As described earlier, many MOW agencies are struggling to remain operational with limited funding and even a small cost savings may be what allows an agency to stay in business.

Consolidation can lead to a reduction in transportation cost, while also allowing for previously unserved clients to receive meals. Clients may be unhappy with frozen meals; however, it may be easier to convince them of the benefit by indicating how many additional people the program can aid when some hot meals are replaced.

The lemma implies that when certain customer service limits are in place, an agency only needs to prepare hot meals on specific days. This allows for operational planning to be simplified and for resource requirements for meal preparation to be re-allocated.

As more people require the service provided by MOW and funding becomes harder to find, the cost savings found through the use of frozen meals will be difficult to resist, despite some dissatisfaction on the part of clients. However, the methodology presented in this paper may be used to make the transition easier by limiting disruption to both clients and service providers.

No two MOW services operate identically, with each variation offering opportunities for extensions to this research. In some instances, meals are dispersed from a central kitchen to several locations from where volunteers may begin their deliveries. This consideration would require the application of a model that incorporates multiple depots. An extension of this problem could also consider varying the fleet size. As client requests fluctuate, the number of drivers needed could be dynamically adjusted to reduce costs or increase service. Finally, rather than attempting to incorporate those clients on the waiting list into established routes, a model could be developed that pools these clients in with all of the others and creates new routes, potentially reducing routing costs.
