                  Anomalous modulation characteristics of Josephson current I
                     c through niobium tunnel junctions at liquid helium temperature were first measured after applying the external magnetic field in perpendicular direction. Josephson current I
                     c was modulated by applying the external magnetic fields (Hx
                     , Hy
                     ) parallel and Hz
                      vertical to the junction plane. Modulation characteristics of the I
                     c value upon Hz
                      had hysteresis. Before applying the vertical field, modulation characteristics I
                     c–(Hx
                     , Hy
                     ) were the product of the two Fraunhofer diffraction patterns in Hx
                      and Hy
                      directions which were parallel to the junction edges of the square shape junction, respectively. Under the perpendicular magnetic field as much as 4000A/m, the maximum I
                     c value did not appear at (Hx
                     , Hy
                     )=(0, 0) point. After removing this vertical field, the I
                     c–(Hx
                     , Hy
                     ) modulation pattern changed from the product of the two Fraunhofer diffraction patterns to the deformed I
                     c–(Hx
                     , Hy
                     ) characteristics, whose anomalous shape was explained by assuming the extremely low current density at four edges of the square shape except the four corner regions. Some magnetic flux would be trapped perpendicularly inside the junction electrodes within the junction area. After the junction was heated to the room temperature and was again cooled to the liquid He temperature, these modulation characteristics again became the normal modulation pattern, in which the trapped flux would be released by this thermal cycle.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Between two superconducting electrodes with thin oxide layer can current flow without voltage drop, whose critical value can be changed by applying external magnetic field parallel to this oxide barrier [1–5]. In order to obtain more information of the barrier uniformity, we have changed the external magnetic field in two Hx
                      and Hy
                      directions parallel to the junction plane as shown in Fig. 1
                     , and have measured the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) dependence [6–11]. By applying the external magnetic field Hx
                      [Hy
                     ], Josephson current distribution is modulated in y [x] perpendicular direction. From these I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics, by using the junction as simple magnetic sensor, Meissner effect of the superconducting film can be observed [12]. Superconductor–insulator–ferromagnet–superconductor junctions are also studied by I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics [13].

By applying the perpendicular Hz
                      field perpendicular to the junction plane we have found the critical current can also be changed [14]. The modulation characteristics of the Josephson current by applying the vertical magnetic field are important both in fundamental physics and in application of superconducting devices to integrated circuits [15–17]. In the case that the critical current once decreased by flux trapping or some external magnetic noise, this current value can be recovered by alternating the Hz
                      field [18].

In this article, we have applied the external magnetic field perpendicular to the junction plane and have obtained I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) characteristics under 4000A/m Hz
                      field and those after reducing this field. In section 2, detailed fabrication process and measurement method of the junction were described. In section 3, I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) characteristics with wide Hx–Hy
                      range were mentioned. In section 4, deformed shape of I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) characteristics after reducing the Hz
                      field was studied. Conclusions were described in section 5.

In order to fabricate superconducting junctions, niobium and aluminum thin films were deposited in separate vacuum chambers for niobium and for aluminum by DC magnetron sputtering vacuum system with load-lock chamber [19]. Diameters of niobium and aluminum targets were 75mm and 100mm, respectively. The sputtering and the load-lock chambers were pumped down to 10−5
                     Pa range using two molecular pumps and two dry pumps. The thicknesses of base niobium, aluminum-oxide and counter-niobium electrode were 300, 5 and 50nm, respectively. Tunnel oxides of niobium/aluminum-oxide/niobium tunnel junctions were formed by natural oxidation of the surface of the aluminum film with pure oxygen atmosphere in oxidization chamber. The junction areas were defined using selective niobium anodization process [20]. Junction size was 50μm square. After sputter-etching the surface of the niobium/aluminum-oxide/niobium tri-layers, a wiring niobium electrode of 100nm thickness was sputtered and was patterned using chemical etching with mixture of fluoric acid, nitric acid and de-ionized water.

In order to obtain the magnetic field dependence, the external magnetic field 
                        H
                     (Hx
                     , Hy
                     , Hz
                     ) to the junction was produced using three pairs of Helmholtz coils [6,8]. Two pairs of Helmholtz coils produced the Hx
                      and Hy
                      magnetic field parallel to the junction plane and the third pair produced the magnetic field Hz
                      vertical to the junction plane, as shown in Fig. 1. The maximum fields which Helmholtz coils were able to produce, were 3000A/m for Hx
                      and Hy
                      field and 8000A/m for Hz
                      field, respectively. The Helmholtz coils were driven by using DC power supply and were controlled by personal computer and GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) system.

In this section, dependences of the Josephson current I
                     c through superconducting junction on external magnetic field were studied in the wide range −3000<
                     Hx
                        
                     <3000A/m, −3000<
                     Hy
                        
                     <3000A/m. The characteristics of the Josephson current I
                     c on the vertical field Hz
                      had hysteresis [14], where the I
                     c value depended not only on the value of the vertical field Hz
                      but also on the previous history of changing the vertical field Hz
                     . The dependence of the value I
                     c on the field 
                        H
                     (Hx
                     –Hy
                     –Hz
                     ) were not drawn as the three-dimensional graph on Hx
                     –Hy
                     –Hz
                      axises. If we fixed the Hz
                      value, however, the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) surface was able to be obtained without hysteresis even in the wide range −3000<
                     Hx
                        
                     <3000A/m, −3000<
                     Hy
                        
                     <3000A/m, where the obtained I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) dependence was smooth without jumping in increasing or decreasing scan of Hx
                      (or Hy
                     ) component. Hence, the vertical magnetic field Hz
                      was changed as (0)–(+4000)–(0)–(−4000)–(0), in which at every point the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) dependences were measured by scanning the 
                        H
                     (Hx
                     , Hy
                     ) parallel field vector 75A/m step by step. In the Hz
                      changing sequence shown in Fig. 2
                     (a), the points (b)–(f) explain the timing of the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) measurement. So, five dependence in Fig. (b)-(f) showed the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics that belonged to the changing history Hz
                      in (a). After cooling the sample to 4.2K, the initial I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics before applying Hz
                      field were obtained as shown in Fig. 2(b). The I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics were the product of two Fraunhofer diffraction patterns in Hx
                      and Hy
                      direction parallel to each edge of the square junction. Figs. (c) and (e) are the I
                     c–(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) characteristics obtained under +4000 and −4000A/m vertical Hz
                      field, respectively. By applying the Hz
                      field as much as +4000A/m [−4000A/m], the peak position of the I
                     c value moved in −Hy
                      direction [+Hy
                      direction]. Owing to the flux expelled and curved by Meissner effect from the superconducting electrode, some Hy
                      component existed at the measured junction position by applying the external Hz
                      field, in which the moving direction became opposite in Figs. (c) and (e). After removing the vertical field, the peak position of the I
                     c value came back near the origin point (Hx
                     , Hy
                     )=(0,0), as shown in Figs. (d) and (f), about which we studied in the next section.

In this section, anomalous shape of I
                     c
                     –(Hx
                     –Hy
                     ) dependence surface after applying the Hz
                      field was studied with scanning of the parallel Hx
                      and Hy
                      field by 40A/m narrower steps. Fig. 3
                     (a) showed the initial I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence before applying the Hz
                      field. Resonant current steps Istep
                      at finite voltage of I–V curves were also measured. Fig. 3(b) shows the Istep-(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence at 0.20mV, where the Istep
                      value were defined from the difference between the maximum and minimum current values in the range 0.18<V<0.22mV. We changed the perpendicular Hz
                      field; (0)–(+4000)–(0)–(−4000)–(0)–(+4000)–(0)–(−4000A/m)–(0), as shown in Fig. 4
                     . The I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) and Istep–(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependences measured at the points (a)–(e), were shown in Fig. 5
                     . (a1)–(e2). After these measurements the sample was heated to the room temperature and the Nb electrode films of the junction were let to the normal state, the sample was again cooled down to the liquid He temperature. Then I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) and Istep–(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependences were measured as shown in Fig. 5(f1–2). In Fig. 5, (a1)–(c1), (d), (e1), (f1) showed I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence, and (a2)–(c2), (e2), (f2) showed Istep–(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence at the resonant voltage Vr
                     
                     =0.20mV. In these Istep–(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependences, the points (α1), (α2), (β1), (β2) were resonant modes: (nx
                     , ny
                     )=(1, 0), (−1, 0) (0,1) (0,−1), respectively. Index (nx
                     , ny
                     ) were the numbers of the flux quantum penetrating into the barrier region in x and y directions during resonance under the external magnetic field 
                        H
                        ex
                     . In (1, 0) and (−1, 0) modes, one wavelength of electromagnetic wave and superconducting order parameter stood in the y direction perpendicular to the external magnetic field inside the junction area. In (0, 1) and (0, −1) modes, there was one wavelength of those in the x direction.

As shown in Fig. 5(a1), before applying the Hz
                      field, the I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence was the product of the two Fraunhofer pattern. In Fig. (a2), typical resonant mode (α1), (α2), (β1), (β2) at finite voltage [0.2mV] were also observed around the main I
                     c peak area in Fig. (a1). For example after applying the Hz

                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence surface moved to the third quadrant area. In Fig. 6

                     , Hy

                     ) dependence of Fig. 5(a1), (b1), (c1), and (e1) after reducing the Hz
                      field were plotted as points a, b, c and e, respectively. As shown in this figure, the returning point of the I
                     c maximum moved in every sequence, because differed the places of the magnetic flux still remained at the pinning centers in Nb films near the measured junction under Hz
                        
                     =0 in every sequence. Fig. 5(d) showed I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence in −800<

                      field, in which the I
                     c current value was less than 30μA. In Fig. 5(d) the high I
                     c value area went away from this measured region, which was easily understood from the wider area measurement of Fig. 2(e). After a thermal cycling from 4.2K to room temperature, the I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) characteristics became the product of two Fraunhofer patterns i.e. normal characteristics again, as shown in Fig. 5(f1). So, the anomalous characteristics of Fig. 5(a1), (b1), (c1) and (e1) was caused by the changes of superconducting order-parameter distribution in Nb electrodes and the electromagnetic field. These changes were reset to the initial state without flux trapping by normal state transition of Nb superconducting electrodes in thermal cycling to room temperature.

Numerical simulation was also studied to explain these measured dependences. First, after removing the vertical Hz
                      field, the magnetic field from the trapped flux in the superconducting film not inside the junction but near the measured junction would simply move the high I
                     c mountain area as the bias magnetic field, whose offset value was easily evaluated from the peak position (Hx
                     , Hy
                     ).

Secondly, the critical junction current density Jc
                      in the junction area would become non-uniform even after reducing the Hz
                      field such as at the points (a), (b), (c), (e) in Fig. 4. In triangle [hexagonal] shape junctions [9], junction current of the three [six] corner areas made huge ridges of the mountain shape I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence. However, in the dependence of Fig. 4 it would not be reasonable to assume higher current density at four corners of the square shape junction than the uniform current density Jc
                     
                     0 under no external magnetic field. So, we assumed the current density near four edges became extremely low, as shown in Fig. 7
                     (a), which was caused by the magnetic flux that still trapped in the superconducting electrodes and remained at the edge regions even after removing the external magnetic field Hz
                     . From this assumed current density distribution, the critical current was numerically obtained as follows. Generally speaking, along the pass across the barrier of the tunnel junction, the gauge-invariant phase difference γ between the two superconducting electrodes was considered from the sum of the phase difference and the line integral of vector potential of electro-magnetic field. This gauge-invariant phase difference γ was modulated perpendicular to the external magnetic field direction inside this barrier region, where the modulation wavelength was inverse proportional to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. From the distribution of Jc
                     sinγ, we calculated the total current that flew without voltage drop. Fig. 7(b) and (c) showed the simulated I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) dependence in the range −800<
                     Hx
                        
                     <800, −800<
                     Hy
                        
                     <800A/m and the enlarged center area, respectively. Four ridges of the two-dimensional I
                     c
                     –(Hx–Hy
                     ) surface observed at four directions (45, 135, 225, 315 degree angle) and the boomerang-like shape of sub peaks were successfully explained in this numerical simulation.

                     ) dependence with fixed Hz
                      value had no hysteresis, the modulation characteristics were successfully measured as the I
