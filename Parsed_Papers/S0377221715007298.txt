                  The game theoretic perspective in auction bidding has provided a powerful normative framework for the analysis of auctions and it has generated an impressive volume of research contributions. Tracing this research, we review key recent advances, which have greatly expanded our understanding of the operation of auctions and produced a more accurate analysis of mechanism design and optimal bidding. We follow various experimental studies which have shown that the predictive power of auction theory remains in many cases limited. For this reason, we concentrate on research themes, which enhance the applicability of auction theory leading to more realistic descriptions of bidding behaviors. We identify important innovations, which expand the environment of auction bidding and carry us beyond rational decision making. We conclude providing directions of future research and discussing their implications.

@&#OVERVIEW@&#

The foundation of auction theory from a game theoretic perspective has provided an elegant analytical approach for understanding competitive bidding. In the process of its development, auction theory has intriguingly addressed a plethora of challenging questions, giving rise to innovative research in various directions. In the present review, we identify the most important research themes, which enhance the applicability and increase the predictive power of auction theory. The aim of this line of research is to enable bidders to become more responsive to the complexity of the auction environment when determining their pricing strategy. In this respect, the contributions that we examine allow auction players to gain valuable insight about the diverse forces that shape bidding behavior. We will follow key recent advances and explore how auction theory evolved amalgamating sophisticated theoretical models together with miscellaneous experimental and empirical findings. Therefore, our focus will be on optimal bidding strategies that should be adopted as the auction environment becomes more involved but at the same time more realistic. We mainly concentrate on standard types of auctions under different settings and behaviors and explore the implementation of various findings on optimal competitive bidding.

Auctions play a pivotal role in economic life. Every day, numerous small or high volume transactions are conducted in the form of auctions. For many goods, trading relies sometimes exclusively on bidding at an auction house. The diversity of auctioned objects, which come for sale, ranges from agricultural products, livestock and commodities to financial assets, such as Treasury Bills, real estate property and energy, such as electricity. For the purchase of goods and services, procurement and contracting for the public sector and the industry is made predominantly through auctions. Governments employ auctions in the sale of public assets, such as the lease of prospects for petroleum exploration and drilling, the license of radio frequency spectrums to the phone industry and the formation of public-private-partnerships for developing long-term capital intensive projects. Trading through auction is the main vehicle for art sales around the world. Electronic auctions for the sale of consumer goods are increasingly becoming more popular, so that e-Bay, which is market leader in this type of sales, reported 145 million active buyers worldwide in the first quarter of 2014 (eBay Inc. website, 2014). Moreover, auction bidding extends to applications outside the scope of trading, such as recent proposals for the determination of draws in chess competition and the selection of the starting team in the overtime period of football games (Granot & Gerchak, 2014), or the use of auctions for fundraising activities as an alternative to lotteries (Bos, 2011; Goeree, Maasland, Onderstal, & Turner, 2005).

Although auctions are conducted in many different ways, the most typical forms are the first price auction (FPA) with sealed bids, the second price auction (SPA) and the ascending English auction. The time duration of auctions greatly varies and it can be as low as five seconds in flower auctions (Harstad & Pekeƒç, 2008) to several months or even years for some sealed bid public procurement auctions.

The history of auctions dates to antiquity. The ancient historian Herodotus (1988) refers to a Babylonian marital custom, which existed before the fifth century BC, and according to which each year beautiful women were auctioned off as wives to the highest bidder, while the proceeds provided dowries for the ugly and poor.

                           1
                           The accuracy of this historical event is under debate (McNeal, 1988).
                         Auctions for slaves were common in antiquity and continued for centuries. Ancient Greeks auctioned mine concessions (Klemperer, 2004) while the Pretorian guard in Ancient Rome sold the position of the emperor by an auction process (Krishna, 2010). The formal quantitative analysis of auctions, however, has appeared only in recent years. Friedman (1956) introduced the decision theoretic approach in auction theory, according to which each bidder maximizes his/her expected profit under the assumption that all rivals choose their bids randomly following a specific probability distribution. The seminal paper of Vickrey (1961) was the first to examine auction bidding under a game theoretic perspective. In the game theoretic approach, all players maximize their own expected profit, or, more generally, their expected utility, while, at the same time, this is common knowledge to all auction participants. A private value auction postulates that each bidder knows how much he/she values the auctioned object. In the simplest symmetric environment, known as the independent private value (IPV) paradigm, each bidder is risk neutral and believes that the values of the auctioned object, as perceived by opponents, are realizations of independent identically distributed random variables. In the IPV setting and for FPA, SPA and English auctions, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium bidding strategy and the expected revenue of the auctioneer can be easily derived (Myerson, 1981;
Riley & Samuelson, 1981). The early stages of auction theory examined various departures from the IPV environment, introducing asymmetry in the underlying probability distribution of the value of the auctioned object (Bulow, Huang, & Klemperer, 1999;
Graham & Marshall, 1987; Klemperer, 1988; Wilson, 1967) and risk aversion of players (Holt, 1980; Maskin & Riley, 1984; Riley & Samuelson, 1981). The earliest attempt to relax independence of the valuations of the players can be traced by
Wilson (1977). Winkler and Brooks (1980) examined dependence under a bivariate multinormal distribution. In a common value auction, the values of the auctioned object for the different players are interdependent, in the sense that for each bidder the exact value is unknown and depends on information possessed by the opponents. The pure common value auction assumes that all bidders share the exact same unknown value, while having different private information about this value. The first derivation of the bidding strategy in common value SPA was derived by
Matthews (1977). The seminal paper of Milgrom and Weber (1982b) introduced a more general form of dependence of the signals of the bidders, known as affiliation, leading to the derivation of the equilibrium bidding strategies in an interdependent value environment with affiliated signals.

The paper consists of five main research themes, which enhance the applicability of auction theory and extend its scope. The first part examines the challenging problem of the statistical estimation of the underlying probability distribution of the valuations of the bidders from the observed historical bid prices. The estimation of the value distribution is crucial in the application of auction theory for the determination of equilibrium bidding strategies,
                           2
                        
                        
                           2
                           Of course, notable exceptions are the symmetric equilibrium bidding prices in the Independent Private Value Second Price Auction and in the common value English auction.
                         the calculation of the expected revenue and mechanism design, as well as for testing model assumptions. We proceed to discuss models, which combine private and common value components and expand the standard framework of auctions. This leads us to the second part, where we consider asymmetry among players, first, in the IPV paradigm, and, then, in a common value environment, where our focus is on the management of information. Further, we address whether auctions ensure efficiency in the allocation of an object.

Moving to the third research theme, we investigate how auctions can be embedded within a larger trading framework. Resale at a subsequent stage, or the presence of a parallel active market, extends the scope of auction bidding allowing more trading flexibility to the agents. Auctions of multiple items and sequential auctions provide another extension, where strategies reflect the dynamic nature and the interactions of the environment. An auction as a trading process carries different inherent sources of risk, which can have considerable impact on the volatility of the payoffs involved. Consequently, our next step is to study methods by which bid prices account for different forms of risk and the corresponding effect on the payoff of each agent.

All players in an auction are required to follow predefined and well-understood rules, which govern proper conduct in the trading process. In practice, however, agents often intentionally choose to bend or break these rules, as, for example, when bidders form collusion rings or when auctioneers submit phantom bids. Following this point of departure, we discuss in the fourth part the effect of different kinds of corruptive behavior in auction design and bidding.

Our last theme carries us outside the framework of rational decision making, which is the cornerstone of the game theoretic approach of competitive bidding. We review a large body of empirical evidence, which supports the presence of bounded rationality in bidding and suggests that bidder populations are usually mixed and include rational players, who follow Nash equilibrium strategies, together with irrational bidders. We consider the analysis of models of mixed bidder populations, which capture irrationality and extend the standard perspective of game theory.

Finally, we conclude with a discussion about the future of the study of competitive bidding and we reflect on some exciting research paths that are expected to enrich auction theory with important innovations. For the convenience of the reader, Table 1
                         summarizes the abbreviations which appear in the text. In our discussion the default case is an auction where bidders compete for the purchase of an object, which is made available for sale by a seller. When occasionally the context changes to the mirror case of an auction with bidders being sellers, we explicitly make the distinction and refer to it as a procurement auction.

Auction theory has grown in many different directions and produced a huge body of research. Reviews of the early literature can be found in Engelbrecht-Wiggans (1980), McAfee and McMillan (1987), Wilson (1992) and Rothkopf and Harstad (1994). Excellent systematic treatments of standard methods of auction bidding and mechanism design are provided in the texts of Klemperer (2004), Milgrom (2004) and Krishna (2010). Many recent surveys concentrate on specific areas of auction theory such as Marshall and Marx (2012), which investigates collusion, Rothkopf and Whinston (2007), which explores e-procurement auctions, or Pham, Teich, Wallenius, and Wallenius (2015), which reviews multi-attribute online auctions. Our paper identifies and discusses selective practical areas of implementation of auction theory and aims to enrich OR practitioners with a spherical knowledge about important contributions and recent innovations in bidding from a game theory perspective emphasizing the role of auction theory in practice.

To apply the methodology of auction theory and to test its assumptions, the underlying probability distributions have to be statistically identified and estimated. Friedman (1956), in the first application of auction bidding strategies in Operations Research, proposed a method to estimate the probability distribution of competitors' bids. For each observed bid of an opponent, a pseudo mark-up is calculated under the assumption that the cost is the same as the one incurred by the bidder. Eventually, these pseudo-mark-ups are used to estimate the parameters of the underlying distribution of bids.

In the game-theoretic IPV framework, the values assigned by the bidders for the auctioned object, with the exception of SPA, are not readily available to each bidder. In fact, the observed historical data consist of the bid prices and sometimes supplementary state variables related to the auction setting, as for example the prevailing, at the time of a procurement auction, price of raw materials. Therefore, the effort is to recover the probability distribution of the value of the auctioned object on the basis of the existing data, assuming that the observed bids are at equilibrium. Initially, this identification and estimation process, known as structural approach, was restricted to simple auction settings. Donald and Paarsch (1993, 1996) and Lafont, Ossard, and Vuong (1995) provided parametric estimates of the underlying value distribution based on observed historical bids. Moving to non-parametric statistical estimation, Elyakime, Laffont, Loisel, and Vuong (1997) and Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong (2000) produced, in an IPV FPA, kernel estimates, which are asymptotically converging to the actual probability distribution. In the indirect structural approach of Guerre et al. (2000), the distribution of bids identifies and provides a non-parametric estimate of the underlying value distribution without the need to derive explicitly the equilibrium strategies ‚Äì even though players bid in a game theoretic environment. In a way, the role of the bid distribution, which eventually determines bidding behavior, is reminiscent of the early work of Friedman (1956) in the decision theoretic model and may be viewed as a ‚Äúfull circle‚Äù of auction theory.

In the IPV paradigm, Rezende (2008) produced estimates of the parameters of the underlying value distribution, employing ordinary least squares. In the same FPA environment, Henderson, List, Millimet, Parmeter, and Price (2012) developed methods for the implementation of non-parametric estimation and derived the appropriate selection of bandwidth. Moving in a parallel direction for an English auction environment, it is possible to derive non-parametric estimates for the underlying value distribution (Haile & Tamer, 2003).

For FPA, Haile, Hong, and Shum (2006) applied the structural approach to non-parametrically test the common value setting against the IPV paradigm. Fevrier (2008) derived consistent non-parametric estimates of the density of the distribution of the common value and the conditional on the value density of the signal.


                           Athey and Haile (2002) examined the non-parametric identification of the underlying value distribution in a variety of standard auction models, such as FPA or English auctions, with private or common values, under the presence of covariates. In addition, they derived a statistical test of the private value environment against the common value framework. In the Affiliated Private Value (APV) environment, which extends the IPV setting to private values, which are affiliated rather than independent, estimators may also be derived. In the simplest estimation case, bidders are conditionally symmetric in the sense that they all draw their private value from the same marginal distribution (Li, Perrigne, & Vuong, 2000, 2002). In this setting, a semi-parametric estimate of the optimal reserve price can also be obtained (Li et al., 2003).


                           Campo, Perrigne, and Vuong (2003) examined an asymmetric APV FPA, where bidders do not have the same marginal distribution for their private value. Many different factors may be responsible for this form of asymmetry. For example, differences among bidders in capacity, geographic location or information may account for the asymmetry. Collusion also differentiates the bidders who are rig members compared to those who do not join the cartel. For the simplifying case of two groups of bidders, the equilibrium strategies are the solution of a system of two differential equations. These first order conditions generalize the symmetric APV framework of Li et al. (2002). At first glance, the system of differential equations appears intractable and it is not possible to produce the bidding strategies in an explicit form. The first order conditions, however, may be rewritten following a structural approach, so that the auctioned object value can be expressed in terms of the conditional bid distributions of the two bidder groups, the total derivatives and the corresponding bid price (Campo et al., 2003). This expression allows the identifiability and non-parametric estimation of the underlying value distribution for each bidder group.

In the framework of a sequential English auction with multiple demand, where m identical objects are being auctioned at m sequential auctions, there is inherent asymmetry among bidders as their behavior changes depending on how many auctioned objects they have already won. Due to this asymmetry, in a sequential IPV English auction, identifiability and estimation of the underlying distribution from which the valuations are drawn cannot be achieved in general from the observed winning prices in the last stage and the number of units won in the earlier stages by each bidder (Brendstrup, 2007;
Lamy, 2012). In a two stage IPV English auction, with valuations drawn independently in each stage and with bidding according to the symmetric Nash equilibrium, a non-parametric estimate of the underlying value distribution based on the observed winning prices at the second stage, can be derived, provided that there are at least three bidders (Lamy, 2012).

Departing from the private or pure common value setting, models which incorporate both a private and a common value component have been developed. The aim has been to produce asymmetric auction environments, where bidders assign a different value to the auctioned item, and their signals do not have the same precision.

In the convolution framework, the value is either the sum or, alternatively, the product of a private component X and a common state variable Y, which are stochastically independent. Therefore, the value V is represented by a linear or a log-linear relationship of X and Y. Wilson (1998) considered the convolution model with probability distributions, which are lognormal in an ascending English auction, where the dropout decision is public and irrevocable and bidders indicate continuously their willingness to pay the prevailing price. In particular, the private component, which is separately known by each bidder, is independently drawn from a lognormal distribution with mean m and variance, which varies among bidder. At the same time, bidders observe a noisy signal, which on the average is log-linearly related to the common value component Y with error term, which follows a mean-zero normal distribution. In other words, the signal has a lognormal distribution about Y, with a different variance for each bidder. Wilson (1998) assumed that the prior distribution of the parameters m and Y is diffuse, so that the variances are infinite and the correlation between m and Y is zero. This assumption about the prior distribution ensures that separately observing a distinct signal from each of the two components of the value is equivalent, in terms of information content, with the observation of an aggregate signal of the value itself. The advantage of this particular parametric setting is that the lognormal distribution simplifies the first order conditions and enables the derivation of a closed form of the equilibrium bid price, as the solution of a system of linear equations. Similar results are obtained when the log linear relationship is replaced by a linear additive model with normality instead of lognormality.

In the same framework of English auction, Hong and Shum (2003) extended Wilson's model dropping the assumption that the prior distribution of Y is diffuse. Moreover, bidders do not receive distinct signals for each component. Instead, they only observe a signal of the combined value of the auctioned object. The inverse bidding strategies can be implicitly determined through a system of non-linear equations. Hong and Shum (2003) provided conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium strategy under the requirement that the bid price increases with the observed signal. In more detail, we may assume that there are n bidders and after k rounds, only the first n-k players remain active. The signal of each bidder for the value Vi
                            is denoted by Si

These result extended the symmetric equilibrium for increasing strategies, which was first derived in the seminal paper of Milgrom and Weber (1982b), to an asymmetric environment. To proceed in the recovery of the underlying value distribution, it is assumed that all bidders will adhere to the equilibrium strategy of Eq. (1). It should be stressed, however, that in an English auction, apart from the symmetric equilibrium of Milgrom and Weber (1982b), there are infinitely many other symmetric equilibrium strategies, which form a continuum (Bikhchandani, Haile, & Riley, 2002). Moreover, in a pure common value English auction there is also a continuum of asymmetric equilibria (Bikchandani & Riley, 1991). Therefore, it is possible that bidders may follow different equilibrium strategies, which incapacitates the estimation process. In addition, models in which a bidder's value is a linear combination of a private and common-value component, with private information about the private-value components and an estimate of the common-value component both assumed drawn from discrete distributions, Jackson (2009) showed that neither an SPA or an English auction has an equilibrium, which creates a further complication.

Under the assumption of lognormality, the corresponding expressions in Eq. (1) are drastically simplified and the distribution of the logarithm of the drop-out prices is shown to be multivariate normal (Hong & Shum, 2003). Moreover, the mean of the (lognormal) underlying value distribution can be estimated following a maximum likelihood estimation method, supplemented by simulation for the calculation of non-tractable integrals (Hong & Shum, 2003). An interesting implementation of these techniques can be found in the investigation of information asymmetry in Mauritian slave auctions (Dionne, St-Amour, & Vencatachellum, 2009). The corresponding analysis provided evidence that family links between buyers and sellers differentiated bidders. Buyers of slaves, who were family related to sellers, paid a premium on their bid price, indicating knowledge of non-public information. The aggressive bidding of less informed buyers is consistent with the result of Hernando-Veciana and Troge (2011), according to which in an English auction environment with private and common value components, informed bidders, who have perfect information about the common value, suffer the insider's curse. The reason is that an uninformed bidder with a high private value component is willing to outbid the informed opponent in the ascending auction, gambling on the advantage of the high private value against the winner's curse due to the common value component. At the same time, an informed bidder facing uninformed opponents with high private values may find it beneficial to reveal any private information about the common value component. We will return to information asymmetry in Section 3.2.

The convolution model allows the estimation of the underlying probability distribution of the values convolution model from the bid prices. In Li et al. (2000), bidders in FPA observe the combined value of the private and common components, which are not separately observable. This setting is IPV conditionally on the state variable and, therefore, following the discussion of Section 2.1.2, the underlying distribution for the private component of the value and the state variable can be non-parametrically estimated from the bid prices. Hong and Shum (2002) applied a different estimation method in FPA under Wilson's log additive model. The estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimizing an objective function, which involves a measure of distance between the observed bid prices and the quantiles of the theoretical bid distribution. Following this approach and using empirical data from procurement auctions of the state of New Jersey, they concluded that, strangely enough, in an asymmetric setting, such as the one proposed, a larger number of bidders might bring a higher median bid price. In particular, if the number of bidders n decreased from 6, which was the most usual value of n in the data set, to 3, then, there would be cost savings of about 15%. Therefore, more bidders do not necessarily increase competition. The reason behind this counterintuitive result is that the winner curse induced by the common value component, which forces bidders to bid less aggressively, is so severe that it outweighs the effect on the winning price caused by increasing the number of opponents.

Often, in the convolution framework, the common state variable remains unobserved by the researcher, even though it is known to each bidder. In FPA, Krassnokyskaya (2011) exploited the dependence of the bid prices on the common state variable Y and recovered the distribution of both X and Y from datasets of historical bids. The derived non-parametric estimates of the underlying distributions have desirable statistical asymptotic properties and they are uniformly converging to the actual probability distributions. An application of the estimation method to Michigan highway procurement auctions provided a better fit compared to models, such as IPV or APV, which do not account for auction heterogeneity.

Moving beyond the convolution model, we may consider an environment with private values, which are independent conditionally on a common state variable Y. In an IPV auction with unobserved heterogeneity, the state variable Y is unobserved by the researcher but it is known to the bidders before they bid. The heterogeneity across the auctions is attributed to the state variable Y, which is auction specific. On the other hand, in the conditionally IPV model, both bidders and the researcher do not observe Y. A typical example of unobserved heterogeneity is timber auctions, where the state variable Y is the quality of timber for sale. If Y is common knowledge to all bidders but remains unobserved to the auction analyst, then the model is IPV with unobserved heterogeneity. Other characteristics that may be viewed as a state of the auction are the reserve price or the cost of participation to the auction.


                           Hu, McAdams and Shum (2013) examined an IPV FPA with unobserved heterogeneity, where the private values are increasing in Y, in the sense of first order stochastic ordering of the conditional distribution of the private value given Y. In the case where the auction state takes discrete values, the maximum bid at each state Y defines a partition, within which the observed historical bids may be classified. When the number of bidders remains fixed and is at least 3, Hu, McAdams, and Shum (2013) were able to recover non-parametrically the distribution of the bid prices conditionally on the state Y. Consequently, the private values and the state variable may be identified from the observed bids. The same identifiability result holds in the conditionally IPV FPA environment.

The number of potential bidders may also be viewed as a state variable. In IPV FPA, the number of potential bidders can be identified and estimated, assuming that it remains fixed for all observed auctions (Guerre et al., 2000). When the size of the bidder population is known to each bidder but remains unobserved by the researcher, non-parametric identification and estimation are still possible (An, Hu, & Shum, 2010). These findings are also deduced from the identifiability methods of Hu, McAdams, and Shum (2013), while similar results for IPV SPA were obtained by Song (2004).

Considerable attention has been given to the study of general asymmetry in auction theory. We proceed to discuss asymmetry first in the IPV setting.

In an IPV setting, asymmetry arises when the probability distribution of the value of the auctioned object differs among bidders.

In the FPA environment, the existence of an equilibrium bidding strategy, which is continuous and strictly increasing in valuation, was established by Lebrun (1999), Maskin and Riley (2000b) and Athey (2001), as a solution of a system of differential equations. Lebrun (1999), Maskin and Riley (2003) and Blume and Heidues (2004) provided conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibrium in terms of mixed strategies in IPV setting, while McAdams (2007) established that for affiliated and interdependent values, there is a unique monotone pure strategy equilibrium. Lebrun (2006) showed that, when the underlying value distributions are log-concave at 0, the solution of the system of differential equations that provides the equilibrium is unique.

Explicit solutions of the corresponding differential equations have been obtained only in particular cases. Vickrey (1961), in the seminal paper which introduced the game theoretic approach in bidding with incomplete information, provided a solution in an asymmetric environment with two players, when the underlying value distributions are uniform and the value of one bidder is common knowledge. The case, where the two underlying distributions are uniform with the same lower end of support, was solved by Griesmer, Levitan, and Shubik (1967). An extension to the ‚Äúpower‚Äù distributions F
                           1(x)¬†=¬†xŒº
                            and F
                           2(x)¬†=¬†(Œ≥x)
                              Œº
                            with the same lower endpoint of support, where Œ≥ and Œº are parameters, was pursued by Plum (1992). Cheng (2006) provided the explicit solution in the more general setting, where F
                           1(x)¬†=¬†xŒº
                            and F
                           2(x)¬†=¬†(Œ≥x)
                              ŒΩ
                           , with certain restrictions on both end points of the support and the parameters Œ≥, Œº and ŒΩ. The equilibrium strategy has a linear form in terms of the value, and for this reason, the auction is called linear asymmetric. Kaplan and Zamir (2012) solved analytically the general case of two different uniform distributions, which have any interval support, and in the presence of a reserve price. At the same time, numerical approximations of the bidding strategies have been developed in the literature starting with Marshall, Meurer, Richard, and Stromquist (1994) in FPA with two asymmetric groups of players and underlying distributions of particular form. A more recent approach, which also applies to the case of more than two heterogeneous players the in FPA environment, considers an approximation of the bid price by polynomials (Bajari, 2001; Hubbard, Kirkegaard, & Paarsch, 2013).

In FPA with only two players, we may assume that the value of one bidder tends to be higher than the value of the opponent, in some stochastic sense. In particular, we may assume reverse hazard rate dominance of the value distribution Fs
                           (v) of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidder (who tends to have higher values) over the value distribution Fw
                           (v) of the ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidder, which is expressed as fs
                           (v)/Fs
                           (v)¬†‚â•¬†fw
                           (v)/Fw
                           (v), for all v in the common support, where fs
                           (v) and fw
                           (v) are the corresponding densities. The presence of one bidder with a dominant value distribution is known as the ‚ÄúGetty effect‚Äù. The bidder with lower values, who is ‚Äúweak‚Äù, will have to bid more aggressively, producing higher bids compared to the other player, the ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidder (Maskin & Riley, 2000a; Krishna, 2010). More precisely, regardless of being weak or strong, a bidder bids more aggressively when he competes against a strong opponent rather than a weak one. When there are two players, who can be characterized as ‚Äústrong‚Äù and ‚Äúweak‚Äù in terms of reverse hazard dominance, the symmetric environment could either be a strong value distribution or a weak value distribution. It is then interesting to compare the distribution of the bid prices arising in an asymmetric auction against the corresponding distribution of the bids in a symmetric setting. There are four possible cases, as shown in Table 2.


                           Maskin and Riley (2000a) showed that the bid distributions can be ranked in terms of the probability distributions (first order stochastic dominance): œÉS
                           (b)¬†‚â§¬†Œ£S
                           (b)¬†‚â§¬†Œ£w
                           (b)¬†‚â§¬†œÉw
                           (b) for all values b.
                        

The above findings were derived under reverse hazard dominance. Kirkegaard (2009) examined a more general framework of two asymmetric bidders with value distributions F
                           1(v) and F
                           2(v) and equilibrium strategies b
                           1(v) and b
                           2(v). The relative strength of bidder 1 compared to bidder 2 can be expressed as the ratio F
                           1,2(v)¬†=¬†F
                           1(v)/F
                           2(v). When F
                           1(v) dominates F
                           2(v) in terms of reverse hazard rate, it is easy to see that 
                              
                                 F
                                 
                                    1
                                    ,

                           (v)¬†<¬†0. Similarly, if there is first order dominance, F
                           1,2(v) remains always below 1. The expected payoffs of the two bidders in the equilibrium point are œÄ
                           1(v) and œÄ
                           2(v), respectively, and the payoff ratio is œÄ
                           1,2(v)¬†=¬†œÄ
                           1(v)/œÄ
                           2(v). 
                           Kirkegaard (2009) proved an extremely useful relationship between the two ratios F
                           1,2(v) and œÄ
                           1,2(v), which allows us to characterize the behavior in an asymmetric environment. In particular, he showed that the sign of œÄ
                           1,2(v)¬†‚àí¬†F
                           1,2(v) is always the same as the sign of b
                           1(v)¬†‚àí¬†b
                           2(v) and the sign of 
                              
                                 œÄ

                           (v). He also concluded that œÄ
                           1(v) exceeds œÄ
                           2(v) at most as many times as F
                           1,2(v) crosses 1. Further, b
                           1(v) is higher than b
                           2(v) as many times as

                           (v) changes sign. Proceeding along this analysis, it is possible to show that when the underlying distributions are normal, beta, Weibull, or lognormal, the bidding strategies will cross at least once. When the value distribution F

In a symmetric IPV environment, the revenue equivalence theorem establishes that the expected revenue of the auctioneer (seller) is the same in FPA and an English auction, which is equivalent to IPV SPA (Vickrey, 1961; Riley & Samuelson, 1981). In an asymmetric auction, the revenue equivalence theorem is no longer in force. Maskin and Riley (2000a) compared the seller's expected revenue in FPA against an English auction and found that ranking is not unambiguous but depends on the kind of asymmetries between bidders. In particular, the sealed bid FPA is superior when the probability distribution of the stronger bidder Fs
                           (v) can be produced from the distribution of the ‚Äúweaker‚Äù player Fw
                           (v) either as a shift, so that Fs
                           (v)¬†=¬†Fw
                           (v¬†‚àí¬†Œ±), with Œ±¬†>¬†0, or by ‚Äústretching‚Äù, which corresponds to Fs
                           (v)¬†=¬†ŒªFw
                           (v), with 1¬†>¬†Œª¬†>¬†0. On the other hand, when the ‚Äústrong‚Äù distribution is generated by shifting probability mass of the ‚Äúweaker‚Äù bidder distribution to zero, the English auction generates more revenue to the seller. To illustrate their findings, Maskin and Riley (2000a) considered an arts auction, where only one bidder may be extremely enthusiastic and eager to purchase a painting, which shifts probability mass to zero. Knowing that his/her opponents do not share his/her enthusiasm, he/she will gamble with a low bid in a sealed bid FPA, which, of course, is not possible in an ascending English auction. Therefore, the expected revenue for the auctioneer is higher in an English auction environment, which provides a partial explanation to the fact that most art auctions are ascending. In procurement auctions, it is reasonable to assume that there is not just one ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù bidder, and, consequently, it is not advisable to bid less aggressively in a sealed bid FPA. This line of thinking may explain why a sealed bid FPA is typically preferred by auctioneers in procurement. Kirkegaard (2012) extended the above results using an auction mechanism design approach. When the value distribution of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù player FS
                           (v) dominates the value distribution FW
                           (v) of the ‚Äúweak‚Äù player, in terms of reverse hazard rate, and 
                              
                                 F
                                 W
                                 ‚Ä≤
                              
                           (v)¬†‚â•¬†
                              
                                 F
                                 S
                                 ‚Ä≤
                              
                           (v), then FPA produces strictly higher expected revenue to the seller compared to SPA. It can be shown that the ranking of FPA and SPA of Maskin and Riley (2000a), when FW
                           (v) is ‚Äúshifted‚Äù or ‚Äústretched‚Äù in order to generate FS
                           (v), is an immediate consequence of the ranking in Kirkegaard (2012). In a more general setting, suppose that the valuation of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù player vs
                            is a random shift of the valuation vW
                            of the ‚Äúweek‚Äù bidder, so that vs
                           ¬†=¬†vW
                           ¬†+¬†Œ±, where Œ± is, now, random. When 
                              
                                 F
                                 W
                                 ‚Ä≤
                              
                           (v) is increasing and log-concave, FPA generates higher revenue to the seller compared to SPA (Kirkegaard, 2012).

When the underlying value distribution is specified and it is possible to explicitly derive the equilibrium strategy, the expected revenue in FPA and SPA can be directly ranked. In this way, for linear asymmetric auctions, Cheng (2006) deduced that the auctioneer should always find preferable with regard to expected revenue, the conduct of a sealed bid FPA rather than an English auction.

In an IPV asymmetric auction, where the value distribution for each bidder is Fi
                           (v), the effect of asymmetry in the expected revenue depends on the particular symmetric environment, which will serve as benchmark. Cantillon (2008) considered as a benchmark the geometric mean of Fi
                           (v), which is the distribution F(v) for which F(v)
                              n
                           ¬†=¬†F
                           1(v)F
                           2(v)‚Ä¶Fn
                           (v). Making use of the fact that the geometric mean is always lower than the arithmetic mean, it is shown that in SPA the symmetric benchmark generates higher revenue to the seller compared to the asymmetric environment. This result extends to FPA only for particular forms of distributions, such as the uniform or power distributions. Indeed, Cheng (2011) provided an example of a pair of value distributions, for which the revenue was higher in the asymmetric FPA compared to the benchmark that Cantillon (2008) proposed.

The first analysis of the management of information in an asymmetric common value auction setting can be traced in Milgrom and Weber (1982a). In the framework of a sealed bid asymmetric FPA, as first introduced by Wilson (1967), one bidder is informed having superior private information compared to the other auction participant, who has only publicly available information. According to Milgrom and Weber (1982a) the informed bidder should gather extra information overtly, while it is preferable for the uninformed bidder to act covertly in collecting some of the private information of his opponent. It is also beneficial to the seller, who sells the auctioned item, to make public any private information, which the informed bidder may have. In essence, uncertainty about an opponent's information results to more aggressive bidding, raising the seller's revenue. Consequently, in a symmetric setting and under a common value FPA, SPA or English auction, the seller should publicly reveal any information, which may be useful to the bidders (Milgrom & Weber, 1982b). This finding is an immediate consequence of the linkage principle

                              The linkage principle is also called the publicity effect (Milgrom 2004).
                           , according to which whenever the price paid upon winning becomes more sensitive to the observed signal, the expected revenue of the seller increases and the bidder profit is lower. In particular, the linkage principle allows the ranking of the expected revenue in two different auctions and can be formally stated as follows (Krishna & Morgan, 1997):


                           Linkage principle: Consider two auctions, i¬†=¬†1 and 2, for which the auctioned object is awarded to the bidder with the highest bid price. Assume that there is a symmetric and increasing equilibrium and let Mi
                           (z,s), with i¬†=¬†1,2, denote the expected price paid by each bidder, when, although his observed signal is s, he bids as if his signal was z. Further, suppose that:

The linkage principle allows us to compare the expected revenue in symmetric FPA and SPA and deduce the revenue equivalence in the IPV paradigm. In a symmetric auction with interdependent values and affiliated signals, the linkage principle implies that SPA outperforms FPA, in terms of expected revenue (Krishna, 2010). For non-standard common value auctions with symmetric players, such as the lottery qualification auctions, where the winning bidder is randomly chosen from the Q highest bidders, the linkage principle may not hold (Harstad & Bordley, 1996).

Moving to the asymmetric case, the expected revenue ranking no longer holds, which implies failure of the linkage principle. In many cases, imposing sufficient conditions allows us to rank the revenue under different auction settings. Cheng and Tan (2010) considered an auction with two bidders and common value V(s
                           1,s
                           2), where s
                           1 and s
                           2 are the signals of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù and the ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidder, respectively. The first player is ‚Äústrong‚Äù, in the sense that the probability distribution of the received signal first-order stochastically dominates the distribution of the signal of the opponent, who is ‚Äúweak‚Äù. Cheng and Tan (2010) considered the unique equilibrium strategy in FPA (Lizzeri & Persico, 1998, Rodriguez, 2000) for SPA the equilibrium bid price V(s,s), which is truth-telling and does not depend on the opponent's signal but, on the other hand, it constitutes one particular selection among the continuum of possible equilibria (Milgrom, 1981). If V(s
                           1,s
                           2) is bounded above the weighted average of the signals of the two bidders, so that V(s
                           1,s
                           2)¬†‚â•¬†(1¬†‚àí¬†r)s
                           1¬†+¬†rs
                           2, and the weight r is less or equal to 0.5, then the seller's revenue is higher in FPA compared to SPA. When the value function is bounder from above by a weighted average of the signals and r¬†>¬†0.5, the reverse ranking occurs so that the seller's revenue is higher in SPA than in FPA.


                           Parreiras (2006) considered hybrid auctions, where the payment of the winner is a weighted average of the highest and second highest bid prices. It is shown that FPA never generates more revenue compared to a hybrid auction. When SPA can be viewed as a limit of a hybrid auction, letting the weight of the payment of the highest bid tend to zero, SPA will yield higher revenue than FPA.

In an asymmetric environment, it is no longer always beneficial for the seller to disclose publicly available information, as the expected revenue may decrease and, therefore, the linkage principle fails (Perry & Reny, 1999). Information asymmetry may arise in an IPV setting, where some bidders know the valuation of some of their opponents, while, for the rest of the players, they are only aware of the underlying value distribution. In this way, the bidder population is partitioned in groups of bidders whose valuations are common knowledge among all members of each group. For example, in a procurement auction, domestic bidders may have superior information about the technical capabilities of opponents who are located domestically, compared to foreign auction participants. In this environment, expected revenue is higher in SPA compared to FPA (Kim & Che, 2004).


                           Campbell and Levin (2000) examined an SPA of two players, where the value and the signals are either 0 or 1. The underlying joint probability distribution of the value and signals has a particular parametric form. The parameter Œ≥ of this distribution is a measure of affiliation among the variables and lies in the interval [0.5,1]. When Œ≥¬†=¬†0.5 the variables are independent, while at the other extreme, Œ≥¬†=¬†1 corresponds to perfect correlation. In this setting, the equilibrium bidding strategy and the seller's revenue can be directly calculated, under different information environments corresponding to all possible ways by which the two signals may be observed. Campbell and Levin (2000) derived a surprising result, which at first sight appears counter-intuitive. The informed bidder, who knows the signal of his opponent, is actually worse-off compared to the environment where the same bidder observes both signals without being able to discern their identity. A qualitative explanation rests on the strategic interaction that occurs. When the informed bidder knows that his opponent has observed a high signal, namely 1, he will choose to raise his bid in order to stay competitive. In contrast, when a bidder is unaware about his opponent's signal, he will choose to gamble by submitting a lower bid, which forces his opponent to lower his own bid. Therefore, more information may bring more aggressive bidding, which raises the seller's revenue and, consequently, lowers the informed bidder's profit. It is interesting to note that, if instead the comparison was made among the environment where a bidder is fully aware of his opponent's signal and the setting where each bidder observes his own signal, the effect of information would be the same as derived by Milgrom and Weber (1982a): less information raises the seller's revenue and decreases the bidder's profit. As we have seen, even in the IPV setting, the effect of asymmetry on the expected revenue critically depends on the reference of the specific symmetric environment (Cantillon, 2008).

An interesting question is whether an informed bidder should reveal voluntarily his/her private information, assuming that its validity is verifiable by other players. The response is not immediate. Clearly a bidder may find it profitable to conceal a positive signal about the value of the auctioned object because otherwise opponents will bid higher. On the other hand, it may be preferable to reveal a negative signal about the value, hoping that this disclosure will force other bidders to lower their bids. This strategy, however, could be foreseen by opponents, who could realize that, when the particular bidder does not reveal his private information, the signal is positive. Arguing iteratively, the bidder in the end may have to disclose also positive private information. Benoit and Dubra (2006) showed that within many auction frameworks a bidder will either completely or partially reveal in equilibrium his/her private information. The result is striking because the ex-ante expected payoff may be reduced by this decision. Nevertheless, the pure common value model is not covered by this analysis.

In a similar research direction, Quint (2010) considered a two bidder FPA, where the common value has two additive components, which are stochastically independent. There are two different signals that each bidder could observe for each of the two value components. In this environment, it is possible to derive the unique equilibrium strategy and the corresponding expected payoff in the general form of different information schemes of the signals (Quint, 2010). The direct comparison of the expected payoff in each case, allows us to draw conclusions about how valuable the information is when it is gained secretly, in the sense that it constitutes private information, or openly, by accessing public knowledge. In particular, when one bidder obtains information that he/she was not expected to have, the benefit is not only due to the actual information, which is accessed. By signaling to the uninformed bidder the information advantage, which has been gained, the opponent is forced to bid less aggressively to avoid the winner's curse. At the same time, if the information, which the bidder receives, is already known to the other player, then, the ex-ante expected payoff is lower when the opponent learns about this information advantage. Consequently, in FPA it is in general advisable to covertly observe private information about a rival. Bidders in an English auction have a stronger incentive to acquire information about the private value component compared to a sealed bid SPA (Hernando-Veciana, 2009). In contrast, a sealed bid SPA forces bidders to seek more incremental information as opposed to the environment of an ascending open auction.

Turning our attention to the seller's point of view, another issue is whether information should be privately revealed to some bidders or publicly announced. In particular, the seller is allowed to discriminate among bidders in terms of the information which is disclosed. Mares and Harstad (2003) provided conditions under which, in an English common value auction with information asymmetry, the seller will always choose to privately reveal information to some of the less informed bidders, although it may not be beneficial to engage in complete truthful disclosure of all available information. In an IPV setting, where bidders are not fully aware of their valuation, Bergemann and Pesendorfer (2007) investigated the optimal mechanism and the policy disclosure of information that the seller should adopt. In this respect, the seller should discriminate among bidders in terms of the accuracy of information which is communicated to them, even if the bidders have the same prior distribution of valuation. Moreover, the auction should be optimally implemented as a sequence of take-it-or-leave-it offers. On the other hand, when the bidder valuation consists of a private and a common value component, the seller should optimally reveal publicly all the information about the common value component, and choose to implement a SPA or an English auction with reservation price, which depends on the information which is released (Gershkov, 2009).

In FPA, the decision between private or public disclosure depends on the content of available information. For high signals, public announcement is preferable, while for low signals private revelation should be chosen. For a two bidder asymmetric FPA setting, Campbell and Levin (2000) and Quint (2010), in the models of signal structure, which we previously described, confirmed that the seller always prefers to reveal information.

Efficiency of an auction mechanism is achieved when the bidder with the highest value is the winner of the auction. In the symmetric IPV environment, both FPA and SPA allocate efficiently the auctioned item to the bidder who has the highest valuation. In an asymmetric SPA environment, where the underlying value distributions are different among bidders, the (weakly) dominant strategy for each player is to bid his own value. Therefore, efficient allocation in SPA always occurs under the dominant strategy. In the IPV asymmetric setting, however, FPA fails to achieve efficiency. To demonstrate this, suppose that in a two bidder FPA environment, the equilibrium strategies are Œ≤
                           1(v) and Œ≤
                           2(v). Asymmetry allows us to assume that Œ≤
                           2(v)¬†<¬†Œ≤
                           1(v) for some v. Then, because of the continuity of the two strategies, for sufficiently small Œµ¬†>¬†0, we may have that Œ≤
                           2(v¬†+¬†Œ¥)¬†‚â§¬†Œ≤
                           2(v)¬†+¬†Œµ¬†<¬†Œ≤
                           1(v)¬†‚àí¬†Œµ¬†‚â§¬†Œ≤
                           1(v¬†‚àí¬†Œ¥). Therefore, the first bidder is able to win in equilibrium when his valuation is v¬†‚àí¬†Œ¥, even though the value of his opponent may be v¬†+¬†Œ¥, which demonstrates the inefficiency of FPA.

In a symmetric environment with interdependent values, the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategies in FPA, or in SPA or in an ascending English auction, are increasing in terms of the observed signal. Consequently, these mechanisms are not necessarily efficient, as the object is allocated to the bidder with the highest signal, which may not correspond to the highest value (Krishna, 2010). Suppose that the value of bidder i is given by Vi
                           ¬†=¬†Vi
                           (s
                           1,‚Ä¶,sn
                           ), where s
                           1,‚Ä¶,sn
                            are the signals of the bidders. The value function Vi
                            is increasing so that

In essence, we require that the signal of each bidder has the highest impact on his/her own value rather than on any other bidder's value. We consider first the symmetric common value environment, where the signals of the bidders are drawn from the same distribution. If the value function is symmetric in the sense that Vi

                            and the function u is symmetric in its last n¬†‚àí¬†1 arguments, then, under the single crossing condition and assuming that the signals are affiliated, FPA, SPA and the English auction have efficient symmetric equilibrium strategies (Maskin, 1992).

In the asymmetric common value environment Maskin (1992) showed that under the Single Crossing Condition, the two bidder English auction is efficient. Dasgupta and Maskin (2000) introduced the following weaker version of the Single Crossing Condition, which also guarantees efficiency of the two bidder English auction:


                           Single Crossing Condition (weak version): Let bidders i and j, with i¬†‚â†¬† j, have the same value, which is also the highest among all bidders. For all such pairs of bidders and for every realization of corresponding signals (s

When there are more than two bidders, the single crossing condition does not ensure efficiency in an English auction (Perry & Reny, 2002). It is possible, however, to modify the single crossing condition in order to ensure efficiency. For this reason, we consider the crossing of the average valuation

According to the average crossing condition, the influence of each signal is higher on the average value than the impact that it has on any other bidder's value. Krishna (2003) showed that whenever the average crossing condition holds, there is an equilibrium strategy for which the English auction is efficient. Dubra, Echenique, and Manelli (2009) provided a condition on the values, which is weaker than the average crossing condition and ensures efficiency in the English auction.

Under the weak version of the Single Crossing Condition, Dasgupta and Maskin (2000) constructed an efficient auction mechanism, which does not necessarily have the form of FPA, SPA or English. A more intuitive and considerably simpler mechanism, which involves pairwise competition and is efficient, has been proposed by Perry and Reny (2002).

It can be shown that the convolution model of Wilson (1998), with private and common value components, which we discussed before, satisfies the average crossing condition. Moreover, similarly to the symmetric setting, in an English auction with private and common value components, the bidder who drops out at each stage is the one who has the lowest value among all active players. Quite surprisingly, however, in the general asymmetric model of an IPV English auction, this may not be the case. Bidders may not necessarily drop out at every stage according to increasing values, even though the equilibrium strategy is efficient and eventually allocates the object to the highest value bidder (Krishna, 2010). The inefficiency of a common-value ascending auction allows a disadvantaged bidder, who has a lower valuation, to participate in the auction with a positive probability of winning (Pagnozzi, 2008). Similarly, experimental evidence suggests that even though bidders in IPV SPA tend to overbid, deviating from the dominant truthful strategy, auction efficiency increases over time as players learn to bid more like each other (Garratt & Wooders, 2010).

Auctions with entry cost restrict participation of players, who may find it unprofitable to bid when the cost is high. It would be reasonable to assume that the exclusion of these bidders will produce inefficiency. In a procurement setting, bidders may have to submit participation letters of bank guarantee, or submit samples for evaluation as well as having to incur a cost for the preparation of supporting documentation or the design of a prototype. Therefore, it may be reasonable to assume that players bear a participation cost in order to be active in the auction. Green and Laffont (1984) were the first to study such auctions. They derived the symmetric equilibrium strategy in SPA, where bidders have private information about the cost of participation and their value, and the underlying distribution is uniform. For a given value, this strategy involves a cut-off entry cost below which it is profitable to participate in the auction. In the symmetric IPV model, where participation cost is the same for all bidders and for strategies with cut-off values, Tan and Yilankaya (2006) showed that if the underlying value distribution is concave, the symmetric equilibrium strategy is unique. On the other hand, when the underlying value distribution is strictly convex, there will always be multiple asymmetric equilibria, which, necessarily, imply inefficiency. Cao and Tian (2013) extended the study of SPA to an asymmetric setting with bidders having different participation costs and value distributions. They derived, under conditions, the existence and uniqueness of a monotonic equilibrium, which applies a higher cut-off value when the entry cost increases. In this framework, the advantage of a bidder from a higher value distribution becomes weaker when the participation cost is high.

In a procurement SPA environment, Gal, Landsberger, and Nemirovsi (2007) considered the case where the entry cost and the value, which is the production cost, are dependent and they can be expressed by a given joint probability distribution. In this setting and under conditions, a unique equilibrium strategy may be derived and numerically implemented. The authors also proposed a partial reimbursement of the entry cost, which eventually raises the seller's revenue inducing higher participation from bidders with low production cost.

In the asymmetric IPV model, Stegeman (1996) showed that, when the reserve price is equal to the seller's valuation and there is no participation cost, an SPA mechanism is ex-ante efficient, in the sense that it maximizes the total surplus of the seller and the bidders. Lu (2009) proposed an alternative ex-ante efficient auction mechanism, which ensures uniqueness of the equilibrium. This auction mechanism is a modification of SPA, with a contingent subsidy for the entry cost and an appropriately set reserve price.

The FPA environment with costly entry has been examined by Cao and Tian (2010) with two groups of bidders: ‚Äúweak‚Äù and ‚Äústrong‚Äù. As before, the value distribution of ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidders first order stochastically dominates the one of ‚Äúweak‚Äù players. In this setting, it is shown that FPA is no longer efficient. By comparing these findings with the results of Menezes and Monteiro (2000), it is also deduced that the seller's revenue remains the same at the symmetric equilibrium, irrespectively of whether bidders know who participates or not.

A seller may also charge a fixed and non-refundable participation fee to all bidders. In the symmetric IPV setting with the number of bidders fixed, Riley and Samuelson (1981) and Myerson (1981) derived the optimal entry fee. On the other hand, when the number of bidders is random and entry is endogenous, it may be optimal for the seller not to charge any fee (Levin & Smith, 1994). Reserve prices and entry fees restrict some bidders from the auction. In an interdependent value auction with affiliated signals and the number of bidders fixed, it is advisable to the seller to set high entry fees and low reserve prices (Milgrom & Weber, 1982b). This result also holds when entry is endogenous (Levin & Smith, 1994).

All the above models assume that the participation cost or entry fee is paid once irrespectively of winning or losing. A pay-to-bid auction, which is frequently conducted in internet sales, is an ascending auction in which, every time a player places a new bid, there is a constant fee, which is paid to the seller. An analysis of the equilibrium bid strategy in this type of auction can be found in Kakhbod (2012).

Auctions appear within different frameworks of various transactions among economic agents. We proceed to consider settings, where auctions are part of a larger market setting. In our discussion, we will gradually extend the complexity of the structure of the processes involved and the interaction of economic agents.

When an auction mechanism is not efficient, a bidder, who is not able to acquire the auctioned object by winning at the auction, may still value the object more than the auction winner. Therefore, in an open economy, the awarding by an auction may be followed by a resale of the object to another player, whose valuation is higher. Sometimes, the auctioneer may prevent bidders from engaging into a resale process, fearing that this second stage trade will compromise the bid prices. Nevertheless, players usually find ways to circumvent these restrictions. For example, during the auction of spectrum licenses in the United Kingdom, although the government restricted the resale stage, unsuccessful bidders were able to acquire the auctioned license by buying the winning firm of the auction (Hafalir & Krishna, 2008). The presence of a secondary market is extremely influential in the bidding behavior (Lange, List, & Price, 2011).

A natural question is whether an inefficient auction could become efficient once it is supplemented by a subsequent resale stage. In this respect, FPA in an asymmetric IPV environment presents an interesting case to discuss. With resale possibilities, the set of strategies of the bidders becomes richer and the option of resale should be integrated in the bid price. Moreover, the information, which is revealed in the end of the auction, plays a critical role in the resale process. Gupta and Lebrun (1999) assumed that the values of all the bidders become publicly known when the auction is completed. As all the players are fully informed about their opponents' values, resale inevitably leads to efficiency. Haile (2003) analyzed an interdependent value with affiliated signals auction, in which symmetric bidders become aware of the values of their opponents after the awarding of the winner and, subsequently, revise their valuation in light of this new information, before they participate in the resale, which is carried out as a new SPA auction.

A more realistic setting is a two bidder FPA setting, where the bid prices, rather than the values, are announced. In the usual asymmetric framework, the value distribution of one player (the ‚Äústrong‚Äù one) first-order stochastically dominates the corresponding value distribution of the opponent, who is characterized as ‚Äúweak‚Äù. In the resale stage, the winner of the bid makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to his/her rival. In this environment, bidders ensure in equilibrium that, in the end of the auction, their bidding strategy does not completely reveal their values (Krishna, 2010). Incomplete information, which governs the resale process, generates inefficiency in the final allocation of the auctioned object.

In an alternative information structure, Hafalir and Krishna (2008) considered the case where the seller announces only the bid price of the winner, and derived a striking result. Under a regularity condition of the value distributions and although the bidders are asymmetric, the distributions of their bid prices are the same in equilibrium. This is achieved by forcing the ‚Äúweak‚Äù player to bid more aggressively in order to compete in equal terms with the ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidder. As we have already seen, in an auction without resale, the ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidder will also bid aggressively, but his/her bid distribution is stochastically dominated by the one of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidder. In the presence of a resale stage, however, the ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidder participates in the auction even more aggressively, ensuring that eventually his/her chance of winning is 50%. Due to this symmetrization effect, the environment of an asymmetric FPA with resale becomes equivalent to a symmetric FPA without resale. Exploiting this equivalence, Hafalir and Krishna (2008) derived the unique increasing equilibrium bidding strategy. When resale is not allowed, the FPA equilibrium strategies for the asymmetric IPV model, as we discussed in Section 3.1, can only be computed for particular cases of value distributions. To compare the effect of resale, Hafalir and Krishna (2009) compared the seller's revenue, which is generated in each of these tractable cases, with the corresponding revenue for the equilibrium strategy with resale. The result of this analysis was that the seller's revenue becomes higher when resale is allowed. In general, however, the effect of resale on expected revenue remains ambiguous. In a two bidder English auction with resale and known valuations, expected revenue increases if there is a small entry fee, while, if participation is costless, the effect on expected revenue depends on the wealth of the bidders (Pagnozzi, 2007).

In a two bidder SPA environment with resale, the winner of the auction pays the bid price of the opponent and, therefore, both bid prices have to be announced. Hafalir and Krishna (2008) showed that to bid one's value is an equilibrium strategy, although, due to the resale stage, it is no longer a dominant strategy. Further, for this model, when resale is allowed, FPA generates higher revenue to the seller compared to SPA. Cheng and Tan (2010) were able to relax the regularity assumptions of Hafalir and Krishna (2008). The results stem from the equivalence of an IPV asymmetric auction with resale to a common value auction. The analysis of the ranking of FPA and SPA in a common value auction, which we previously discussed in Section 3.3, enabled Cheng and Tan (2010) to establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the ranking of revenue under FPA and SPA with resale.

The possibility of resale increases the incentive of speculators to participate in an auction, even though the auctioned object has no value to them. The purpose of a speculator is to obtain the object by winning the auction and to subsequently sell it to the bidder who values it most. Garratt and Tr√∂ger (2006) considered an FPA and SPA environment with resale, where symmetric bidders compete against a speculator. As the speculator drives the bid price high, a bidder with high value will choose to bid low, preferring to obtain the auctioned item at the subsequent resale stage. Similarly, in an English auction with resale, a bidder with a high value may drop out before the price reaches his valuation (Pagnozzi, 2007).


                           Zheng (2002) examined the design of an optimal auction mechanism with resale, which leads to the maximum achievable revenue for the seller. Without resale, the seller has complete control of the allocation of the auctioned object and, therefore, he/she is able to obtain the highest possible revenue. The maximum revenue, without resale, is generated under the auction mechanism designed by Myerson (1981). When resale is not prohibited, Zheng (2002) proposed a mechanism, which involves multiple rounds of resale. The reseller at each round chooses sequentially the optimal for him/her mechanism. Under conditions, this mechanism leads to the Myerson allocation and the revenue for the seller is the maximum possible. Calzolari and Pavan (2006) examined the optimal auction mechanism, when resale is made to a third party, who does not participate in the primary auction.


                           Zhang and Wang (2013) constructed the optimal auction mechanism when the resale is carried out in the ultimatum form of take-it-or-leave-it. In this auction environment, one ‚Äúregular‚Äù bidder has a private value, while his/her opponent has a publicly known valuation, and acts as a dealer. When the commonly known value is zero, the dealer resembles a speculator. At the resale stage, the proposal for resale is randomly made by one of the two players. In the optimal mechanism, the seller finds it sub-optimal to allocate the object directly to the ‚Äúregular‚Äù bidder. This is consistent to many auctions in which only dealers are allowed to participate and not individual buyers. Another finding is that, in the end of the auction, the seller should not reveal any information regarding the valuation of the ‚Äúregular‚Äù player, apart from identifying who the winner is. Finally, when the valuation of the dealer is positive and the dealer always makes the resale proposal, the seller is able to achieve the Myerson revenue.

In an IPV setting, Xu, Levin, and Ye (2013) studied an environment with participation cost to enter the primary auction and without any entry cost for the resale. At the symmetric equilibrium of SPA and FPA, bidders with low entry cost have a lower cut-off entry value compared to the setting without resale. At the same time, bidders with high participation cost are less likely to enter in the presence of resale. Therefore, we see again that the opportunity of resale generates a speculation motivation for low value bidders while bidders with high entry cost and high value stay out of the auction preferring to obtain the object at the resale stage. When auction entry is costly, numerical results for a uniform value distribution suggest that the effect of resale in terms of the expected seller's revenue and efficiency remains ambiguous.


                           Vir√°g (2013) examined the asymmetric FPA environment with resale in the presence of more than two bidders. With multiple bidders, the bid price distributions of the players are no longer symmetric, so that ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidders tend to submit lower bids compared to ‚Äústrong‚Äù bidders. Nevertheless, resale reduces the asymmetry of the distributions of bids of the ‚Äústrong‚Äù and the ‚Äúweak‚Äù bidders compared to an auction without resale. As the number of bidders increases, the resale effect, leading to less asymmetry and to a preference of the seller to FPA rather than SPA, becomes less prominent.

In many auction resale models (Haile, 2003, Vir√°g, 2013) the resale stage is carried out as a secondary auction, such as SPA, resulting to a series of auctions, which appear at different stages. This sequential setting will be examined separately.

A more complex auction environment arises when there are multiple items for sale either simultaneously or sequentially in different time periods. In some cases instead of treating K identical objects as one indivisible item sold in one single winner-takes-it-all auction, the seller may decide to split the K units of the object and sell them separately to possibly different bidders. This can either be done in one single auction where bidders simultaneously submit K different bids, or in a sequence of K single unit auctions. In a procurement two bidder symmetric FPA, splitting the awarded quantity to different suppliers may decrease competition in comparison to sole-source award because any cost benefits to the buyer from split award are offset by the impact of a form of implicit coordination in bidding (Anton & Yao, 1989). On the other hand, if the two bidders have asymmetric information about their opponent's valuation, slit award auctions may be preferable for auctioneers (Anton & Yao, 1992). More involved auction processes which split the quantity awarded to different suppliers are discussed in Tunca and Wu (2009).

In a simultaneous auction of multiple non-identical objects, bidders often value differently the various combinations of the objects for sale, due to the competitive or complementary nature of the items. For this reason, the value of a combination of items may not be the sum of the values of the individual items when they are sold separately. Auctioning some or all of the items in bundles, where each bundle will necessarily be sold to a single bidder, is beneficial to the seller, when the number of bidders is small (Palfrey, 1983; Chakraborty, 1999). With a large number of bidders, selling the objects separately is preferable to the seller. When there are two objects for sale with two possible values, Armstrong (2000) and Avery and Hendershott (2000) showed that the optimal bundling for the seller is not to commit to sell the items as bundles or as single objects. The seller should employ a probabilistic form of bundling, so that the probability of winning an object is higher when the other object has been already won.

A process of assigning multiple items, which carries important theoretical advantages, is the Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves (VCG) mechanism (Vickrey, 1961; Clarke, 1971; Groves, 1973). According to this mechanism, for each item, the bidder who provides the highest bid is awarded the supply for this item. In the VCG process, however, the winning bidder pays an amount equal to the externality that the corresponding bidder exerts on the rivals. In particular, a bidder who wins K objects pays the sum of the K highest rejected bids of his/her opponents. Stated differently, the VCG auction mechanism resembles a discriminatory FPA, where the winning bidder pays the bid price and receives a refund, which is equal to the extra revenue of the seller due to the presence of the particular bid.

The VCG process generalizes, in a multiple item environment, the sealed bid SPA auction. Its main advantage is that the truth revealing strategy is weakly dominant while, at the same time, the mechanism allocates multiple objects efficiently, and, under conditions, it maximizes the seller's revenue among all efficient mechanisms (Krishna & Perry, 1997; Ausubel & Milgrom, 2006). Despite its elegance and theoretical appeal, Ausubel and Milgrom (2006) and Rothkopf (2007a) pinpointed several weaknesses of the VCG mechanism. In many cases, the information revelation of the true value may be undesirable, as for example in public tenders where bidders may not be willing to reveal their profit, although encryption systems may alleviate the privacy concern. Another weakness is that the truth-reporting strategy in VCG is no longer dominant under a financial constraint of limited budget. VCG mechanisms are also vulnerable to cheating, since the final payment depends drastically on the other bids and bidders have incentives to collude and coordinate their strategies or to introduce false identity bids. Auction cheating will be further explored and discussed in Section 5. The computational complexity for determining the winner may discourage the implementation of the VCG mechanism, although, it should be noted that other commonly found in procurement auction mechanisms are more computationally involved.

The most serious concern for the seller is the revenue deficiency, which arises when payments are too low even though competition is ample. To explain how the VCG mechanism can be revenue deficient, Ausubel and Milgrom (2006) provided an interesting example. Suppose that there are four bidders {A,B,C,D} and three items {a,b,c} for purchase. The valuations of the bidders are shown in Table 3.
                     

In the VCG mechanism, the items a, b and c are awarded to bidders A, B and C, respectively, who pay nothing, although an SPA auction for the indivisible set of all items would award them to bidder D and the revenue would be 1 monetary unit. Some of the above weaknesses can be relaxed under a condition that all bidders have substitute preferences (Ausubel & Milgrom, 2006). The fact remains that due to the weaknesses outlined above, although the simple Vickrey SPA has been conducted since the nineteenth century in philatelic auctions (Lucking-Reiley, 2000), the VCG mechanism is not widely used in real auctioning.

Bidders often participate in a sequence of auctions for similar objects. In such an environment, each auction can no longer be viewed in isolation. The information, which is received by the bidders in each stage, may drastically affect the revised valuation in subsequent auctions. Consequently, the bid price becomes a function of both the particular bidder's initial value and the announced bid prices of the previous auctions. Some interesting examples of sequential auctions, the data of which have been empirically studied, are auctions for red Bordeau wine (Ashenfelter, 1989), Dutch roses (Van Den Berg, Van Ours, & Pradhan, 2001) and sardines (Pezanis-Christou, 2000). Pesendorfer (2000) examined first price sequential auctions for milk, investigating collusion among bidders.

If the time period, within which the auctions take place, is long, discounting by an appropriate interest rate is required when the total revenue or payoff is computed. It is also important to specify how many units in total each bidder intends to purchase. In the simplest case, the bidders are assumed to have a single unit demand.


                           Milgrom and Weber (1999) characterized the symmetric equilibrium strategy in sequential affiliated value FPA or English auctions of single units, with or without announcement of the winning price. Another interesting case is a sequence of K IPV FPAs with single unit demand, which are all held within a short time period, and, therefore, there is no need of discounting. The n bidders are assumed to be symmetric and the value distribution is F. The symmetric equilibrium strategy for the kth auction is Œ≤k
                           (x)¬†=¬†Œï[V
                           (
                           
                              k
                           
                           )|V
                           (
                           
                              k
                           
                           )¬†<¬†x¬†<¬†V
                           (
                           
                              k
                           ¬†+¬†1)], where x is the value and V
                           (
                           
                              k
                           
                           ) is the kth order statistic of n¬†‚àí¬†1 independent random variables drawn from F (Krishna, 2010). According to this strategy, players place progressively higher bids until they are able to win one object. Nevertheless, the sequence of winning bid prices forms a martingale in the sense that, when the outcome of the kth auction is known, the winning price at the k¬†+¬†1 auction is on the average the already observed winning price at the kth auction. In essence, this occurs because the competitive forces of each auction balance the progressively higher bids and counter the decrease of the number of competing bidders, as winning players depart. Strangely enough and contrary to the theoretical prediction, empirical evidence from wine auctions supports a downward movement of the winning prices (Ashenfelter, 1989), which presents an anomaly to the previous result. On the other hand, in a sequence of English auctions for used cars in New Jersey from 2001 to 2002, the reported prices presented an increasing tendency (Raviv, 2006).

Several explanations have been proposed to explain the declining price phenomenon (Ashta, 2006), including non-decreasing risk aversion of the players and synergistic and complementary effects among others. The presence of outside options may also explain the declining price anomaly (Kirchkamp, Poen, & Reiss, 2009). The decreasing pattern of equilibrium prices also appears in the symmetric strategy of sequential IPV SPAs with single-unit demand, when the auctioneer does not commit to the exact number of units, which are for sale (Rodriguez, 2012). Instead, the auctioneer evaluates in each stage whether the sequence of auctions should be terminated early, in view of the information, which is available at that time. Clearly, although this situation does not apply to a seller, who adopts high reserve prices above the marginal cost, the setting is relevant to a weak seller, who announces low reserve prices. When the environment is a sequence of two FPAs with imperfect quantity commitment, it is possible to determine a unique symmetric and monotone bidding strategy only when the second auction is sufficiently discounted (Zeithammer, 2009). High valuation bidders will bid less aggressively in the first auction, knowing that their bid price is above the marginal cost of the seller and, therefore, the occurrence of the second auction will not be affected. Therefore, it is advisable for sellers to engage in some form of commitment in the form of a reserved price schedule.


                           Morales and Steinberg (2014) examined a procurement auction setting where the demand of a product extends in two periods. Instead of assigning the total supply for both periods to one bidder, using a standard SPA and treating both periods as one indivisible object, the auctioneer may award the supply of each period to different bidders. Morales and Steinberg (2014) provide a lower bound to the cost deficiency in a multiple winner VCG auction compared to the cost of the SPA.

Sequential auctions are often conducted by retailers in order to scrap inventory with consumers having single unit demand. Vulcano, Van Ryzin, and Maglaras (2002) proposed a dynamic auction mechanism by which, conditionally on the bids received, the seller decides the quantity, which will be sold, and the bids, which will be accepted. An extension to an infinite horizon sequential auction is examined by
van Ryzin and Vulcano (2004). On the other hand, when the seller announces the auctioned quantity before the bids are known and the number of participating bidders is random with known distribution, Chen, Ghate, and Tripathi (2011) derived the optimal lot size to be auctioned. Similarly, Ghate (2015) determined the number of units to be scrapped and the minimum level below which bids are not accepted when the estimate of the distribution of the number of units is dynamically updated.


                           Katehakis and Puranam (2012) viewed a sequential auction, where bidders have multi-unit demand while an open market also offers the same object at a fixed price, as a Markov decision process and derived the optimal bidding prices at each stage. In the case of players with multi-unit demand, a bidder, with a high signal, has an incentive to deceive opponents by falsely conveying the impression of a low signal. In a sequential framework with identical auctioned objects, the bidder with a high signal may attempt, by randomization between concealing and revealing, to make the first auction non-informative, to ensure that the fear of winner's curse is present only for the second auction. Therefore, when the signals tend to be high, sellers should prefer a sequential setting rather than the simultaneous auction of all the objects (Pezanis-Christou, 2013).


                           Juda and Parkes (2009), motivated by eBay online auctions, proposed a transformation of a sequential SPA with unit supply for the sellers and multi-unit demand for the buyers, and dynamic arrivals and departures, into an option based auction with proxy agents that match prices and goods. The proposed system allows buyers to have a simple truthful dominant strategy, similar to the single unit SPA.

If there are two asymmetric bidders, then, in an infinite sequential common value FPA environment with discounting, the informed bidder eventually reveals his/her information (H√∂rner & Jamison, 2008). Once the informed bidder makes this information publicly known, the bid prices become equal to the common value estimate, which yields zero profit in subsequent auctions. In this respect, the seller prefers the sequential setting rather than the simultaneous multi-unit auction. At the same time, quite unexpectedly, the discounted profit of the informed bidder is relatively lower compared to the uninformed player. However, if both players are informed, and for low discount factors, bidders are able to ensure positive discounted profits and, therefore, the seller will prefer the simultaneous multi-unit auction.


                           Vir√°g (2007) examined a sequential common value auction setting, where two employers compete for one worker. The bid is the wage that the worker will receive for each period. The current employer has exact knowledge of the value of the worker, while his opponent has initially a prior distribution for the common value. In this asymmetric environment, in the end of each auction, only the identity of the winner, and not the bid prices, is announced. Compared to the simultaneous multi-unit auction, the spread of information from the first auction reduces the information asymmetry between the two bidders in the second auction, and, therefore, competition becomes more aggressive while the seller's revenue increases.

Auctions often appear in complex networks of economic trading. In such an environment, procurement auctions, in particular, become an integral process within the supply chain, while an active market for the auctioned object may exist either downstream or upstream. To illustrate with an example, suppose that an upstream manufacturer conducts an auction to sell the production capacity, which is viewed as an indivisible object, to two downstream agents. An active market ensures that additional units may be purchased at a higher cost. The two downstream agents eventually compete in the retail market where the demand curve is linear with uncertain intercept. Chen and Vulcano (2009) derived the equilibrium bidding strategies and showed that the impact of the information revealed by the upstream auction is to lower the bids, compared to an isolated auction setting. Moreover, SPA provides higher payoff to both the upstream manufacturer and the downstream agents compared to FPA.


                        Bose and Deltas (2007) examined a SPA environment where a seller can either restrict participation by selling the item exclusively to intermediaries, who eventually resell the auctioned object to the consumers by a subsequent new SPA, or allow to one randomly chosen consumer to participate in the auction. The consumer valuations are private and independent while the auctioned object has no value to the resellers. Bose and Deltas (2007) derive a stark result: the seller earns higher expected revenue by committing not to sell to the consumers directly. The reason is that, in an unrestricted auction, attended by a consumer, intermediaries bid less aggressively under the fear that if they win, the value of the losing consumer would be below the winning bid and, consequently, the resale value may have been overestimated. This effect counters the extra revenue from the participation of the additional bidder and may explain why in some auctions final consumers are not allowed to bid.

In many real world examples, auctions generate competition among supply chains rather than isolated agents. As an example, consider an upstream manufacturer, who participates in a downstream procurement FPA indirectly through an intermediate agent. The intermediate agent, who eventually bids in the auction, may be the local authorized distributor of an overseas manufacturer. The manufacturer and the distributor have different views about the competition, as expressed by their corresponding estimate of the cumulative distribution function of the opponents' cost. Moreover, the two supply partners may intentionally conceal information from each other, in an effort to gain an advantage in the division of total profit. Lorentziadis (2014) derived the equilibrium transfer price, at which the object becomes available from the manufacturer to the distributor, and the equilibrium bid price in the auction. In unilateral communication, the informed supply chain agent is always able to apply a higher margin, while, in information sharing, profit is equally divided among the two partners. A similar double marginalization occurs in online auctions, where an ad agency acts as intermediary selling to an advertiser a display, which will be available only if the ad agency is the winner of a central downstream SPA for the purchase of the ad slot. In this setting, it is the intermediary agent, who determines the transfer price, which becomes also the bid price, due to the dominant truth telling strategy in the central SPA. It may be shown that it is always preferable for the intermediate party to offer the ad slot to the advertiser at a take-it-or-leave-it price, which is randomly determined in an interval with endpoints related to the reserve price of the central auction (Feldman, Mirronki, Muthukrishnan, & Pai, 2010).


                           Cachon and Zhang (2006) considered the optimal sourcing mechanism for a buyer, whose total cost has two components: the purchase cost and the operating cost, which depends on the lead time. A simpler mechanism is to conduct a SPA and to either charge a fee for late delivery or to specify the required lead time. Both of these methods perform relatively well compared to the optimal mechanism.

In Hu, Beil, and Duenyas (2013), a downstream buyer conducts an English auction in which the cost of each bidder is the sum of two components: the cost of purchasing a part of the object from an upstream manufacturer and the cost of processing. It is preferable for the upstream manufacturer, who makes the part available, to quote a different price to each bidder (Hu, Beil, and Duenyas 2013). In particular, the part should be offered at a low price to the bidder with the highest potential to sell at the downstream buyer and at higher prices to the other bidders, gambling that the profit will be higher, if any one of these less promising bidders is successful. If, on the other hand, the profit potential of all bidders is low, it is advisable for the upstream manufacturer to treat all bidders equally and to gamble with a higher quote. Moreover, the optimal selling mechanism for the upstream manufacturer is to employ an English ascending auction, which will provide the part to one bidder at the highest price. Of course, when the manufacturer backs only one bidder, it remains unclear how the upstream auction should be eventually conducted under such a monopoly framework.

In the newsvendor problem, a retailer faces an uncertain market demand and can source the product from multiple suppliers. To purchase the product, the retailer conducts an auction. If the auctioned quantity is fixed before the actual demand is observed, which is called a push contract, the retailer bears all the risk of ordering in excess or below the demand. In the other extreme, which is known as a pull contract, the order is placed after the demand becomes known, whereas the suppliers bid without knowing the exact quantity that will be ordered. Therefore, in this case, the risk of uncertainty of the order is shifted to the suppliers, who, nevertheless, may be obliged to make a substantial investment for the required production capacity. When a fixed cost for the supply is present and there are multiple auctioned items, which may be ordered at lower quantities than initially inquired, the bidder may employ different methods to ensure profitability, such as setting a lower acceptable order level or proposing an appropriate discount schedule (Lorentziadis, 2008). In combinatorial auctions bidders are allowed to place bids for combinations (packages) of the auctioned objects, which greatly increases the computational burden for the mechanism design and the determination of winners (Sandholm, 2002;
Schneider, Shabalin, & Bichler, 2010). The computation effort of determining the winning allocation can be relaxed when bidders limit the allowable combinations (Park & Rothkopf, 2005) or by using efficient computational algorithms (Mansouri & Hassini, 2015). A comprehensive review of combinatorial auctions can be found in Cramton, Shoham, and Steinberg (2006). For an IPV English auction, Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) proposed a variant of the push mechanism, where the order is placed after the auction but before the realization of the demand. Similarly, they proposed a pull contract, where the order is placed after the demand is known, while bids in the auction have to be above a floor price limit. These mechanisms are simple to implement and perform relatively well compared to the optimal auction mechanism. Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) concluded that a push contact is preferable for the buyer when there are many suppliers and the demand is high, while the pull contract becomes more attractive when the demand is more variable and the unit cost of the supply is high. Budde and Minner (2014) extended the setting of Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) in the FPA environment with risk aversion. They concluded that a risk-averse retailer always prefers FPA rather than SPA for a pull contract. The same preference holds for a push contract when risk aversion is sufficiently high. Suppliers, with low risk aversion, prefer pull contracts and their choice is reversed in favor of push contracts as risk aversion becomes sufficiently high.


                           Chen (2007) proposed that the retailer, who faces uncertain demand, should first design a contract which gives a price for every possible quantity ordered, and proceed to a standard auction selling this contract to the supplier with the highest bid. Due to the practical difficulty in the implementation of auctioning such contracts, Duenyas, Hu, and Beil (2013) developed a modified version of an English auction for a fixed quantity, which is simple in its application while it continues to be an optimal mechanism.

Auction bidding is an inherently risky process of trading. There are, however, many sources of uncertainty, which force bidders to adjust their bidding strategy taking into account the risk involved.

The uncertainty in the outcome of an auction is typically captured by an appropriate von Neumann-Morgenstern utility, which is distinguished by the risk aversion of the decision maker. Therefore, each bidder maximizes his/her expected utility rather than the expected monetary profit. The early work of Holt (1980), in a symmetric IPV sale FPA with increasing and concave utility function, demonstrated that risk aversion produces higher bid prices, as risk-averse bidders try to avoid the gambling nature of auction bidding. Due to the monotonicity of the utility function, truth telling in the IPV SPA environment is still a dominant strategy. Therefore, the revenue equivalence theorem no longer holds as the FPA seller's revenue is higher with risk-averse bidders. Moving from the IPV environment to a symmetric common value FPA setting, risk aversion does not necessarily increase the seller's revenue (Menicucci, 2004). The reason is that risk-averse bidders evaluate more dearly the loss due to the winner's curse and bid more conservatively.

The asymmetric IPV FPA, where bidders exhibit different risk aversion, has been explored in a particular parametric setting by Mar√©chat and Morand (2011). The allocation becomes inefficient as a highly risk averse bidder will increase his/her bid more than a bidder with lower risk aversion. Moreover, the seller's expected revenue increases with the asymmetry of risk aversion. Campo (2012) developed a semi-parametric estimation method when bidders are asymmetrically risk-averse, which recovers the utility and value distributions from the observed bid prices. The model assumes that the utility and value distributions are common knowledge among bidders.

In an interdependent value auction, bidders face the risk of uncertainty of the value of the auctioned object. Bidders exhibit decreasing absolute risk-aversion (DARA), when their utility u, is such that ‚àíu''(x)/u'(x) is decreasing. Es≈ë and White (2004) showed that in affiliated value FPA, SPA, and English auctions, symmetric DARA bidders behave less aggressively compared to the IPV setting, reducing their bid prices mare than the risk premium. This effect is known as ‚Äúprecautionary bidding‚Äù. It is caused by the fact that DARA bidders value more highly each extra monetary unit of income against an increase in the probability of winning. Due to precautionary bidding, DARA bidders prefer auctions with interdependent values rather than IPV. For example, DARA bidding firms would choose to adopt similar production technologies, introducing in this way common value elements in the auction. Therefore, paradoxically enough, in FPA and SPA, the winner's curse becomes a blessing for DARA bidders, who are better off in a common value setting. For English auctions, however, DARA bidders are indifferent between the IPV and the interdependent value environment. On the other hand, under constant absolute risk aversion, bidders have no preference towards either the private value or the common value auction.

In a decision theoretic framework, Takano, Ishii, and Muraki (2014) considered the risk of uncertainty of the cost, in a sequence of auctions. A stochastic dynamic programming approach allows the determination of the optimal bid prices, under a value-at-risk constraint, which limits the exposure to the risk due to cost uncertainty.

Another form of risk is generated by the uncertainty in the number of bidders n, who will participate in the auction. Based on the findings of Matthews (1987), Table 4
                            summarizes whether bidders would prefer in a symmetric IPV FPA to have n revealed or concealed by the seller/auctioneer with regard to their risk aversion. Table 4 also provides the type of auction (FPA or SPA), which bidders or the auctioneer/seller prefer for different attitudes towards risk.


                           Levin and Ozdenoren (2004) followed a minimum utility approach in which symmetric IPV bidders determine their strategy minimizing their maximum utility with respect to a set of priors for n. Although in SPA truth telling remains the dominant strategy, in FPA the equilibrium bid price resembles the standard FPA strategy, where the valuation distribution is the minimum of the expected winning probability over all priors for n. Moreover, under a ‚Äúmonotone likelihood ratio‚Äù condition, the bid price increases when the set of priors becomes larger. This can be interpreted as an ambiguity aversion of the bidders, in the sense that when there is more uncertainty about the available states of nature, bidders raise their price. We will return to the ambiguity aversion in Section 6. Finally, in SPA bidders are indifferent whether the seller reveals or conceals n, while in FPA, their preference is to become aware of n. The seller's preference, on the other hand, is to conceal n.
                        

The winning bidder of a supply or construction auction may decide to abandon the project before its completion. Often, the reason is that the actual cost of the project turns out to be higher than the initial estimate or there is another opportunity, which offers a higher return. The possibility where bids are not irrevocably executable and can be withdrawn at a cost was examined in Rothkopf (1991). Withdrawable bids provide an insurance against the winner's curse (Harstad & Rothkopf, 1995).

To protect the procurer against the risk of contractor default, one solution is to enforce the payment of liquidated damages if the winner of the auctions defaults. Alternatively, this may be implemented as loss of a deposited amount. In an IPV FPA and SPA with possibility of bidder default, Waehrer (1995) derived the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategies and concluded that decreasing the deposit is to the benefit of the auctioneer. Chillemi and Mezzetti (2014) considered an optimal mechanism, which involves a contract clause for the payment of stipulated damages if the project is not completed. The optimal mechanism takes the form of a lottery assignment, when the minimum cost of all the bidders is above a threshold. Under this mechanism, when the cost is private information for each bidder, the stipulated damages become punitive, in the sense that they exceed the expected value of the project. The optimal mechanism cannot be implemented in the form of a standard auction, although, it may be approximated by a SPA with a fixed amount of liquidated damage in case of breach.

The implementation of upfront payments creates a number of practical problems especially for financially distressed firms. Due to limited liability, the winning firm in a procurement project will choose to default, if it discovers that the eventual cost of the project exceeds the sum of its bid price and its financial assets. Burguet, Ganuza, and Hauk (2012) examined mechanism design taking under consideration the financial strength of the bidders. Financially weak bidders are most likely to submit a low bid price and subsequently default. For this reason, auctioneers, who want to avoid default and ensure project completion, should discourage financially weak bidders from placing a low bid as, for example, by requiring a minimum discount on the budget price at a procurement auction. In this way, competition for bidders with low financial assets becomes less aggressive and the probability of default is reduced. The impact of project financing in the bid prices was investigated by Campo (2012) in a data set of the Los Angeles City Hall construction projects in the period between 1994 and 2003. It is estimated that if payment were made in advance, the bid price of weak firms would be substantially lowered. Under limited liability, the expected procurement cost is lower in FPA compared to SPA (Parlane, 2003). Supplier prequalification screening can in general alleviate the risk of default (Drew & Skitmore, 1993; Wan & Beil, 2009).

On the other side of the auction floor, the winning bidder needs to address the risk of default of the auctioneer, who might be unable to make the agreed payment even though the project has been successfully completed. Lorentziadis (2014) derived the risk premium in FPA and SPA, which takes the form of an additional mark-up in the equilibrium bid price and compensates for the auctioneer risk of default.

Financial constraints may prohibit bidders from adhering to their initial bidding strategy creating inefficiency (Maskin, 1992). For example, an absolute budget makes it impossible to bid above the fixed spending limit. This may be restrictive when bidding in simultaneous auctions (Rothkopf, 1977; Palfrey, 1980). Alternatively, it may be possible to exceed the budget by external financing which requires payment of interest. In the IPV setting, where the value and the budget are private information, Che and Gale (1998) showed that the expected revenue of the seller is higher in FPA compared to SPA. In essence, when the budget is an absolute spending limit or when external credit is available, the imposed financial constraint becomes more binding in SPA rather than in FPA.

An auction has a fixed set of rules by which it is conducted and these rules must be clearly understood and followed by all players. To increase the objectivity of the auction process and for practical reasons, the seller of an item often delegates to a reputable third-party auction house (auctioneer) to run the auction in return for a commission. There are various methods by which the bidders, the auctioneer and the seller may try to bend or, even, break the rules engaging in illicit behavior in an effort to curb or intensify the competition and bias the allocation process.

Bidders may engage in colluding behavior in an attempt to suppress rivalry. The formation of rings enables bidders to act cooperatively, which drastically modifies the competitive nature of auctions in an illegal manner (Marshall & Marx, 2012). Collusion in its most simple form involves a bribe from one bidder to his rival, in order to abstain from the auction. For this form of collusion, Rachmilevitch (2013) derived conditions for a continuous monotonic equilibrium in the IPV FPA. In the same setting with commonly known values, the two bidders with the highest valuations collude with probability exceeding 50% (Kivetz & Tauman, 2010). Rings, however, may be formed by a much more complex collusive mechanism.

The operation of a bidding ring is often coordinated and implemented by a ‚Äúcenter‚Äù. In a weak cartel, ring members communicate with each other exchanging information about their valuations or report their values to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù, without any side payments.

In an all-inclusive weak cartel, which operates optimally without side-payments in IPV-FPA, all bidders submit a bid equal to the reserve price provided that they report to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù a value above the reserve price (McAfee & McMillan, 1992). In this way, the object is allocated randomly by the auctioneer to one of the ring members with valuation exceeding the reserve price. The cartel can do no better than to randomly assign the right to bid to one of its members. Athey, Bagwell, and Sanchirico (2004) extended this result for weak cartels that operate in repeated auctions, when the winner is not identified but the winning price is common knowledge. The collusion mechanism of random allocation, however, is not efficient, since the auctioned object does not end up to the bidder who values it most. It is precisely the lack of efficiency in a weak cartel, which allows the design of an optimal collusion-proof auction mechanism, ensuring that the bidder with the highest valuation does not have an incentive to participate in a cartel. In a symmetric IPV environment where the density of the value distribution has one peak, Che, Condorelli, and Kim (2014) derived a simple procedure for an optimal collusion-free auction. Initially, the seller runs a SPA with reserve price set at the maximum of the standard reserve price and the peak of the value density. If no bid exceeds the reserve price, the seller offers the object sequentially to each bidder, with a predetermined order, at a take-it-or-leave-it price.

If monetary transfers between the collusive bidders are also foreseen through a transfer mechanism, then, the cartel takes its strong form at the expense of leaving more visible traces for prosecution. In a symmetric IPV FPA and under the condition of increasing hazard rate of the underlying value distribution, McAfee and McMillan (1992) showed that a cartel, which includes all n bidders, operates efficiently by having first all bidders report their values to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù and leaving only the highest bidder to submit a bid at the level of the reserve price, provided that his/her reported value exceeds the reserve price. Moreover, each ring member receives an amount which is equal to n
                           ‚àí1
                           E[V
                           (2)¬†‚àí¬†r|V
                           (1)¬†‚â•¬†r], where r is the reserve price, and V
                           (1) and V
                           (2) are respectively the highest and second highest reported values. This mechanism can be implemented by a supplementary FPA, known as knockout auction, run by the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù prior to the auction. If the seller suspects bidder collusion, he/she should respond by appropriately increasing the reserve price (McAfee & McMillan, 1992). In the presence of strong cartels, auctions, which deter collusion, have been designed by Pavlov (2008) and Che and Kim (2009). In an asymmetric IPV setting, the optimal auction in the presence of a strong cartel can become collusion-proof provided that the cartel is not all-inclusive or, alternatively, whenever the sale of the object may not always occur under the optimal auction. Nevertheless, the practical implementation becomes dubious as losing bidders suffer considerable losses, in addition to paying the winning bidders.


                           Graham and Marshall (1987) examined the effect of a strong cartel in an environment of symmetric IPV SPA and English auctions. A knockout SPA mechanism prior to the main auction determines the member of the ring who will represent the cartel in the main auction and the monetary transfers, which will be made. This mechanism induces truthful reporting of the private valuations and ensures that no ring member deviates from the prescribed collusive behavior. Moreover, collusion is efficient as it allocates the auctioned item to the bidder with the highest valuation. On the other hand, the weakness in the implementation of this mechanism is that the net payments within the cartel are zero on the average (ex-ante), which means that sometimes the ring center will make ex-post a loss while in other occasions it will run a surplus. Mailath and Zemsky (1991) extended the analysis for heterogeneous bidders and proposed a mechanism which is efficient and ex-post budget balancing, although it is rather difficult to implement, as again losing bidders are required to make side payments to other bidders. Krishna (2010) considered an ex-post balancing mechanism, based on a VCG auction, which is efficient but fails to induce truth-telling as a dominant bidding strategy. Sosic (2007) proposed a mechanism, which is efficient and ex-post balancing, while truth-telling, although still not a dominant strategy, is an equilibrium in terms of minimax regret.

The operation of a cartel is drastically affected by the auction framework. Marshall, Marx, and Meurer (2012) discussed an example of five bidders with valuation 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. In SPA, a ring, which would involve bidders with valuations 4 and 5, would require bidder 4 to submit a bid 3 and bidder 5 to bid his true value, as in the non-cooperative game. The winner would pay the second price, which is 3, and the profit of 2 could be split among the ring members, while, without the cartel, the profit would only be 1. In FPA, the same ring would dictate bidder 5 to submit a bid at 3 and bidder 4 to bid strictly below 3. The operation of the cartel, though, becomes more unstable, because, contrary to SPA, bidder 5 is acting differently compared to the non-cooperative game, and at the same time, bidder 4 has an incentive to cheat by placing a bid slightly above 3.


                           Marshall and Marx (2007) compared the operation of a cartel in FPA and SPA. They considered a heterogeneous IPV environment, where the cartel commits before the auction to a particular mechanism by which colluding bidders report their values to the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù, agrees on the amounts of monetary transfers between them and receive recommendations about their bid price. The cartel is not all-inclusive and bidders are allowed to decide whether to join the ring. Subsequently, ring members are forced to adhere to the collusive mechanism and submit bids on the basis of their private information. The auctioneer announces nothing about the outcome of the auction in an effort to avoid collusion. Nevertheless, even in an infinitely repeated FPA setting, Blume and Heidhues (2006) demonstrated that by withholding all information, the auctioneer cannot prevent bid rigging. Due to this secrecy, the cartel may be unable to control the bids, in which case the collusion is known as bid coordination mechanism (BCM). On the other hand, in a bid submission mechanism (BSM), ring members are forced by the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù to submit dictated bids, and, therefore, the cartel becomes more visible. Marshall and Marx (2007) showed that in SPA, there is an equilibrium BCM, which is efficient and suppresses all ring competition. In FPA this is not possible, since for any BCM, at least sometimes, two ring members will bid slightly different prices. In the FPA environment, only BSM can suppress competition among colluding bidders. If in an FPA colluding bidders are able to submit bids under undetected identity, then even BSM fails to eliminate ring competition, generating serious complications in the operation of the cartel. In contrast, in SPA, the presence of undetected bids has no effect on the operation of the ring.

Collusion in common value auctions enables ring members to pool the available information about the value of the auctioned object, increasing the precision of their estimates, which leads to more efficient bidding and reduces the winner's curse. At first glance this appears to support the formation of cartels. However, a bidder with high signal may be hesitant in sharing information and making side payments to opponents with low signal. On the other hand, bidders with low signals are more willing to reveal their private information. Therefore, bidders with high signal may be better off refusing to join the ring. In common value FPA with binding reserve price, Hendricks, Porter, and Tan (2008) showed that information sharing discourages collusion. Moreover, the optimal collusive mechanism is a knockout FPA, a version of which can be ex-post efficient and balanced. Similarly, Mares and Shor (2008) demonstrated experimentally that collusion in a common value environment generates lower bid prices.

Shill bidding appears in an auction when the seller participates in the process acting as a new bidder in an effort to mislead the actual bidders and raise the winning bid by pushing the price upward. On-line auctions are more susceptible to shilling since technology makes it easier to conceal the identity of a bidder (Nikitkov & Bay, 2008). Another motive of the seller for shill bidding is to avoid paying a high commission to the auction house by setting a low reserve price, while, subsequently shilling raises the price (Kauffman & Wood, 2005). In phantom bidding, it is the auctioneer who engages in covert bidding, submitting ‚Äúoff the wall‚Äù bids, with the intention to raise the winning price and, consequently, the amount of commission received.

When shilling is successful, it allows a seller to change the payment method of an auction. For example, in SPA the seller attempts to increase the payment from the level of the second highest price towards the highest bid price, by inserting shill bids above the second highest price.

In every auction, a seller is always ex-ante active by setting an initial reserve price for the auctioned object. In an IPV setting, shill bidding essentially becomes equivalent to selecting a reserve price, which is flexible rather than fixed from the beginning. Rothkopf and Harstad (1995) examined an IPV auction environment where a seller runs either an honest FPA or a SPA, while shill bidding occurs with some probability known to the seller. Whenever the auction is conducted as SPA, bidders respond by adjusting their bids according to their own estimate of the probability of shilling. The decrease of the bids forces in equilibrium all sellers, with the exception of the one with the highest possible probability of shilling (who remains indifferent) to strictly prefer FPA rather than SPA. McAdams and Swartz (2007) examined an IPV SPA, where the value distribution is uniform in [0,1] and there is a fixed cost for hiring a shill, which the bidders view as a random variable following a known probability distribution. In equilibrium, the seller, who decides to shill bid, will do so only when the observed cost of shill is below a threshold while bidders adjust their bid prices accordingly. As a result, shilling reduces the seller's expected revenue.


                           Lamy (2009) considered a symmetric affiliated value FPA or SPA, where the seller, after setting a fixed reserve price, decides whether to submit a shill bid, acting strategically as a new uninformed bidder. The symmetric equilibrium strategies for the bidders and the seller yield lower revenue for the seller when shilling is possible, because sellers bid less aggressively due to the fear that the second highest bid will come from the seller. Therefore, the seller will find it preferable to credibly commit to a policy of no shill bidding. Moreover, if the seller is not willing to commit to such a policy and when the signals are independent, the revenue in FPA is strictly higher than in SPA.

In a common value English auction, when the seller can shill bid at any time, shilling generates an additional effect because actual bidders may revise upwards their estimate of the true value, as the shill bids create the impression that there are more bidders with higher valuation. In the symmetric environment where the seller has the same information as all other bidders and signals are binary, Chakraborty and Kosmopoulou (2004) showed that it is preferable for the seller to ensure that the bidders' estimate of the probability of shilling remains low. In fact, bidders adjust their bids at a lower level, when they suspect that shilling may be present, which triggers a negative impact to the seller's profit. Consequently, the seller must strengthen his/her good reputation of adhering to the rules of the auction. Therefore, the seller should consider hiring a third-party mechanism, which would prohibit undetected shill bids. On the other hand, the auctioneer usually receives a commission on the winning bid price or on the reserve price, provided that there is a bid exceeding the reserve price. As a result, contrary to the seller, the auctioneer may find shill bidding preferable, especially when the contribution of the shill bid to the valuation of the object is considerable. In conclusion, the incentives of the auctioneer may not be aligned to the interests of the seller. Experimental evidence (Kosmopoulou & De Silva, 2007) confirms that shill bidding reduces the seller's payoff, while bidders may be better off, since the bid price is lower and the effect of winner's curse is reduced.

Shilling also occurs by bidders, who introduce fake bids under multiple false identities (Yokoo, Sakurai, & Matsubara, 2004). In a combinatorial VCG auction, Sher (2012) presented an interesting example in which shill bidding is effective. Suppose that two items, 1 and 2, are auctioned to two bidders A and B. The valuation of the bidders is according to Table 5.
                           
                        

With the VCG allocation and truthful bidding, the package of both items is awarded to bidder A, with payment 3 monetary units. Bidder A has an incentive to shill bid and participate with two identities, A1 and A2, who have fake valuations and bid as in Table 5. In this way, ‚Äúbidders‚Äù A1 and A2 will win the two items and each will pay 1 monetary unit. Therefore, in total, bidder A pays 2 monetary units instead of 3. The disintegration of a bidder into shills is in essence the inverse process of the merging of bidders for the creation of collusion rings. Sher (2012) derived the optimal shilling strategy for a two-bidder VCG combinatorial auction, which is a computationally hard problem. When the items are pure complements, as in the example considered above, the best strategy is to completely disintegrate and shill bid independently for each item.

In a similar cheating practice, known as phantom bidding, it is the auctioneer, instead of the seller, who produces bids ‚Äúoff the wall‚Äù. In an IPV English setting, with heterogeneous bidders, who have different value distributions, the auctioneer revises the optimal reserve price, as the auction progresses and information is revealed. Graham, Marshall, and Richard (1990) showed that the auctioneer finds it optimal to raise the reserve price by phantom bidding on the basis of the observed bid sequence. Similarly, Deltas (1999) concluded that the revenue of the auctioneer increases by phantom bidding. In a symmetric common value setting with a particular value function and uniform value distribution, Vincent (1995) confirmed that a secret -but nevertheless fixed- reserve price, rather than an announced one, is preferable for the seller, allowing the auctioneer to take advantage of the secrecy and to introduce phantom bids. At the same time, in an IPV symmetric SPA, a secret reserve price has no effect. Kosmopoulou (2011) examined phantom bidding in a common value English auction, where only the auctioneer observes the number of interested bidders and, therefore, knows how intense the competition is. In the setting where the signals take three values (high, medium and low), Kosmopoulou (2011) demonstrated that the auctioneer can benefit from phantom bidding only if there is one bidder with a high signal. Therefore, especially when the number of bidders is large and consequently the likelihood of only one bidder with a high signal is relatively low, the auctioneer should in general avoid phantom bidding. On the other hand, moving beyond a common value framework phantom bidding may be worth pursuing when the auctioned object for some reason appeals only to one single bidder.

Auction mechanisms, which are designed to eliminate the incentive for shill bidding with multiple identities in package auctions, have been proposed by Yokoo, Matsutani, and Iwasaki (2006) and
Day and Milgrom (2008). Alternatively, shill bidding disappears when inspection of identities is in place, even in the form of limited verification, such as the one proposed by Conitzer (2007), which facilitates considerably the computational effort. Another way to deter shilling is to charge each bidder a commission fee, which makes it costly to participate with a fake identity. In an IPV English auction with multiple values for the optimal reserve value, the optimal level of such shill deterrent fee, which ensures that shilling is not profitable, was derived by Wang, Hidv√©gi, and Whinston (2004). Alternatively, bidders may be required to post a participation bond, as for example in the form of a letter of bank guarantee, which at the same time increases the penalty in case shill bidding is revealed.

Bidders may decide to spy on already submitted bids in order to gain more exact information about the competition. McAdams and Schwartz (2007) showed that in a symmetric IPV FPA setting, with uniform value distribution, bidders upon a threshold value decide in equilibrium to spy at a fixed cost. Nevertheless, the seller is worse off when bidders are able to spy on their opponents. A similar spy scheme may be facilitated by the collusion center, which is fully informed about the valuations. ƒÄzacis and Vida (2015) explored a two bidder IPV FPA environment with binary (high or low) valuation, where the collusion center sends a private ‚Äúspy‚Äù signal to each contestant about the value of his/her opponent. To maximize bidder's payoff and induce collusion without side payments, the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù should provide signals that depend only on the other's player's value.

A corrupt auctioneer may also be involved in bid rigging. In type I corruption, the auctioneer in a FPA allows the highest bidder to lower his/her bid, receiving in exchange a bribe. In the environment of a symmetric IPV FPA, Menezes and Monteiro (2006) showed that with type I corruption, efficiency is not lost, but the bidding behavior is modified and the seller revenue is reduced. Moreover, the equilibrium bidding strategy was derived in the case where the bribe is either a lump sum or an amount proportional to the surplus due to bid manipulation.

Type II corruption gives the possibility to a favored bidder to raise the bid price in order to match (or slightly exceed) the winning price. The auctioneer may choose the favored bidder by means of a supplementary bribery SPA before the auction, as in Koc and Neilson (2008). Although the auction becomes efficient in this manner, by contacting all the bidders the auctioneer runs the risk of being detected and exposed. The inefficiency in the allocation introduced by the bribery of type II corruption with two asymmetric bidders and bribes proportional to the surplus was examined by Burguet and Perry (2007), who found that for large fractions of bribery, the bid price may in some cases decrease compared to the absence of corruption. Arozamena and Weinschelbaum (2009) examined the symmetric IPV FPA where the favored bidder, who is ex-ante exogenously determined, has the right to revise and resubmit his/her bid, knowing the highest bid price of the opponents. Their analysis revealed that, if the hazard rate Œª(v)¬†=¬†F(v)/f(v) of the underlying value distribution F(v) with density f(v), is strictly convex, then corruption makes honest bidders more aggressive, so that it is possible that the expected revenue of the seller may increase. On the other hand, when Œª(v) is strictly concave, honest bidders become less aggressive in their bids. The expected utility for the honest bidder, however, always decreases in the presence of corruption and the corruptive partners enjoy jointly a positive surplus.


                           Lengwiler and Wolfstetter (2010) considered a symmetric IPV FPA, where the auctioneer engages to type I or type II corruption with the highest or second-highest bidder, respectively, choosing the most profitable form. Therefore, the favored bidder is determined ex-post by the auctioneer, after the bid prices become known, and the bribe is proportional to the bid. The expected surplus generated by the corrupt activity is found to be decreasing with the number of bidders and, quite surprisingly, to be increasing with the fraction of bribe. For large fractions of bribe, though, the analysis does not produce a monotone symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy. It is interesting to note that, in procurement, the advantage of a favorite bidder may also exist in a legal framework known as right of first refusal. For example, a long-term supplier may be given the privilege to revise his/her bid and match the highest price of his/her opponents.

In a multi-dimensional sealed bid procurement auction environment, where non-price attributes are aggregated with price by a score function, corruption takes many different forms. In Burguet and Che (2004), the auctioneer has the power to assess more favorably the non-price attribute (quality) of a favorite bidder, increasing the quality level by the manipulation power, in exchange for a bribe. In this setting, there are two contestants, one of which has lower production cost for all quality levels, and, therefore, enjoys a technological advantage. The score is a linear function of the price and the quality and awarding is to the bidder with the highest score. Burguet and Che (2004) showed that for low manipulation power, competition becomes more aggressive, but the auction remains efficient, in the sense that the low cost bidder wins the contract. Therefore, in this case, corruption benefits the buyer by lowering the winning price at which the auctioned object is bought. On the other hand, high manipulation power allows the high cost bidder to sometimes win the contract, overcoming his/her technological disadvantage. Eventually, when the manipulation power becomes considerably high, the low cost bidder also gains from corruption because competition becomes less intense. An optimal scoring rule by the buyer, would adjust the weight on the cost with respect to the manipulation power of the auctioneer, so that ultimately the impact of the quality level would remain at an optimal level.

In a framework of public procurement, a corrupted auctioneer may select the weights of the score function in a biased manner, providing ex-ante higher weight to particular attributes for which a favorite contestant scores high with respect to the competition. Methods by which weights are objectively determined ex-post, after the sealed bids have been submitted, are discussed in Lorentziadis (2010) and Falagario, Sciancalepore, Costantino, and Pietroforte (2012). Similar hybrid auction mechanisms using Data Envelopment Analysis for the evaluation of the bids have been proposed by Bogetoft and Nielsen (2008).

In recent years, a large number of experimental studies have demonstrated that bidding behavior appears to deviate from the predicted Nash equilibrium strategy. Bidding behavior is subject to influences by numerous factors ranging from the bidder's personality traits, such as culture and emotional stability (Grebitus, Lusk, & Nayga, 2013), to human hormones related to contraception (Chen, Katuscak, & Ozdenoren, 2013).

In Bazerman and Samuelson (1983), students participated in auctions for the purchase of a jar which contained $8. The amount in the jar was unknown to the subjects of the study, who estimated it at $5.13 on average. At the same time, the highest bid was on average $10.01, which provides a clear demonstration of the winner's curse.

In the experimental study of Kagel and Levin (1986), the release of public information in a common value auction appeared to provide a smaller increase or even a decrease to the seller's revenue compared to the game theoretic prediction. The validity of the conclusions of this study, however, has been controversial (Cox, Dinkin, & Smith, 1999; Campbell, Kagel, & Levin, 1999). Similar experimental results in the context of affiliated private value auctions, which indicate a deviation from the equilibrium bidding strategy, were drawn by
Kagel, Harstad, and Levin (1987).


                           Avery and Kagel (1997) considered the wallet game introduced by Klemperer (1998). In a two bidder common value SPA, where the value of the auctioned object v is the sum of two independent and uniformly distributed signals s
                           1 and s
                           2, each bidder observes only one of the two signals. Participants in this experiment, who were predominantly undergraduate students, suffered the winner's curse, providing evidence that players did not follow the equilibrium strategy of bidding twice the observed signal. Even subjects in the experiment, who had acquired some bidding experience by participating in 25 auctions, were not able to avoid the winner's curse. In an asymmetric version of this auction environment, the auctioned object was worth v
                           1¬†=¬†s
                           1¬†+¬†s
                           2 to the first bidder, while the valuation of the second bidder was v
                           2¬†=¬†s
                           1¬†+¬†s
                           2¬†+¬†K, where K is positive and privately known. In the Nash equilibrium bidding strategy, the second bidder should always win because of his/her advantage. The na√Øve strategy of bidding the expected valuation conditionally on the observed signal, however, provided better fit to the experimental data for both versions of the auction environment, compared to the game-theoretic strategy. Nevertheless, the presence of considerable heterogeneity implied that other forces were in place.

The same experiment in an English ascending environment with two players was conducted by Rose and Levin (2008). The analysis of the data assumed that some bidders follow the na√Øve strategy of bidding the unconditional value of the object, while others adopt the ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù Nash equilibrium approach. In essence, the bidder population consisted of two groups, so that the subjects of the experiment were classified in two clusters: na√Øve or sophisticated. In the asymmetric version of the wallet game, with K¬†=¬†1, advantaged bidders that followed the Nash equilibrium should theoretically be able to always win. In the experimental data of the study, however, no bidder qualified to be characterized as sophisticated by winning 100% of the times when being advantaged. On the other hand, 7 bidders, corresponding to a proportion of 21%, were able to win 80% of the times, when they were advantaged. Sophisticated bidders appeared to be more aggressive when their signal was high or when they were advantaged in comparison to na√Øve players. The data suggests that the population of bidders was mixed, but its structure appears to be more involved, including other types and strategies than the ones considered. A criticism in these studies is that the pool of subjects is undergraduate students, who may be unfamiliar with decision making in an auction environment. Nevertheless, in an experimental IPV auction setting Dyer, Kagel, and Levin (1989) provided evidence that executives with over twenty years of experience in the construction contract industry fell prey to the winner's curse in a similar manner to inexperienced students. Further, the experimental study of Kagel and Richard (2001) indicated that even super-experienced bidders, who overcome the winner's curse, may not necessarily follow the Nash equilibrium strategy.

Overbidding in auctions leading to winner's curse appears to be a prevalent phenomenon. Bidder behavior is often driven by an irrational desire to win, even at a considerably high cost compared to the perceived value of the auctioned object (Ariely & Simonson, 2003). In ancient Rome, winners of an auction could claim that they were influenced by ‚Äúbidder's heat‚Äù (calor licitantis) and demand that the auction be declared void on this ground (Lee & Malmendier, 2011). In experimental studies uncertainty in IPV FPA and English auctions leads some players to overbid, which cannot be explained by risk preference (McGee, 2013), and resembles auction fever. Contrary to winner's curse, overbidding affects both IPV and interdependent value auctions, while even a relatively small percentage of irrational bidders may have a significant effect on the winning price.

Sniping, which is the practice of late bidding just before an auction ends, provides another example of a possible deviation from game theoretic bidding. In an auction where the ending time is infinitely extended as long as bidders remain active, sniping, although frequently observed in many online auctions, should not occur in equilibrium (Ockenfels & Roth, 2006). In some online auctions, sniping may be explained by the presence of new late coming bidders. Sniping could also be justified as a rational strategy when bidders are involved in a more complicated game. For instance, if a bidder is pursuing two similar objects in two auctions with overlapping bidding windows, when only one is desired, last minute bidding may be necessary in order to avoid winning both items.

According to the game theoretic perspective, bidders first prescribe a utility on random outcomes to account for risk aversion due to uncertainty. Under the axioms of preference, von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947) showed that it is possible to represent the preference ordering of gambles by expected utility. The choices of rational game-theoretic decision makers should be based on a comparison of the corresponding expected utility of each action. From a game theoretic perspective and for a given auction, a rational bidder maximizes his/her expected utility with respect to all available bidding strategies. The probability distribution for the calculation of the expected utility should accurately reflect all the existing information appropriately updating the prior distributions. A game theoretic agent assumes that all rivals will act similarly in this manner. Rationality requires that, when agents have the same information, they make similar inferences and adopt the same behavior. On the other hand, when the players are asymmetrically informed, rational bidders form predictions in the form of probability distributions about the types of their opponents and adopt a Bayesian equilibrium strategy (Harsanyi, 1967/68). In this respect, game theory produces a normative theory of rational behavior, which is strictly related to the environment of the particular game. If the game is expanded and new strategies, which have not been previously considered, become available, such as bluffing or feigning irrationality for the purpose of gaining a strategic advantage, then behavior, which deviates from the previous equilibrium, may be now viewed as rational. If players are playing different games, then they may adopt strategies which appear irrational to each other, whereas in fact, they both act rationally in their own environment. Therefore, a deviation from the normative game theory behavior will be characterized as irrational only within the context of a particular game and when all strategies have been correctly accounted for. In this sense, bidding outside the prescriptions of the game theoretic approach, for a particular auction game, can only be explained by irrationality.

We proceed to examine the factors that could explain why the bidding behavior may deviate from the rational game theoretic perspective. In essence, as Rothkopf (2007b) argues ‚Äúthe only alternative to game theory is a psychological theory‚Äù. The validity of the von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern axioms of choice has been greatly challenged in numerous empirical studies (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986; Tversky, Slovic, & Kahneman, 1990; Baucells & Rata, 2006; Boosj, van Praag, & van de Kuilen, 2010). A rich literature has been developed for non-expected utility theory models, in an effort to provide better predictive power for the actual behavior of agents (Starmer, 2000; Kahneman, 2011). Therefore, irrationality in auction bidding can be traced in the various behavioral models of irrationality that have been developed during the last decades. When the expected utility preference model is not valid, the irregularity of irrationality impairs even basic results of auction theory, such as the equivalence of IPV FPA and Dutch auctions (Nakajima, 2011). Bidders often underestimate the probability of winning or employ nonlinear probability weighing which produces an overbidding behavior (Armantier & Treicht, 2009a,2009b).

The endowment effect (Thaler, 1980), according to which people place a higher value to objects that they own, provides another explanation for non-rational behavior, although experimental results about its presence are still greatly debated among experimental economists and psychologists (Plott & Zeiler, 2005,2011; Isoni et al. 2011). Under the endowment effect, bidders may become attached to an auctioned item, which causes overbidding (Loureiro, Umberger, & Hine, 2003). Experimental studies suggest that the length of the period in which a bidder believed that he/she was in the lead, provided a sense of ownership and drastically affected the bid price (Heyman, Orhun, & Ariely, 2004). Under time pressure, the endowment effect appears to be less prominent (Chuang, 2013).

Bidders in online auctions are often influenced by a low starting price, which attracts more bids even though the probability of winning is lower (Ariely & Simonson, 2003; Kamins, Dreze, & Folkes, 2004; Sutter & Hardesty, 2005). The winning price appears to be greatly affected by references prices, which are drawn either from the past bidding behavior of the bidders, or from historical data on similar auctions (Dholakia & Simonson, 2005; Pilehvar, Elmaghraby, & Gopal, 2013). Bidders may often be inclined to express their bids in intervals rather than points, although the corresponding effect does not appear to create a deviation to rational bidding, at least in an experimental SPA environment (Banerjee & Shogren, 2013).

A losing bidder may feel regret for having bid below the winning price, while the winner may regret having left money on the table by bidding high. Ascending auctions do not present any regret. In FPAs, however, there is empirical evidence that regret is reflected in the bid prices (Filiz-Ozbay & Ozbay, 2007). In the IPV FPA, bid prices are driven up by the sensitivity to the regret of a losing bidder missing to win a favorable opportunity (Engelbrecht-Wiggans & Katok, 2008). In general, experimental evidence appears to support that regret, rather than risk aversion, provides a stronger explanation for overbidding (Engelbrecht-Wiggans & Katok, 2009). Ambiguity aversion plays an important role in bidding behavior. The presence of ambiguity about the underlying value distribution creates underbidding, in divergence to the Nash equilibrium behavior (Chen, Katuscak, & Ozdenoren, 2007; Noe, Rebello, & Wang, 2012).

Another cause of irrationality is the inability of the players to comprehend and do the right calculations to determine the strategy dictated by rationality, because, as noted by Simon (1978), the mind remains the scarce resource in decision making. Lee and Malmendier (2011) considered eBay auctions, where bidders have the option to immediately purchase the auctioned item in a fixed price, outside the context of the bidding process. Paradoxically enough, in a clear demonstration of irrational overbidding, the auction price often exceeded the fixed price at which the item was available. Lee and Malmendier (2011) attributed this strange behavior to limited attention, as overbidding appears to be correlated to the distance of the fixed price listing on the auction screen. In many cases, the bidders may simply be unable to consider the problem from the point of view of a competitor (Ball, Bazerman, & Caroll, 1991; Bazerman, 2006). Moreover, decision makers may also take into account issues outside the framework of auction, such as fairness and motivation, as in the procedural utility models of Benz (2007). In general, behavioral limitations may partially explain irrationality in bidding (Boosj et al., 2010). In multidimensional auctions, predictions about the positioning of each bidder with regard to non-price attributes, such as the quality level, may drastically influence bidding behavior (Haruvy & Jap, 2013).

In conclusion, it is unlikely that the cause of non-rational behavior can be identified in one single factor (Cooper & Fang, 2008). The joint effect of forces that shape human nature come into play and determine bidding behavior.

The experimental study of Neugebauer and Selten (2006) provided evidence about the impact of experience in bidding. While initially underbidding was primarily observed, learning from the information, which is revealed about the bid prices in a sequence of FPAs appeared to generate overbidding. On the contrary, when no feedback about the highest bid was provided, bidders in the long run adopted the Nash equilibrium strategy (Neugebauer & Perote, 2008). This, however, does not mean that irrationality will eventually vanish as bidders participate in repeated auctions. Irrationality, quite surprisingly, can be both profitable and evolutionary stable. To demonstrate this fact, Deltas and Engelbrechts-Wiggans (2005) considered a two bidder common value English auction, with independent identically distributed signals s
                           1 and s
                           2 and value v¬†=¬†s
                           1

                           2. The second bidder is fully rational and aware that the opponent is na√Øve. When the signal distribution is symmetric and unimodal, the na√Øve bidder has a higher expected payoff compared to the rational player, because, intuitively, the irrational bidder enjoys a first-mover advantage in choosing his/her type. Moreover, when the game is repeated many times, a unique stable equilibrium is ultimately reached, in which some na√Øve players can still be found. The auctioneer is better off when both players are rational and, therefore, it is beneficial to the auctioneer to educate the na√Øve bidder to become rational.

The experimental and empirical literature in auction bidding confirms that some bidders follow the game-theoretic approach, while, at the same time, another group of players is not in line with the rational predictions of game theory. Next, we will investigate how mixed bidder populations are introduced in models that capture bounded rationality.

A number of different models have been developed to account for bounded rationality in auctions and integrate behavioral aspects of bidding. The bidder population in these models is mixed in the sense that rational bidders are allowed to coexist with bidders who adopt irrational bidding strategies, which in some cases resemble simple rules of thumb.


                           Eyster and Rabin (2005) considered a mixed bidder population, which consists of two groups. In the first group, which has relative size œá, players erroneously believe that there is no connection between types and actions and that their opponents adopt the average, over all different types, strategy. In the second group, with size 1¬†‚àí¬†œá, agents are fully rational and able to predict the correlation between actions and types, adopting a Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategy. For this structure of the bidder population, the œá-cursed equilibrium strategy maximizes, for a given bidder's type, the expected payoff. In common value SPA, with value function v(s,y), where s is the signal and y an object characteristic, the œá cursed equilibrium of a bidder with signal si

Therefore, cursed bidders formulate their bids by placing weight 1¬†‚àí¬†œá to the Nash equilibrium price and weight œá to the expectation of the object value given the observed signal. Due to the irrationality introduced and the violation of the linkage principle, cursed bidders are doomed to suffer the winner's curse, unless œá¬†=¬†0. The adoption of a cursed equilibrium is consistent with various data sets, such as the data in the study by Avery and Kagel (1997), and provides better fit compared to the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The value of œá usually ranges between 0% and 60%.

In the English auction wallet game, where the value is the sum of the two signals s
                           1 and s
                           2, Goncalves (2008) examined the case where bidders may be heterogeneously cursed. The irrational bidder tries to estimate the signal of his opponent under the belief that the rival bidder continues to follow the symmetric Nash equilibrium strategy Œ≤¬†=¬†2s. Consequently, if the opponent remains active, when the ascending auction price has reached Œ≤
                           1, the corresponding signal must be at least Œ≤
                           1/2. For this reason, the bid Œ≤¬†=¬†Œ≤

                           2. Each bidder is allowed to follow a mixed strategy with a rational or an irrational behavior. If the second bidder is fully rational, the first bidder should adopt either the symmetric equilibrium strategy or the irrational strategy Œ≤
                           1, depending on the expectation of a random variable, which relates to the maximum and minimum of the two signals. For the auctioneer, it is preferable to run the auction with two irrational bidders rather than two players, who always match their strategy choosing among rational and irrational behavior.

The mixed bidder population in Crawford and Iribberi (2007) builds on the concept of level-k thinking, which was introduced by Stahl (1993). Bidders at the lowest 0 level follow an irrational behavior, such as the na√Øve random selection of bids or truthful bidding. At the next thinking level 1, players optimally respond to the 0 level bidders. Inductively, players at level-k thinking best respond to the bidding strategy of the k¬†‚àí¬†1 level. The model with a structure of three levels appears to provide a good fit to many FPA and SPA datasets, although frequently it coincides with the cursed equilibrium model. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that out-of-equilibrium bidding behavior is usually due to deviations of best response rather than wrong expectations (Kirchkamp & Reiss, 2011).

In the theoretic-decision approach of auction bidding, players maximize their payoff under the belief that their opponents are randomly selecting their bids, acting non-strategically. Rothkopf (2007b) argues that, in auction bidding, decision theory dominates the game-theoretic approach. Therefore, it is likely that, in a mixed population of bidders, the irrational behavior is attributed to the application of a decision theoretic strategy. Lorentziadis (2012) considered a mixed population of bidders, which consisted of two groups: the decision theoretic players, and the game-theoretic bidders. Each group erroneously believed that all players adopt the same behavior and determined the bid price accordingly. Lorentziadis (2012) introduced a hyper-rational bidder, who is aware of the structure of the bidder population and bids optimally. The bid price of the hyper-rational bidder, which was derived for an IPV FPA with uniform underlying distribution as a solution of a polynomial equation, serves as a measure of the level of competition in connection to the structure of the mixed population.

In a procurement auction, bidders often employ simple rules of thumb to determine the bid price. In the experimental study of Kirchkamp and Reiss (2008), the mixed bidder population was found to involve irrational players, who employ simple mark-up heuristics, such the application of a fixed absolute or percentage markup. In Shachat and Wei (2012), this bidding behavior was complemented by a learning effect, which paradoxically enough reduced in the long run the number of rational bidders, while, in the experimental data, more players appeared to employ the constant absolute markup rule.

During the last half century, the application of game theory in bidding has produced an impressively large number of theoretical findings and advances, which have contributed to a better understanding of the operation of auctions, expanding our knowledge and intuition. Nevertheless, the predictive power of auction theory still remains disputable, as demonstrated in various empirical and experimental studies. In fact, bidding often appears to be considerably more convoluted compared to the standard models of auction theory. The nature of human behavior and the continuously evolving trading processes in the global ‚Äìvirtual and on-line- economy pose challenging difficulties in the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework, which can accurately depict bidding. We have presented the most important recent research contributions in the multidisciplinary field of auction theory, which, unfortunately sometimes only partially, addressed some of these deficiencies. Future research directions will certainly shed more light and provide more comprehensive answers in the analysis of real world auctions. In this respect, it may be useful to give a short account of some of the most immediate issues that will most likely be examined in the future, in an effort to enhance the predictive power of auction theory.

The standard game theoretic approach in bidding assumes that the probability distribution F of the value or, alternatively, the signal of the auctioned object is completely known to the bidder and the bid price is Œ≤¬†=¬†b(F). However, the bidder can only statistically -either parametrically or non-parametrically- estimate F by 
                        
                           F
                           ^
                        
                     , using historical data along with any other private or public available information. Therefore, the final bid price is 
                        
                           
                              Œ≤
                              ^
                           
                           =
                           b
                           
                              (
                              
                                 F
                                 ^
                              
                              )
                           
                        
                      rather than Œ≤. The error, which is induced both in the bid price and the expected revenue, should be taken into consideration in applications of auction theory, since the final bidding method no longer follows the Nash equilibrium strategy. The difference in the estimation procedures adopted by each bidder as well as the distinction among the data sets available to each player generates a form of heterogeneity, which is often overlooked. Consequently, any existing asymmetry in the underlying probability distribution is further amplified due to the heterogeneity of the method of estimation and the quality and size of the database of each bidder. As a result, heterogeneity is intensified in a rather non-predictable manner. Due to the fact that the available information and the method of its processing usually remain private and concealed by each bidder, it is often quite difficult to account for this form of heterogeneity.

Another research direction will aim to introduce auctions in complex trading environments, where competition is between supply chains rather than individuals or firms. Models should be allowed to include more intricate interactions among the economic agents involved together with different information structures. Negotiations should be examined as an integral part of the wider in scope bidding process. This expanded framework of auction bidding will more accurately describe the actual global procurement setting and enable supply chains to become more responsive to issues such as shortening lead times and optimizing production with respect to the demand from auction winning. Communication among agents, as highlighted by Gupta, Koulamas, and Kyparisis (2009) especially in electronic auctions, will play a crucial role in auction models and its influence in bidding will account for a stimulating research theme. The study of an efficient incorporation of information on past auctions into the management of subsequent auctions, as proposed by Pinker, Seidmann, and Vakrat (2010) in inventory allocation across multiple auctions, will lead to enhanced profit potentials for auctioneers.

The investigation of different forms of risk, affecting payoff and generating volatility, is another topic of future research. In procurement auctions there are still some sources of risk, which have been overlooked, such as quality acceptance outcomes, penalties related to late deliveries, or potential environmental damage claims. Scenario based solutions, especially in sequential auctions, as developed by Takano et al. (2014), may prove useful in monitoring the value at risk.

Collusion will continue to be an active research topic. In multidimensional procurement auctions, where non-price attributes along with price are aggregated to determine the winner, there are various forms of cheating which have yet to be addressed, such as corrupted short list invitations for participation, limited publicity, or biased setting of weights favoring particular bidders. In industrial procurement, methods to deter corruption should achieve a balance between maintaining transparency in the process and ensuring confidentiality of the final bidding details, in order to avoid the revelation of sensitive information to the procurer's competitors. Therefore, it is important to examine the optimal feedback, which bidders should receive about the awarding in a sealed bid auction. Similarly, in public procurement, it is also critical to determine the information regarding the outcome of a tender, which should be made public. Auction audits, as suggested by Chen, Seshadri, and Zemel (2008), should be more widely employed in order to examine post-bid data and curb corruption. Auctions with encryption protocols, as first developed by Nurmi and Salomaa (1993), provide a venue to ensure privacy avoiding the disclosure of bids. Unconditional full privacy, however, without a trusted third party, is unattainable for SPA with more than two bidders, while for FPA the complexity of such encryption protocol is exponential in the bid size (Brandt and Sandholm, 2008). Cryptographic auction protocols may also alleviate the potentiality of auctioneer cheating (Franklin & Reiter, 1996) and prevent false-name bids (Yokoo, Sakurai, & Matsubara, 2001). Introducing protocols of mutual verifiability among bidders eliminates the need for a trusted third party (Brandt, 2002) although losing bidders should have an incentive to complete the protocol (Bradford, Park, Rothkopf, & Park, 2008).

At the same time, it is essential to develop methods by which competition in an auction can be enhanced, especially when there is suspicion that collusion among bidders may be present. Moving beyond shilling and in addition to setting reservation prices, the seller may be allowed to actively and legally participate in an auction. Such auction designs should not compromise fair play but, at the same time, they would address the concern of the seller about the level of competition.

It is also imperative to re-examine the entire body of auction theory under the assumption of a mixed bidder population, which exhibits different levels of bounded rationality. As an example, we may consider the question of whether the seller should reveal private information, which may affect behavioral aspects of bidding, such as fairness or regret. Another example relates to the optimal number of invited bidders in a procurement auction, when some of the players may not be fully rational.

A more general issue in all decision-making sciences is the identification of the sources of irrationality. We have already seen that the causes of irrationality are multiple and, therefore, it remains a challenging problem to integrate all these factors in the analysis of auction bidding. The dynamic interaction between these forces in the formulation of bidding behavior will yield a more comprehensive perspective of irrationality. For example, the analysis of auctions in the presence of irrationality would become more accurate by introducing the interplay in bidding behavior of the endowment effect with price anchoring and regret.

In an empirical level, there is a pressing need to conduct further empirical studies and to identify the actual bidding methods employed in auction bidding. Non-game theoretic approaches, such as the decision-making bidding method or heuristic based procedures, should be integrated in the development of auction theory. In this venue, it will be a challenging task to enrich the game theory perspective of auctions with recent advances of decision-making bidding, such as the extensive study of probability distributions of bid prices (Skitmore, 2014) or the development of predictive tools, as, for example, the iso-score curve of Ballesteros-P√©rez, Gonz√°lez-Cruz, Pastor-Ferrando, and Fern√°ndez-Diego (2012). The final goal of this project will be to amalgamate the normative game theoretical approach with other bidding behaviors, which may better account for the strategies adopted by actual players. This appears to be a necessary innovation to enhance the predictive power and applicability of auction theory. Furthermore, the growing application of auctions as a means of economic trading will certainly give rise to new unanticipated problems leading to unchartered research paths.
