                  Technological advances in cytotoxicity analysis have now made it possible to obtain real time data on changes in cell growth, morphology and cell death. This type of testing has a great potential for reducing and refining traditional in vivo toxicology tests. By monitoring the dynamic response profile of living cells via the xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer for high-throughput (RTCA HT) system, cellular changes including cell number (cell index, CI) are recorded and analyzed. A special scaled index defined as normalized cell index (NCI) is used in the analysis which reduces the influence of inter-experimental variations. To assess the extent of exposure of the tested chemicals, a two-exponent model is presented to describe rate of cell growth and death. This model is embodied in the time and concentration-dependent cellular response curves, and the parameters k
                     1 and k
                     2 in this model are used to describe the rate of cell growth and death. Based on calculated k
                     2 values and the corresponding concentrations, a concentration–response curve is fitted. As a result, a cytotoxicity assessment named KC
                     50 is calculated. The validation of the proposed method is demonstrated by exposing six cell lines to 14 chemical compounds. Our findings suggest that the proposed KC
                     50-based toxicity assay can be an alternative to the traditional single time-point assay such as LC
                     50 (the concentration at which 50% of the cells are killed). The proposed index has a potential for routine evaluation of cytotoxicities. Another advantage of the proposed index is that it extracts cytotoxicity information when CI fails to detect the low toxicity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

To assess the safety or hazards of industrial chemicals, consumer products, pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants etc., the animal toxicity studies are generally adopted by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) classification and human health risk assessments (GHS, 2005; WHO, 2010). Most of the current toxicity tests require the use of laboratory animals, involve exposure by various routes and monitor whether animals die or exhibit any clinical signs of toxicity. Increasing societal concerns about animal use have led to the development of alternative in vitro test methods that can significantly reduce and even replace the use of mammalians for acute systemic toxicity testing (ICCVAM, 2010). The emerging in vitro cell-based assays endeavor to provide some information about the mode or mechanism of action that causes cytotoxicity in cell dynamics (Xing et al., 2006, 2011; Huang and Xing, 2006). The in vitro testing can be used to address potential chemical toxicity, metabolic degradation or impaired permeability. Furthermore, such information can be used to develop a prediction model to estimate the starting doses for in vivo studies in order to further reduce animal use. The significance of the in vitro assay is strongly supported by recently published strategies for the future of toxicology testing (National Research Council, 2007; USEPA, 2009).

The real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) is a system that enables dynamic monitoring of changes in cell population such as cell proliferation and death induced by toxicant (Xing et al., 2006, 2011). As the measurement is non-invasive and label free, the system can continuously monitor the cells from the time when they are seeded. More importantly, unlike end-point assays, cellular responses from minutes to days after the addition of chemical compound are recorded. This ensures no meaningful time points are missed for analysis.

To measure the cytotoxicity, LC
                     50/IC
                     50 (the concentration at which 50% of cells are killed compared to untreated controls) is widely used as the toxicity indices (Cer et al., 2011; Kothawad et al., 2012). However, these toxicity indices are largely dependent on the incubation time. For example, the LC
                     50 for a 24-h incubation period would be different from 48-h incubation (Kurve et al., 2010). This influence of incubation time can lead to questions about which time point provides the most scientifically valid results. Furthermore, it also makes the end-point dependent toxicity indices much less reliable than generally anticipated. To utilize the abundant information in the obtained response profile and avoid the shortcoming in time-dependent cytotoxicity assessment, KC
                     50 index is used in this paper (Zhang et al., 2006, 2007). A regression analysis is used in the computation of KC
                     50 to capture the trend of the cellular response (growth inhibition/killing) as opposed to the use of the single point. Therefore this index can evaluate the cytotoxicity effect over the whole exposure period. The KC
                     50 index has the following two main advantages:
                        
                           (1)
                           The value of KC
                              50 index presents a cytotoxicity measure for identifying and analyzing the level of toxicity effect of a chemical compound.


                              KC
                              50 index provides an accurate degree of cytotoxicity and is prone to less variation amongst all the cytotoxicity indices.

To demonstrate the proposed cytotoxicity measurement, a cell line panel (including six kinds of cell lines) exposed to 14 chemicals are investigated. First, a denoising algorithm is proposed to remove the outliers which are caused by the disturbance during the chemical injection. Then, the curve selection is carried out to estimate the parameters based on the selected curve. Further, KC
                     50 is computed to determine the level of toxicity. Based on the calculated KC
                     50 value, the registry of cytotoxicity (RC) predictive model is developed. As a result, the correlation between the predicted values and the corresponding LD
                     50 (the lethal dose at which 50% of the population if killed in a given period of time) in rats rodents is analyzed.

Six human cell lines purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used to perform the assessment (shown in Table 1
                        ). All cell lines were grown in 37°C incubators with 5% CO2.

Fourteen chemicals tested in this study are listed in Table 2
                        , which were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). These chemicals are the potentially toxic chemicals, which do not react with the cell culture medium (Tanneberger et al., 2010; MSDS, 2009; ICCVAM, 2010).

Stock solutions of the chemical were prepared in water (H2O) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored in amber vials at −20°C. The stock solutions were 1:3 serially diluted to make 11 working concentrations.

The xCELLigence RTCA HT system consists of four 384 well E-Plates (E-Plates 384) engaged on four HT Stations where the cell index (CI) reading is recorded simultaneously. The system is integrated with the Biomek® Fx system and Cytomat 2C incubator. The cells were seeded into the E-plates 384, and initial attachment and growth were continuously monitored for approximately 24h. Eleven concentrations of each chemical were then added to the wells and responses were continuously recorded for approximately additional 75h. Each concentration in each chemical was repeated in quadruplicate in order to increase the reliability of biological experiment data. The median value of each quadruplicate is used in the following analysis. The CI reading frequency was once per hour until completion of experiment. The experiment is conducted for 72h.

To get the same baseline, normalized CI (NCI) is used in this paper. The NCI has been defined as the ratio of CI value to the initial CI value immediately after injecting a chemical solution to the well (Pan et al., 2013), i.e.

To remove the noise effectively while preserving the original curve characteristics, we propose a new denoising algorithm. The central idea is to study the normal rate of growth and killing of the cells induced by various compounds. In order to do this, we define ‘velocity of cell population change’ as in Eq. (2). Whenever the abnormal velocity (that is, abnormal rate of change in population such as sharp increase in growth) is observed, this behavior is considered as noise and its effect is negated by using interpolation. The detailed algorithm is described as follows:

The red curve in Fig. 1(a) demonstrates the result of TCRP denoising. It can be seen that four outliers in TCRP of cadmium chloride (#6) at the concentration of 2mM are removed. Fig. 1(b) shows the corresponding distribution of ΔCI(j). Most of ΔCI are located within the region of μ
                        ±2σ. Fig. 1(c) and (d) also show the eleven original and denoised TCRPs of A549 exposed to cadmium chloride (#6) respectively.

From Fig. 1(d), it can be seen that the cellular response profile can be classified into two groups as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              cells that undergo cell death;

cells that continue to grow after recovery.

To describe the trend of TCRPs, the two-exponent model and method suggested by Zhang et al. (2007) are used to model the cell proliferation/death:

                        where NCI in the vector Y is the averages NCI of the two high concentrations. The function “lsqcurvefit” in MATLAB (©2011b, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) is used to achieve the regression analysis.

It can be seen that Eq. (7) is a nonlinear regression problem without constrains. If d
                        1 is negative value, it means that the TCRP with high concentration also shows the growth inhibition and has the similar trend to the TCRP with low concentration. The details are given in the discussion part.

Same as the previous nonlinear fitting procedure, averages of the two low concentrations are used to determine k
                        2 and d
                        2. The initial values of Eq. (10) are also calculated by linear regression similar to Eqs. (8) and (9).


                        Step 3: As d
                        1 and d
                        2 are constants, fit 11 TCRPs to determine the values of k
                        1 and k
                        2 in Eq. (6) for each concentration level. It should be noted that the modeling of Eq. (6) for each concentration is a nonlinear regression problem. The first order Taylor series expansion for the exponential function is used to get the initial value for the nonlinear regression, i.e.

                        2 values against logarithmic value of the concentrations.

                        2 directly measure the toxicity. Thus, the obtained k
                        2 values and the corresponding concentrations are used to fit the sigmoidal model, i.e.

                        n)% of the k
                        2 value in untreated cells, where n is any number between 0 and 100.

Data including 14 chemicals tested in six cell lines were selected to validate the proposed method. In each experiment, each cellular response was repeated at least in quadruplicate to increase the reliability of biological experiment readings. The median value was calculated from the quadruplicate readings to perform the toxicity assessment.

In order to demonstrate the algorithm, the A549 exposed to cadmium chloride (#6) with 11 concentration was taken as an illustration. The effects of different chemical concentrations on cells are shown in Fig. 1(c). It can be seen that increasing concentration leads to decreasing CI, which reflects mainly the dynamic evolution of cell population. The normalized cell index NCI was adopted to keep the same assays baseline. The smoothed TCRPs were obtained by using the Algorithm 1 and shown in Fig. 1(d). Using the multi-concentration TCRPs, the k
                        2 values from all concentrations of cadmium chloride (#6) were calculated by Algorithm 2 and the results are shown in Table 3
                        . These data fitted well to the model as described by Eq. (13), and the corresponding concentration–curve is shown in Fig. 2
                         as the solid line. Then, the value of KC
                        50 was determined to be 135.17μM by using Eq. (17).

To further explain and compare the proposed approach to the traditional approach to evaluate the toxic effect, traditional indices were calculated using (Boyd et al., 1992):

Based on these calculated traditional toxic effect indices, the concentration–effect curves of cadmium chloride (#6) were routinely presented at three time points: 24, 48 and 72h as shown in Fig. 3
                         and Table 3. Using Fig. 3, LC
                        50 values for 24, 48 and 72h were determined to be 709.25μM, 19.71μM and 15.62μM. It can be seen that the LC
                        50 method not only depends on the chemical concentration and the cellular response, but also depends on the incubation time. Compared to the LC
                        50, the KC
                        50 presents the relationship between chemical concentration and cellular response, thereby avoiding the issue of time dependency.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A new cytotoxicity analysis method is proposed to capture the trend of time-dependent cellular response in this paper. A mathematical model is built from the regression analysis, which can describe the rate of cell growth inhibition and killing after exposure to a chemical with multi-concentration.

One of the goals of this study is to determine the starting dose for acute oral systematic toxicity tests. In order to achieve this target, we first calculate the KC
                        50 values of 14 chemicals in 6 cell lines (shown in Table 4
                        ). Then a geometric mean of the KC
                        50 values predicts acute oral LD
                        50 values from KC
                        50 values. A linear regression model (shown in the caption of Fig. 4
                        ) is built from pairs of the log-transformed KC
                        50 values (in mM) and log-transformed rodent oral LD
                        50 values (in mmol/kg) (see Table 4). Then the estimated linear regression model is compared to the registry of cytotoxicity (RC) model (Konsoula and Barile, 2005; ICCVAM, 2010):

                                             KC

                                 +
                                 0.625
                              
                           
                        
                     

The comparison result is shown in Fig. 4. The correlation of the predicted log(LD
                        50) between the two models is 71.40%. This result is consistent with the RC rat mmol prediction line, and the new regression line is within log5 interval. Hence the prediction of LD
                        50 values from rodent acute oral toxicity determined by KC
                        50 are acceptable. This analysis justifies the use of KC
                        50 assay for estimating the starting doses in in vivo animal acute oral toxicity testing and may assist in hazard identification. Although the method does not have a high degree of accuracy, it does at least produce usable data (4 chemicals are out of the boarder).

The concept of KC
                        50 is also extended to demonstrate the cytotoxicity effect of several cell lines, which reveals the relative sensitivity of each cell line to the test substance by mean-graph. The example of cadmium chloride (#6) is shown in Fig. 5
                        . Each bar indicates whether the sensitivity of the cell line is greater (bar to the right) or less (bar to the left) than the average response. It can be seen that the mean-graph allows grasping the specificity of cell line response to chemicals (Nakamura et al., 2002).

Reproducibility of the KC
                        50 values is evaluated by conducting three separate validation tests (shown in Fig. 6
                        ). In this figure, the coefficient of variation (CV%) defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, is used to provide a quantitative indicator of the repeatability of the tests. When the value of CV% is higher, it means that the data has high variability and less stability, vice versa. In this experiment, the CV% of KC
                        50 value is small (only 10.67%). Certainly a further improved repeatability performance of biological experiments would lead to a better cell based in vitro assay.

The model (Eq. (5)) is determined by two kinds of exponential models which measure the rate of cell growth (d
                        2
                        >0) and cell death (d
                        1
                        >0). However, the exponential calorimeters d
                        1 and d
                        2 obtained from the fitting procedure may not fully agree with this assumption. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the higher concentration causes cells to proliferate, which determines the d
                        1 as a negative value. This means the exponential models, k
                        1
                        ×exp(−
                        d
                        1
                        ×
                        t(j)) and k
                        2
                        ×exp(d
                        2
                        ×
                        t(j)), have the same physical meaning (measuring cell growth). Based on this kind of TCRPs, the concentration–response of k
                        2 only reflects the cell growth inhibition after exposure to the chemical (shown in Fig. 7(b)) and the KC
                        50 value measures the level of the cell growth inhibition. In the presence of this kind of TCRPs, the traditional toxicity measurements (such as LC
                        50) will not produce any results.

The accuracy of model (Eq. (6)) will be affected when it is used to evaluate the chemicals which are characterized modulators of tubulin polymerization. One example is shown in Fig. 8(a), where the impedance-based TCRPs go through an initial steady decline in cell index followed by recovery after treatment (Abassi et al., 2009). Based on this kind of TCRPs, the k
                        2 can be determined with higher precision at lower concentrations. However, at high concentrations, the accuracy of k
                        2 is reduced. Since the model (6) captures the trend of cell proliferation/death, one can either calculate k
                        2 using model (6) or record more cell index readings (>72h exposure).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a cytotoxicity measurement of KC
                     50 is implemented by using regression analysis. In order to calculate KC
                     50, the parameters of two-exponent model are estimated to describe the rate of cell growth and killing. Then estimated k
                     2 values are used to obtain the concentration–response curve and calculate KC
                     50. It is seen that the proposed approach can be utilized in identifying and categorizing the level of toxicity with response to the different cell types and different levels of concentration. As demonstrated in the result, this methodology shows that KC
                     50 is effective and suitable for defining the level of toxicity to cell line with various concentrations of chemicals and for statistically analyzing their effects on dynamic cell responses in biological process. Comparing to the traditional end-point toxicity index (such as LC
                     50), the proposed method allows for the relationship between chemical concentration and cellular response to be found independent of time. So, the dilemma of the assessed time point selection in traditional methods can be overcome. More importantly, the proposed in vitro cytotoxicity test method can be used for estimating starting doses for acute oral systemic toxicity tests.
