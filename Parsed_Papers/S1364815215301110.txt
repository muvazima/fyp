                  In order to fully capture the benefits of rising CO2 in adapting agriculture to climate change, we first need to understand how CO2 affects crop growth. Several recent studies reported unexpected increases in sugarcane (C4) yields under elevated CO2, but it is difficult to distinguish direct leaf-level effects of rising CO2 on photosynthesis from indirect water-related responses. A simulation model of CO2 effects, based purely on changes in stomatal conductance (indirect mechanism), showed transpiration was reduced by 30% (initially) to 10% (closed canopy) and yield increased by 3% even in a well-irrigated crop. The model incorporated the results of a field experiment, and a glasshouse experiment designed to disentangle the mechanisms of CO2 response: whole-plant transpiration and stomatal conductance were both 28% lower for plants growing with high-frequency demand-based watering at 720 vs 390 ppm CO2, but there was no increase in biomass, indicating that indirect mechanisms dominate CO2 responses in sugarcane.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Some of the most important sources of human and animal food are derived from a small number of the world's plant species that possess the CO2 concentration mechanism that involve four carbon compounds. These C4 species include maize, sorghum and sugarcane. Photosynthesis occurs in two types of tissue in C4 plants, the mesophyll and the bundle sheath while only the mesophyll is involved in the case of C3 plants (Matsuoka et al., 2001). This allows C4 plants to reach maximum photosynthesis rates at current levels of ambient CO2 (Ghannoum et al., 2000). Reported responses to elevated CO2 concentrations of increased photosynthesis and consequent biomass accumulation in well watered C4 plants (e.g., de Souza et al., 2008), have therefore been difficult to explain. In order to accurately model the impacts of climate change on crops and to fully capture the benefits of rising CO2 in adapting agriculture to climate change, it is first necessary that we properly understand the processes by which CO2 affects crop growth.

Even in well watered C4 plants, elevated CO2 and consequently reduced stomatal conductance can lead to enhanced leaf growth and photosynthesis through mitigating the effects of transient water stress (Seneweera et al., 1998). In an open top chamber experiment where sugarcane was exposed to twice normal CO2, stomatal conductance was reduced by 37% and transpiration reduced by 32% while photosynthesis and biomass yield increased by 30% and 40% respectively (de Souza et al., 2008). de Souza et al. (2008) also found difficulty in explaining this result and suggested that even though plants were irrigated when soil water was at a low tension of 20 kPa, plants in normal CO2 must have experienced transient water stress that was alleviated in the treatments under elevated CO2. One would need to provide a different water regime for plants growing in high levels of CO2 for them to experience the same degree of water stress to plants growing in normal CO2 levels. Vu and Allen (2009) reported a similar reduction in conductance (34%) and a smaller reduction in transpiration (25%) when well watered sugarcane plants were provided with ‘twice normal’ CO2 (720 ppm) in glasshouse experiments. Ghannoum et al. (2000) listed reports which indicate that assimilation (A) and biomass accumulation in well watered C4 plants both increase under elevated CO2 and other reports where A responded but not growth and yet others where growth responded but not A. These conflicting results probably reflect the difficulty of inferring growth responses from short-term measurements of A using small segments of young leaves (Ghannoum et al., 2000), as was the case in the studies by de Souza et al. (2008) and Vu and Allen (2009). Ghannoum et al. (2000) argued that indirect effects are dominant in the response of C4 plants to elevated CO2. Ghannoum et al. (2003) provided further evidence that even under water stress, elevated CO2 does not directly enhance A, and any enhancement of A is most likely due to non-stomatal means. To date little work has been conducted on the effects of CO2 on sugarcane and the contrasting reports among the work that has been done (de Souza et al., 2008; Vu and Allen, 2009) suggest that further investigation on the nature and mechanisms of these responses is warranted.


                     Tubiello et al. (2007) reviewed the literature on crop CO2 experiments and concluded there was broad agreement between different techniques (across enclosed, semi-enclosed and unenclosed environments) for estimates of the impact of elevated CO2 on yield, once differences in CO2 treatment levels were taken into account. They also found that the results from most crop model simulations were consistent with the results from field-based CO2 experiments.

Two sugarcane modelling platforms are available internationally for sugarcane, Canegro in the DSSAT platform (Inman-Bamber et al., 1993; Kiker et al., 2002; Singels et al., 2008) and the ‘Sugar’ module in the APSIM platform (Keating et al., 1999; Holzworth et al., 2014). In previous applications of these models to climate change, approaches to representing CO2 effects on sugarcane have varied (Park et al., 2007; Webster et al., 2009; Marin et al., 2013; Knox et al., 2010; Biggs et al., 2013; Singels et al., 2014; Marin et al., 2015). Webster et al. (2009) assumed that intrinsic transpiration efficiency (TE) as defined by Sinclair, 2012 and Keating et al. (1999) would increase by 8% for every 100 ppm increase in CO2 when estimating sugarcane yields for future climates in Australia, using the APSIM-Sugar model. This increase in TE is less than was assumed for wheat (10.6%) by Asseng et al. (2004) who used the APSIM module for wheat. However the response for wheat included benefits to TE from increased internal CO2 as external CO2 levels rise (Asseng et al., 2004) which may not be the case for sugarcane and other C4 plants. Webster et al. (2009) also assumed that radiation use efficiency (RUE) would increase by 1.43% for every 100 ppm increase in CO2 concentration. The assumptions about TE and RUE for sugarcane came from an internal report by Park et al. (2007). Biggs et al. (2013) used the same model and assumptions to predict yield and off-site impacts in future climates, for one sugarcane region. TE responses to twice normal CO2 measured in small cuvettes, supported the Webster et al. (2009) assumption about TE in one case (Vu and Allen, 2009) but not in another where TE increased 62% in twice normal CO2 (de Souza et al., 2008). The modest increase in RUE assumed by Webster et al. (2009) would not account for the 40% increase in biomass for well watered plants in twice normal CO2 (de Souza et al., 2008). None of these modelling studies appeared to use experimental evidence for assumptions about the effects of CO2 on sugarcane yield building processes.

Controlled environment experiments allow the fine level of manipulative control required to separate proximate leaf-level CO2 responses from those mediated by whole-plant-soil hydrological feedbacks. We describe an experimental approach that is well suited to testing and measuring the mechanisms that should be represented in crop models. We also describe a field experiment used to measure transpiration and provide a baseline for crop simulations under current CO2 levels. We then developed a model (from existing ones) that could make use of the results obtained in the glasshouse to predict what will happen in a field of sugarcane subjected to elevated CO2.

This paper makes advancements, firstly in developing experimental techniques to decouple direct and indirect effects of enriched CO2 on plants and secondly in improving ways to simulate the effects of CO2 enrichment on sugarcane growth and water use.

For the glasshouse pot experiments we developed a control system that could maintain soil water content within a narrow range to limit CO2 responses mediated by feedbacks on soil moisture while simultaneously measuring the amount of water used. This was accomplished by using a sensor array linked to a control system that could independently control and deliver exact volumes of water to each pot (Fig. 1
                        ). Each pot was fitted with a volumetric soil moisture sensor (CS616, Campbell Scientific, Utah) that measured soil moisture every 10 min. If the soil moisture for a particular pot fell below its target treatment level, then a solenoid would open to deliver an aliquot of water from a precisely-machined reservoir (204 ml) above the pot. A data logger was programmed to automatically calibrate each sensor for the most recent three water deliveries (based on the increase in soil moisture in response to each addition of the known volume of water) so that water use could be interpolated between triggered water deliveries. A horizontal tube with lateral perforations, orientated perpendicularly to the moisture sensors, was used to spread the delivered water evenly in the pots, assisted further by a thin (2 cm) layer of sand between the tube and the soil surface. A 5 cm layer of plastic beads was placed on top of this to limit evaporation.

For the CO2 treatments we used two large (approximately 6 m × 9 m by 7 m tall) controlled environment chambers, part of a new facility based on the design described in Inman-Bamber et al. (2008). The chambers included control systems for regulating temperature, humidity and CO2 levels, with large air handlers to ensure even mixing. Two precautions were taken to prevent the build-up of plant-active contaminants from the CO2 supply in chambers such as ethylene (Morison and Gifford, 1984a): 1) the system used a continuous flow of air through the chambers, with CO2 injected into the incoming air stream (diluted in two-stage mixing to within 10 ppm of chamber levels before entering the chamber to eliminate CO2 gradients); and 2) the source of gas used was produced by separation of atmospheric air, and therefore low in plant active impurities to begin with.

Air temperature and relative humidity (RH) were measured every minute with shielded sensors (HMP45a Vaisala Pty Ltd Melbourne, VIC) placed at the level of the leaves. Solar radiation (350–2500 nm) was measured above the plant canopy at a height of 6 m in each chamber with four 1-m long tube solarimeters (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).

The experiment was a factorial design of two CO2 treatments by two sugarcane varieties by four harvest dates, replicated four times (with harvest dates and replicates arranged in a 4 × 4 Latin Square), giving a total of 64 pots. For the CO2 treatments, one growth chamber was supplied with ambient air (approximately 390 ppm CO2), while the other was elevated to approximately 720 ppm. The two varieties that were used were KQ228A and Q208A, two of the mostly widely grown commercial varieties in northern Queensland, Australia. The watering control system was set to maintain the soil in each pot at 90% of field capacity (watering trigger threshold). The four harvest dates are explained below.

One-eyed setts were germinated and then transplanted, three per pot, into pots (520 mm tall and 380 mm in diameter) containing 25 L of a premium potting mix. Plants were allowed to establish for 2 months at field capacity. During this period, pots were watered to just above field capacity each afternoon, and excess water was allowed to drain through small holes at the bottom of each pot. The water content after drainage was regarded as field capacity and was determined separately for each moisture sensor–pot combination. Watering and CO2 treatments were then initiated and the starting mass of plants was determined from destructive harvesting of 10 extra plants of each variety. In each chamber four control pots were set up that were identical to experimental pots except that they contained no plants. These were used to measure pot evaporation (subtracted from pot water use in calculating transpiration).

Plants were harvested in batches at approximately 8-week intervals following the initiation of treatments. Harvested plants were subsampled and separated by plant part into green leaf, dead leaf, sheath and stalk to obtain dry masses following the procedures described in Inman-Bamber et al. (2008). Subsamples of green leaf were processed through a leaf area meter, and the height and number of internodes were measured for stalks. Water use for each pot was calculated for the final seven days before harvest, to calculate the water use per unit green leaf area for each harvest date.

Shortly before the final harvest in November 2011, gas exchange measurements were taken on the youngest fully expanded leaf (leaf #1) of 24 plants in each glasshouse, using a portable photosynthesis apparatus (Li-6400, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). A 6 cm2 section of the leaf was enclosed in the cuvette and exposed to 2000 μmol/m2/s photosynthetically active radiation and to 375 ppm CO2. Readings were later repeated on the same leaves using the same settings but this time with CO2 set to 720 ppm.

Because of teething problems with the first experiment, we briefly note some clarifying results from a later experiment that addressed these issues. This later experiment included eight replicates of each of the same clones (Q208 and KQ228) and CO2 treatment combinations as before. The experiment ran for a shorter period (12 weeks) so the plants were small enough to swap pots and CO2 treatments between chambers half way through the trial. The average water use for each pot was calculated for the four days before the changeover and the four days after the changeover. An analysis of variance was then used to test whether there were any effects of chambers, besides those associated with CO2 treatments, on plant water use. At the end of the 12-week experiment, pots were harvested as before, and results were analysed to test for any biomass differences between treatments.

A Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) system was set up in a 10.3 ha commercial block of sugarcane (cv. Q127, first ratoon) at Kalamia estate (19.6 °S, 147.4 °E), near Ayr in the Burdekin district, north-east Australia. The details and results of the BREB system were provided by Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003) and only brief details are repeated here. The crop was ratooned (allowed to regrow) after harvesting the plant crop on 23 August 2000 and was irrigated and fertilized according to industry recommendations for achieving potential yields. On 22 October 2000, four recently calibrated tube solarimeters (1 m long) were placed on the soil surface in two places near the BREB installation, to span the 1.8 m dual crop row configuration exactly. Two more tube solarimeters were mounted above the canopy so that the fraction of intercepted radiation could be determined.

On 17 September 1998, an automatic weather station (AWS) was installed in an open grassed area about 1 km from the BREB system at Kalamia. All components were described by Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003). AWS data were used to determine daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from Allen et al. (1998).

Total above ground biomass was determined on seven occasions during the development of the crop at Kalamia. All plant material was removed from one 18 m2 quadrat in each of four sampling sites on each occasion. Shoots and stalks were counted and then weighed altogether. A sub sample of stalks was also weighed and then partitioned into green leaf, sheath plus immature stem, mature stem and dead leaf components. A sub sample of each of these components was weighed and then dried to constant mass in a forced draught oven set at 80 °C. Stalk and crop heights were estimated based on a stalk diameter of 23 mm, and leaves extending an additional 2 m above the stalks.

We used a customised version of the model from WaterSense (Armour et al., 2012) to simulate the effects of elevated CO2 on the field experiment above. WaterSense was a web-based irrigation scheduling service (now disabled) based on a model that used the most appropriate components of APSIM and Canegro for the purpose of helping sugarcane farmers to manage irrigation (Haines et al., 2008). Canegro and APSIM-Sugar differ considerably in regard to the transpiration process. Potential transpiration (TO) in APSIM is determined by the amount of radiation intercepted (R
                        
                           I
                        ), RUE, TE and the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) (Eq. (1)). Actual transpiration (TA) is limited either by TO or the rate of root water supply to the crop (WR) (Eq. (2)). The ratio of TA to TO (0–1) is the measure of water stress affecting biomass gain directly and leaf expansion proportionally (Keating et al., 1999).

Older versions of Canegro use the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation in a procedure which includes a daily estimate of the canopy height (z
                        
                           c
                        ) and leaf area index (LAI) (Inman-Bamber et al., 1993), but newer versions use the FAO56 approach (Allen et al., 1998) based on crop factors (Singels et al., 2008). The crop factor, also called the crop coefficient (K
                        
                           c
                        ), is the ratio of crop transpiration plus evaporation from the soil (evapotranspiration or ETc), to a reference evapotranspiration of a well-watered, short grass (ET0) and is often regarded as a simple function of crop development alone (Allen et al., 1998).

For this study we used WaterSense logic (Armour et al., 2012) but we replaced the crop coefficient approach with the one in which evapotranspiration estimates vary with z
                        
                           c
                         and LAI as reported by Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003) and Inman-Bamber et al. (1993, 2005). In this procedure latent heat flux is derived from the PM equation (Eq. (3)) and functions for canopy resistance, aerodynamic resistance and wind speed (Eqs. (4)–(6)). This was done to allow estimates of leaf conductance obtained from the glasshouse study to be scaled up to an estimate of canopy conductance of a field crop.

Latent heat flux from sugarcane transpiration is:

The PM equation uses wind speed measured at 2 m and determines aerodynamic resistance to vapour flux as a function of the difference between crop height and the height of the wind speed measurement (Eq. (5)). Sugarcane can grow to heights well above 2 m thus preventing resolving this equation at times. Wind speeds (u

The CO2 level used in our simulations was 375 ppm (r
                        
                           s
                         = 106 m s−1) which was the ‘current’ level at the time of the BREB experiment by Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003). The elevated CO2 concentration was chosen as 720 ppm (r
                        
                           s
                         = 148 m s−1) to correspond with several experiments including ours, where the high CO2 treatment was set at this level.

LAI was determined as in the APSIM-Sugar model (Keating et al., 1999) with leaf characteristics for the variety Q172 as in Table 1
                        . APSIM interpolates between inflection points defined as ‘x’ and ‘y’ parameters (Table 1). For example the maximum area is 50 cm2 for leaf #1 and it increases linearly to 500 cm2 for leaf #12 and remaining leaves.

Dry above ground biomass accumulation (△B) was also based on the APSIM-Sugar model and the Canegro term for maintenance respiration (M = 0.004) (Eq. (10)).

Compared to previous CO2 work on sugarcane using open top chambers, the glasshouse experiment provided improvements by using a demand-driven watering system to maintain treatment soil water levels irrespective of CO2 treatments, and temperature and humidity control systems to compensate for the substantial reductions in transpiration and evaporative cooling under elevated CO2. Nonetheless, as the first experiment in a new facility, there were some initial teething problems in fully regulating and matching conditions between the two chambers. Radiation and temperature conditions were very similar between chambers (Fig. 2
                        ), but humidity control was insufficient to fully offset the differences in transpiration between chambers and RH was slightly lower in the high than the low CO2 chamber (Fig. 2). Analysis of variance for biomass yield per pot indicated that single effects of CO2 level, variety and harvest date were statistically significant (p < 0.02) but no interactions were significant. The yield of above ground biomass was significantly higher in the low than the high CO2 chamber (Fig. 3
                        ). Plants were watered on demand using the same soil moisture criteria, with frequent checks and watering, in both chambers so it is not likely that the lower RH in the high CO2 chamber would have reduced yield through water stress. Mite damage was noted on leaves when gas exchange measurements were made shortly before the final harvest. This damage was confined to the high CO2 chamber and may have contributed to the slightly lower yields at 8 and 10 months in this chamber. No mites were evident earlier in the experiment and the yields at 4 and 6 months would have benefited from exposure to elevated CO2 had there been any direct effect of CO2 on photosynthesis (see Fig. 3). The CO2 effect on yield was not significant (p = 0.108) when the analysis of variance was confined to yields from these two earlier harvests, when no mites were present.

Variety, harvest date and CO2 level all had significant effects (p = 0.022, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively) on whole-pot transpiration per unit leaf area over the 7-day period prior to sampling. However no interactions were significant. Elevated CO2 reduced mean transpiration by 27.5% (Fig. 3.) and this, combined with inadequate humidifier-dehumidifier control, was probably the cause of the lower RH in the high than the low CO2 chamber (Fig. 2.).

Cuvette (leaf chamber) measurements of gas exchange on leaf #1 indicated that photosynthesis was not affected with mite damage ratings of 1 (no damage) and 2 (slight damage within the range of natural blemishes, <5% of leaf area) (damage scores ranged from 1 to 5). Measurements on leaves where mite damage ratings exceeded natural blemishes (>2) were excluded from the analysis. Photosynthesis was increased (p < 0.001) by a temporary increase in CO2 concentration in the cuvette regardless of whether plants had been growing at ambient or elevated CO2 levels or not (Table 2
                        ). The cuvette × chamber interaction was not significant (p = 0.085) but there was a tendency for the response to an increase in cuvette CO2 level to be greater for plants growing at ambient CO2 levels than at elevated levels (Table 2). This was most likely due to the rather low internal CO2 concentration (C
                        
                           i
                        ) of leaves in ambient CO2 (390 ppm) when cuvette CO2 was 375 ppm (Table 2). For plants growing in elevated CO2, C
                        
                           i
                         was also below the level (∼100 ppm) thought to be saturating for C4 species (Ghannoum et al., 2000) when the small cuvette CO2 concentration was 375 ppm (Table 2).

The mean effect of an increase in cuvette CO2 concentration on stomatal conductance was substantial (34% reduction, p < 0.001) and there was a tendency (p = 0.054) for the reduction to be greater for plants growing at elevated, rather than at ambient, CO2 (Table 2). However the more meaningful response is that between low CO2 in both cuvette and chamber compared to high CO2 in both types of chambers (i.e., when gas exchange measurements are made at the same CO2 levels as the long term CO2 treatments in which plants have been growing). This is more likely to be a measure of the long-term effect of CO2 on conductance than any other comparison. In this case, it appears that long-term exposure to elevated CO2 had reduced stomatal conductance by 28% which is very similar to the reduction in transpiration determined for all leaves over a 7-d period as discussed earlier.

We would expect that this reduction in transpiration was due largely to decreased stomatal conductance given that air-flow; radiation and temperature conditions as well as the ‘canopy’ structure in both large chambers were similar. Transpiration in the high CO2 chamber may have been lower than observed had the RH been the same as in the low CO2 chamber (Fig. 2). However a conservative approach would be to assume that conductance was reduced by 28% by long term exposure to elevated CO2. This corresponds to a 39% increase in stomatal resistance to gaseous diffusion (r
                        
                           s
                        ) (since r
                        
                           s
                         is the inverse of conductance) (Table 2) from prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 (390 vs. 720 ppm). Thus rs increased 11.8% per 100 ppm increase in CO2.

Brief clarifying results from the later experiment, in which problems with environmental controls and mites were addressed, confirmed that CO2 responses were predominantly restricted to reductions in water use, and that these changes in water use were the result of CO2 treatments rather than other differences between chambers. Measurements of whole-pot transpiration immediately before and after swapping pots and CO2 treatments between chambers (Table 3
                        ) showed significant differences between CO2 treatments and clones (both p << 0.01), but not between chambers (p = 0.45). Final harvested aboveground biomass showed differences between clones (p << 0.01), but not between CO2 treatments (p = 0.52, Table 4
                        ).

The simulated fraction of solar radiation (400–7000 nm) reaching the soil surface was similar to what was observed using the tube solarimeters (Fig. 4
                        ). A close approximation of radiation levels at the soil surface was important for the correct partitioning of latent heat flux between evaporation from the soil (Eq. (8)) and transpiration from the canopy.

Simulated ETc provided a good approximation of ETc measured with the BREB system (Fig. 5
                        ). The process for deciding if ETc measurements logged at 20 min intervals were deemed acceptable or not depending on wind direction and the resolution of the sensors (Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey, 2003). If all 40 ETc readings between 06:00 and 19:00 on a given day were acceptable, then the acceptance rate for cumulative ETc on that day was 100%. The correlation between simulated and measured daily ETc was high (R2 = 0.65, n = 127) when an acceptance rate of 80% was used for measured ETc and was very high (R2 = 0.83, n = 41) when the acceptance rate was 90%. Thus the more reliable the measurements, the closer they were to those estimated by the model. In this case one would rely more on the model than the measurements when their acceptance rates were low.

The simulation of biomass yield was close to the yield observed by means of the seven sample harvests conducted during the growth of the crop. Observed biomass yield was similar to simulated biomass yield for three of the harvest samples and was lower than simulated yield for one sample and higher for three of the samples (Fig. 6
                        ). Although simulations of elevated CO2 made little difference to biomass yield because this crop was well irrigated, biomass yield was 8% greater with elevated CO2 than without it when the crop was young due to a short period of water stress in October 2000, and it was 3% greater at harvest (August 2001), also because of water stress caused by the drying off process which limited water availability to the crop. Reduced water use due to elevated CO2 resulted in more water being available during the stress periods (Fig. 6).

Simulated LAI corresponded with measured LAI when this was determined for the first time in January 2001 (Fig. 7
                        ). LAI observed in March and May also supported the assumptions about canopy development processes in the model. Measurements of LAI in April and June were lower than simulated LAI. The low LAI in April was unexpected but the reduction in LAI in June was possibly due to drying off prior to harvesting – a process not reflected in the simulation until July (Fig. 7). Canopy development would have benefitted from elevated CO2 to only a small extent during the short-lived stress period in October 2000 (Fig. 7).

The simulation of stalk length was realistic (Fig. 8
                        ). Crop height (stalk height plus leaf length) was not measured as such but a maximum canopy height of 5 m was realistic given the 4 m height of the scaffolding built to service the BREB sensors and observations that leaves extended only about 1 m above that platform when the crop was at its tallest. Crop canopy height (z
                        
                           c
                        ) and LAI need to be correctly modelled since these terms are used in the PM calculation of transpiration (Eqs. (3)–(5)).

The ratio (F) of transpiration at 720 ppm CO2 relative to transpiration at 375 ppm CO2 was as low as 0.7 when LAI was small and F increased to a range of 0.8–0.95 (Fig. 9
                        
                        ) as LAI reached 3.5 and crop height 5 m (Figs. 7 and 8). F increased to as much as 1.5 during the drying-off period in July because high CO2 and consequently reduced transpiration, increased the amount of water stored in the soil which could then be transpired during this period more readily than the crop subjected to low CO2. When LAI and canopy height (z
                        
                           c
                        ) are small, r
                        
                           a

                           s
                        ) has a large flow-on effect on transpiration (Eqs. (4), (5) and (7)). When LAI and z

                           a
                         is relatively large so the impact of elevated CO2 on transpiration is reduced when water is not limiting.

The ratio of ETc to ET0 is the crop coefficient (K
                        
                           c
                        ) as defined by Allen et al. (1998). Measured and simulated K
                        
                           c
                         were similar and in agreement with maximum K

                         = 1.25 as in Allen et al. (1998) and Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003). However it is clear from the measurements and simulation that K

                           c
                         varied mostly between 1.0 and 1.5 indicating that irrigation scheduling based on simple models using constant K
                        
                           c
                         values could be flawed particularly if irrigation is applied daily in sandy soils. LAI for sugarcane in the BREB experiment was as high as 4.0 compared to an effective LAI = 1.44 for grass in the reference ET0 calculation (Allen et al., 1998). Crop height exceeded 4 m for sugarcane in the BREB experiment compared to a grass height of 0.12 m in the ET0 calculation (Allen et al., 1998). Stomatal resistance for grass (Allen et al., 1998) and sugarcane was similar (100 and 106 s m−1, respectively) at current CO2 levels and was 148 s m−1 for sugarcane at elevated CO2 levels and this increase caused a slight reduction in K
                        
                           c
                         for sugarcane growing at twice normal CO2 (Fig. 10).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The glasshouse experiment presented here provides evidence that the direct stimulation of sugarcane growth by elevated CO2 from purely leaf-level mechanisms, if any, is small. This suggests that reported increases in yield from previously published CO2 experiments (Vu et al., 2006; de Souza et al., 2008) are likely to be largely due to indirect mechanisms related to improved water relations (the alleviation of water stress and prolonged soil water availability) even if water was thought to have been non-limiting during the experiments. Better water relations could have explained the results of Vu et al. (2006) where photosynthesis of small sugarcane leaf segments of young leaves was 10–20% greater in 720 ppm than ambient ppm CO2 because elevated CO2 reduced stomatal conductance by 51% and transpiration by 39%. Vu et al. (2006) suggested that the increase in leaf area (31%) and stalk yield (55%) with elevated CO2, could have been partly through enhanced water use efficiency and therefore stress alleviation and prolonged water availability. de Souza et al. (2008) clarified their efforts to ensure adequate irrigation by maintaining soil water tension below 20 kPa and yet the 40% increase in biomass yield under elevated CO2 was thought to be at least partly due water stress alleviation.

Interestingly, even without any direct effect of CO2 on photosynthesis, the modelling of the BREB experiment showed a biomass yield advantage as high as 8%, early in the accumulation of biomass by the crop (Fig. 6) which we thought at the time was irrigated adequately. However the final yield of the experiment would have increased only by about 3% at 720 ppm CO2 according to the simulation. Marin et al. (2013) simulated a 10% increase in fresh cane yield with 750 versus 380 ppm CO2 in their study using climatic conditions in Sao Paulo state, Brazil where irrigation is generally not practiced but rainfall is high. Their model was DSSAT/Canegro which uses a crop factor (K
                     
                        c
                     ) approach based on the Penman-Monteith formula to determine grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0) where canopy resistance for ‘grass’ was allowed to vary with CO2 (Marin et al., 2013). However sugarcane evapotranspiration could not be influenced by the interaction between CO2 concentration, crop height and LAI as we suggest it should be. Another problem with the crop coefficient (K
                     
                        c
                     ) approach is that K
                     
                        c
                      varies considerably depending on soil moisture and various climatic variables (Fig. 10). Relative humidity, wind speed and crop height also need to be taken into account as we have done or as suggested by Allen et al. (1998) in the ‘Dual crop coefficient’ approach. A similar problem with K
                     
                        c
                      was identified in the CropSyst model by Marsal et al. (2014) using lysimeters rather than a BREB system. Furthermore, simulation of the BREB experiment with 375 and 720 ppm CO2 indicated that transpiration could be reduced by about 30% when the crop is small but only by about 10% when the canopy is closed and the crop is tall (Fig. 9). Similar simulations were produced by Morison and Gifford (1984b) who plotted F (the ratio of transpiration under elevated vs ambient CO2) against the ratio of r
                     
                        a

                        s
                      for different responses of r
                     
                        s
                      to the doubling of CO2 concentrations. F was as low as 66% (when r
                     
                        a
                     
                     /r
                     
                        s
                      was small, 0.04) and was as high as 0.90 (when r
                     
                        a

                        s
                      was 0.96 and stomatal conductance was reduced by 36%) for a doubling of CO2 concentration. These authors point out, as we do, that the effect of stomatal closure on transpiration depends on the ratio of stomatal (r
                     
                        s
                     ) to aerodynamic resistance (r
                     
                        a
                     ). Only when stomatal resistance is large relative to aerodynamic resistance is the reduction in stomatal conductance with increased CO2 concentration reflected as a reduction of similar magnitude in transpiration (Morison and Gifford, 1984b). In our case when simulating the BREB experiment, a reduction of 29% in stomatal conductance (a 40% increase in rs) resulted in a 30% reduction in transpiration only when the crop was small (Fig. 9) and well-coupled with the atmosphere (r
                     
                        a
                      << r
                     
                        s
                     ). For models of canopy transpiration that do not use a full Penman-Montieth (Eq. (3)) approach, it is important to take this decoupling and diminished response into account when scaling and parameterising canopy level CO2 responses from leaf-level measurements. This is particularly important for crops like sugarcane where the canopy is closed, and r
                     
                        a
                      is large, for most of the crop's growth.

If changing levels of CO2 affect crop growth only through alleviation of water stress then clearly the degree of water stress encountered by the crop under current CO2 conditions will influence the degree to which the crop responds to CO2. Inman-Bamber and Smith (2005) show how sensitive sugarcane is to water stress in terms of expansive growth. Inman-Bamber et al. (2008) showed how an increase in temperature for plants growing in a glasshouse can cause a reduction in leaf extension at midday presumably through water stress even when plants have water ‘on demand’ as was the case in our glasshouse experiment. Depending on the variety, hourly photosynthesis may not be reduced at all or by 50% at most by water stress which is sufficient to stop leaf extension (Inman-Bamber et al., 2008) so it was not surprising that our glasshouse grown plants did not respond to elevated CO2 in terms of increased biomass. Growth of leaves of Panicum coloratum growing in controlled environment chambers was greater when elevated CO2 (1000 ppm) decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration under high VPD conditions, even though soil water content was maintained at 100% (Seneweera et al., 1998). These authors concluded that greater CO2 concentrations allow C4 grasses to maintain better internal water relations by reducing transpirational water losses and so allow expansion of these species into more arid climates. In a simulation study on possible sugarcane yields in Ghana, Black et al., 2012 found that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration offset a 20% increase in demand for irrigation associated with a 4 °C rise in temperature. The model used a simple approach for representing direct effects of CO2 on plant water use whereby changes in stomatal conductance were assumed to be inversely proportional to changes in CO2 level (e.g. a halving of conductance for a doubling of CO2: stronger than the actual measured responses for sugarcane summarised in the paragraph below).

A comprehensive review on the effects of elevated CO2 on C4 species by Leakey (2009) sides with conclusions by Ghannoum et al. (2000) that C4 photosynthesis could only be stimulated by elevated CO2 either directly, when internal CO2 concentration (Ci) is below about 100 ppm or indirectly, when reduced stomatal conductance stimulated photosynthesis via altered water relations or energy balance. Of the 220 Ci measurements (not published) on sugarcane growing at normal CO2 levels, taken by Inman-Bamber et al. (2008) only seven Ci readings were less than 100 ppm; six of these were for water stressed plants. Mean Ci was significantly lower (120 ppm) for the dry treatments compared to the wet treatment (198 ppm, p = 0.014). In another experiment in which potted sugarcane had water on demand, whole plant photosynthesis (per unit leaf area) declined about 66% from 6 to 10 months of age (Inman-Bamber et al., 2011). Bull, 1969 reported a similar decline in photosynthesis of leaf segments for plants between 10 and 48 weeks of age. Basnayake et al. (2015) measured stomatal conductance on various irrigated and rainfed crops during the first six months of development. For irrigated crops the mean final conductance was 202 mmol/m2/s compared to 259 mmol/m2/s for the earlier conductance's. In our experiment (Table 2), mean conductance in normal CO2 was 179 mmol/m2/s in the 9-month-old plants, which is probably to be expected for well-watered plants of that age. The low Ci values in Table 2 are probably due to the rather low stomatal conductance related to crop age rather than to water stress. Thus ageing crops could respond to elevated CO2 directly through increased Ci but this was not evident in the biomass yields of our experiment.

The most consistent effect of elevated CO2 reported in the sugarcane literature is that on stomatal conductance; a 37% and 34% reduction in twice normal CO2 (de Souza et al., 2008; Vu et al., 2006) and in our case a 28% reduction for well-watered plants when CO2 concentration was elevated from 390 to 720 ppm (Table 2). This agrees with research from other C4 species such as maize (Leakey et al., 2006) where, in the absence of water stress, growth under elevated CO2 (550 ppm compared to 367 ppm) did not stimulate photosynthesis, biomass accumulation or yield. Nor was there any CO2 effect on the activity of key photosynthetic enzymes, or metabolic markers of carbon and nitrogen status (Leakey et al., 2006).

It behoves modellers to be careful about assumptions used when representing CO2 effects in their models (Tubiello et al., 2007) and experimental evidence has been lacking up to now for simulating the response of sugarcane yields to future rises in CO2 concentrations. In this paper we presented initial experimental evidence that indicates modelling future climate scenarios for sugarcane should be based on representing CO2 responses predominantly through indirect water-related mechanisms.

We also provided a modelling framework that demonstrates the value of using carefully targeted, controlled studies to test and isolate proposed response mechanisms and subsequently reconstruct (scale up) their combined action under a field crop situation, through modelling. Algorithms developed in the simulation study are well suited for investigating possible responses of sugarcane to climate change scenarios in which CO2, radiation, temperature and rainfall may all change, and have been applied in this way by Everingham et al. (2015).
