                  We consider a clique relaxation model based on the concept of relative vertex connectivity. It extends the classical definition of a k-vertex-connected subgraph by requiring that the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a disconnected (or a trivial) graph is proportional to the size of this subgraph, rather than fixed at k. Consequently, we further generalize the proposed approach to require vertex-connectivity of a subgraph to be some function f of its size. We discuss connections of the proposed models with other clique relaxation ideas from the literature and demonstrate that our generalized framework, referred to as f-vertex-connectivity, encompasses other known vertex-connectivity-based models, such as s-bundle and k-block. We study related computational complexity issues and show that finding maximum subgraphs with relatively large vertex connectivity is NP-hard. An interesting special case that extends the R-robust 2-club model recently introduced in the literature, is also considered. In terms of solution techniques, we first develop general linear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations. Then we describe an effective exact algorithm that iteratively solves a series of simpler MIPs, along with some enhancements, in order to obtain an optimal solution for the original problem. Finally, we perform computational experiments on several classes of random and real-life networks to demonstrate performance of the developed solution approaches and illustrate some properties of the proposed clique relaxation models.

                                 v

                      are connected if G contains a path between them; graph G is connected (disconnected) if all its vertices are pairwise connected (there exists a pair of vertices that are not connected). The vertex connectivity of a graph G, referred to as 
                        
                           κ
                           (
                           G
                           )
                        
                     , is defined as the minimum number of vertices of G whose removal results in either a disconnected graph or a trivial graph (i.e., consisting of exactly one vertex) (Kirousis, Serna, & Spirakis, 1993; Pattillo, Youssef, & Butenko, 2013). We say that graph G is k-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is at least k, i.e., 
                        
                           κ
                           (
                           G
                           )
                           ⩾
                           k
                        
                     . Vertex connectivity and k-vertex connectivity of a given graph can be verified in polynomial time (Galil, 1980). Since vertex connectivity is among the fundamental graph properties, there is a considerable body of work on this topic, see Galil (1980); Kammer and Täubig (2005); Kirousis et al. (1993); Matula (1969); Reif and Spirakis (1985) and references therein.

The longest distance (or, equivalently, the length of a longest shortest path) between all pairs of vertices in G is referred to as the diameter of G, i.e.,

                      denotes the subgraph induced by S on G. A clique C is a subset of V such that the subgraph 
                        
                           G
                           [
                           C
                           ]
                        
                      induced by C in G is complete (Luce & Perry, 1949). The maximum clique problem is to find a clique of maximum cardinality in G, see, e.g., Bomze, Budinich, Pardalos, and Pelillo (1999). This problem is NP-hard (and its decision version is NP-complete) (Garey & Johnson, 1979).

A clique is a very intuitive and simple concept of a cohesive subgraph with numerous important applications (Bomze et al., 1999; Butenko & Wilhelm, 2006). Cliques possess a number of “ideal” cohesiveness properties (Pattillo, Youssef, et al., 2013): each vertex is connected to all other vertices, a clique has maximum possible edge density as well as edge and vertex connectivity, the distance between any pair of vertices is one, etc. However, in many practical scenarios cliques are overly restrictive graph structures. Thus, a number of clique relaxation models have been introduced in the literature, see, e.g., Balasundaram, Butenko, Hicks, and Sachdeva (2011); Balasundaram, Butenko, and Trukhanov (2005); Veremyev and Boginski (2012a).

A unifying taxonomic framework proposed by Pattillo, Youssef, et al., 2013 demonstrates that all existing clique relaxation models in the literature are based on relaxing some of the elementary clique-defining properties, namely, distance, diameter, domination, degree, density and connectivity. These relaxations are further classified into absolute and relative ones. One illustrative example of an absolute (diameter-based) relaxation is an s-club, which is defined as a subset 
                        
                           S
                           ⊆
                           V
                        
                      such that the subgraph 
                        
                           G
                           [
                           S
                           ]
                        
                      induced by S in G has diameter of at most s, i.e., 
                        
                           diam
                           (
                           G
                           [
                           S
                           ]
                           )
                           ⩽
                           s
                        
                     , where s is a fixed positive integer (Balasundaram et al., 2005; Veremyev & Boginski, 2012a). Clearly, requiring 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           1
                        
                      results in a clique, while relaxing 
                        
                           s
                           ⩾
                           2
                        
                      defines a subgraph with somewhat less restrictive diameter requirements. The problem of finding maximum s-clubs is known to be NP-hard for any fixed 
                        
                           s
                           ⩾
                           2
                        
                      (Balasundaram et al., 2005).

Another absolute clique relaxation model using vertex connectivity is a k-block (Pattillo, Youssef, et al., 2013), which is defined as a subset 
                        
                           S
                           ⊆
                           V
                        
                      such that the subgraph 
                        
                           G
                           [
                           S
                           ]
                        
                      induced by S in G has vertex connectivity of at least k, i.e., 
                        
                           κ
                           (
                           G
                           [
                           S
                           ]
                           )
                           ⩾
                           k
                        
                     . In contrast to the computationally hard clique relaxation model above, finding a maximum 1-block is a polynomially solvable problem, as it corresponds to finding the largest connected component of a graph. Similarly, maximum 2-connected and 3-connected components can be found in 
                        
                           O

                      time (Kammer & Täubig, 2005); furthermore, for any fixed

                           >

                     , finding maximum k-connected components can be performed in 
                        
                           O
                           (

                     -quasi-clique is, probably, the most well-known relative clique relaxation model with a number of important applications in biological, social, telecommunication and financial areas (Abello, Pardalos, & Resende, 1999; Abello et al., 2002; Matsuda, Ishihara, & Hashimoto, 1999; Mahdavi Pajouh, Miao, & Balasundaram, 2014; Uno, 2010). For example, in graph-theoretical models that are built upon some real-life (e.g., experimental) data, measurement errors and noisy observations often result in missing “links” (i.e., edges). Using cliques for capturing and representing dense clusters of closely related (either through cohesiveness or “tightness”) functional elements within such networked systems can be impractical and too idealistic since large cliques rarely occur in natural systems. Consequently, techniques based on 
                        
                           γ
                        
                     -quasi-clique models can be applied to address such issues. However, Pattillo, Youssef, et al., 2013 pointed out that other relative clique relaxations ideas should also be studied. Specifically, the concept of relative vertex connectivity was identified as an interesting research direction that is worth exploring. In this paper, we further investigate this issue by using the following definition of a clique relaxation model:

In this paper we consider the problem of finding a maximum (in terms of cardinality

The discussion above highlights the fact that identifying maximum subgraphs remains a difficult combinatorial optimization problem in general graphs as long as the required cohesiveness property is relatively strict (e.g., clique, s-bundle,

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we study the theoretical computational complexity issues. In Section 3 we develop a linear mixed integer program (MIP) for finding the maximum

Then in Section 4 we describe an effective exact algorithm that iteratively solves a series of simpler MIPs along with some enhancements in order to obtain an optimal solution for the original problem. Section 5 is focused on an interesting special case referred to as the

In Section 6 we provide the results of our computational experiments using the developed solution approaches on several classes of random and real-life networks. We also describe simple preprocessing techniques that substantially improve the performance of standard solvers. Finally, we conclude the paper by highlighting promising directions for future research work in Section 7.

As discussed in Section 1, the concept of f-vertex-connectivity encompasses other known vertex-connectivity-based models proposed in the literature such as s-bundle and k-block. Next, we show that the f-VERTEX-CONNECTED subgraph problem remains NP-complete for two other types of 
                           
                              f

                              ·
                              )
                           
                         with substantially less restrictive vertex connectivity requirements.

In this section we provide linear mixed 0–1 programming formulations for finding maximum

We generalize the network flow linear programming formulation; recall that k-vertex-connectivity between any pair of vertices can be checked via a maximum flow approach (Kammer & Täubig, 2005). In the remainder of this section we assume

                               is a non-decreasing function, which is a natural assumption. Otherwise, one should simply modify line 14 of Algorithm 1 to consider all

                           G

                     . The motivation behind introducing this concept is the following observation. All 2-clubs ensure that there exists a very “short” path (of length at most 2) between any pair of vertices. Nevertheless, unlike cliques such graphs are potentially still vulnerable to specific vertex-targeted attacks (or errors). Generally speaking, the concept of attacks (or errors) in graphs is typically defined as “targeted” (or “not-targeted,” e.g., due to a random failure) disruptions that destroy certain graph elements (e.g., vertices) in order to interfere with a desirable graph property (e.g., vertex connectivity) (Albert, Jeong, & Barabási, 2000; Veremyev & Boginski, 2012a). One illustrative example of a very vulnerable 2-club is a star graph, i.e., a tree with one internal vertex and 
                        
                           |
                           V
                           |
                           -
                           1
                        
                      leaves. All paths between leaves in this graph share a common vertex. Thus, it is easy to observe that removal (e.g., a failure due to an attack or error) of the internal vertex completely disconnects the graph.

It is important to note that in the definition of R-robust 2-club, parameter R is fixed and does not depend on the size of S. However, it is natural to consider more “robust” (i.e., vertex-attack tolerant as in Veremyev & Boginski (2012a, 2012b)) subgraphs that require a larger number of vertex-disjoint “short” paths as their sizes grow. Based on this intuition, we define the following model:

                     . Thus, requiring vertex-connectivity with “short” paths (i.e., lengths of paths are at most 2 as in Definitions 3 and 4) may potentially simplify the problem of finding large subgraphs with the desirable properties. On the other hand, it also reduces the sizes of the obtained subgraphs due to somewhat stricter requirements. These insights are also supported by the results of our computational experiments described below in Section 6.

Finally, we note that EIA discussed in Section 4 can be easily extended to solve f-RCP. In particular, one should modify MIP f-RCP by changing the right-hand side in (21) similar to (14), remove constraints (10) and introduce an additional constraint (15). As in Section 4, we refer to the obtained MIP as f-RCP(L). In Section 6 whenever we use EIA to find either a maximum f-vertex-connected subgraph, or a maximum f-robust 2-club, we assume that either f-CP(L), or f-RCP(L) is used a subprocedure in EIA, respectively.

In this section we describe a series of computational experiments performed using several classes of randomly generated (uniform and power-law) and real-life graph test instances. In particular, we are mostly interested in studying effectiveness of the proposed exact solution approach, namely, EIA. We also compare its performance with respect to the developed linear MIP formulations. Moreover, comparing the sizes of the obtained maximum subgraphs (including

Our study is conducted on a Mac OS X machine equipped with an Intel Core i7 2.8GHz processor, 8GB of RAM and FICO Xpress-Optimizer 7.6 (FICO, 2013). The time limit of 50,000s is used in all computational experiments.

We consider three classes of test instances: (i) uniform random graphs with 50 and 500 vertices denoted by 
                           
                              u
                              50
                           
                         and 
                           
                              u
                              500
                           
                        , respectively, (ii) power-law random graphs with 50 and 500 vertices denoted by 
                           
                              p
                              50
                           
                         and 
                           
                              p
                              500
                           
                        , respectively, and (iii) a subset of real-life networks obtained from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection database (Davis & Hu, 2011) and Pajek datasets (Batagelj & Mrvar, 2006). In particular, for real-life networks we focus on instances, where the results of the respective optimization problems have meaningful interpretations, e.g., optimal solutions correspond to “highly connected subgroups” in social or communication networks that require a reasonably large fraction of their vertices to be removed in order to disconnect the subgroup. The parameters of the selected instances (including their sizes and network types, e.g., social, biological) are provided in Tables 1, and 5
                        .

Uniform random graphs are constructed according to a classical

It is widely reported in the literature that many real-life networks (e.g., biological, financial, telecommunication, social) have a power-law structure (Faloutsos, Faloutsos, & Faloutsos, 1999; Newman, 2003), i.e., the probability that a vertex has degree k is 
                           
                              Θ

                                    k
                                 
                                 
                                    -
                                    β
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                         for some constant 
                           
                              β
                           
                        , where the value of 
                           
                              β
                           
                         depends on the network edge density. Thus, we also consider instances of power-law random graphs (i.e.,

Most of our computational experiments are focused on EIA because the algorithm significantly outperforms an approach based on solving MIPs using a standard solver. In order to demonstrate this observation we report comparisons of EIA with 
                           
                              γ

                        -RCP in Table 7. However, we also improve the solver’s performance by applying a simple, but rather effective preprocessing procedure to reduce the sizes of the input graphs (via vertex and edge removal) and consequently decrease the sizes of the corresponding MIP formulations. The intuition behind our preprocessing procedure described in detail next, is similar to one of the enhancements used in EIA (see Section 4).

Following the same idea, this approach can be extended for a more general problem of finding maximum f-connected subgraphs. Next, consider the problem of finding a maximum

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The first set of experiments (reported in Tables 1 and 2
                        ) is conducted to evaluate the performance of EIA for some real-life graphs as well as random uniform and power-law graphs. The value of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         is gradually decreased from 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         (i.e., maximum clique) to 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.1
                           
                        . One immediate observation from Table 1 is that for larger (smaller) values of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         the sizes of the maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-connected subgraphs in power-law random graphs are typically larger (smaller) than in the corresponding uniform random graphs. This trend can be easily explained by inherent differences in the degree distributions of uniform and power-law graphs. Another interesting observation from Table 2 is that the problem of finding maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-connected subgraphs seems to be substantially easier for power-law graphs, which is extremely promising as real-life complex networks have a power-law structure.

The second set of experiments (reported in Tables 3 and 4
                        
                        ) is similar to the previous one. We focus on the problem of finding maximum f-connected subgraphs for 
                           
                              f
                              (
                              |
                              S
                              |
                              )
                              =
                              γ
                              (
                              |
                              S
                              |
                              -
                              |
                              S
                              
                                 
                                    |
                                 
                                 
                                    α
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        , where 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         and the value of 
                           
                              α
                           
                         is gradually increased from 0 to 
                           
                              0.9
                           
                        . Observe that 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0
                           
                         corresponds to 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-connectivity (also, see the results in the respective column with 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         of Table 1), while larger values of 
                           
                              α
                           
                         imply somewhat less restrictive connectivity requirements. Thus, the sizes of the obtained subgraphs increase substantially for larger values of 
                           
                              α
                           
                        . Also, for smaller values of 
                           
                              α
                           
                        , power-law graphs have larger maximum f-connected subgraphs than uniform graphs. This fact is rather intuitive if we compare the results for uniform and power-law graphs in the column of Table 1 with 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         and observe that 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-connectivity is “similar” to f-connectivity for smaller values of 
                           
                              α
                           
                        . Interestingly, comparing Table 4 and the column with 
                           
                              γ
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                         of Table 2, we conclude that average running times increase for larger value of 
                           
                              α
                           
                        . We believe this is due to less restrictive connectivity requirements, which imply larger feasible regions. Note also that the computational behavior of EIA on real-life instances in the first and the second sets of experiments is somewhat similar to its behavior on random power-law graphs, which is not a surprising observation.

The third set of experiments (reported in Tables 5 and 6
                        
                        ) is aimed at evaluating EIA for finding maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-robust 2-clubs. As expected, the subgraph size increases gradually as the value of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         decreases (and the robustness requirements become less restrictive). One key observation is that the sizes of the obtained subgraphs are much larger for the power-law graphs in comparison to the uniform ones, which is natural if we recall the “small-world” property of power-law graphs. More importantly, recall that formulation 
                           
                              f
                              -
                              RCP
                           
                        (L) is more compact than 
                           
                              f
                              -
                              CP
                           
                        (L). Thus, we are capable of solving considerably larger test instances than in Tables 1–4. Also, EIA performs much better for power-law graphs. This allows us to obtain maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-robust 2-clubs for rather large real-life complex networks reasonably fast. Interestingly, EIA’s performance is better on real-life instances than on random power-law graphs, which might be due to a higher density of 
                           
                              p
                              500
                           
                         instances (recall that we generate random power-law graphs trying to match densities of the corresponding random uniform graphs).

Another important observation from Table 5 is that in instances that belong to the same class of networks, the sizes of the obtained subgraphs may behave in a rather similar manner as the value of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         decreases. One of illustrative examples is the class of book graphs “huck,” “jean,” “david,” “anna” and “homer,” which are constructed based on five classic works: Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, Hugo’s Les Misérables, Dicken’s David Copperfield, Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina and Homer’s Iliad, respectively. In these graphs each vertex represents a book character and two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding characters encounter each other in the book (COLOR02/03/04, 2013).

Probably the most interesting example is “USAir97” graph. It contains the largest 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-robust 2-club among the considered real-life instances almost for every value of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         despite the fact it is not the largest graph. This property of “USAir97” is rather intuitive if one recalls that for the obtained subgraphs we require connectivity with paths of length at most 2, which correspond to one layover flights in the underlying transportation network.

The last set of experiments (reported in Table 7
                        ) demonstrates that EIA convincingly outperforms an approach based on solving MIPs 
                           
                              γ
                              -
                              CP
                              ,
                              f
                              -
                              CP
                           
                         and 
                           
                              γ
                              -
                              RCP
                           
                         using a standard commercial solver. We attribute these results to the following two factors: first, MIPs solved by EIA are relatively simple and easy to solve, and, second, the number of iterations due to the proposed enhancements is reasonably small.

Our experimental study demonstrates that requiring vertex connectivity with “short” paths (i.e., lengths of paths are at most 2) significantly simplifies the problem of finding maximum subgraphs with the desirable properties. For example, we can find maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-robust 2-clubs in real-life graph instances with 1000–2000 vertices (see Table 5). In comparison, we are able to obtain maximum 
                           
                              γ
                           
                        -relative-connected and f-connected subgraphs only for real-life instances with up to 100 vertices (see Tables 1 and 3) in a reasonable amount of time. On the other hand, requiring vertex connectivity with “short” paths also reduces the sizes of the obtained subgraphs due to somewhat stricter requirements. Finally, this trade-off is also illustrated in Fig. 5
                         for Dolphins social network (Davis & Hu, 2011).

This study defines and analyzes rather flexible and intuitive clique relaxation models based on the concept of relative vertex connectivity and its functional generalizations. This work is mostly focused on graph-theoretical modeling and computational complexity issues, as well as exact solution approaches based on linear mixed 0–1 programming formulations with additional enhancements. In particular, we describe an exact algorithm referred to as EIA that iteratively solves a series of simple MIPs in order to obtain an optimal solution for the original problem. Our computational results demonstrate that our approach can handle reasonably large instances of sparse graphs as long as vertex connectivity with “short” paths is required. However, development of more advanced solution methods for large-scale and dense graph problems with general vertex connectivity metrics is a promising direction of future research. Examples of sophisticated techniques for solving other clique-relaxation-based optimization problems can be found in (Balasundaram et al., 2011; Balasundaram, Chandramouli, & Trukhanov, 2010; Mahdavi Pajouh et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2012). Finally, one should note that the overall framework can be naturally extended to consider relative edge connectivity.
