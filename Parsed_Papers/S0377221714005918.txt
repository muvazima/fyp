                  The classical objective function of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles (Min–Sum). In several situations, such as disaster relief efforts, computer networks, and workload balance, the minimization of the longest route (Min–Max) is a better objective function. In this paper, we compare the optimal solution of several variants of the Min–Sum and the Min–Max VRP, from the worst-case point of view. Our aim is two-fold. First, we seek to motivate the design of heuristic, metaheuristic, and matheuristic algorithms for the Min–Max VRP, as even the optimal solution of the classical Min–Sum VRP can be very poor if used to solve the Min–Max VRP. Second, we aim to show that the Min–Max approach should be adopted only when it is well-justified, because the corresponding total distance can be very large with respect to the one obtained by optimally solving the classical Min–Sum VRP.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is the problem of determining a set of routes that visit a set of customers at minimum distance, where each route satisfies a capacity constraint. This problem is interesting both from the theoretical and the practical points of view. In fact, finding an optimal solution is really challenging and this problem is solved daily by companies worldwide. In the last 50years, numerous variants have been studied, including the case with one vehicle (Traveling Salesman Problem – TSP), the case with multiple uncapacitated vehicles (Multiple TSP – MTSP), and the more traditional case with several capacitated vehicles (Capacitated VRP – CVRP). The latter case, which was introduced in Dantzig and Ramser (1959), plays a central role in distribution management. The first exact algorithms for the CVRP were proposed by Christofides, Mingozzi, and Toth (1981a, 1981b). The best known exact algorithms are the ones proposed by Fukasawa et al. (2006) and Baldacci, Christofides, and Mingozzi (2008), Baldacci, Mingozzi, and Roberti (2011). For a recent survey on exact algorithms for the CVRP, we refer the reader to Baldacci, Mingozzi, and Roberti (2012). Although it is possible to optimally solve instances of the TSP with several thousands of customers, the CVRP remains very difficult to solve optimally, even if a few hundred customers are considered. Therefore, both heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed for its solution. The most famous heuristic is the Savings algorithm by Clarke and Wright (1964). The best known metaheuristics are the Adaptive large neighborhood search by Pisinger and Ropke (2007) and the Hybrid genetic algorithm recently proposed by Vidal, Crainic, Gendreau, and Prins (2014). We refer to Toth and Vigo (2002) and Golden, Raghavan, and Wasil (2008) for two comprehensive books on the VRP and to Laporte, Toth, and Vigo (2013) for a recent overview of exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic approaches.

The classical objective function of the VRP is the minimization of the total distance traveled by all vehicles (Min–Sum). In this paper, we also focus on the case in which the aim is to minimize the longest route (Min–Max). This new objective function is important in several situations. For example, in disaster relief efforts the aim is to serve all victims as soon as possible, in computer networks the aim is to minimize the maximum latency between a server and a client, in workload balance the aim is to balance the amount of work among drivers on a given day or across a time horizon. A limited number of papers is devoted to the Min–Max VRP. A tabu search algorithm is proposed in França, Gendreau, Laporte, and Müller (1995) for the Multiple TSP. Averbakh and Berman (1996) study the problem in which two salesmen must visit nodes on a tree. Applegate, Cook, Dash, and Rohe (2002) develop specialized cutting planes and a distributed search algorithm to solve the so-called Newspaper routing problem. Carlsson, Ge, Subramaniam, and Ye (2009) study the multi-depot case and propose an LP-based balancing approach and a region partition heuristic. Wang, Golden, and Wasil (2013) develop a three-phase heuristic able to significantly improve upon the LP-based balancing approach. Ren (2011) proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm. Yakici and Karasakal (2013) propose a heuristic approach for the case with split deliveries and heterogeneous demands. Campbell, Vandenbussche, and Hermann (2008) propose for the first time a comparison of the solutions obtained with alternative objective functions. They define Min–Max and Min–Sum in a different way: Min–Max aims at minimizing the arrival time to the latest customer and Min–Avg (or Min–Sum) aims at minimizing the average arrival time or, equivalently, the sum of the arrival times to the customers. The paper by Huang, Smilowitz, and Balcik (2012) extends this work by studying how alternative objectives, based on equity, efficiency, and efficacy metrics, influence the structure of the routes. The solutions obtained on the basis of the definitions of Min–Max and Min–Sum used in Campbell et al. (2008) can be very different from the ones obtained on the basis of our definition of Min–Max and Min–Sum. Consider for example the simpler TSP case. Our Min–Sum and Min–Max objectives are equivalent, while if the aim is to minimize the latest arrival, the routing can significantly differ. In fact, Campbell et al. (2008) show that the worst-case ratio between the total length of the route obtained by minimizing the latest arrival and the total length of the route obtained by minimizing the total length is 3/2.

The length of the longest route in the Min–Sum VRP is not lower than the length of the longest route in the Min–Max VRP, while the total distance in the Min–Max VRP is not lower than the total distance in the Min–Sum VRP. Our aim is to consider several variants of the VRP. For each of these variants, we aim to answer the following questions:
                        
                           1.
                           What is the ratio of the length of the longest route in the Min–Sum VRP to the length of the longest route in the Min–Max VRP, in the worst case?

What is the ratio of the total distance of the Min–Max VRP to the total distance of the Min–Sum VRP, in the worst case?

The answer to the first question tells us if minimizing the total distance can imply a significant increase in the length of the longest route. In that case, the design of heuristic, metaheuristic, and matheuristic algorithms for the Min–Max VRP is well-motivated. The answer to the second question tells us if minimizing the longest route can imply a significant increase in the total distance. In that case, this objective should be really well-justified to be adopted.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the variants of the VRP studied in the paper are formally described. In Section 3, the worst-case analysis concerning the Capacitated VRP with an infinite number of vehicles is shown. Section 4 focuses on the Capacitated VRP with a finite number of vehicles. Section 5 concerns the Multiple TSP. Section 6 focuses on the Service time VRP with a finite number of vehicles. Some conclusions are presented in Section 7.

                              Multiple TSP: The customers just have to be visited (i.e., no demand has to be satisfied). Each vehicle has infinite capacity. Exactly k routes have to be determined.


                              Service time VRP with a finite number of vehicles: Distances are replaced by travel times. Customer demands are given in terms of service times. The duration of any route is the sum of travel time and service times of the customers visited by the route. At most k vehicles are available and there is no limit on the total load or duration of a route.

In the Min–Sum VRP, the problem is to determine a set of routes that minimizes the total distance (or total time). Instead, in the Min–Max VRP, the problem is to determine a set of routes that minimizes the length (or duration) of the longest route.

An optimal solution of the Min–Max Capacitated VRP with an infinite number of vehicles is the following: Serve each customer

                            and splitting of the demand is not allowed, customer 1 has to be served directly. Therefore, a lower bound on the optimal length of the Min–Max Capacitated VRP with an infinite number of vehicles is given by the length of the route serving customer 1, that is 2. Since the solution in which each customer

In Section 4.1, we develop Theorems 3 and 4 relating to the worst-case ratios of the Min–Sum and Min–Max solutions. In Section 4.2, we define route-optimal routing plans and extend Theorems 3 and 4. (We point out that route-optimal routing plans are used in proving Theorem 11.) We discover that the bounds apply not only to the ratios between the Min–Max and the Min–Sum solutions, but also to ratios between any route-optimal solution and the Min–Max or the Min–Sum solutions.

A route-optimal routing plan is one in which every individual route in the plan is optimized in terms of total distance. Therefore, what differentiates two route-optimal routing plans is only the assignment of customers to the routes. The Min–Sum solution is obviously route-optimal. A Min–Max solution may not be route-optimal because, if we focus on only the maximal route, the other routes do not need to be optimal. However, among these Min–Max solutions, there is at least one route-optimal solution. We consider route-optimal Min–Max solutions in this paper.

                               because every route serves only a subset of the customers served by the giant route. By route-optimality and the triangle inequality, the above inequality holds.

The distances must satisfy the triangle inequality, otherwise the bounds in Theorems 5 and 6 may not hold. In fact, these ratios can be arbitrarily large, as shown in Example 5.

There are four customers and at most two vehicles. We assume that the capacity of each vehicle is greater than the sum of demands of all the customers. The distance matrix is presented in Table 1
                              . Observe that the triangle inequality is violated if

In this section, we introduce a variant of the VRP in which the customer demands are given in terms of service times. Therefore, the demands contribute directly to route duration. We replace distances with travel times, so the total duration of a route is the sum of travel time and service times of the customers visited by the route. We assume there are at most k routes and no limit on the duration of a route. Additional notation is introduced in Section 6.1. The goal is to compare the quality of the Min–Max and the Min–Sum solutions.

This section is organized as follows. In Section 6.1, we discuss how and to what extent the routing of the Min–Sum and Min–Max solutions will change with the addition of customer service times. In Section 6.2, we explore whether the bounds for the ratios in Theorems 3 and 4 are still valid or tight when we include service times.

Here, we provide some additional notation. Let T be the total service time of all the customers,

                                 Since no maximum route-duration constraint is assumed, the routing of the Min–Sum solution is unaffected by service times.

The routing of the Min–Max solution may, however, be affected by customer service times. We present three examples next. In Fig. 9
                           , we see that the Min–Max routing plan may change by adding different service times for customers. In Fig. 10
                           , we see that even with uniform service times, the Min–Max solution can change. In Fig. 11
                           , we see that even when the original solution is perfectly balanced (same number of customers and same travel time on every route), the solution may still change with the addition of uniform service times. Therefore we have

                              There are four customers and two routes. The travel time matrix is presented in Table 2
                                 . Assume a service time of 1 unit for customers 1 and 4 and service time of 3 units for customers 2 and 3. The Min–Max solutions without and with service times are displayed in Fig. 9(a) and (b). The travel times are labeled next to edges and the service times are labeled next to nodes. If the routing plan in Fig. 9(a) were used in the problem with service times, the Min–Max value would be 9. The Min–Max value of the routing plan in Fig. 9(b) is 8.

There are four customers and two routes. The travel time matrix is presented in Table 3
                                 . Assume a uniform service time of 10 units. The Min–Max solutions without and with service times are displayed in Fig. 10(a) and (b). If the routing plan in Fig. 10(a) were used in the problem with service times, the Min–Max value would be 34. The Min–Max value of the routing plan in Fig. 10(b) is 26.

There are six customers and two routes. The travel time matrix is presented in Table 4
                                 . Assume a uniform service time of 10 units. The Min–Max solutions without and with service times are displayed in Fig. 11(a) and (b). If the routing plan in Fig. 11(a) were used in the problem with service times, the Min–Max value would be 53. The Min–Max value of the routing plan in Fig. 11(b) is 45.

The inequality can be proved in the same way as with Theorem 3. To show that the bound is tight, we modify Example 3, which was used to prove Theorem 3, by considering a uniform service time of t units for each customer (see Example 11).

The solution in Fig. 12(b) is feasible which gives the objective function value an upper bound of

Travel time:

Summing the three parts, a lower bound on the Min–Max objective function value is

We assume that the Min–Max solution is route-optimal (if not, we can apply to each individual route an exact algorithm to optimally solve the corresponding TSP), which allows us to apply Theorem 6, which states that

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, the optimal solutions of several variants of Min–Max and Min–Sum VRPs are compared from the worst-case point of view. The carried out theoretical analysis allows us to draw the following two key conclusions. The first is that the length of the longest route in the Min–Sum VRP problems is at most k times, where k is the number of available vehicles, the length of the longest route in the Min–Max VRP. Therefore, when k tends to infinity, the ratio of these two lengths tends to infinity. This motivates the need to design heuristic, metaheuristic, and matheuristic algorithms for the Min–Max VRP. The second conclusion concerns the comparison of the total distance of the Min–Max VRP with the total distance of the Min–Sum VRP. The worst-case analysis shows that the former total distance is at most k times, where k is the number of available vehicles, the latter total distance. Therefore, when k tends to infinity, the ratio of these two total distances tends to infinity. This implies that the aim of minimizing the longest route should be really well-justified before deciding to adopt a Min–Max approach. Future research can be devoted to study variants of the problems analyzed in this paper, e.g., the case with asymmetric distances, the case with a limit on the total length of a route, and the case with split delivery. Moreover, the exploration of the efficient frontier of the multi-objective VRP, with both Min–Sum and Min–Max objectives, is a promising research avenue.
