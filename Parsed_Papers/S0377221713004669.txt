                  We consider the problem of minimizing a smooth function over a feasible set defined as the Cartesian product of convex compact sets. We assume that the dimension of each factor set is huge, so we are interested in studying inexact block coordinate descent methods (possibly combined with column generation strategies). We define a general decomposition framework where different line search based methods can be embedded, and we state global convergence results. Specific decomposition methods based on gradient projection and Frank–Wolfe algorithms are derived from the proposed framework. The numerical results of computational experiments performed on network assignment problems are reported.

We assume that the dimension n

                      of each block h is extremely large, so we are interested in studying decomposition-based methods.

                     (h). With this in mind, in this work we focus on the class of block coordinate descent methods. In this context, the Gauss–Seidel algorithm is one of the most popular method: at each iteration k, given the current point x

The literature on the convergence of exact decomposition algorithms (as the above Gauss–Seidel algorithm) is wide (see, e.g., [3,9,13,15]). Note that the computation of the exact solutions of the generated subproblems may be expensive whenever these latter do not have a particular structure. This has motivated several studies on inexact decomposition methods [14,21,4,17–19,23,20].

We observe that in some applications (for instance, like those concerning network equilibrium problems [7]) it is convenient to work on a lower-dimensional subset

                           (
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                           )

                                 F
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                        
                     , that in general depends on the current feasible iterate x
                     
                        k
                     . This will allow to solve problems in which the number of variables in each block is so huge that it is not reasonable to completely enumerate them a priori. In these cases it is suitable to adopt a column generation strategy, for which only the variables needed to reach optimality are iteratively added. Another case that can greatly benefit from this strategy is when a restriction of the feasible set can give some kind of computational advantages, as for instance the possibility to compute efficiently the objective function.

On these bases we can define, for instance, a Gauss–Seidel decomposition method operating on the restrictions of the factor sets 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 h

Furthermore, for the reasons already explained, we are interested in designing decomposition methods that do not necessarily require the computation of the exact solutions of the generated subproblems.

the generated subproblems can be inexactly solved whenever the computation of their exact solutions is too expensive;

there is some degree of freedom in the selection of the blocks.

The above points distinguish the present work that of some cited papers. Convergent inexact block-descent methods for smooth problems are proposed in [4,18]. This latter work, as well as [17], presents also convergence rates results of the defined algorithms. The very recent paper [19] provides a unified convergence analysis for a general class of inexact block-descent methods even for nonsmooth problems. Various types of updating rules can be embedded in the presented general framework, including the cyclic updating rule, the Gauss–Southwell update rule or the overlapping essentially cyclic update rule. However, the general inexact decomposition schemes proposed in [4,18,19] do not admit the possibility of operating on restrictions of the factor sets, thus precluding the possibility of employing column generation strategies.

Inexact decomposition algorithms for specific (linearly constrained) problems are presented in [14,21,23,20], but, differently from our general framework, they require specific assumptions on the factor sets and on the objective function.

Concerning point (i), we state some properties to ensure that the restrictions of the factor sets yield a suitable representation of these latter in a lower dimensional subspace. Regarding points (ii) and (iii), we introduce general conditions on the block selection, and on the iterative mappings operating on the restrictions of the factor sets to guarantee global convergence properties. As a result, we present a general inexact decomposition framework whose key elements are the definition of lower dimensional restrictions of the factor sets, and the employment of line search based iterative minimization mappings defined on the introduced restrictions of the factor sets. Starting from the decomposition framework, specific convergent algorithms, based on gradient projection and Frank–Wolfe directions are designed. Summarizing, the main aim of the paper is to develop a unifying global convergence theory for inexact block coordinate descent methods possibly applied in connection with column generation strategies.

The paper is organized as follows. The decomposition framework is presented in Section 2, as well as its convergence properties and the required assumptions. In Section 3 we describe two known line search mappings, the standard Armijo-type line search and a derivative-free line search, and we recall their theoretical properties. Two inexact decomposition methods, based on gradient projection and Frank–Wolfe directions, are defined in Section 4. In Section 5 we analyze a wide class of problems that fulfill the assumptions required for the convergence of the proposed framework. Finally, in Section 6 we report the numerical results of computational experiments performed on network assignment problems.

In this section we propose an inexact decomposition framework in which at each iteration a block of variables is chosen and the corresponding sub-problem is inexactly solved. The key issues of the proposed decomposition framework are the introduction of suitable low dimensional restrictions of the sets whose Cartesian product yields the feasible set, and the employment of block descent methods to inexactly solve the generated subproblems. First we formally define the restriction of a set

The proposed algorithm, named IDA, is depicted in Algorithm 1.


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

In order to perform the convergence analysis of Algorithm IDA, we need to introduce suitable assumptions on the sets

                                 h
                              
                           
                           (
                           ·
                           )
                        
                     , on the block selection, on the search direction d
                     
                        k
                     , and on the line search procedure that computes the stepsize α
                     
                        k
                     .

The first assumption is on the properties of the sets

We observe that (i) of Assumption 1 is needed to ensure that along an infinite sequence of iterates it is possible to extract a subsequence for which the same restriction of the factor set is selected. Condition (ii) requires that the restriction 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                           (
                           
                              
                                 x

                           )
                        
                      captures, in the limit, the geometry of the set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 F

                      in terms of optimality conditions. Examples of restrictions satisfying Assumption 1 are defined in Section 5 with reference to a general class of linearly constrained problems (see Proposition 8).

A second assumption requires that each block component x
                     (l) for l
                     ∈{1,…,
                     L} is periodically considered at Step 3 within a prefixed maximum number of iterations.
                        Assumption 2
                        There exists an integer M
                           >0 such that, for all k
                           ⩾0 and for all l
                           ∈{1,…,
                           L}, we can find an index l(k), with 0⩽
                           l(k)⩽
                           M, such that at Step 1 we have h
                           
                              k+l(k)
                           =
                           l.

The next assumption needs to be satisfied by the line search mapping, and by the choice of the search direction.
                        Assumption 3
                        At every iteration k, the line search procedure computes a value of α
                           
                              k

Line search mappings are described and analyzed in the appendix. We remark that the condition (5) stated in Assumption 3 requires, as usual in the context of decomposition methods, that the distance ∥x
                     
                        k+1
                     −
                     x
                     
                        k
                     ∥ tends to zero. Indeed, at each iteration, a single block of variables is updated, so that, to attain convergence it may be necessary that “consecutive” points x
                     
                        k
                     ,
                     x
                     
                        k+1,
                     x
                     
                        k+2,…, tend to the same limit point.

This requirement can be satisfied by an iteration of the form

                     where α
                     
                        k
                      is determined by an Armijo-type line search (see Section 3.1) provided, for instance, that d
                     
                        k
                      is obtained by a gradient projection. In other cases, for instance, whenever d
                     
                        k
                      is a Frank–Wolfe-type direction, the adoption of an Armijo-type line search is not sufficient to guarantee that the distance between successive points tends to zero. This motivates the adoption of a line search (see Section 3.2) based on an acceptance condition different from that of Armijo’s rule.

Finally, we state the following assumption on the search direction.
                        Assumption 4
                        Let {x
                           
                              k
                           }

                            be a subsequence of feasible points convergent to a point x

Note that the following theoretical result is a generalized convergence theorem that follows directly from the stated assumptions, and can be used to design algorithmic strategies for specific classes of problems whose convergence can be proved by satisfying the required assumptions.

In this section we present two decomposition algorithms derived from the IDA framework. The two algorithms are based on gradient projection and Frank–Wolfe directions respectively, and on the adoption of suitable line searches. In both algorithms we implicitly assume that, if ∇f(x
                     
                        k
                     )

                        k
                     
                     =0, then we consider a null step along the search direction, that is α
                     
                        k
                     
                     =0.

The gradient projection-based algorithm is formally defined by Algorithm 4. We denote by

The global convergence of Algorithm 4 is stated in Proposition 4.
                           Proposition 4
                           
                              Let {x
                              
                                 k
                              } be the sequence generated by GP-IDA. Suppose that 
                              Assumptions 1 and 2 
                              are satisfied. Then {x
                              
                                 k

                              (1).

We will show that the search direction d

                               are such that Assumptions 3, 4 hold, so that the thesis follows from Proposition 1. Hence, we assume that there exists an infinite subset K such that

The decomposition method based on the Frank–Wolfe direction is described in Algorithm 5.


                        
                           
                              
                           
                        
                     

The global convergence of Algorithm 5 is established in Proposition 5.

                              Let {x

                              } be the sequence generated by FW-IDA. Suppose that 
                              Assumptions 1 and 2 
                              are satisfied. Then {x

We remark that global convergence results of inexact block coordinate descent methods (in the general case of nonconvex objective functions) based on Frank–Wolfe iterations were not known. A randomized block-coordinate variant of the classic Frank–Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization with block-separable constraints has been presented in [12], where convergence rates results in the duality gap have been established.

In this section we will show how a wide class of problems has a structure that allows restrictions on the factor sets which satisfy Assumption 1.

                      that most violates the optimality conditions, and the indexes corresponding to all the variables with inactive bounds. The presence of the maximal violating pair allows us to satisfy requirement (ii) of Assumption 1, while the inclusion of all the variables with inactive bounds is needed to ensure that also requirement (i) is satisfied. Now we will show that Assumption 1 holds on the restriction

Finally, we remark that there exist algorithms (see, e.g., [11,16]) that perform projections onto feasible sets of the form (40) in linear time. Then, the GP-IDA algorithm, described in Section 4, can be effectively applied to classes of problems whose feasible set has the structure considered in this section.

In this section we report the results obtained by the proposed inexact decomposition methods on network assignment problems, which is a class of convex large-scale optimization problems.

Network assignment problems are a widely studied subject in many research fields, as for instance transportation and data transmission. The aim of a network equilibrium model is to predict the link flows of a network whose arc costs depend on the origin/destination routes chosen by its users (travellers or data package). Denoting by L the number of Origin/Destination (OD) pairs, and by x the vector of path flows, under suitable assumptions (see, e.g., [1,7] for the technical details), network equilibrium model leads to an optimization problem of the form

The convex problem (48) has a very simple structure, as its feasible set 
                        
                           F
                        
                      is the Cartesian product of simplices. However, problem (48) can be considered a “virtual” formulation: indeed, in any real application it is not reasonable to completely enumerate, a priori, all the paths, since this would be too expensive. This motivates the need of introducing restrictions of the factor sets formally defined in the preceding section. More specifically, given the current feasible point x
                     
                        k
                     , for each h
                     ∈{1,…,
                     L}, the restricted set of variables contains the variables whose current value is strictly positive and the one corresponding to the cheaper path to the destination, that is, the variable

In the decomposition schemes of GP-IDA and FW-IDA we consider a number of block components equal to the number of origins, so that each given block component groups the variables of the OD pairs associated to the given origin. The line search parameters δ and γ have been set equal to the values 0.5 and 10−4 respectively. We have performed numerical experiments on the freely available data sets from the repository of Hillel Bar-Gera.

The performances of GP-IDA and FW-IDA have been compared with those of OBA (Origin-Based Assignment), a well established specialized algorithm for the Traffic Assignment Problem (see [1]), for which an executable is freely available.

                      Furthermore, in order to measure the computational improvements brought by the inexact decomposition, we implemented the GP-EDA algorithm, where the subproblems are solved exactly, and the GP algorithm, which represents the standard projected gradient algorithm without any decomposition.

All algorithms, except OBA, have been coded in C++ using the Boost Graph Library

                      implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for the shortest path computation, as well as the graph representation. All tests have been performed on a Intel Core i7 2.93gigahertz standard desktop machine with 3gigabytes of RAM. For each test problem and for each algorithm we report in Tables 2–5

The symbol * indicates that the algorithm was not able to satisfy the stopping criterion within 5×103
                     seconds for Winnipeg, 104
                     seconds for Barcelona and 2×104
                     seconds for Berlin Central and Chicago Sketch.

From the results reported in Tables 2–5, we can observe that GP-IDA algorithm is competitive with OBA code, and that the Frank–Wolfe based-method, as well-known, is poorly effective for the considered class of problems. We may note that the performances of GP-IDA are clearly better than those of OBA code on the biggest network considered, that is, Berlin Central network. For the other networks, OBA code outperforms GP-IDA when a relatively high accuracy (say a relative gap lower than 10−5) is required (the difference is particularly significant in the Chicago Sketch network). However, as pointed out in [5], in practical cases, requiring a relative gap lower than 10−4 does not change by any significant amount the link flow values of the solution. On the whole, as OBA code is highly specialized for the particular problem data and structure, the results of the numerical experiments point out the validity of the proposed inexact decomposition approach. We also notice that the results show the effectiveness of the inexact decomposition strategy compared with an exact decomposition method (GP-EDA) and with a method (GP) not using a decomposition technique.
