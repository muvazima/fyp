                  In this paper, we present a fully automatic Delaunay based sculpting algorithm for approximating the shape of a finite set of points 
                        S
                      in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . The algorithm generates a relaxed Gabriel graph (
                        R
                        G
                        G
                     ) that consists of most of the Gabriel edges and a few non-Gabriel edges induced by the Delaunay triangulation. Holes are characterized through a structural pattern called as body-arm formed by the Delaunay triangles in the void regions. 
                        R
                        G
                        G
                      is constructed through an iterative removal of Delaunay triangles subjected to circumcenter (of triangle) and topological regularity constraints in 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           n
                           log
                           n
                           )
                        
                      time using 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                      space.
                  We introduce the notion of directed boundary samples which characterizes the two dimensional objects based on the alignment of their boundaries in the cavities. Theoretically, we justify our algorithm by showing that under given sampling conditions, the boundary of 
                        R
                        G
                        G
                      captures the topological properties of objects having directed boundary samples. Unlike many other approaches, our algorithm does not require tuning of any external parameter to approximate the geometric shape of point set and hence human intervention is completely eliminated. Experimental evaluations of the proposed technique are done using

                      error norm measure, which is the symmetric difference between the boundaries of reconstructed shape and the original shape. We demonstrate the efficacy of our automatic shape reconstruction technique by showing several examples and experiments with varying point set densities and distributions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Given a finite set of points, 
                        S
                        ⊆
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , distributed across a known or unknown object, shape reconstruction deals with the construction of a polygon (could be with holes) that best captures the geometric shape of 
                        S
                      (Fig. 1
                     ). The problem finds various applications in computer graphics, computer vision, pattern recognition  [1], Geographical Information System  [2,3], study of physical objects like stars in astronomy  [4], molecular shape description in biology  [5], and target area monitoring in wireless sensor networks  [6].

There exist few challenges in approximating the shape of a point set. First, it is unclear what constitutes the best approximation for the geometric shape of a point set mainly due to a lack of precise mathematical definition for its optimal shape. Second, the point set shapes are highly subjective in nature and often depend on a specific application context or other human cognitive factors. As a consequence, the shapes perceived by humans for a majority of point sets vary and reaching a consensus on the optimum shape is an extremely difficult task. The rich variety of shapes available in the nature and the heterogeneity of point sets further weaken a well-defined formulation of the shape approximation problem  [7].

Delaunay based shape reconstruction approaches such as 
                        α
                     -shape  [8], 
                        A
                     -shape  [9] and 
                        χ
                     -shape  [10] depend on external parameters to construct the geometric shape of a point set. As a result, a family of shapes is generated for a given point set. For example, 
                        α
                     -shape family of a brain point set consists of a set of different but structurally close shapes for different values of 
                        α
                      as demonstrated in Fig. 2
                     . Though it gives the flexibility of choosing the best shape that suits an application, it has few limitations. For instance, choosing the best shape from a set of similar shapes demands a great deal of human involvement which might induce humanly errors thereby affecting the accuracy of the whole system or application. Moreover, since everyone is cognitively different from each other, reaching a consensus on the desired shape by different individuals becomes a challenging task. Considering these facts, it is often desirable to have an automatic algorithm that constructs the geometric shape of a point set.

In general, two approaches have been adopted to evaluate shape reconstruction results. In one approach, the results are experimentally evaluated against a known original shape with respect to certain error parameters. Error is estimated as the area of symmetric difference between the original shape and the reconstructed result  [10]. The evaluation of the results are made extensive and authentic by carrying out experiments like varying point density and homogeneity in point distribution. In another approach, algorithms are analyzed theoretically for geometric and topological guarantees on the output shape under some input sampling assumptions  [12]. We use both the approaches for evaluating the proposed shape reconstruction algorithm.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

A plethora of work has been proposed for geometric shape reconstruction from a planar point set. Though a full review of all the shape reconstruction algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper, we briefly mention some closely related methods based on Delaunay triangulation filtering and proximity graphs.

In a survey on shape reconstruction  [7], Edelsbrunner elaborates on how different shape reconstruction methods restrict the Delaunay triangulation to arrive at their respective shapes. The shape is represented by the underlying space of a sub complex obtained from the Delaunay triangulation using a corresponding filtering procedure. In 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     , 
                        α
                     -shape of a point set 
                        S
                      is generated by connecting the points 
                        p
                        ,
                        q
                        ∈
                        S
                     , which are touched by an empty disk of radius 
                        α
                        [8]. However, 
                        α
                     -shape construction requires an external parameter, 
                        α
                      and there exist some point sets for which the 
                        α
                     -shape family does not contain the appropriate shape  [9]. In another work  [13], Edelsbrunner described WRAP algorithm which is based on ideas from Morse theory applied to the flow maps derived from certain distance functions. A variant of WRAP algorithm, proposed by Ramos et al.  [14] provides geometric and topological guarantees on reconstructed surfaces within the 
                        ϵ
                     -sampling model. Though WRAP algorithm can be extended to any dimension, the commercially available software, Geomagic WRAP based on  [13], mainly focuses on three-dimensional surface reconstruction.

The family of 
                        A
                     -shapes proposed by Melkemi et al.  [9] contains 
                        α
                     -shapes and the crust  [12] as special cases. Determination of a proper 
                        A
                      in 
                        A
                     -shape computation is controlled by two parameters, 
                        α
                      and 
                        t
                     . The first parameter, 
                        α
                        ≥
                        0
                      controls the resolution and the second parameter, 
                        t
                        ∈
                        
                           [
                           0
                           ,
                           1
                           ]
                        
                     , interpolates between the un-weighted case and the case where points are weighted by the local density  [7].

A related notion for characterizing a point set distribution is characteristic shape (or 
                        χ
                     -shape)  [10]. 
                        χ
                     -shape algorithm removes external edges of Delaunay triangulation until the largest edge on the boundary is less than a threshold value. Termination and efficiency of the algorithm and the boundary of 
                        χ
                     -shape are dependent on the threshold value. Further, it generates only simply connected shapes (holes cannot be detected). Recently, variants of 
                        α
                     -shapes such as k-order 
                        α
                     -hulls  [15] and LDA-
                        α
                     -complex  [16] have been proposed for shape reconstruction. LDA-
                        α
                     -complex effectively uses the local density variation found in the point sets for detecting the hollow regions. Relaxing the constraint that the generated shape should possess a closed boundary, proximity graphs such as Relative neighborhood graph (RNG), Gabriel graph, Sphere-of-Influence graph  [17] and 
                        β
                     -skeletons  [18] play a vital role in defining the shape and structure of planar point sets  [19].

Methods such as crust, NN-crust and normalized mesh employ Delaunay triangulation along with a sampling criteria of the input curves or surfaces for providing guarantees on the reconstruction  [12,20,21]. All these algorithms are extended to 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     , and reconstructs surfaces from point sets with provable guarantees. A detailed description on these algorithms is available in  [21]. Recently, the authors  [22] proposed a Delaunay sculpting technique for reconstructing curves and surfaces from boundary samples and provide theoretical results on the bound of the sampling parameter 
                        ϵ
                     , for which a topologically correct reconstruction is guaranteed. As opposed to this, the proposed algorithm considers points distributed across the entire object as the input and also constructs internal hole boundaries for a wide range of point sets.

In this paper, we present an automatic algorithm for shape reconstruction from planar point sets which completely eliminates the hassles of human intervention. The proposed method constructs the boundaries for point sets sampled from both simply connected (objects without holes) and multiply connected objects (objects with holes). The novelty of our approach lies in judiciously using the information embedded in the geometry of the Delaunay triangles to avoid parametrization of the algorithm and thereby relieving the end user of the tedious task of tuning an external parameter. We use a combination of a local measure (circumcenter of Delaunay triangles) and a global measure (size of the Delaunay triangles quantified by the circumradius) for the filtration of the Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, our algorithm also constructs boundaries for a wide variety of holes based on the structural arrangements of the Delaunay triangles. To the best of our knowledge, the holes conceptualized as a set of acute Delaunay triangles surrounded by several sets of obtuse Delaunay triangles connected in a particular way is totally new in the arena of hole detection. The hole concept described in this paper effectively captures the low density regions (regions where the holes are most likely to exist) in a wide range of point sets. However, we lay no claim on the optimality of the reconstructed hole boundaries due to a lack of mathematical definition for a hole in the point sets.

In this section, we assume that the point set 
                           S
                         has been sampled from a polygonal object 
                           O
                         and we call 
                           S
                        , an object sample. All the subsequent terminology introduced are with respect to the original object 
                           O
                        . We characterize point sets based on a sampling condition and the boundary alignment of 
                           O
                        . Let

                           ∂

                         in each cavity are called cavity edges, and the edges of

                         in the cavities are called 
                           virtual edges
                        . Every cavity has exactly one virtual edge covering it (Fig. 4
                        (a)) and a polygonal object can have multiple cavities.

                        . In Definition 4, we considered only the boundary sample. Now we extend the definition to object samples with some additional sampling criteria. Sampling such as 
                           ϵ
                        -sampling  [12], defined in terms of the medial axis of the object, enables providing theoretical guarantees for curve or surface reconstruction. 
                           ϵ
                        -sampling to object samples seems to be inappropriate, as the points are distributed all over the object. So, we adopt a model similar to the one used in  [20] with few additional constraints (Definition 5).

In computational geometry, sculpting is the process of creating shapes through repeated elimination of triangles from an initial triangular mesh. The proposed algorithm is analogous to Boissonat’s sculpture  [26] method but uses a different sculpting strategy. As opposed to a selection criteria based on the maximum distance in sculpture, we use the combination of circumcenter and circumradius of Delaunay triangle to capture the structure of triangles and consequently the geometric proximity of input points.

In most of the cases, an exterior circumcenter (the circumcenter of a Delaunay triangle that lies outside the boundary of the triangulation) produces a wider angle at the vertex opposite to the boundary edge of the triangle, which in turn pushes the other two boundary vertices further away from each other and makes them non-neighbors on the boundary. In Fig. 5
                     , the triangle 
                        A
                      is removable as it is irrelevant with respect to the shape of the input points. Apart from the wider angle property, there are two factors that establish triangle 
                        A
                      as removable: First, its emptiness due to the circumcircle property of Delaunay triangulation and second, its existence in the proximity to the boundary. In our approach, we basically search for such irrelevant boundary Delaunay triangles and remove them to construct the geometric shape of the input points.


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

The main algorithm starts by constructing the Delaunay triangulation of the input point set 
                           S
                         and uses the filtration procedure along with a hole detection method to reach the final shape. Input to the filtration algorithm (Algorithm 1) is a regular simplicial complex,

                        . Then, the filtration algorithm proceeds by iteratively removing all thin boundary triangles,

                                    RGG
                                 
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         share a common edge as highlighted in blue color in Fig. 6
                        (b). If one triangle gets removed, the other one is retained in the intermediate 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    RGG
                                 
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         due to the regularity constraint. Consequently, the triangle, that is selected first is removed, while the other one is retained in the final shape. Hence, the final shape is completely dependent on the order in which the algorithm selects these triangles. In our approach, the triangles are selected for removal according to their circumradius. Deletable boundary thin triangle with the largest circumradius gets removed first. To accomplish this, we use a heap based priority queue as described in Algorithm 1. The reason for choosing circumradius as the selection criterion is that, when combined with the location of the circumcenter, circumradius effectively captures the geometric proximity of points.

Broadly, we classify the possible holes in a point set as fat and thin. A fat hole (Fig. 7
                        (b)) is more compact and consists of a set of fat triangles surrounded by thin triangles whereas a thin hole (Fig. 7(d)) is elongated, more like a tubular structure that consists of a series of thin and fat triangles. From our observation, for the fat holes, we could draw a common structure in terms of Delaunay triangles. For example, a closer look at the structure of Delaunay triangulation around the hole in the teapot (Fig. 8
                        (a)) shows a fat triangle surrounded by thin triangles. Similar structure of Delaunay triangulation can be observed around the hole region in other objects (Fig. 8(b) and (c)) as well. However, it is extremely difficult to characterize thin holes by a common Delaunay structure (see Fig. 7(d)). Hence, we account for fat holes in this paper and hereafter we use the term hole to refer to fat holes.

In our approach, we conceptualize a hole as a structure with a body surrounded by a set of arms. A body is a set of connected fat triangles and an arm is a set of connected thin triangles attached to a fat triangle in the body. Holes can be categorized based on the number of arms it possesses.

The hole detection part of the algorithm (Lines 3–15 of Algorithm 2), first creates a sorted list

                         are non-increasingly sorted based on their circumradius. Then, for each fat triangle 
                           △

                         is a member of any hole structure (body and arms) or not. This check is done based on the presence of a NULL value in

                         returned by BODY_CHECK() algorithm (described in Appendix 7). If NULL value is not present, then

                           B
                         (all fat triangles in 
                           B
                        ) is deleted from 
                           L
                        . Further, 
                           B
                         is also deleted from the

                         subjected to the REGULARITY property. Neighboring thin triangles of each deleted fat triangle are updated as boundary triangles. Further, it calls TRIANGLE_FILTER() algorithm which deletes all thin triangles present in the arms and completes the hole boundary construction.

Deletion of fat triangles in

                         ensures a linear time operation for the whole process of hole body identification and deletion (for loop of RGG_GENERATE() algorithm). Fig. 9(f)–(g) shows various stages of hole detection for teapot shape. Deleted body of the shape is shown in Fig. 11
                        (a) and (c) and its respective hole after deleting arms is shown in Fig. 11(b) and (d). RGG_GENERATE() algorithm incurs a time complexity of 
                           O

                           m
                        -arm holes, the boundary of the body represents a polygon (referred to as body polygon) having 
                           m
                         vertices and two adjacent arms are joined at one of the 
                           m
                         vertices of the body polygon (see Fig. 12
                        ). An end triangle of an arm is its member triangle which has two edges lying on the hole boundary. It is to be noted that an arm can have more than one end triangles. Except the end triangles, all other member triangles of an arm of a hole contribute only a single edge, referred to as a hole edge.

                           Without loss of generality, we consider a single fat hole,

                               sampling solely depends on its arms structure. An arm consisting of member triangles with the hole edges having a length of

                               satisfies the conditions 2 and 3 in Definition 5 along a sub portion of

                           A reverse argument of Lemma 4.2 holds good here due to the assumption that the object 
                                 O
                               contains only fat holes. This implies that body-arm structures are generated in the hole regions of 
                                 
                                    Del
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    S

                              . Consequently, RGG_GENERATE() constructs the hole boundaries for all the body-arm structures and hence the proof.

                                    RGG
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    S
                                    )
                                 
                               
                              contains an edge between every pair of adjacent samples of 
                              
                                 ∂
                                 O
                               
                              and 
                              
                                 
                                    RGG
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    S
                                    )
                                 
                               
                              is free of false positive holes.
                           

The proposed algorithm is implemented in C++ using computational geometry algorithms library (CGAL)  [11]. A user-friendly GUI that inherits the Delaunay triangulation GUI of the Triangulation_2 package  [11] has also been developed.

We analyzed the effectiveness of our shape approximation algorithm by testing on a variety of 2D point sets of different sampling densities and distributions. Since there does not exist a mathematical definition for what constitutes the optimal shape of a set of points, we use original shapes  [10] to compare the reconstructed results. Some of the test data are sampled from the images taken from AIM@SHAPE repository  [27]. For the experiments, we used semi-randomized and randomized point distributions which are generated with the help of 
                        χ
                     -shape software  [10]. In a semi-randomly distributed point set, each point is randomly positioned at a distance greater than a threshold distance from any other point. We experimented with different point sets belonging to different categories which consist of samples from both simply connected and multiply connected objects.


                        Fig. 13
                         shows the results obtained for various randomly distributed point (non-uniform) sets with low densities. Fig. 14
                         shows the results generated by our algorithm for highly dense and evenly distributed point sets sampled from different images. Figs. 13 and 14 reassure our claim that RGG_GENERATE() algorithm can be used to construct boundaries for a wide range of hole structures including multiple hole boundaries of arbitrarily different shapes and sizes, as well as symmetric holes like circle and square. Considering the fact that no optimal algorithm is known till date which account for all possible shapes available, our attempt for characterizing the hole boundaries in shape reconstruction is quite relevant.

In this section, we present a comparative study of our shape reconstruction algorithm with two other prominent shape reconstruction approaches. The first approach is 
                           α
                        -shape  [7] and the second one is 
                           χ
                        -shape  [10]. We would like to remark that, though 
                           α
                        -shape is perceived as the generalization of the convex hull and general theory about the shape of point sets, it has also been employed for shape reconstruction in  [28]. All the three approaches make use of Delaunay triangulation filtering for the shape characterization. While 
                           α
                        -shape and 
                           χ
                        -shape remove the edges of the Delaunay triangulation, our approach removes thin boundary triangles satisfying CIRCUMCENTER and REGULARITY properties mentioned in Section  4.1.


                        Fig. 15
                         illustrates a qualitative comparison of our algorithm with 
                           α
                        -shape and 
                           χ
                        -shape algorithms. At the end of this section, we also briefly compare our approach with two variants of 
                           α
                        -shape-conformal and LDA-
                           α
                        -shapes. We compare our method to the above mentioned approaches based on the following criteria.


                        External parameter and theoretical guarantee. Both 
                           α
                        -shape and 
                           χ
                        -shape are dependent on an external parameters (
                           α
                         for 
                           α
                        -shape and normalized length for 
                           χ
                        -shape) and hence generates a set of shapes for a given point set. It is extremely difficult to select the best 
                           α
                         (correspondingly, normalized length) for a non-uniform point set. Moreover, neither, 
                           α
                        -shape nor 
                           χ
                        -shape provides a theoretical guarantee on the reconstructed output. In contrast, our approach does not rely on any external parameter and hence generates only one shape for a given point set. Theoretically, it has been shown that, for point sets 
                           
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              ↑
                              )
                           
                        -samples, 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         captures a piece-wise linear approximation of the original object boundary (both internal and external boundaries).


                        Hole detection. 
                           α
                        -shape and our method detect holes in the point set whereas 
                           χ
                        -shape lacks this ability. Our method found to perform better than 
                           α
                        -shape for fat holes as illustrated in Fig. 16
                        (a)–(c) (also see A-shape point set of Fig. 15). However, as already mentioned in Section  4.2, 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         (Fig. 17
                        (b)) cannot detect the thin holes (such as Fig. 17(a)) whereas 
                           α
                        -shape detects the hole (Fig. 17(c)).


                        Noise and disconnected regions. All the three approaches include the noise as a part of the final shape, unless the point set is pre-processed for them. If the input point set consists of disconnected regions, only 
                           α
                        -shape has the ability to generate multiple regions for a well chosen value of 
                           α
                        . A preprocessing step  [10] such as employing a clustering algorithm like 
                           k
                        -means can be used in other approaches to cluster the point set first and then approximate the shape of each region.


                        Regularity. 
                           α
                        -shape can be irregular as it may contain bridges, dangling edges or junction points. 
                           χ
                        -shape and 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         are always regular as both the algorithms check for the regularity constraint before filtering the Delaunay triangulation.


                        Time complexity. All the three algorithms run in 
                           O
                           
                              (
                              n
                              log
                              n
                              )
                           
                         as 
                           
                              Del
                           
                           
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         computation takes 
                           O
                           
                              (
                              n
                              log
                              n
                              )
                           
                         time.

Since 
                           α
                        -shape relies on a global scale parameter, shape reconstruction based on 
                           α
                        -shape is successful only for uniform sampling  [29]. To cure this limitation, variants such as LDA-
                           α
                        -shape  [16] and conformal 
                           α
                        -shape  [29] have been proposed. These algorithms utilize the local density and geometric information available in the point set quantified by a maximally finite ball (LDA-
                           α
                        -ball) and local scale parameter (conformal 
                           α
                        -shape) for the filtration of Delaunay complex. LDA-
                           α
                        -complex requires high density sampling in the critical regions of the shape as the algorithm completely relies on the information of local density variation. As opposed to this, we use a criterion, which effectively combines a local measure (circumcenter of Delaunay triangles) and a global measure (removal based on circumradius of Delaunay triangles) to filter Delaunay complex. For detecting holes, we use the structural arrangements of Delaunay triangles and hence our approach does not rely on any external parameter. Conformal 
                           α
                        -shape uses a local scale parameter 
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 ̂
                              
                           
                         and also provide geometric and topological guarantees using 
                           ϵ
                        -sampling model. Hence it mainly focuses on curve and surface reconstruction. LDA-
                           α
                         shape uses a different sampling called as 
                           
                              (
                              ϵ
                              ,
                              δ
                              )
                           
                        -sample to provide theoretical guarantees. In our approach, we use a semi-random sampling called as 
                           
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              ↑
                              )
                           
                        -sample to establish that 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         of an object 
                           O
                         represents a piece-wise linear approximation of 
                           ∂
                           O
                        .

To validate our algorithm, we conducted experiments on point distributions of well defined shapes and computed to what extent 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                        s of these point sets conform to the respective original shapes. We used 
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 2

                         (used for the evaluation of 
                           χ
                        -shape algorithm in  [10]) for the performance evaluation of our shape reconstruction algorithm. It is defined as the area of the symmetric difference between the original shape

                         of zero implies that the two shapes are equal in area and also their boundaries are structurally alike. The units of the area in all the cases are square pixels.

We used randomly distributed points of Germany, Vietnam, F and K shapes for the point density experiment because they exhibit a range of sinuosity and non-convexities. For the Germany point set, it is apparent from Fig. 18
                         that all the three shapes tend to the original shape by capturing fine details of the boundary as the point set density increases.


                        Fig. 19
                         exhibits the variation in the accuracy of all the three shapes (
                           ∂

                           χ
                        -shape and 
                           α
                        -shape) with the varying point set densities as quantified by 
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           
                              error norm
                           
                        . From Fig. 19(a)–(b), it can be observed that as the point set density increases, accuracy of each shape also increases. Our algorithm performs relatively better as the point sets density increases for Germany and Vietnam shapes.

It is to be noted that, F and K shape boundaries do not possess different levels of sinuosity. Instead, they have non-convex regions on their boundaries. A direct proportionality relation between shape accuracy and point set density is not much evident from Fig. 19(c)–(d). For F-shape, 
                           χ
                        -shape and 
                           α
                        -shape algorithms show a better performance than the 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         (please refer Figs. 19(c) and 20
                        ). In addition to that, 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         results do not improve much for F shape (Fig. 19(c)). This is mainly due to the presence of obstructing triangles (either fat triangles or thin triangles whose characteristic edges are not on the boundary, triangles high lighted in red color in Fig. 20) in the upper non-convex portion of the F shape. RGG_GENERATE() (Algorithm 2) can never filter such triangles and the cavity remains undetected (please refer Fig. 20) irrespective of an increase in the point set density. The boundary of K shape never gave rise to obstructing Delaunay triangles and hence our algorithm generates a more accurate K shape compared to the other two algorithms (refer Fig. 19(d)).

To investigate the effects of point distribution on the shape reconstruction methods such as 
                           α
                        -shape, 
                           χ
                        -shape and the proposed algorithm, we conducted an experiment on the shape of the upper case letter K generated using sanserif font (Arial). We considered four different point distributions of letter K—a semi-randomly distributed points all over the shape (SR-semi-random), a semi-randomly distributed point set where points are concentrated in the interior of the shape (SRIB-semi-random internally biased), a semi-randomly distributed points where points are concentrated towards boundary (SRBB-semi-random boundary biased) and a randomly distributed point set (TR-truly random). We conducted experiment on all the three shape reconstruction algorithms (
                           α
                        -shape, 
                           χ
                        -shape and 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                        ) using an instance of each point distribution category. Fig. 21
                         illustrates the results generated by each algorithm for different distributions. From Fig. 21, it is evident that as the inhomogeneity in the point distribution increases, the deviation between the results by each algorithm and the original shape also increases. To be more precise, 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         (similarly, 
                           α
                        -shape and 
                           χ
                        -shape) of semi-random distribution is structurally closer to the original shape than the 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         of a truly random distribution. This was an expected behavior because a truly random distribution of points may lack several features and information of the original shape thereby making the reconstruction process extremely difficult.


                        Fig. 22
                         captures a more accurate and precise summary of the point distribution experiment as quantified by 
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           
                              error norm
                           
                        . We would like to point out that letter K is a representative shape for a wide variety of shapes having non-convexities on their boundary and hence we believe that, the experiment has the potential to capture the behavior of all the three algorithms on different distributions of such shapes. For SR distribution, all the three shape reconstruction algorithms construct boundaries structurally very close to the original boundary as indicated by the histograms in Fig. 22. When comparing results for SRBB and SRIB distributions, it can be observed that all the three algorithms perform better in the case of SRBB distribution. This is mainly due to the presence of more boundary points capable of defining the boundary of the shape in the case of SRBB.

For a TR distribution, 
                           α
                        -shape and 
                           χ
                        -shape performed better than 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         (Fig. 22). In particular, 
                           χ
                        -shape was found to be more tolerant to the random distribution than the other two. Further we noticed that randomly distributed points can have large gaps which may constitute undesired holes (or false positives) in the 
                           ∂
                           
                              RGG
                           
                         as shown in the last entry of the first row of Fig. 21. Some extremely random point distributions may possess void regions having Delaunay triangulation conforming to the body and arms structures and hence get detected by our algorithm. However, even for an extremely random point distribution carrying much less information about the geometry of the original shape (such as K in Fig. 21), our algorithm is able to generate a prototype structure representing the original shape. Further refinement schemes can be applied on this structure to generate a better quality approximation. From our experiments, we found that the chances of having such unwanted holes in semi-random distributions like the ones shown in the first three columns of Fig. 21 are very low.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have proposed an automatic shape reconstruction algorithm for planar point sets. Such a non-parametric algorithm is highly desirable as it relieves the end user of the tedious task of tuning an external parameter to construct the geometric shapes of point sets. The approach is more relevant when considering the fact that most of the established shape reconstruction techniques depend on external parameters to define the shapes but provide limited information on how to pick the right parameter to get an accurate shape.

The proposed algorithm is simple, easy to implement and handles object samples from simply and multiply connected objects. We summarize the key results of our empirical study on the proposed shape reconstruction approach.

                           Like many other shape reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm is also dependent on the homogeneity in the point distributions. It performs better for semi-random distributions than truly random distributions.

Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with

                              -shape show that this approach yields boundaries with reasonable accuracy. The quantitative analysis was carried out based on

It has been shown that, fat holes that have body and arms structure can be automatically detected. There is no restriction on the number of holes as well.

For genus deduction in three dimensions using the proposed approach, it requires a redesign and modification on the concept of hole and the corresponding algorithms. A direct extension may end up in detecting interior hollow regions such as the cavity inside a coconut shell. However, it is unclear at this point of time, where exactly such cavity detection is applied and hence one of the future work lies in this direction. Apart from this, we are also looking at exploring thin hole formations using Voronoi diagram.


                     
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

Here we describe the identification of potential bodies in a regular simplicial complex 
                        F

                     . To accomplish the task, we classify fat triangles in 
                        F
                        
                           (

                      based on the number of thin neighboring triangles as follows (Fig. 23
                     ):

                              -A fat triangle whose one edge is also the characteristic edge of a thin triangle and has two other fat triangles as neighbors.

                               and 1-
                                 
                                    thin neighbored

                               fat triangles.

The bodies in 
                        F
                        
                           (
                           S
                           )
                        
                      are identified using BODY_CHECK() procedure given in Algorithm 3. BODY_CHECK() receives a fat triangle, 
                        △
                        T
                      from the RGG_GENERATE() algorithm (Algorithm 2) and finds the body which consists of 
                        △
                        T
                     . The parameter 
                        
                           depth
                        
                      indicates the level of recursion and is set to 0 at the start. 
                        
                           Predecessor_id
                        
                      is the identifier of the predecessor triangle which called the current BODY_CHECK() in the execution hierarchy. Initially, it is set to 
                        −
                        1
                      as the fat triangle provided by the RGG_GENERATE() algorithm does not have any predecessor. The 
                        
                           Predecessor_id
                        
                      is used to avoid redundant recursive calls in the case of 1-
                        
                           thin neighbored
                        
                      triangles. 
                        
                           root_id
                        
                      is the identifier of the first fat triangle that initiated the BODY_CHECK() procedure and is used to eliminate non-hole structures of the form shown in Fig. 10(b). At any level of the recursion, if the fat triangle encountered is the one which initiated the body check procedure, it clearly indicates that some points are trapped inside the hole structure. Consequently, the algorithm invalidates such structures as body of any hole.

If 
                        △
                        T
                      is a 3-
                        
                           thin neighbored
                        
                      triangle, then it must be a body of a 3-arm type hole (Definition 6) and it is returned immediately from Algorithm 3 as 
                        B
                     . On the other hand, if 
                        △
                        T
                      is either 1-
                        
                           thin neighbored
                        
                      or 2-
                        
                           thin neighbored
                        
                     , it requires further check to confirm that 
                        △
                        T
                      is indeed a part of any body in the triangulation. We adopt a recursive strategy to confirm this and the recursion advances in the direction of neighboring fat triangles of 
                        △
                        T
                      updating the list of fat triangles encountered during the recursion. At any point of recursion, if a 0-
                        
                           thin neighbored
                        
                      triangle is found, it implies that the body definition has been violated and hence the triangle along with a NULL value is returned.
