               Abstract
               
                  In this paper, we present boosted SVM dedicated to solve imbalanced data problems. Proposed solution combines the benefits of using ensemble classifiers for uneven data together with cost-sensitive support vectors machines. Further, we present oracle-based approach for extracting decision rules from the boosted SVM. In the next step we examine the quality of the proposed method by comparing the performance with other algorithms which deal with imbalanced data. Finally, boosted SVM is used for medical application of predicting post-operative life expectancy in the lung cancer patients.
