                  Proposed here is an evaluation of multiple muscle loads and a procedure for determining optimum solutions to ergonomic design problems. The simultaneous muscle load evaluation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and optimum solutions are obtained for each participant. In addition, one optimum solution for all participants, which is defined as the compromise solution, is also obtained. Moreover, the proposed method provides both objective and subjective information to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method was applied to the problem of designing the handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement. The height and distance of the handrails were the design variables, and surface electromyograms of four muscles were measured. The optimization results suggest that the proposed evaluation represents the impressions of participants more completely than an independent use of muscle loads. In addition, the compromise solution is determined, and the benefits of the proposed method are examined.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since the marketplaces of many products have reached maturity, decisions taken by consumers while they are purchasing products are affected by key factors such as product usability and design novelty in addition to rudimentary factors such as functionality, performance, and economy. Therefore, it is increasingly important for manufacturers to design products that provide comfort and satisfaction to consumers in addition to the rudimentary benefits (Jordan, 1998). Ergonomics or human factor methodologies are applied to product design in order to consider the satisfaction levels of consumers (Hägg, 2003). Bioinstrumentation measurements such as the electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) are employed in ergonomic design to evaluate the usability of products quantitatively (Chaffin et al., 1999; Tsang and Vidulich, 2006). Among these, the surface EMG is frequently used for evaluating physical stress and fatigue because of the noninvasive nature and ease of its measurement (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992). In general, surface EMGs of multiple muscles are measured when product usability and work fatigue are evaluated; however, often each surface EMG is evaluated independently.

For example, Kothiyal and Kayis (2001) measured surface EMGs of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, and middle deltoid when moving weights, so as to determine the effects of varying load magnitude and work rate on the muscular load in seated manual handling tasks performed with one hand. They concluded that each muscle load was dependent on the direction of movement and that it was difficult to identify the preferred movement direction for all muscles. Herring and Hallbeck (2007) measured the flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and posterior deltoid when pushing or pulling a shift lever, in order to determine the best location for the shift lever in a pushing and pulling task such as operating a manual transmission. From the results of measurements for pulling trials, a trade-off was found between the activity of the posterior deltoid and flexor digitorum profundus. These studies did not investigate a method for simultaneously evaluating multiple muscle loads.


                     Eksioglu (2004) used the sum of multiple muscle loads as the indicator of comprehensive muscle load so as to determine the optimum grip span for a power grip exertion. However, it is possible that a particular muscle load dominates perceived total discomfort (hereafter referred to as the human satisfaction, or simply the satisfaction). In addition, the muscle load which dominates the satisfaction may be different for each consumer. Also, the weighted sum with different amplitude of weight may affect the satisfaction. Therefore, the sum of multiple muscle loads may not always represent human satisfaction with muscle loads; thus it might not be suitable in the comprehensive evaluation of muscle loads. Ben-Gal and Bukchin (2002) and Nussbaum et al. (2009) combined multiple objectives (i.e., economic measures and ergonomic measures) into one objective. However, in these studies, multiple objectives were combined arbitrarily. Objective functions have been applied to estimate muscle loads with biomechanical models because an excessive number of muscles exists in relation to the mechanical degrees of freedom at the joints (Alexander, 2003; Erdemir et al., 2007; Herzog, 1996; Prilutsky and Zatsiorsky, 2002). The two common criteria are minimization of the sum of squared muscle-force divided by maximum muscle-force (Pedotti et al., 1978) or minimization of the sum of cubed muscle-force divided by cross-sectional muscle-area (Crowninshield and Brand, 1981). These objective functions are defined for evaluating the strategy of a muscle activity, not for assessing the comfort of a human motion. Therefore, the objective functions already proposed for estimating muscle force are perhaps not appropriate for direct application to evaluating the burden that users feel.

In previous studies (Chihara and Seo, 2011; Chihara et al., 2011), we proposed a simultaneous evaluation method for multiple muscle loads by applying the methodology of multi-objective optimization. Multiple muscle loads were defined as objective functions that should be minimized, and the simultaneous muscle load evaluation of each consumer was formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). That is, the MOOPs were formulated for each consumer. The each consumer's MOOP was solved and the optimum solution for each consumer was obtained. In general, optimum solutions for consumers do not correspond with each other; but we need to determine the only one design variable vector. We, therefore, introduced the concept of “regret” (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret is defined as the difference from the optimum function value of the optimum solution. Hence, if design variable vector corresponds to the optimum solution, the regret equals to zero; and the more the distance from design variable vector to the optimum solution increases, the more the regret increases. Obviously the regrets of consumers do not always correspond to zero when the one design variable vector is determined for all consumers. Then, the design problem to determine one optimum solution for all consumers (hereafter referred to as the compromise solution) was formulated as the minimization of the maximum regret of consumers. The min–max problem indicates that the optimization of the problem makes objective function values for all consumers as close as possible to the objective function value of their each optimum solution.

However, in previous studies, we considered only the muscle loads and did not confirm the degree of subjective satisfaction. That is, the relationship between the objective muscle loads and the subjective satisfaction levels was not clear. Thus, it is essential to develop the proposed method to evaluate the relationship between muscle loads and satisfaction levels. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to reveal the relationship between objective muscle load and subjective satisfaction levels. In this study, we derive an evaluation function of subjective satisfaction and evaluate the satisfaction levels of participants. The proposed method will provide designers both subjective and objective information for ergonomic design problem, and help the decision making of designers. Design of a handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement is undertaken as the case study and confirms the benefits of the proposed method.

First, multiple objective indicators are measured while participants use a product or perform a task. Next, the response surfaces are predicted for objective indicators that are significantly changed by design variable changes. In addition, the consistency between objective indicators and subjective satisfaction levels is evaluated, and the response surface of satisfaction scores is predicted as the satisfaction level function. Then, the simultaneous evaluation of objective indicators for each participant is formulated as a MOOP, and the optimum design solution for each participant is obtained. Finally, a compromise solution for all participants is obtained by considering the regrets of participants. Moreover, the satisfaction level at the obtained compromise solution is also calculated to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method will be described in greater detail in the following subsections. In addition, the muscle load is taken as the example of the objective indicator in the following description, because muscle load (or, EMG) is used in the application.

                         (i = 1, 2, …, nDES), which are unknown parameter to decide the design, are selected that possibly affect either the usability of an intended product or the work load of an intended task. It is noted that usability is defined as “the extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (ISO 9241-11, 1998). In other words, usability is the ease of use of a product; thus, physical effort is one of components that affect usability. Here, nDES represents the number of design variables. Then, multiple levels are set for each design variable. In addition, multiple muscles are selected that might contract while using the product or performing the task. The EMGs of the selected muscles are measured under all experimental conditions. Moreover, the subjective satisfaction scores for each condition are collected.

Among the measured EMGs, those that exhibit significant changes in response to design variable changes are selected. Here, nEMG represents the number of selected EMGs. The response surfaces of the selected EMGs are approximated as follows:

                           j,k
                         represents the response surface predicted by the radial basis function network (RBFN) (Orr, 1996). The RBFN performs well in terms of accuracy and robustness, irrespective of the degree of nonlinearity. Additionally, it is robust against experimental errors or noise (Jin et al., 2001). Thus, we consider the RBFN to be a dependable method for approximating the EMGs because the degree of nonlinearity in the EMGs is difficult to predict, and measured EMGs unavoidably contain experimental errors and noise. In this study, the parameters proposed for the RBFN by Kitayama and Yamazaki (2011) are adopted.

The response surface of the subjective evaluation scores on the total muscle load is approximated as the satisfaction level function. However, it is possible that the subjective and objective evaluation conflict each other. That is, the trend of objective muscle load and that of subjective evaluation do not correspond with each other. There are two possibilities when the objective and subjective evaluation are in conflict. One is that the participants fail to properly assess their physical effort (i.e., muscle load in this paper); and the other case is that the participant's subjective evaluation is affected by unexpected physical effort. We can eliminate the participant if it is the former case; and also eliminate if the number of participants who have discrepancy is vanishingly low. However, we need to reselect the objective indicator (or EMGs) if most of participants are affected by unexpected physical effort. Therefore, the number of participants that have discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation may be regarded as the indicator for the adequacy of selected EMGs. Thus, the consistency of muscle loads and satisfaction scores are evaluated. First, the muscle loads dominance relation of experimental conditions is evaluated. Next, the consistency index described below is calculated on the basis of the muscle loads dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. We assume that there is no discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. When the number of participants who fail to properly assess their sensation is relatively low, they are eliminated. That is, the consistency index is calculated and participants who have discrepancy are eliminated, so as to enhance the reliability of measured data on the assumption that both the subjective and objective evaluations are correct when they correspond. The satisfaction level function is approximated for each selected participants.

To judge the relationship of solutions in a MOOP, the concept of domination is used (Deb, 2001). The solution A is said to dominate the other solution B, if the solution A is no worse than solution B in all objectives and is strictly better than solution B in at least one objective. Let us consider a two-objective optimization problem with three different solutions shown in Fig. 1
                        . Both objective functions need to be minimized. In Fig. 1, if solutions A and B are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution B in both objective functions. Thus, solution A dominates solution B. In addition, if solutions A and C are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution C in the first objective function; conversely, solution A is worse than solution C in the second objective function. Hence, solutions A and C do not dominate each other.

In this study, the consistency between objective and subjective evaluation is determined with comparing the muscle loads dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. Let us assume that the higher satisfaction score means better condition. Compared with solutions A and B in Fig. 1, there is no discrepancy between objective and subjective evaluation if the satisfaction score of solution A is larger than that of solution B. In addition, the objective and subjective evaluation conflict with each other if the satisfaction score of solution A is smaller than or equal to that of solution B. Compared with solutions A and C, it is difficult to determine the consistency whatever the order of the satisfaction scores of solutions A and C. This is because there is no dominance relation between solution A and C. The smaller the number of conditions that the muscle loads dominance relation and satisfaction scores conflict with each other, the objective and subjective evaluation are more consistent with each other. Therefore, the consistency index on k-th participant is defined as follows:

We assume that there is negligible discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. Then, the satisfaction level functions are approximated as follows:

                         represents response the surface of the satisfaction level function predicted by the RBFN. The critical value of consistency index should be determined in advance. However, there is no guideline to determine the critical value. Therefore, in this study, the critical value is determined by considering the relationship between the consistency index and the validity of the optimum solutions for participants.

The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is formulated as a MOOP on the assumption that lower EMG values mean better comfort or usability for consumers. The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads for the k-th participant is expressed in the following equations:

In general, no single design variable vector exists that optimizes all objective functions simultaneously, so the objective functions are at least partly in conflict. Hence, the solution of the MOOP is a Pareto optimal set, which is a set of design variable vectors that cannot be improved upon for all objective functions simultaneously, that is, a Pareto optimal set consists of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, a satisficing trade-off method (STOM) (Nakayama and Sawaragi, 1984) is used to select a Pareto optimal solution that is suited to user satisfaction. Fig. 2
                         shows a conceptual diagram of the STOM. Here, the point minimizing each of the objective functions is called the ideal point f
                        
                           I
                        , and the objective function vector that is satisfactory or desirable to the decision maker is called the aspiration level f
                        
                           A
                        . In addition, the ideal point can be provided by a decision maker. As shown in Fig. 2, the STOM obtains the Pareto optimal solution that is closest to the ideal point from the specified aspiration level. The Pareto optimal solution obtained by the STOM is hereafter referred to as the preferred solution. The aspiration level should be prescribed when solving the MOOP by means of the STOM. In this study, the objective function vector associated with the aspiration level is that of the optimum solution of the satisfaction level function of the participant. The preferred solution for the k-th participant is denoted by

                         (i = 1, 2, …, nDES) and the preferred point 
                           
                              
                                 f

                                    ,

                         (j = 1, 2, …, nEMG) is defined as the objective function values of the preferred solution.

If the preferred solutions for the participants correspond with each other, the preferred solutions may be taken as the compromise solution for all participants. Unfortunately, the preferred solutions for the participants usually do not entirely correspond with each other. In this study, the compromise solution determined for all participants is based on the concept of compromise (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret defined in Section 1 is expressed as 
                           
                              
                                 f

                                    ,
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                              −
                              
                                 f
                                 
                                    j
                                    ,
                                    k
                                 
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        . Then, the design variable vector that minimizes the maximum regret among m participants is defined as the compromise solution 
                           x
                        
                        
                           c,m
                         for m participants. Here, the compromise solution is obtained by solving a min–max problem.

The optimization problem for calculating the compromise solution 
                           x

                        Eq. (7) is a problem that minimizes the maximum regret among the m participants. In other words, the min–max problem implies that the muscle loads of all participants are moved as close as possible to the preferred solution for each participant. It is difficult to solve Eq. (7) directly, so the following equivalent problem in terms of the auxiliary variable z is formulated in order to obtain the compromise solution:

The maximum regret may decrease with the intended number of participants. Therefore, the relationship between the amplitude of the maximum regret and the number of divided subgroups of participants is presented to support the decision making of designers. The participants are divided into some groups by means of the cluster analysis (Miller and Miller, 2010) of their preferred solutions, and then the compromise solutions are obtained for each divided subgroup.

The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is performed throughout the day at the rate of about 3 per hour (Dall and Kerr, 2010). Studies of the STS movement from a chair have been performed by many researchers (Alexander et al., 1991; Arborelius et al., 1992; Burdett et al., 1985; Janssen et al., 2002; Kerr et al., 1991; Rodosky et al., 1989; Schenkman et al., 1996; Su et al., 1998). Providing handrails is one recipe for making the STS movement easy. Several reports on the position of handrails for the STS movement can be found. These reports were mainly based on subjective evaluations by participants (Dekker et al., 2007) or the burden on the lower limbs only (Tanaka et al., 2009). However, the STS movement with handrails should ideally be evaluated on the basis of the comprehensive burden on both the upper and lower limbs. Therefore, the proposed method for simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is applied to the STS movement, and we consider whether or not the proposed method can provide quantitative information on ergonomic design problems and support the decision making of designers.

@&#METHODS@&#

Eight healthy Japanese male participants, aged between 21 and 24, were recruited for this study. In this study, only young male consented to participate. The aim of this study is to propose the simultaneous muscle load evaluation method, not to investigate subject characteristics such as gender. Therefore, the experiment was performed with a homogenous subject sample (i.e., young male) so as to simplify the evaluation of proposed method. None of the participants had a musculoskeletal disorder. Their mean (SD) height and body mass were 1754 (65.1) mm and 65.1 (4.62) kg. Two handrails were set horizontally at either side of the participants. The height h and distance d of the handrails were 100, 200, or 300 mm and 400, 600, or 800 mm, respectively (see Fig. 3
                        ). Thus, the number of experimental conditions was nine (three heights × three distances). These dimensions are based on the Japanese Industrial Standards (1994). In addition, the handrails chosen had a diameter of 32 mm, based on the architectural standards of the Japanese Ministry of Land (2007). The seat of the chair was set at the tibial height of each participant in order to remove the effect of chair height from the muscle loads. The mean (SD) tibial height was 459 (29.1) mm. All participants were required to sit and bend their knee joints at right angles, as shown in Fig. 3, but they stood up at their own pace.

The target muscles were the anterior deltoid, triceps brachii, rectus femoris, and tibialis anterior. The attachment positions of the surface electrodes for each target muscle as follows: electrodes were placed on approximately 4 cm below the clavicle for anterior deltoid, approximately half of the distance between the acromion and the olecranon for triceps brachii, approximately half the distance between the knee and the iliac spine for rectus femoris, and approximately one-quarter to one-third the distance between the knee and the ankle for tibialis anterior (Cram et al., 2008). The EMGs of the four muscles of the dominant-hand side were measured on the assumption that the STS movement is symmetric across the sagittal plane. The experiment was repeated three times for each condition, with a 5-min break taken between each trial. The mean value of the three trials was used as the representative value for each handrail position. In addition, the measuring sequence was randomized to minimize confounding related to the order of exposure. During the breaks, the satisfaction scores of each handrail position were collected on a scale from 1 to 7 (Very difficult: 1, Difficult: 2, Slightly difficult: 3, Indifferent: 4, Slightly easy: 5. Easy: 6, Very easy: 7).

The EMGs were measured by pairs of surface electrodes (Vitrode F and Vitrode D, Nihon Kohden Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The EMG signals were high pass filtered for noise rejection, rectified and filtered (low-pass, 2 Hz). In addition, the processed EMGs were normalized relative to the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The MVCs were obtained for each muscle using manual resistance. The isometric contractions lasted 5–6 s. In this study, the maximum value of %MVC during the STS movement was evaluated as the indicator of muscle load. A two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted in order to examine the effects of the two design variables (i.e., the height and distance of handrails) on the EMGs of four target muscles at 5% significant level. The ANOVA was performed for each of four muscles.

This experiment was approved by the Research Safety and Ethics Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan University.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the mean values of the EMGs for each target muscle of the participants. In addition, Fig. 5
                         shows the mean values of the ease of the STS movement, based on the subjective evaluations by the participants. From Fig. 4(a), the %MVC of the anterior deltoid, which is one muscle of the upper limbs, is not affected by the handrail position. Conversely, from Fig. 4(b), the higher and closer the handrail position, the higher the %MVC of the triceps brachii. The %MVC of the rectus femoris is not affected by the handrail position, but that of the tibialis anterior is affected [see Fig. 4(c) and (d)].

The %MVC results for the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior exhibit significant differences with changes in both the height and distance of the handrails. In addition, those of the anterior deltoid and rectus femoris exhibit significant differences with changes in either of the two conditions (the distance and the height affect the anterior deltoid and the rectus femoris, respectively). Hence, we focus on the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior and construct the response surface of the two EMGs in order to simplify the evaluation of muscle loads for the STS movement. Comparison between the %MVC plots for the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior indicates that the lower and the farther the handrail position, the lower the muscle load of the triceps brachii, but the higher the muscle load of the tibialis anterior. Fig. 5 shows that a handrail distance of 600 mm provides a higher degree of standing ease than the other two distances (i.e., d = 400 and 800 mm). In particular, the handrail position with (h, d) = (200, 600) and (300, 600) had the highest mean value for the subjective evaluation score.

The consistency indexes of the participants are calculated as listed in Table 1
                         on the basis of the procedure described in Section 2.4. The mean consistency index reaches 0.840. It is found that the consistency index of participant F is especially low in the eight participants. The satisfaction scores of each participant are approximated as the satisfaction level functions. The satisfaction level functions were solved by the particle swarm optimization (Venter and Sobieski, 2003) included in the general purpose optimization software VisualDOC (Vanderplaats Research & Development, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Table 1 lists the optimum solutions of the evaluation functions of satisfaction level for each participant.

The %MVC of the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior are approximated by functions of the height and distance of the handrails, using the RBFN. Then, the simultaneous muscle load evaluation for the STS movement is formulated as a MOOP, which is given in the following equations (in mm):

                        where f
                        1 and f
                        2 are the predicted response surfaces of the %MVC of the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior. Eq. (14) is composed for each participant and is solved by the STOM.

The objective function values of the optimum solution listed in Table 1 are applied to the aspiration level of each participant. In addition, the point at which the %MVCs are equal to zero is set as the ideal point, irrespective of participants. The MOOPs were solved by the particle swarm optimization (Venter and Sobieski, 2003).


                        Table 2
                         lists the preferred solutions for each participant. It was found that the mean preferred height and distance for the handrails was 238 mm and 575 mm, respectively. However, the preferred heights and distances of the participants have a wide distribution that corresponds to the range of boundary conditions of the design variables described in Eq. (15).

The more the handrail position deviates from the preferred solution, the more difficult the participants may find the STS movement, on the assumption that the preferred solution is the best condition for the STS movement. Therefore, the distance from the preferred solution in the objective space (hereafter referred to as the distance from preferred solution) is adopted as the indicator of muscle load to validate the proposed method. Table 3
                         shows the correlation coefficient between the indicators of muscle load (i.e., the %MVC of the triceps brachii f
                        1, that of the tibialis anterior f
                        2, and the sum of the two %MVC f
                        1 + f
                        2 as well as the distance from the preferred solution) and the subjective satisfaction score. A negative correlation coefficient implies a reasonable connection between the muscle load indicator and the subjective evaluation; because the smaller the muscle load, the higher the subjective satisfaction score. The numbers of significant negative correlation coefficients for f
                        1, f
                        2, f
                        1 + f
                        2, and the distance from preferred solution are 1, 3, 2, and 7, respectively. The number of negative and significant correlation coefficients for the distance from preferred solution is the highest, followed by the %MVC of the tibialis anterior and that of the triceps brachii.


                        Fig. 6
                         shows the relationship between the consistency index and the correlation coefficient for the distance from preferred solution. From Fig. 6, it is found that participant F has the lowest consistency index and insignificant correlation coefficient. Conversely, the participants except participant F have significant correlation coefficient, and their consistency indexes exceed 0.8. Thus, 0.8 is set for the critical value of consistency index, and participant F is eliminated from the participants.


                        Table 4
                         lists the satisfaction level for the 7 participants except participant F. It is found that the mean satisfaction level reaches approximately 6.0, and the satisfaction level implies “easy to stand”. In addition, the cluster analysis was performed for the preferred solutions so as to divide the participants into subgroups. The participants are divided into two and three subgroups as shown in Fig. 7
                        
                     

The compromise solutions are determined for each subgroup shown in Fig. 7 on the basis of the procedure described in Section 2.5. The results of calculating the compromise solutions are listed in Table 5
                        .

From Table 5, it is found that the maximum regret decreases with increase in the number of subgroups. In addition, the maximum regret is improved about 4.5 %MVC by increasing the number of subgroups from one to three (7.86 %MVC for one group versus 3.32 %MVC for three subgroups). The mean satisfaction level of seven participants is also slightly improved by about 0.2 with increase in the number of subgroups.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The %MVC of the anterior deltoid is not affected by the handrails position, while that of the triceps brachii is affected. This may be explained by the fact that the STS movement with handrails involved a narrow range of forward shoulder flexion, thus the flexion range hardly changed when the handrail position changed. The higher and closer the handrail position, the more inflected the elbow joint; therefore, the range of elbow extension becomes wide and makes the %MVC high in the STS movement. Regarding the lower limb, the %MVC of the rectus femoris is not affected by the handrail position, but that of the tibialis anterior is affected. Yamada et al. (2004) reported that the rectus femoris may serve mainly to transfer the center of mass upward and the tibialis anterior may serve mainly to maintain balance. The seat height in this study was constant for each participant, so the muscle load in transferring the body mass would be almost constant as well. Thus, a significant difference in the %MVC of the rectus femoris was not found with the change of handrail position.


                        Fig. 4(b) and (d) indicates that there is a trade-off between the muscle loads of the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior. The body balance may be maintained by the tibialis anterior when the handrails are located relatively far and low. In contrast, higher and closer handrail positions may increase the use of the tibialis anterior and reduce the muscle load of the triceps brachii. We conclude that the muscles of both the upper and lower limbs (i.e., the triceps brachii and the tibialis anterior) should be considered when the burden of the STS movement is evaluated, not just either of the two muscles. This is because there is a trade-off between the muscle loads of the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior, so the optimum handrail position is not determined solely on the basis of either of the two EMGs. In addition, the trend of the subjective evaluations does not correspond to that of the %MVC of both the muscles. This is consistent with the premise that the two muscles should be evaluated simultaneously.

According to Table 3, the number of positive correlation coefficients is larger in the case of the muscle load of the triceps brachii, but the number of negative correlation coefficients is larger in the case of the tibialis anterior. This may be explained by the fact that the muscle load of the tibialis anterior for maintaining body balance is dispersed to the triceps brachii with increasing dependence on handrails. That is, the load of the tibialis anterior decreases and its correlation coefficient becomes negative with increasing dependence on handrails, but that of the triceps brachii increases and its correlation coefficient becomes positive. In addition, among the four indicators of muscle load, the distance from preferred solution has the highest number of significant negative correlation coefficients. The ease of the STS movement may be improved by dispersing the load of the tibialis anterior to the triceps brachii; however, the excess dispersing of load to the triceps brachii reduces the ease of the STS movement. Hence, perhaps the simultaneous evaluation of the two muscle loads proposed in this paper represents the impressions of the participants more completely than the %MVC of the triceps brachii and tibialis anterior does.


                        Fig. 6 shows that participant F has the lowest consistency index and insignificant correlation coefficient. Therefore, the muscle loads and the subjective evaluation of participant F do not correspond with each other, and the participant may be an exceptional individual compared with the other participants. In addition, only one of eight participant has the discrepancy, thus the selected two EMGs may be adequate as the indicator of muscle load for the STS movement.

For the calculated results of the preferred solutions, the mean preferred solution of seven participants except participant F is (h, d) = (241, 543). However, it is found that the preferred solutions of each participant are distributed, with the range corresponding to the boundary conditions of the design variables (see Table 4). Therefore, the mean value among the participants may not be reasonable as the compromise solution for all participants. This may agree with the recommendation in this study that the compromise solution for multiple participants should be determined by quantifying the degree of compromise for each participant.

The mean preferred solution is (h, d) = (241, 543), while the compromise solution for one group is (h, d) = (296, 730). This is because, the proposed method minimizes the regret for each participant. The regret of few participants may drastically increase if the mean preferred solution is selected as the optimum for all participants. The compromise solution is relatively higher and farther than the mean preferred solution; hence, the participants who prefer the higher and farther position may have relatively high sensitivity for the %MVC.

From the results of calculating the compromise solutions, it is found that the maximum regret decreases with increase in the number of subgroups. Therefore, the muscle loads of the intended participants are moved as close as possible to the preferred solution for each participant by increasing the number of subgroups. However, the satisfaction level is hardly improved when increasing the number of subgroups. Therefore, the reduction of muscle load due to the increase of subgroups, which is approximately 4.5 %MVC, may not affect significant influence on their subjective satisfaction levels. Moreover, the minimum satisfaction level of 7 participants is not below 4.0 (indifferent) when the number of subgroups equals to one. That is, no participant feels difficult to stand when the handrails position is determined without dividing the participants into some subgroups. Thus, we conclude that the compromise solution for one group (h = 296 mm and d = 730 mm) is the compromise solution for this participants.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, we have proposed a simultaneous evaluation method for multiple muscle loads by applying the methodology of multi-objective optimization. We also proposed a calculation procedure to provide both objective and subjective information (i.e., the muscle loads and the satisfaction levels) so as to support decision making for ergonomic design problems. We have applied the proposed method to the design problem of handrail position for easy STS movement. The muscle load of the STS movement was formulated as a MOOP, and it was found that the simultaneous evaluation method proposed in this paper represents the impressions of the participants more completely than an independent use of muscle loads. In addition, from the calculated results of the compromise solutions, we have quantitatively detected that the compromise solutions and the regret were greatly influenced by the number of subgroups. However, we have concluded that there was no need to divide the participants into some subgroups and the compromise solution was (h, d) = (296, 730). This is because no participant feels difficult to stand with the handrail position of the compromise solution even though the maximum regret reaches approximately 4.5 %MVC. If the satisfaction level functions are not detected, it may be difficult to judge whether 4.5 %MVC is serious muscle load or not. The proposed method can provide both objective muscle loads and subjective satisfaction levels, so the method may be a great help to designers. It should be noted that the obtained compromise solution is only for these participants.

In this way, the proposed method can provide quantitative information on ergonomic design problems that are dominated by muscle loads, and may support the decision making of designers. In addition, the proposed method can be applied to other products for which the usability is determined on the basis of muscle loads. Of course, it may also be applied to the evaluation of tasks or work. Moreover, the proposed method may have potential to be applied for more general evaluation of usability, not only for the muscle load. In this study, 0.8 is set for the critical value of consistency index on the basis of the relationship to the validity of the preferred solutions. It should be noted that the critical value of consistency index is only for these participants. The versatile critical value of consistency index might have to be empirically determined by increasing the examples of the application of proposed method. As well as EMG, other bioinstrumentations such as EEG and ECG are applied to ergonomic design problems. Therefore, as the next step of this study, the proposed method should be developed to deal not only with EMG, but also with other bioinstrumentations.
