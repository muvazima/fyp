                  PROMETHEE methods are widely used in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) to deal with real world decision making problems. In this paper, we propose to apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) to the family of PROMETHEE methods in order to explore the whole set of parameters compatible with some preference information provided by the Decision Maker (DM). The application of the presented methodology is described in a didactic example.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

PROMETHEE is a well-known family of Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methods (see Figueira et al., 2005a for a collection of surveys on MCDA and Brans & Mareschal, 2005; Brans, Mareschal, & Vincke, 1984 for a survey on PROMETHEE methods) that deals with several types of real world problems (Behzadian, Kazemzadeh, Albadvi, & Aghdasi, 2010).

In order to apply these methods, the Decision Maker (DM) has to provide some preference information on the parameters involved (preference function shape, weights of criteria and thresholds). This type of preference information can be given directly or indirectly. The DM gives direct preference information when she provides directly all values of the parameters present in the model. The DM supplies indirect preference information when she provides some preferences between alternatives from which compatible preference parameters can be inferred. The indirect preference information requires less cognitive effort from the DM and, for this reason, it is widely used in outranking methods (see for example Dias & Mousseau, 2006; Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2011; Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012; Mousseau & Słowiński, 1998; Mousseau, Słowiński, & Zielniewicz, 2000).

Recommendations provided by PROMETHEE methods are dependent on the values given to the considered parameters; in fact, generally, different sets of parameters lead to different comparisons between the alternatives. For this reason, many methods have been proposed in literature to elicit sets of parameters compatible with some preference information provided by the DM or to get values of the parameters leading to an alternative to occupy the first position(s) in the ranking. Only some of these contributions are cited in the following.

Taking into consideration an MCDA additive method, and therefore obtaining a ranking of the considered alternatives, Mareschal (1988) carries out a sensitivity analysis in order to obtain stability intervals for the criteria weights so that the method provides the same ranking for any combination of the weights inside the said intervals. Sun and Han (2010) solve a linear programming problem to find the most discriminant set of weights compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. Wolters and Mareschal (1995) propose a method to study how the ranking of the alternatives is sensitive to the changes on the weights and to the evaluations of the alternatives, and which modifications on the importance weights are necessary to make a certain alternative the best one. Eppe and De Smet (2012) study the weights that best represent the preferences of the DM and the type of structural information which gives the ranking closest to the ranking provided by the DM. Eppe, De Smet, and Stutzle (2011) use a meta-heuristic in order to induce parameters for the PROMETHEE II model starting from some preference information provided by the DM.

If the DM decides to give indirect preferences, Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) (Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008; see also Greco, Słowiński, Figueira, & Mousseau, 2010 for a survey on ROR) can be applied to explore the whole space of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. ROR is a family of MCDA methods that simultaneously takes into account all sets of parameters compatible with some preference information provided by the DM considering two preference relations, one possible and one necessary. The necessary preference relation holds between two alternatives 
                        
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                        
                      if x is at least as good as y for all sets of parameters compatible with the information provided by the DM, while the possible preference relation between two alternatives holds if x is at least as good as y for at least one set of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. ROR for preferences with interacting criteria modeled through the Choquet integral has been considered in Angilella, Greco, and Matarazzo (2010). ROR has also been applied to the classical PROMETHEE methods in Kadziński et al. (2012) and to the bipolar PROMETHEE methods in Corrente, Figueira, and Greco (in press). An axiomatic basis for the concepts of necessary and possible preferences has been given in Giarlotta and Greco (2013).

Similarly to ROR, the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) (Lahdelma & Salminen, 2001; Lahdelma, Hokkanen, & Salminen, 1998) explores the whole set of parameters compatible with some preference information provided by the DM. SMAA is a family of MCDA methods that takes into account imprecision or lack of data considering probability distributions on the space of criteria weights and on the space of alternatives’ evaluations. SMAA has also been applied to dependent uncertainties (Lahdelma & Salminen, 2002b; Lahdelma, Makkonen, & Salminen, 2006) and to preference with interacting criteria (Angilella, Corrente, & Greco, 2012).

Proposed in this paper is an integrated approach between SMAA and the classical PROMETHEE methods creating the SMAA-PROMETHEE method. On one hand, integrating SMAA and PROMETHEE I method permits computing the frequency of the preference, indifference or incomparability between two alternatives. On the other hand, integrating SMAA and PROMETHEE II method permits to study the different positions an alternative can obtain in the ranking when varying the parameters of the model.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section the classical PROMETHEE I and II methods are described; in Section 3 a description of the SMAA methods introducing their basic concepts is provided; in Section 4 the SMAA-PROMETHEE methods and their link with the ROR are presented. Section 5 contains a didactic example and finally some conclusions and future directions of research are presented in the last section.

                      in PROMETHEE II provide a partial and a complete preorder on the set of alternatives A, respectively.

By choosing the decision model and by assigning the values of its parameters, it is straightforward obtaining some results for building further recommendations regarding the problem at hand. Generally, the DM is unable to directly provide these parameters or she is unaware of their meaning. Moreover, the evaluations of the considered alternatives can be missing or imprecise in real world decision making problems.

SMAA is a family of MCDA methods that takes into account imprecision or lack of data in the problem at hand considering a probability distribution

                     If the DM is able to provide some preference information, then the space W is restricted by the constraints translating this preference information. Consequently, with W we shall denote the set of weights compatible with the preference information provided by the DM.

As stated in Section 2, the use of the PROMETHEE methods is based on preference function shape, weights of criteria, indifference and preference thresholds and evaluations of the alternatives on the considered criteria. Obviously, the choice of each of these parameters will influence the results obtained by applying the PROMETHEE methods. In order to take into account the variety of possible results that can be obtained using different values of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM, we shall apply the SMAA methodology. Even if SMAA has already been applied to outranking methods and in particular to ELECTRE methods (Hokkanen, Lahdelma, Miettinen, & Salminen, 1998; Tervonen et al., 2009a), to the best of our knowledge, applying SMAA to PROMETHEE methods has never been attempted in literature before.

In this section, how to translate different types of preference information provided by the DM and how to obtain results by using the SMAA methodology will be described.

The DM could be able to give different types of information regarding the importance of criteria. She could order all the criteria with respect to their importance or she could provide an interval of possible values for the same criteria stating, for example, that the importance of criterion

                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         is between 
                           
                              0.2
                           
                         and 
                           
                              0.4
                           
                         or that the importance of criterion

                         is between

This preference information can be easily translated by linear inequalities. In the first case, considering n criteria

Observe that W is a convex set whose points can be obtained as a convex combination of its vertices,

In this particular case, as the set of weights is convex, a convex combination of said vertices could be used by the analyst to easily get other weights compatible with the preferences provided by the DM.

In order to get robust recommendations for the considered problem, the whole set of compatible weights should be explored and, for this reason, we can apply SMAA and ROR (Greco et al., 2008). ROR is a family of MCDA methods that simultaneously take into account all the sets of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM building a necessary and a possible preference relation. Given two alternatives x and y, we say that x is necessarily preferred to y, and we write 
                           
                              x
                              
                                 
                                    ≿
                                 
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                              
                              y
                           
                        , if x is at least as good as y for all compatible sets of parameters, while x is possibly preferred to y, and we write 
                           
                              x
                              
                                 
                                    ≿
                                 
                                 
                                    P
                                 
                              
                              y
                           
                        , if x is at least as good as y for at least one compatible set of parameters. ROR has already been applied to classical PROMETHEE methods in Kadziński et al. (2012).

Inspired by Corrente, Greco, and Słowiński (2013), supposing that the weights are the only variables in our model (therefore alternatives’ evaluations and thresholds are considered as data of the decision problem), we get the following results on ROR applied to PROMETHEE methods:

As SMAA methods compute their indices sampling a large number of sets of parameters among all the compatible ones while the ROR takes into account all the sets of parameters simultaneously, if the sample of the sets of parameters is very high, SMAA results can be used to approximate the results of the necessary and the possible preference relations of the ROR analysis (see Kadziński & Tervonen, 2013a; Kadziński & Tervonen, 2013b for two papers studying the relationships between SMAA and ROR).

Let us suppose that the analyst, in accordance with the DM, has decided that the V-Shape function (1) is the most appropriate to model her preferences on all criteria. The DM may be interested in giving some preference information on the indifference and preference thresholds for some criterion

                         in the form of interval values. That is, she could state that the indifference threshold is a value between h and k or that the preference threshold is lower than a certain value l. In this case, indifference and preference thresholds compatible with the preference information provided by the DM should satisfy the following set of constraints

In this case, since the set of constraints (2) defines a convex space, in order to sample other vector of thresholds compatible with the preferences of the DM, one can apply the Hit-And-Run method (Smith, 1984; Tervonen, Van Valkenhoef, Basturk, & Postmus, 2013). The Hit-And-Run sampling begins with the choice of one point inside the polyhedron delimited by the constraints translating the preference information provided by the DM. At each iteration, a random direction is sampled from the unit hypersphere that, with the considered position, generates a line. Finally, the sampling of one point inside the segment whose extremes are the intersection of the line with the bounds and the current point is done. Let us point out that the Hit-And-Run sampling method could also be applied in the case in which the DM provides preference information on the importance of criteria because the constraints translating the partial or total order of the importance weights constitute a convex set in the feasible weights space.

In some decision making problems, evaluations of alternatives are given in an imprecise way. This means that the evaluation of a certain alternative on a particular criterion is not punctual but it could be any value inside an interval. For example, evaluating sport cars, the price of a car could vary between 15,000 and 17,500 Euros while its maximum speed could vary between 200kilometer/hour and 230kilometer/hour. In this case, for each alternative

In order to take into account such type of preference, before applying the PROMETHEE methods, one should sample a performance table from G and then compute the total or partial ranking of the alternatives.

In order to get the parameters necessary to apply the methodology, a direct and an indirect techniques have been referred to throughout literature. The DM gives direct preference information when she directly provides all values of the parameters present in the model. The DM supplies indirect preference information when she provides some preferences between alternatives from which compatible preference parameters can be inferred.

Supposing to consider the indirect preference information, the DM could state, for example, that alternative x is preferred to alternative y or that x and y are indifferent. Such preference information can be translated by the following inequalities:

All of the previous constraints are obviously dependent on the weights of criteria, on the indifference and preference thresholds and also on the evaluations of the alternatives. We have to distinguish two cases:
                           
                              •
                              The evaluations of the alternatives on the considered criteria and the indifference and preference thresholds are punctually defined. In this case, the only variables are the weights of criteria on which eventually the DM could provide some preference information. Therefore, considering the set of constraints translating the preferences of the DM on the weights, one can sample weights compatible with these preferences by using one of the methods introduced in Section 4.1.

The evaluations of the alternatives are not fixed or the DM wishes to provide some preference information on the thresholds. In this case, the set of constraints modeling the preferences of the DM on the considered alternatives depends on the evaluations of the alternatives and, the problem of sampling a performance table compatible with these preferences is highly not linear. For this reason, one can proceed by sampling a performance table from the evaluation space G and, independently from the performance table sampled, a set of weights and thresholds compatible with the preference information provided by the DM proceeding as described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. Two cases can arise:
                                    
                                       –
                                       if the sampled parameters (evaluations of the alternatives and thresholds) are compatible with the preferences provided by the DM on the considered alternatives, then these parameters are stored,

if the sampled parameters are not compatible with the preferences provided by the DM on the considered alternatives, then they are rejected and, if the maximum number of sampling has not yet been reached, a new sampling is performed.

For each sampled set of parameters compatible with the preferences of the DM, one can get:
                           
                              •

As stated previously, PROMETHEE I does not provide a complete ranking of the alternatives but only a partial one. For this reason, we suggest to compute two matrices UP and DOWN of dimension nxn which elements have the following interpretation:
                           
                              •

                                  is the frequency with which alternative

                                  is preferred to k other alternatives in A by using the PROMETHEE I method. For example, if UP

Observe that the two matrices UP and DOWN can be computed in any MCDA method providing a partial preorder on the set of alternatives A as, for example, ELECTRE II, III and IV (see Figueira, Mousseau, & Roy, 2005b).

Let us also observe that the two matrices UP and DOWN could be computed for the PROMETHEE II method and for each other method providing a complete order of the alternatives in A observing what follows:

In this section we shall apply SMAA to the classical PROMETHEE methods to deal with a multiple criteria decision making problem in which a DM has to choose among five cars evaluated on four different criteria: Price, Acceleration, Maximum speed and Consumption. The evaluations of the five cars on the four criteria are reported in Table 1
                     .

Let us suppose that the DM in accordance with the analyst decides that the V-shape function represents her preferences and she arranges the criteria in a non-increasing order of preference as follows: Price, Consumption, Acceleration and Maximum speed. This means that, denoting with

                     . Regarding the indifference and the preference thresholds, the DM gives the information reported in Table 2
                     .

Since the DM is interested in getting a general overview of the five cars, we present her with the results in Tables 3 and 4
                     
                      achieved by applying SMAA to the classical PROMETHEE I and II methods.

According to Tervonen and Lahdelma (2007), in order to achieve error limits of 0.01 for 
                        
                           
                              
                                 b
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 r
                              
                           
                        
                     , we sampled 10,000 sets of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. The results show that (
                        
                           SK
                        
                     ) is almost surely the best car. Indeed, looking at the positive and the negative flows separately, that is taking into account how much an alternative is preferred to all other alternatives and how much all other alternatives are preferred to it, we obtain:
                        
                           •
                           (
                                 
                                    SK
                                 
                              ) is preferred to each other car with a frequency of at least 77% (see the fourth row of Table 3(a)),
                           

(
                                 
                                    SK
                                 
                              ) is preferred to all other cars with a frequency of 66% (see the fourth row of Table 3(b)),
                           

the frequency that none of the other alternatives is preferred to (
                                 
                                    SK
                                 
                              ) is 83% (see the fourth row of Table 3(c)).

In the same way, (
                        
                           PE
                        
                     ) should be the worst car because:
                        
                           •
                           Each car is preferred to (
                                 
                                    PE
                                 
                              ) with a frequency of at least 49% (see the first column of Table 3(a)).

(
                                 
                                    PE
                                 
                              ) is preferred to no other car with a frequency of 71% (see the first row of Table 3(b)).

All other cars are preferred to (
                                 
                                    PE
                                 
                              ) with a frequency of 44% (see the first row of Table 3(c)).

Looking at the second best car, it seems that the choice should be between 
                        
                           CI
                        
                      and 
                        
                           FI
                        
                      because both of them are more globally preferred to 
                        
                           SK
                        
                      (see fourth column of Table 3(a)) and more locally preferred to 
                        
                           SK
                        
                      (see fourth column of Table 3(d)).

Because the DM wants to be as cautious as possible in choosing the best car, she would like to have more information about the possible rankings that can be obtained varying the different parameters and about which preferences make each alternative the best. For this reason, we decided to show her the results obtained by applying SMAA to the classical PROMETHEE II method too. We point out that looking at the first two columns of Table 4(a), that is at the frequency by which a car reached the first two positions, (
                        
                           FI
                        
                     ) is slightly better than (
                        
                           CI
                        
                     ) while it is still confirmed that 
                        
                           PE
                        
                      is the worst car.

From Table 4(a) we see that every car could fill the first position in the final rank while from Table 4(b) we understand that criterion Maximum speed has a general marginal importance in the final decision. In particular, it can be surprising to see that (
                        
                           PE
                        
                     ) could achieve the first position, and therefore asking for which values of the parameters it could happen.

Looking at Table 5
                      we can observe that even if 
                        
                           (
                           PE
                           )
                        
                      has the highest price among the five considered cars, and that the price is the most important criterion for the DM, it has the lowest consumption and this criterion is the second most important and has an importance weight equal to 
                        
                           0.27
                        
                     .

In Table 6
                      we reported the evaluations and the thresholds for which the other four alternatives could reach the first position.

Inspired by Lahdelma and Salminen (2002a), the analyst could be interested in understanding whether the results provided by the method are dependent on the values assigned to the considered thresholds. For this reason, we applied SMAA to 2000 randomly generated problems. Each problem was composed as follow. We sampled a performance table M and a vector of weights w compatible with the preference information provided by the DM. Then, by considering M and w, we sampled 10,000 thresholds in the considered intervals and we studied, consequently, the rank acceptability indices obtained by applying SMAA.

Looking at Table 7

                     ). This means that, in this example, the variation of the thresholds would not highly influence the results obtained by applying SMAA once that the performance table and the criteria weights have already been fixed.

In general, we could not state that the values given to the thresholds are not influencing the results but that the DM should perform in any case a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the obtained results.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

PROMETHEE methods and SMAA have been widely applied to deal with several real world problems (Behzadian et al., 2010; Tervonen & Figueira, 2008). In this paper we have proposed to apply SMAA to the classical PROMETHEE methods (Brans & Mareschal, 2005; Brans et al., 1984). The integration of SMAA and PROMETHEE methods gives the opportunity to obtain recommendations considering several set of parameters compatible with the preference information provided by the DM, and not only considering one of these sets. Thus the methodology presented in this paper brings about the possibility to effectively deal with robustness concerns related to the choice of preference parameters in PROMETHEE methods.

In the PROMETHEE II case, one can look at the possible final rankings obtained considering the net flow and at which parameters give to an alternative the best position.

In the didactic example we have shown that the SMAA methodology can be applied to classical PROMETHEE methods. This brings us to believe that the methodology we are proposing in this paper can be adopted to deal with many real-world problems.

In the future we also plan on applying the SMAA methodology to the bipolar PROMETHEE methods (Corrente, Figueira, & Greco, 2012) being the extension of the classic PROMETHEE methods to the case of interacting criteria and to the MCHP applied to PROMETHEE methods (Corrente et al., 2013).
