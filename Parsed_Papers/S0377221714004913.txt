                  We explore buyback contracts in a supplier–retailer supply chain where the retailer faces a price-dependent downward-sloping demand curve subject to uncertainty. Differentiated from the existing literature, this work focuses on analytically examining how the uncertainty level embedded in market demand affects the applicability of buyback contracts in supply chain management. To this end, we seek to characterize the buyback model in terms of only the demand uncertainty level (DUL). With this new research perspective, we have obtained some interesting new findings for buyback. For example, we find that (1) even though the supply chain’s efficiency will change over the DUL with a wholesale price-only contract, it will be maintained constantly at that of the corresponding deterministic demand setting with buyback, regardless of the DUL; (2) in the practice of buyback, the buyback issuer should adjust only the buyback price in reaction to different DULs while leave the wholesale price unchanged as that in the corresponding deterministic demand setting; (3) only in the demand setting with an intermediate level of the uncertainty (which is identified quantitatively in Theorem 5), buyback provision is beneficial simultaneously for the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain system, while this is not the case in the other demand settings. This work reveals that DUL can be a critical factor affecting the applicability of supply chain contracts.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well-known that because of the effect of double marginalization, the wholesale price-only contracts often lead to some impairment in the efficiency of the supply chain facing uncertain end market demand. In order to mitigate this loss of efficiency, numerous other contracting mechanisms have been developed in supply chain management. Typical among these is the buyback mechanism, by which the retailer still pays a wholesale price for each unit ordered, but is allowed to return at the end of the selling season all or part of the unsold items to the supplier with a predetermined full or partial refund per unit. Buyback contracts have been exploited extensively in various retail sectors such as publishing, fashion apparels, computers, and cosmetics (Kandel, 1996; Padmanabhan & Png, 1995, 1997; Emmons & Gilbert, 1998).

It is frequently observed in the retail industry that the retailer only has some knowledge (such as probabilistic knowledge) about the demand but not accurate and full information of the exact demand trend/curve. This situation arises when, e.g., the future (macro) market environment is uncertain (see Vaagen and Wallace (2008) for an illustration). Furthermore, the demand uncertainty level (DUL) often varies across different business settings, as reported by Nahmias and Smith (1994), it is common for the retail industry to observe a variability from 3 to 300 in the variance-to-mean ratio of demand. Motivated by these observations in industry, in this paper we take such demand uncertainty into account and explore its effects on the buyback contracts, with a supplier–retailer supply chain where for future demand, the retailer only knows the respective probabilistic price-dependent demand curve.

To existing research, a fundamental contribution of this work is to analytically examine how the uncertainty level inherent in market demand affects the applicability of buyback contracts in supply chain management. To this end, we seek to characterize the buyback model in terms of only the DUL. As shown by this work, taking such a research perspective does allow us to analytically develop some new results and obtain some interesting and profound findings for the buyback contracts. For instance, but not limited to, we have identified how the DUL relates to the buyback’s efficiency and the analytical circumstances under which buyback increases the profit of the supplier, the retailer, or both and subsequently achieve Pareto-improvement in a decentralized supply chain setting. With these explorations, we obtain some interesting new findings for buyback. For example, we find that (1) even though the supply chain’s efficiency will change over the DUL with a wholesale price-only contract, it will be maintained constantly at that of the corresponding deterministic demand setting with buyback, regardless of the DUL; (2) in the practice of buyback, the buyback issuer should adjust only the buyback price in reaction to different DULs, while leave the wholesale price unchanged as that in the corresponding deterministic demand setting; (3) only in the demand setting with an intermediate level of the uncertainty (which is identified quantitatively in Theorem 5 of the paper), buyback provision is beneficial simultaneously for the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain system, while this is not the case in the other demand settings; and vice versa.

In industry we can observe that in the same business setting, some forms of contracts are exploited more often than another, or the same form of contract is utilized more often in one specific business setting than in another business setting. Why is this the case? Even though we have never seen a systematical investigation on this issue, we note that some factors have been found to have significant effects on the applicability of supply chain contracts. For example, Marvel and Peck (1995) showed that the uncertainty type (they considered the valuation uncertainty and the consumer arrival number uncertainty) is one crucial factor. Cachon (2003, chap. 6) pointed out contract’s administrative cost may also be one. With this study, we believe that DUL is another important dimension affecting the applicability of supply chain contracts. Of course, similar to other modeling research’s limitation, our results and findings are derived based on the model setup and we cannot generalize them to all business settings. Despite the acknowledged limitations, we believe that our paper has revealed some important analytical closed-form properties of buyback contracts and made a good contribution to the related literature.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 formulates the model. Section 4 characterizes the supply chain with wholesale price-only contract. Section 5 characterizes the supply chain with buyback provision. Section 6 discusses the value of buyback for the respective supply chain members and the system. Section 7 examines the efficiency of buyback in coordinating the supply chain. Section 8 explores the effects of buyback on the retail price. Section 9 concludes the paper. All the proofs are put in Online Supplementary Appendix.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

There is a substantial literature on supply chain contracts. To enhance our exposition and highlight this paper’s contributions, we will review only the literature that is the most closely related to our work and refer readers to excellent review papers by Lariviere (1999, chap. 8), Tsay et al. (1999, chap. 10), and Cachon (2003, chap. 6) for more details on this topic.

The first related research stream examines buyback in the classical price-taking newsvendor setting. Pasternack (1985) appears the first to explore the channel coordination issue with buyback contracts in this setting. He showed that (i) allowing full returns with full credit and allowing no returns are both channel suboptimal and (ii) there exists a continuum of coordinating full-returns policies with partial credit that is independent of the demand distribution in the end market. Furthermore, the resulting coordinated profit can be allocated arbitrarily by a proper choice of the contract terms in the continuum. A commentary on this paper is available in Pasternack (2008). More research on buyback in this setting can be found in, e.g., Donohue (2000), Tsay (2001), with some additional complexities in their models.

The second related research stream explores buyback in a stochastic price-dependent demand setting, which our paper is classified to. In general, there is no buyback contract that can attain coordination in this setting except for more complex variations with it (Bernstein and Federgruen, 2005; Cachon, 2003, chap. 6; Chen and Bell, 2011; Chiu et al., 2011). Hence, research of the buyback contract in this setting generally does not address the coordination issue, rather, it analyzes the decentralized setting in a Stackelberg framework. Emmons and Gilbert (1998) examined the effects of buyback on supply chain members’ profits in a decentralized manufacturer–retailer supply chain with price-dependent multiplicative demand. Granot and Yin (2005) studied buyback in a similar framework. By assuming several types of deterministic demand functions, multiplied by a uniformly distributed random part, they analytically explored the Stackelberg equilibrium, the resulting supply chain members’ profits, and the efficiency of using buyback. Song, Ray, and Li (2008) integrated the various demand-specific insights on the buyback contract from Granot and Yin (2005) and other sources, and extended them to develop fairly general structural properties of the optimal buyback contract for price-dependent multiplicative demand setting. Different from the above reviewed papers, we explore buyback in a price-dependent additive demand setting. It is worth noting that the main results developed by the above mentioned papers for multiplicative demand setting generally cannot be extended to additive demand setting. As pointed out by Song et al. (2008), none of the major results developed by them with multiplicative demand remains valid for additive demand. Furthermore, according to Granot and Yin (2005), it is more challenging to deal with additive demand model than multiplicative demand model. Nevertheless, in this paper, we are able to derive explicitly the Stackelberg equilibrium and the respective insights with additive demand, and hence make a contribution to the literature.

The most related research to our paper is Padmanabhan and Png (1997), which studied buyback in two market environments respectively, one is a competitive retail environment with deterministic demand curves and the other is an uncertain downward-sloping demand curve with no retail competition. For the first market environment, they showed buyback can increase the supplier’s profit by intensifying the retail level competition. However, this result was disproved later by Wang (2004). Subsequently, Padmanabhan and Png (2004) returned to the problem and showed that this result holds only in the presence of demand uncertainty. For the second environment, they explored the conditions under which buyback can increase the supplier’s profit. Our work is the most related to their studies of buyback for the second market environment, however, with some fundamental differences as follows:

First, they explored buyback by assuming full returns with full credit, which means only one decision variable, the wholesale price, is involved in their buyback scheme. Even though this considerably simplifies their model analysis, it imposes a restriction on the strategy space of the supplier and consequently results in a suboptimal outcome (see the discussions following Theorems 4 and 5 for more details). Differentiated from them, we consider a full returns scheme with partial or full credit, which involves two decision variables. We argue that such a change is essential, because, as shown by our study, their buyback model leads to a suboptimal outcome for the supplier, and our buyback model strictly dominates theirs from the supplier’s perspective (even though our analysis is also much more complicated). Second, they looked at buyback only from the supplier’s perspective whereas we examine it from both the supplier’s and the retailer’s perspectives, with an attempt to analytically explore the business circumstances under which Pareto-improvement can be obtained by using buyback. Third, we seek to characterize the supply chain with buyback in terms of only the DUL, so that we can explore how the uncertainty level embedded in demand affects the applicability of a supply chain contract. However, this is not the case in their studies. In fact, as indicated in Section 1, such a new research perspective does allow us to obtain some interesting new findings for buyback.

The third related research stream, different from the first two streams (including our paper), integrates another component, i.e., costly effort, in the analysis of buyback contracts by considering a newsvendor with stochastic effort-dependent demand. In such a setting, Taylor (2002) showed that the combinatorial use of a buy-back contract and a rebate contract can achieve supply chain coordination. Taylor and Xiao (2009) showed that buyback can be more effective in encouraging the retailer to improve demand forecasting than the rebate contract.

Another different study is the one carried out by Marvel and Peck (1995). By incorporating two types of uncertainties in their model, namely, the uncertainty with respect to product valuation and the uncertainty with respect to the number of customer arrivals, they showed that only the valuation uncertainty makes the supplier prefer the wholesale price-only contract, whereas only the arrivals uncertainty induces the supplier to offer buyback in its contracts. Their studies reveal that the type of uncertainty can be a significant factor influencing the applicability of a supply chain contract. Our work, with different focal point and model, demonstrates that the DUL can be another critical factor.

We consider a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer. We assume that the retail demand is characterized by a price-dependent downward-sloping demand curve, given by 
                        
                           q
                           =
                           m
                           -
                           p
                        
                     , where p is the retail price, with 
                        
                           0
                           ⩽
                           p
                           ⩽
                           m
                           ,
                           
                           q
                        
                      is the product demand at 
                        
                           p
                           ,
                           
                           m
                        
                      is a random variable, and since it is the demand at 
                        
                           p
                           =
                           0
                        
                     , it indicates the maximum potential market size for different market settings. It is further pointed out that p is a decision variable associated with q of the retailer. Without loss of generality, its coefficient is normalized to 1 for clarity. Our model has two time periods: 0 and 1. At time 0, the retailer faces uncertainty in parameter m of the downward-sloping demand curve, which is distributed as follows:

At time 1 the uncertainty in the demand curve is resolved. In response, the retailer decides to release a quantity q to the end market from the available amount Q ordered at time 0.

It should be pointed out that assumption (1) is very common in the literature (see, e.g., Burnetas & Ritchken, 2005; Padmanabhan & Png, 1997). It is actually equivalent to a linear deterministic demand function with an additive random part that follows a binary distribution, i.e.,

                     We will now specify a wholesale price contract with a buyback provision, which allows the demand risk to be shared between the channel partners and mitigates the effect of double marginalization. Specifically, we assume that the supplier will buy back all items not sold by the end of the selling season at a refund of b per unit. In order to avoid the trivial cases, we require

At time 0, the retailer needs to decide the order quantity Q, allowing for uncertainty in the demand characterized by (1). The retailer’s optimal order quantity Q at time 0 is obtained by maximizing his expected profit

                     , the retailer will order at time 0 just the quantity that is optimal for releasing to the market at time 1. This observation does not carry over to the case of 
                        
                           σ

                     , where the retailer might order a larger quantity in the hope that demand will be high and might have to release only a part of the order only if the demand turns out to be low. It is on the case we focus next.

In what follows we obtain the retailer’s optimal order quantity

                      at time 0 for a given wholesale price w. The problem can be solved as a two-stage dynamic program. First, we obtain the retailer’s optimal release quantity at time 1 for each realization of the demand curve. We then maximize the retailer’s expected profit at time 0 and derive the following result.

                      graphically illustrates how the DUL affects the equilibrium with the wholesale price-only contract. An interesting result revealed in Theorem 1(i) and Fig. 2 is that there exists a threshold DUL, given by

                     , under which the equilibrium keeps unchanged as the same to that in the corresponding deterministic demand case, above which the equilibrium wholesale price is always lower than 
                        
                           
                              
                                 w
                              
                              
                                 ^
                              
                           
                        
                      and the equilibrium order quantity is always larger than 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Q
                              
                              
                                 ^
                              
                           
                        
                     . A closer look at this result reveals that double marginalization effect is alleviated to some extent when the uncertainty in demand is relatively high. An explanation for this result is as follows: when the DUL is relatively low, the supplier’s and the retailer’s decisions will not be affected at equilibrium and they still make the decisions as in the deterministic demand case. However, with the DUL increasing to a certain degree, the decision robustness is destroyed and equilibrium will change. Due to that stockout cost increases with the relatively high DUL, and for hedging against the increased stockout cost, it is beneficial for the supplier to decrease the wholesale price and for the retailer to increase the ordering quantity in response, which in turn leads to an alleviation of the double marginalization effect in the channel.

In addition, from Theorem 1(ii) it is seen that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ρ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      also serves as a threshold DUL, above which the retailer has an incentive to withhold a part of its order from the market at time 1 for a more profitable retail price. From (16) and (17), we obtain the expected quantity for the retailer to withhold from the market at equilibrium, which is denoted by

                     Actually, it can be widely observed in industries for the practice to withhold inventory from the market for an improved operations or/and profitability. For example, in the luxury fashion industry, many high-end luxury fashion brands do not sell all inventory at once after start of the selling season, instead, they withhold some of the inventory. The logic behind doing so is that they do not want the market to feel that there are plenty of inventories for the items which will cheapen the value of the products and hence advocate the strategic consumer behaviors of waiting for discount and mark-down (Tereyağoğlu & Veeraraghavan, 2012). In the mass market, many fast fashion companies often also withhold inventory for a very limited product availability at the retail sales floor. The logic with such a strategy lies in that it can encourage consumer impulse purchase and reduce inventory carrying cost at the retail sales floor (Cachon & Swinney, 2011; Choi, 2013).

                      graphically illustrates how the expected profits of the supplier and the retailer at equilibrium are affected by the DUL. A surprising result is that the expected profits of both the supplier and the retailer at equilibrium are always larger in a relatively high DUL (i.e.,

                     , and therefore the supply chain efficiency increases from which both the supplier and the retailer benefit.

In the following sections, we examine the case where the supplier offers the retailer an additional chance of returning all the quantity withheld from the market at a refund of b per unit. We mainly explore four issues in terms of uncertainty level in the demand: (i) the equilibrium buyback contract and order quantity, (ii) the expected profits of the supplier and the retailer at equilibrium, (iii) the value of buyback for the supplier and the retailer, respectively, and its efficiency in coordinating the supply chain, and (iv) the effect of buyback on the retail price. With these explorations, we expect to see the effects of buyback and how the uncertainty level of demand influences these effects.

We first obtain the optimal response of the retailer, given a buyback contract, say 
                           
                              (
                              w
                              ,
                              b
                              )
                           
                        , where w is the wholesale price and b is the buyback price, with 
                           
                              w
                              ⩾
                              b

                              0
                           
                        . As in the case of no buyback, this problem can be solved by two-stage dynamic programming: First, we analyze the retailer’s optimal response at time 1, given the realized demand curve. Then, we analyze the retailer’s optimal response at time 0 based on its optimal response at time 1, given the buyback contract 
                           
                              (

                        Fig. 4
                         graphically illustrates how the equilibrium with buyback provision is affected by the DUL. We see from Theorem 3(i) and Fig. 4(5) that with the use of buyback, regardless of the DUL, at equilibrium the supplier does not deviate from the equilibrium wholesale price associated with the corresponding deterministic demand case, and it only needs to adjust the buyback price downwards in reaction to the increased DUL. This is significantly different from the case of no buyback, where the supplier decreases the wholesale price at equilibrium in response to a high DUL (i.e.,

                        ). A closer look at this result reveals that in the negotiation of setting buyback contracts, the supplier should bargain with the retailer only on the buyback price, while leave the wholesale price unchanged as that in the corresponding deterministic demand case. One explanation for this result is that in the case with buyback, it is enough for the supplier to mitigate the effects of different levels of demand uncertainty by adjusting the buyback price only, and there is no necessity to change the wholesale price at equilibrium.

                        . A counterintuitive result is that the retailer’s order quantity increases strictly as the buyback price decreases. A second thought on this result reveals its behind reasonability that it is just a balanced outcome between the effects resulted from a decreased buyback price and an increased DUL. To be specific, on one hand, a decreased buyback price will make the retailer reduce its order quantity; on the other hand, however, an increased DUL will push the retailer to increase its order quantity by which to hedge against the increased demand uncertainty risk. With a balance of the effects from these two aspects, it is seen that the order quantity of the retailer seems to increase as the buyback price decreases.

                        ) buyback provision pushes the retailer to order more, otherwise there is no effect on the order size. This result is somewhat counterintuitive, because it is often claimed that giving an additional buyback provision always induces the retailer to order more (Katok & Wu, 2009, p. 1958). In addition, intuitively, the retailer has a stronger incentive to withhold products from the market under a buyback provision, as compared to the case of no buyback. By Theorem 3(iii), we obtain the expected quantity for the retailer to withhold from the market at equilibrium (in fact, he returns the products to the supplier) with buyback as follows:

                        . Furthermore, it is clear that the use of buyback decreases the threshold DUL, above which the retailer has an incentive to withhold products from the market. This gives, once again, the intuitive result that the retailer has a stronger incentive to withhold products from the market when it can return products to the supplier.

                        ), buyback actually plays no role on the supply chain. With the DUL increasing, however, buyback can facilitate the supply chain operations with remedying to some extent the channel double marginalization effect. Thereby, the supply chain efficiency is enhanced from which both the supplier and the retailer benefit.


                        Padmanabhan and Png (1997) considered unlimited returns with full credit from the supplier’s perspective with a model equivalent to ours. We mentioned in Section 2 that the buyback scheme considered by them results in a suboptimal outcome for the supplier. With the help of some calculations in Appendix, we can conclude that the supplier’s profit given by Padmanabhan and Png, 1997 comes to

                        By comparing this with (34), we see that the expected profit obtained by the supplier at equilibrium with the buyback scheme considered in Padmanabhan and Png (1997) is strictly less than that with the buyback scheme considered in our paper for all

                        . Hence, their buyback model is strictly dominated by ours from the supplier’s perspective.

In this section, we explore the value of buyback for the supplier and the retailer at different DULs. In particular, it is intuitive that for the deterministic case of 
                        
                           σ
                           =

                     , the value of buyback is zero for both the supplier and the retailer, because in this case the retailer knows accurately the demand and will therefore order only the quantity that is optimal for releasing to the market. Further discussion in the following shows that this observation even carries over to some cases of

                      graphically illustrates how the values of buyback are affected by the DUL. We see from Theorem 5 and Fig. 6 that the supplier never suffers a loss with the use of buyback regardless of the DUL. Furthermore, it benefits when the DUL is not too low (higher than

                     ). As a result, there exists a range of DUL in which Pareto-improvement can be achieved using buyback. This result reveals the demand circumstances where buyback is acceptable to both the supplier and the retailer in a decentralized setting. As we mentioned in Section 2, Marvel and Peck (1995) demonstrated that the type of uncertainty can be a factor influencing the applicability of supply chain contracts. Cachon (2003, chap. 6) pointed out that, to some extent, the contract’s administrative cost may be utilized to explain why a supply chain contract form can be observed in practice over another. Despite our model does not consider the administrative cost and uncertainty type issues, Theorem 5 indicates that DUL can be another critical factor affecting the applicability of supply chain contracts. To be specific, we can observe from Theorem 5 that it is easier for buyback contracts to be applied in the market circumstance with an intermediate DUL (because, in which, Pareto-improvement can be obtained even under a decentralized setting).

A closer look at this result reveals its explanations as follows: when the DUL is relatively low, it is obvious that buyback actually has no value for both the supplier and the retailer; when the DUL is relatively high, for hedging against high demand uncertainty risk, the supplier, leaving the wholesale price unchanged, has to offer a buyback price that is so low that the retailer becomes worse than that without buyback; when the DUL is intermediate, even though the supplier also tries to capture the channel profit by offering a selfish buyback price, at equilibrium the buyback price is still in a range that can guarantee the retailer receiving some benefits from buyback, and thus Pareto-improvement takes place under buyback.

                     . Furthermore, the corresponding expected profit received by the supplier at equilibrium also strictly dominates that in the setting of Padmanabhan and Png (1997)’s buyback model by (34) and (36). This, together with the discussion following Theorem 4, further indicates that the buyback scheme considered in Padmanabhan and Png (1997) results in a suboptimal outcome for the supplier.

We know that a buyback contract alone cannot achieve supply chain coordination in the setting of a price-dependent newsvendor, which our model shares. In this section, we examine the efficiency of buyback in coordinating the supply chain. To do this, we first need to derive the system-wide optimal profit for the supply chain. This problem can be solved by taking the supplier and the retailer collectively as a centralized entity. The corresponding results are summarized in the following lemma, where we denote by

                     , may only be a result of our specific model setup, it is interesting to find that the system efficiency will maintain constantly at the level of the corresponding deterministic demand case with buyback, while this is not the case with the wholesale price-only contracts, for which the system efficiency changes over different DULs. The behind driver leading to this result is the role of buyback. To be specific, buyback can mitigate the effects of different DULs on the system and thereby maintain the system efficiency as the same to that in the deterministic demand case of

                      graphically depicts how the expectation and SD of the retail price are affected by the DUL. From Theorem 7 and Fig. 8, we summarize the effects of buyback on the expectation and SD of the retail price as follows: (i) increasing the expectation of the retail price while decreasing its SD, i.e., its fluctuation level, at a relatively high DUL (i.e.,

                     ). Hence, looking at buyback from the end consumers’ perspective, the end consumers never benefit from the use of buyback, and in some cases, such as at a relatively high DUL, they suffer a loss in the presence of buyback. In addition, it is seen from Theorem 7(i), Theorem 1(i), and Theorem 3(i) that the retailer will maintain earning a constant margin with buyback regardless of the DUL, while this is not the case with the wholesale price-only contract.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have studied buyback contracts in terms of DUL in a two-echelon supply chain facing the end market demand characterized by a price-dependent downward-sloping demand curve subject to uncertainty. To be specific, we have characterized the buyback contract, the order quantity, and the respective supply chain members’ expected profits at equilibrium. We have also examined the value of buyback, its efficiency in coordinating the supply chain, and the expectation and standard deviation of the retail price with buyback. We derive all the results explicitly in terms of the DUL, which is measured by the SD. In addition, we have made detailed comparisons between the scenarios with buyback and no buyback over different DULs, which allow us to see more clearly the effects of buyback and how DUL influences these effects. We summarize the relevant results in Table 1
                     .

As a conclusion, we would like to conduct a comparison between our studies and those by Granot and Yin (2005). First, some results in our studies, to some extent, can be viewed as the extensions of the corresponding results in Granot and Yin (2005) to the additive form of demand. For example, our studies, with a special additive form of demand, demonstrate that the wholesale price and the system efficiency with buyback coincide with those in the corresponding deterministic demand case. These results are very consistent with those found by Granot and Yin (2005). Furthermore, it should be noted that we have shown these results over different DULs. By contrast, Granot and Yin (2005) derived them with a uniform distribution over [0,2], i.e., a singly given DUL determined by the uniform distribution over [0,2]. In terms of such a sense, our studies, even though with a special form, have extended these core results in Granot and Yin (2005) to the case of additive form of demand, and thereby substantiated the first conjecture proposed by Granot and Yin (2005) to a good extent by a consideration of the additive form of demand (see Theorem 5.1 and Conjecture 5.3 (i) in Granot and Yin (2005)).

In addition to the extended resemblances, our studies also demonstrate that some results developed in Granot and Yin (2005) cannot be extended with an additive form of demand. For example, Granot and Yin (2005) have found that for the linear expected demand, at equilibrium buyback will benefit all the supply chain members and the system with a multiplicative form of demand as in their studies. However, they have actually derived this result with a given DUL determined by the uniform distribution over [0,2]. Hence, readers may not help wondering whether this result still holds as the DUL changes (or the PDF for the stochastic part of the demand changes). Different answers are possible for this issue. At least this is the case with the additive form of demand, as shown in our studies with a special additive form of demand, buyback is beneficial simultaneously for the supplier, the retailer, and the system only in a range of the intermediate DULs, and with the other cases this is not the case. For another example, Granot and Yin (2005) have found that for the linear expected demand, the system efficiency with the wholesale price-only contracts cannot exceed 75% (see Proposition 3.6 in Granot and Yin (2005)). However, is it also so with different DULs or PDFs for the stochastic demand? The answer may be yes or no. Actually, our studies have found that for the additive form of demand, depending on different DULs, the system efficiency with the wholesale price-only contracts can be higher or lower than 75%. In addition, Theorem 3 in our studies has exhibited a direct deny to Conjecture 5.3 (ii) in Granot and Yin (2005) for the additive form of demand.

The above comparison raises some research directions that are worth pursuing in the future. First, whether the results obtained in Granot and Yin (2005) and our paper still hold for more general cases. Second, whether the extensions discussed in the above comparison still hold for more general additive form of demand, such as an extension of our model that the parameter m follows a general distribution. Third, in addition to the formal difference, what are the essences that are driving the resemblances and differences between the results with the two forms of demand model. We leave these as interesting topics for future research.
