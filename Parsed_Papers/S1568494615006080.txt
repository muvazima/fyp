                  This paper presents a simple and efficient real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) for constrained real-parameter optimization. Different from some conventional RCGAs that operate evolutionary operators in a series framework, the proposed RCGA implements three specially designed evolutionary operators, named the ranking selection (RS), direction-based crossover (DBX), and the dynamic random mutation (DRM), to mimic a specific evolutionary process that has a parallel-structured inner loop. A variety of benchmark constrained optimization problems (COPs) are used to evaluate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed RCGA. Besides, some existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms in the same category of the proposed algorithm are considered and utilized as a rigorous base of performance evaluation. Extensive comparison results reveal that the proposed RCGA is superior to most of the comparison algorithms in providing a much faster convergence speed as well as a better solution accuracy, especially for problems subject to stringent equality constraints. Finally, as a specific application, the proposed RCGA is applied to optimize the GaAs film growth of a horizontal metal-organic chemical vapor deposition reactor. Simulation studies have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed RCGA in solving COPs.
