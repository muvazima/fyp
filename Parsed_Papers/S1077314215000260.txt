                  Spatio-temporal saliency detection has attracted lots of research interests due to its competitive performance on wide multimedia applications. For spatio-temporal saliency detection, existing bottom-up algorithms often over-simplify the fusion strategy, which results in the inferior performance than the human vision system. In this paper, a novel bottom-up spatio-temporal saliency model is proposed to improve the accuracy of attentional region estimation in videos through fully exploiting the merit of fusion. In order to represent the space constructed by several types of features such as location, appearance and temporal cues extracted from video, kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS) including three approximation entity-models is proposed. Using KR-MFS, a hybrid fusion strategy which considers the combination of spatial and temporal saliency of each individual unit and incorporates the impacts from the neighboring units is presented and embedded into the spatio-temporal saliency model. The proposed model has been evaluated on the publicly available dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed spatio-temporal saliency model can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Visual saliency modeling has been widely considered to be a promising approach to automatically and efficiently localizing the “important” content in images or videos [1–3]. While saliency detection from still images depends only on spatial information (i.e., the current scene), for the task of saliency estimation from videos, temporal information (i.e., the accumulative information along time) also plays an important role, which is commonly termed as spatio-temporal saliency in the literature [4]. As highlighted in [4], spatio-temporal saliency modeling provides a natural way to identify important regions from dynamic scenes, which can benefit a wide range of computer vision applications, such as action recognition [5], moving object detection in the stationary or dynamic background [6–8], and image/video compression [9].

A lot of spatio-temporal saliency models have recently been proposed, which in general fall into two categories, namely the data-driven bottom-up models [2,3,5–15] and the task-oriented top-down models [16–18]. The later category of models usually resorts to supervised learning, with a pre-determined task and the corresponding training data, while the former does not rely on specific tasks. In this paper, we are mainly focused on bottom-up saliency modeling for the purpose of detecting salient moving object (region) from videos, which desirably can facilitate the computer vision tasks such as moving object detection [6–8] and visual tracking [19].

The vast majority of existing computational models for spatio-temporal saliency detection [2,3,6,7,10,12–15] follow the paradigm that the spatial saliency and the temporal saliency are first measured separately and then fused to obtain the final saliency map. Neurobiological evidence supporting this paradigm can be found in [20], which suggests that visual information processing in the brain goes along two parallel and concurrent streams, namely the ventral stream and the dorsal stream. The former has high spatial sensitivity and mainly processes appearance information, while the latter has high temporal sensitivity and mainly processes motion information. Consequently, the hypothetical segregation of the two streams naturally raises a question, i.e., the so-called visual integration problem: how does the cortex combine the information from the two streams? In spatio-temporal saliency models, in addition to the spatial and temporal saliency calculation modules which simulate the perceptual functionality of the ventral and the dorsal streams, there should also be a fusion strategy for simulating the visual integration functionality. In previous works [2,3,6,7,10,12–15], the fusion problem is typically addressed by performing multiplicative, additive, or maximum operations over the corresponding perceptual units independently, which totally ignores the connection among the neighboring units. While these fusion strategies might be appropriate for eye fixation prediction as discussed in many previous works, they are disadvantageous for those tasks which require highlighting foreground regions uniformly. In addition, the over-simplicity of existing fusion strategies may be one of the key reasons why existing computational models underperform the human vision system in predicting salient moving objects. These facts motivate us to develop a more effective approach for fusing the spatial and the temporal saliency.

Our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model follows the aforementioned paradigm while being mainly focused on the fusion strategy. Due to its computational efficiency and perceptual superiority [21–23], superpixel is taken as the basic computational unit in our model. Similar to [24], each unit is represented by a feature vector defined in the mixed feature space, that is, the Cartesian product of the location feature subspace, the appearance feature subspace and the temporal feature subspace. Spatio-temporal saliency can then be treated as a function value of the mixed feature, which can be learnt by means of regression. In order to accommodate the locality and multi-modality of the mixed feature space, we first propose the model of kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS), which includes three variants: kernel regression using local constant approximation in mixed feature space (KR-LC-MFS), kernel regression using local regularized linear approximation in mixed feature space (KR-LRL-MFS) and kernel regression using local regularized kernel approximation in mixed feature space (KR-LRK-MFS). In addition, the relationship between KR-MFS and the classical kernel regression [25–28] is discussed. Then, based on KR-MFS, a hybrid fusion strategy is proposed. Different from the existing fusion strategies treat each unit individually, the proposed fusion strategy is able to exploit the spatial structure of the neighboring units. Finally, by integrating the spatial and temporal saliency calculation modules and the hybrid fusion module, we propose a unified spatio-temporal saliency model, which can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark datasets. To sum up, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

                           A generic model, i.e., kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS), and its three variants, i.e., KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LRK-MFS, are proposed, which can be potentially applied to many real-world problems besides the spatio-temporal saliency detection as concerned in this paper.

Based on KR-MFS, a hybrid fusion strategy is proposed. The key property of the proposed fusion strategy is that it is able to take into account the influences from the neighboring units.

By the aide of the hybrid fusion strategy, our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, our model is well modularized and therefore has good extendibility.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 details the proposed KR-MFS model and the variants. Section 4 describes the spatio-temporal saliency model using KR-MFS. In Section 5, our saliency model is comprehensively evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art algorithms. Section 6 gives the conclusion of this paper.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In this section, we briefly review the previous works including the saliency measure and fusion strategies for spatio-temporal saliency modeling, and kernel regression and its applications in computer vision. Note that top-down saliency modeling is excluded from our literature review here since we only concentrate on bottom-up saliency in this paper.

As mentioned before, a majority of existing spatio-temporal saliency models [2,3,6,7,10,12–15] have adopted the paradigm, that the spatial and the temporal saliency are first computed separately and then fused. In [1,2], the Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter with center-surround mechanism is utilized to measure saliency. Itti et al. deploy the spatial and temporal surprise to define saliency and detect salient events in video, where surprise is mathematically computed by Kullback–Liebler (KL) divergence [3]. Liu et al. utilize a spatio-temporal volume to integrate the spatial and temporal saliency, where the spatial and temporal saliency is measured by Shannon’s self-information [6]. In [7], spatial saliency is measured by self-resemblance of the texture descriptors, while the temporal saliency is computed by the sum of absolute difference between temporal gradients of the center and the surrounding regions. Zhai and Shah define temporal saliency as motion contrast based on the estimated point correspondences using RANSAC and spatial saliency as global color histogram contrast [10]. In [12], cortical-like filters corresponding to the two separate outputs of the retina, namely parvocellular and magnocellular, are utilized to compute the spatial and temporal saliency respectively. Ren et al. apply feature reconstruction error to measure spatial and temporal saliency [13]. In [14], temporal saliency is computed based on dynamic consistent optical flow and spatial saliency is computed by integrating the activation maps from multiple low-level feature channels. Recently, Fang et al. exploit a psychological model for speed perception which is further utilized to estimate temporal saliency; meanwhile spatial saliency is computed by averaging multiple saliency maps corresponding to multiple spatial features [15].

There also exists spatio-temporal saliency models which do not follow the aforementioned paradigm, like in [8,9,11]. In these methods, the spatial and temporal saliency calculation and the fusion modules are integrated as a whole. Mahadevan and Vasconcelos extend the discriminant center-surround hypothesis from image to video by using dynamic texture to model the spatio-temporal characteristics of the visual stimuli [8]. In [9], the spatial and temporal features are first extracted, and then the spatio-temporal saliency is measured by Quaternion Fourier Transform. Seo and Milanfar [11] adopt the local regression kernel to represent each pixel/voxel, where the center-surround contrast based on the resemblance of a pixel/voxel to its surroundings is utilized to measure spatio-temporal saliency.

Generally, the overwhelming majority of spatio-temporal saliency models follow the aforementioned paradigm. Our proposed model also follows the same paradigm.

In [2], the motion channel is simply treated as an ordinary one like the other spatial feature channels such as color, intensity, and orientation, and then all these channels are normalized and combined into the final saliency map. By fitting the neural data, the additive fusion scheme is recommended in [3]. Liu et al. propose a weighted additive fusion approach, where weights are estimated from the spatio-temporal volumes [6]. By considering the influence of scale, Kim et al. propose a multi-scale additive fusion method [7]. In [12,13], some common fusion approaches such as multiplicative, additive, and maximum fusion, are evaluated and discussed. A maximum fusion strategy is also introduced in [14]. The work of [10] adopts a dynamic additive fusion strategy in which the temporal attention is dominant over the spatial attention when large motion contrast exists. Recently, an adaptive entropy-based and uncertainty-weighted fusion strategy is proposed [15], where uncertainty weight is defined based on the quality of the saliency map.

In summary, previous fusion strategies can be generally divided into three categories: weighted multiplicative, weighted additive and maximum fusion. In these approaches, the spatio-temporal saliency value of each unit is fused independently without considering the influences from its neighboring units. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid fusion approach which can jointly take the independent fusion on each unit and the influences from its neighboring units into account.

As a non-parametric regression approach, kernel regression [25–28] is commonly used to estimate complex trends from noisy data, which has benefited lots of computer vision tasks. In [29], kernel regression is adopted to estimate the cluttered background in infrared images so that the background part can be suppressed and the small targets can stand out. Kim et al. deduce a refined weighted center-surround saliency measurement for noisy image using kernel regression [30], and they achieve impressive experimental results. In [31], an adaptive kernel regression model is proposed and applied to image denoising and interpolation, which is subsequently employed to spatio-temporal saliency detection [11] and training-free object detection [32].

In these applications of kernel regression [11,29–32], the models usually address the univariate analysis or multivariate analysis where each component obeys the same probabilistic distribution. However, these existing models are not applicable to the spatio-temporal saliency detection problem discussed in this paper. This is because our problem involves the mixed variable representing different types of features extracted from videos, including location, spatial and temporal cues, which obey different probabilistic distributions. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel model of kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS).

We first give a review about the classic kernel regression (CKR), and then kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS) is introduced in detail.

                         is the regression function and ε is the random noise with zero mean which is independent and identically distributed.

In classic kernel regression, the independent variable x is generally univariate or multivariate with each component obeying the same distribution, and the weighted function can be expressed relatively easily. Based on the constant approximation assumption in the local domain, the Nadaraya–Watson estimator was proposed in [25,26]. With the linear or polynomial approximation assumption, the corresponding estimator was introduced in [31]. In the existing kernel regression models, the independent variable is mostly restricted to be single-modal which constrains the application range of kernel regression approaches. Furthermore, the kernel approximation and regularization problem has hardly been discussed in the context of kernel regression. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, KR-MFS is proposed in the following subsection.

We first give a definition of the mixed variable which follows a complex probability distribution. As depicted in [24], one variable x is mixed if

                         (i.e., the Euclidean distance of their corresponding features) is less than a certain threshold. Therefore, the neighboring variables of a reference variable and its number are determined by the feature distribution of variables and the dissimilarity threshold. As an instance, the determination of neighborhood relationship is specifically depicted in Section 4.4. Assuming that the reference pair

It is noted that kernel regression [25–28], including KR-MFS, contains two key factors: localization and approximation, which simultaneously affect the overall performance of kernel regression. Generally, the localization is achieved via the weighted function or bandwidth matrix equipped kernel, and the approximation is realized by the regression function. In KR-MFS, the localization is calculated using the original variable

                         to form the regression variable is determined by the causal relationship between the independent variable and the function value, which is dependent on the specific application. As an instance, in Section 4.4, the construction of regression variable is specifically demonstrated in spatio-temporal saliency detection.

As for the localization problem, the bandwidth matrix estimation in mixed feature spaces is an interesting research topic that goes beyond the scope of this paper and is part of our ongoing work. As a compromise between efficiency and accuracy, this paper adopts a greedy bandwidth matrix estimation approach. In addition, we put particular emphasis on the approximation problem. Under different local approximation degrees, kernel regression using local constant approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LC-MFS), kernel regression using local regularized linear approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRL-MFS), and kernel regression using local regularized kernel approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRK-MFS) are discussed in Sections 3.2.1–3.2.3, respectively.

Different from the widely known Nadaraya–Watson estimator [25,26] that is applicable only when the independent variable comes from the homogeneous space, the proposed estimator deduced by KR-LC-MFS can further handle the case that the independent variable comes from the heterogeneous space (i.e., the mixed feature space). For KR-LC-MFS, the adaption to the mixed feature space benefits from the bandwidth matrix

                            defined in the mixed feature space. As an example, the bandwidth matrix estimation is specifically introduced in Section 4.4. Generally, the local constant assumption makes the local constant estimator have a relatively high bias. In order to reduce the fitting bias, more precise approximations are considered in the following models.

Assuming that the local function value can be approximated by an affine function, kernel regression using local linear regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-LL-MFS) can be derived:

Generally, the number of neighboring samples in the local domain is relatively small, which may result in regressions with incorrectly steep extrapolations (i.e., large estimation variances) [33]. For discouraging the fitting hyperplanes with steep slopes, Ridge regression [28,34] takes the square of the L2 norm of the regression coefficients as a regularization term to penalize the original objective function. Inspired by its success in Ridge regression, the regularization term (i.e., the square of the L2 norm of the regression coefficients

                            in Eq. (4)) is utilized to restrict KR-LL-MFS for reducing the estimation variance caused by small amount of neighbors. Combining KR-LL-MFS and the regularization term, kernel regression using local regularized linear regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRL-MFS) is proposed and depicted in Eq. (5).

                            is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between the estimation bias (i.e., the approximation error) and the estimation variance (i.e., the magnitude of the regression coefficients). Generally, larger

                            has been left out of the penalty term as penalization of the intercept could make the procedure not depend on the origin chosen for y.

Note that kernel regression using local regularized polynomial approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRP-MFS) can be modeled similarly, by replacing

In addition, the regularization term can improve the estimator

In KR-LRL-MFS, the linear approximation is assumed in the local domain. However, in some cases, the linear approximation is not sufficient, so the kernel approximation (i.e., the infinite approximation) is addressed in this section. For supporting the infinite approximation, the original regression variable u is mapped to the variable

                            stands for the regularization parameter which controls the trade-off between the regression model fitting bias and the regression model variance. Notably, the kernel approximation described in Eq. (8) is equivalent to basis expansions using reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which is demonstrated in Appendix B. The interested readers can refer to [35,36] which offer more insights about RKHS. Different from the existing works [35,36] that pursue global regression assigning the same weight to the loss function, Eq. (8) formulates local regression in which the loss function is assigned with different weights. Similar to the process of KR-LRL-MFS, the measured data are first centralized, and then the regression coefficient vector

                            are utilized and evaluated for the spatio-temporal saliency detection task, respectively.

Our proposed spatio-temporal saliency detection model using kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS) is presented in this section. Firstly, Section 4.1 gives an overview of the model. The mixed feature vector extraction from image sequences is introduced in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 describes spatial and temporal saliency measure. Finally, Section 4.4 details how to fuse the calculated spatial and temporal saliency using KR-MFS.

As shown in Fig. 1
                        (a), the visual cortex is organized in two different streams which originate from the primary visual cortex (V1) where we can find two kinds of cells. Along the ventral stream, the first kind of cells in the V1 form area tunes the spatial orientations and projects them to areas of V2 form, V4 and IT. Along the dorsal stream, the second kind of cells in the V1 motion area tunes the motion orientations and projects them to V2 motion, MT and MST. As for bottom-up saliency, the spatial saliency is mainly generated in the V1 form area of the ventral stream [37]. The MT area of the dorsal stream that is provided with the center-surround mechanism contains the integration cells, motion contrast cells [38], which implies that the temporal saliency starts to appear in the MT area. In addition, evidence suggests that processing in cortical areas of static and dynamic visual information is organized along parallel streams with mutual interactions at different levels [39]. As saliency is generated in early areas, so we just investigate the early mutual interactions between two parallel streams. More specifically, the experiments in [40] clearly suggest that the V2 area of the ventral stream interacts with the MT area of the dorsal stream. The asymmetric interaction exists because that the higher level dorsal areas, such as MT and MST, are activated more rapidly than the early ventral areas, such as V1 form and V2 form [41]. Hence, visual integration happens between the lower level areas of the ventral stream and higher level areas of the dorsal stream. Motivated by this neurobiological finding, the spatio-temporal saliency detection architecture, that is, the spatial and temporal saliency is first calculated respectively and then fused as the final result, has been adopted by lots of computational models [2,3,6,7,10,12–15]. Our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model also follows this framework, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). In this framework, the spatial and temporal saliency can be estimated in an almost parallel fashion while the fusion module allows the exchange of the information.

Specifically, the input image sequence is first over-segmented using the algorithm proposed in [42] and the produced superpixels are taken as the basic computational units for saliency detection. In addition, the mixed feature vector of each unit in the frame can be extracted and represented by 
                           
                              q

                         is explained in the following.

Until now, large amounts of computer vision tasks have been benefited from the superpixel-based units, such as object recognition [44], visual tracking [19], and salient object detection [21–23,43]. In [23], the rationale and superiority of superpixel-based visual saliency modeling are deeply discussed. As pointed out by [23], superpixel-based visual saliency modeling is in favor of implementing visual organization according to gestalt principles [45] and uniformly highlighting the foreground regions, which are desirable for subsequent processing (e.g., detection and segmentation). Therefore, this paper takes the superpixel-based visual unit as the primary calculation unit.

As shown in Fig. 2
                        , the input sequences are first over-segmented using the algorithm proposed in [42]. Assuming that the current frame

The temporal feature of each unit is represented by its trajectory, which can be naturally computed by the average of the motion vectors of pixels in one unit. Due to the low computational complexity, the optical flow approach [48], a refined version of [49], is utilized to compute the dense motion vectors. In order to exploit more temporal information, weighted relay tracking is presented. More specifically, the temporal feature

                         can be calculated similarly. Note that the introduced region tracking inevitably contains some error as the tracked superpixel is unstable because one superpixel may be divided into several superpixels or several superpixels may be merged together during the tracking process. With this consideration, the above temporal feature

The fusion strategy of spatial and temporal saliency has been widely studied in the previous work [2,3,6,7,10,12–15]. In the existing fusion approaches, the spatio-temporal saliency of each unit is independently fused by the multiplicative, additive, or maximum combination operators. This independent fusion on each unit may have a slight impact on the eye fixation prediction task, but it is disadvantageous when the spatio-temporal saliency is modeled for computer vision tasks (e.g., foreground detection and segmentation). Since interesting objects are often associated with localized groups of units, it is intuitive to consider a small group of units in the neighborhood for spatio-temporal saliency fusion. Using kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS), this section proposes a hybrid fusion strategy to combine spatial and temporal saliency by a group of neighboring units instead of individual ones.

The rationale behind that KR-MFS can be utilized to fuse the spatial and temporal saliency is first declared. In order to demonstrate the rationale clearly, the neighboring unit set of the reference unit is introduced first. As shown in Fig. 3
                        (a), the neighboring unit set of the reference unit

Based on the Gestalt principles [45], spatially adjacent units with similar appearance and temporal characteristics should be similarly salient. Given this consideration, the spatial and temporal saliency fusion should jointly take the reference unit and its neighboring unit set into account simultaneously. Assuming the salient value of the reference unit is blurred because of noise, we naturally consider re-estimating it using its weighted neighbors where a larger weight is assigned when the neighboring unit is more similar to the reference unit in the mixed feature space. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), the red filled circle denotes the reference unit, and the green filled circles with different size indicate its neighboring units. Moreover, the size of the green filled circle is proportional to the similarity between the reference unit and its neighboring unit. Mathematically, the re-estimation process can be implemented by weighted regression model, which is called kernel regression or kernel smoothing when the weight is computed using the bandwidth matrix equipped kernel. Finally, substituting the mixed variable corresponding to the reference unit into the mapping function which is learned by kernel regression, the ideal spatio-temporal saliency value of the reference unit can be recovered.

                         probably contains some errors without considering the influence from its neighboring units. Thus, the true value

                         needs to be recovered from its noisy version by making full use of the neighboring units. Here, KR-MFS is adopted to finish the recovery and fuse the spatial and temporal saliency.

As aforementioned, the original mixed feature 
                           
                              q
                              =
                              (
                              l

                              a
                              ,
                              t
                              )
                           
                        , integrating rich information [46], is beneficial to calculate the spatial and temporal saliency. However, the dimensionality of the mixed feature is too high for KR-MFS in the local domain. As there are just dozens of samples in the local domain, kernel regression becomes unpractical when the dimensionality of the regression variable is too high compared with the small number of samples. For pursuing a favorable ratio of the variable-dimension and sample-size, the dimensionality of each basic feature space (e.g., the location feature space l, the appearance feature space a, or the temporal feature space 
                           
                              t
                           
                        ) is restricted to be not more than three. The determination of the upper bound is on the basis of the fact that the mixed feature comes from the joint of multiple basic feature spaces and local regression needs more than ten neighboring samples when the dimensionality of the regression variable is three [33]. With the consideration of the curse of dimensionality, the dimensionality reduction on the original mixed feature 
                           
                              q

                         is required. Compared with other existing dimensionality reduction methods, such as independent component analysis (ICA), manifold learning, and so forth, principal component analysis (PCA) is selected to implement dimensionality reduction due to its computational efficiency. Let us suppose that the current frame is over-segmented into m superpixels, thus the original corresponding mixed feature sets

                         are taken as the training database for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the location feature l keeps its original dimensionality, the dimensionality of the appearance feature a is reduced to three, and the dimensionality of the temporal feature t is reduced to two. More discussion about the dimensionality determination is discussed in the experimental section.

In the following, kernel regression using local regularized kernel approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRK-MFS) is taken as an example to explain the unity of the spatial and temporal cues for combining the spatial and temporal saliency. Here, the determination of the original variable and the selection of the regression variable are introduced first. Let

                         must include all the basic features. However, the spatio-temporal saliency value is independent on the location feature l in a fixed local domain, so the regression variable

                         just includes the appearance feature a and the temporal feature t. The multiplicative combination of the spatial and temporal saliency on each unit is adopted, due to its better performance compared with other independent operators, which is demonstrated in the experimental Section 5.2.1.

Similarly, kernel regression using local constant approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LC-MFS) and kernel regression using local regularized linear approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRL-MFS) can also be utilized to combine the spatial and temporal saliency. In the experiment section, the fusion performance of three estimators, deduced by KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LRK-MFS, is discussed in detail. Compared with the intuitive spatial and temporal saliency combination strategy (e.g., the multiplicative fusion, the additive fusion and the maximum fusion), the superior fusion performance of the proposed strategy is presented in the experimental section.

In this part, the evaluation dataset and criteria are first introduced in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, the overall performance of the proposed spatio-temporal saliency model is illustrated. Section 5.3 gives a fair comparison with six state-of-the-art approaches.

Different from datasets for evaluating eye fixation prediction, an extensive video dataset proposed in [53] is specifically created to evaluate regional saliency detection in video. As our proposed approach aims at salient motion region detection in video, the public dataset in [53] is employed to demonstrate the validation of our proposed model. The collected dataset [53] contains 7.5-h videos, including six subsets: documentary video, advertisement video, cartoon video, news video, movie video, and surveillance video. In total, 62,356 key frames are sequentially sampled out of the 764,806 video frames. The salient regions in key frames are manually labeled as 23 subjects and then averaged to generate the ground-truth saliency maps. As a whole, the adopted evaluation dataset can cover different video saliency detection situations.

Similar to [17,53], the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) is adopted to evaluate the similarity between the estimated saliency map (ESM) and ground-truth saliency map (GSM). In the evaluation process, different thresholds are utilized to select salient regions from ESM, which is then validated by GSM. More specifically, given a threshold, ESM is segmented into the binary mask, and then the number of true positive (TP) is calculated by the multiplication of the binary mask and GSM, and the number of the false positive (FP) is calculated by the intersection of the binary mask and the mask that GSM equals zero. Furthermore, true positive rate can be calculated by TP/GTP, where GTP denotes the sum of GSM and false positive rate can be computed by FP/GFP, where GFP denotes the sum of the region that GSM equals zero. After that, the ROC curve is plotted as the true positive rate vs. false positive rate, and the AuROC score is defined as the area under the ROC curve. Perfect prediction corresponds to a score of 1 and random prediction corresponds to a score of 0.5. In this paper, both ROC curves and AuROC scores are utilized to demonstrate the performance of video saliency detection approaches.

In our implementation, each frame is over-segmented into around 300 units by [38], the inter-frame interval 
                           
                              Δ
                           
                         is set to 4 and the tracking length 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         is set to 4.

In order to validate the temporal feature using weighted relay tracking, the AuROC scores of the temporal saliency using non-relay tracking, non-weighted relay tracking, and weighted relay tracking, are reported in Table 1
                        . As depicted in Table 1, non-weighted relay tracking and weighted relay tracking can achieve better video saliency prediction performance than non-relay tracking, which reflects that more temporal information benefits the video saliency prediction. In addition, compared with the non-weighted relay tracking, the weighted relay tracking can further improve the performance of the temporal saliency. That’s mainly because the relay tracking may inevitably import some error. To some extent, the weighted relay tracking can reduce the influence of tracking error, which is therefore adopted to extract the temporal features.

Considering the curse of dimensionality, feature reduction on the original mixed feature 
                           
                              q
                              =
                              (
                              l
                              ,
                              a
                              ,
                              t
                              )
                           
                         in the fusion module (i.e., Kernel Regression in Mixed Feature Spaces (KR-MFS)) is requisite. In the following, we detail how to determine the dimensionality of the reduced feature. Under the aforementioned dimensionality restriction (i.e., the upper bound dimensionality of each basic feature space is set to three), the integral energy distribution of the first three eigenvalue of each feature space is summarized in Table 2
                        . In order to preserve the basic characteristic of the original feature, the reduced features should reserve 85 percent of the energy of the original features. For the location feature l, both eigenvalues are kept in order to make the integral energy exceed 85%. As for the appearance feature a, although the integral energy that the first three eigenvalues contains is still not over 85%, the upper bound dimensionality of each basic feature space is set to three as aforementioned. Therefore, the dimensionality of the appearance feature a is reduced to three. The dimensionality of the temporal feature t is reduced to 2 as the integral energy kept by the first two eigenvalues has exceeded 85%.

In order to demonstrate the overall performance of our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model, experiments are performed from three perspectives, respectively.

We first investigate the video saliency prediction performance on different feature channels (e.g., the spatial channel and the temporal channel). In addition, the common fusion approaches, including the multiplicative fusion, the additive fusion and the maximum fusion, are also evaluated. Specifically, for the multiplicative and additive fusion approaches, the balancing coefficient 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                            is set to 0.5. Notably, the saliency results from the spatial channel and the temporal channel do not have the same range of values, which naturally should be normalized so that they can be fused. However, as pointed out by [14], the raw saliency information of two channels without normalization is capable of promoting the accuracy of the fusion result. Therefore, the original saliency results of two channels are not normalized when they are fused together in the following experiments.

The spatial saliency detection result, temporal saliency detection result, spatio-temporal saliency detection result using multiplicative fusion strategy, spatio-temporal saliency detection result using additive fusion strategy, and spatio-temporal saliency detection result using maximum fusion strategy (MAX) are intuitively depicted in Fig. 4
                           . It’s noted that the spatial and temporal saliency does not have the same range of values as aforementioned. Hence, the additive fusion and maximum fusion easily tend to the response from one predominant channel; however, the multiplicative fusion can make full use of responses from both channels. In the given illustration of Fig. 4, the results of additive fusion and maximum fusion resemble the temporal saliency result because the response from the temporal channel is overall larger than that of spatial channel, while the multiplicative fusion produces a more balanced result (i.e., the fusion result represents large only when the spatial and temporal saliency values are both large).

In order to make the quantitative analysis intuitive, the ROC curves are reported in Fig. 5
                            and the AuROC scores are summarized in Table 1. Based on the quantitative results from Fig. 5 and Table 3
                           , the spatial channel (AuROC=0.7190) achieves a better prediction performance than the temporal channel (AuROC=0.6866). In addition, the spatio-temporal saliency via multiplicative combination of spatial and temporal saliency (AuROC=0.7444) can achieve better performance than each of the individual channel. So our advocated spatial and temporal saliency cues are complementary and can favor different salient aspects (i.e., stationary attention and temporal attention). As far as the related independent fusion approaches including multiplicative fusion (∗), additive fusion (+) and maximum fusion (MAX), the multiplicative fusion strategy (AuROC=0.7444) can get a better performance compared with the additive fusion strategy (AuROC=0.7179) and maximum fusion strategy (AuROC=0.6986).

As far as the independent fusion operators, the multiplicative fusion operator can obtain the best performance. So the independent multiplicative fusion result is taken as the observed spatio-temporal saliency value.

As mentioned in Section 4, similar to KR-LRK-MFS, both KR-LC-MFS and KR-LRL-MFS are utilized to fuse spatial and temporal saliency. Intuitively, KR-LC-MFS does not rely on the regularized coefficient 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           , but KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LRK-MFS do. In order to analyze their sensitivity to 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           , the spatio-temporal saliency detection results obtained by using KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS under different configurations of 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                            are given in Table 4
                           .

As can be seen, KR-LC-MFS is independent on the setting of 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           , which thereby gets a constant AuROC score, KR-LRL-MFS achieves its highest AuROC score when 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 0.1
                              
                           , and KR-LRK-MFS achieves the highest AuROC score when 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 0.5
                              
                            or 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 1.0
                              
                           . Therefore, in our implementation, we set 
                              
                                 λ
                              
                            to 0.1 for KR-LRL-MFS and 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 1.0
                              
                            for KR-LRK-MFS (we do not choose 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 0.5
                              
                            because it can achieve a lower standard deviation when 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 1.0
                                 )
                              
                           . In addition, one can also observe that KR-LRK-MFS can outperform both KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LC-MFS, with the highest AuROC score being 0.8339, 0.8332 and 0.8235, respectively.

In order to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed hybrid fusion approaches (i.e., KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LRK-MFS), the independent fusion approaches including multiplicative fusion (∗), additive fusion (+) and maximum fusion (MAX) are utilized to provide a baseline. In addition, the visual results on different fusion approaches are intuitively depicted in Fig. 6
                           . Compared with the independent fusion results from Fig. 6(c)–(e), our proposed hybrid fusion results from Fig. 6(f)–(h) can uniformly enhance the foreground regions, which will be helpful to the computer vision tasks such as foreground segmentation.

Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation results of different fusion methods are summarized in Fig. 7
                            and Table 5
                           . As depicted in Fig. 7 and Table 5, the proposed hybrid fusion strategy can outperform the independent fusion strategy.

As mentioned previously, the ground truth map is generated by the average of manual rectangle labels from 23 subjects, and then is smoothed by a Gaussian template with sigma=3. Hence, the ground truth map appears crude especially when the object owns a sharp contour (e.g., the object is circular, but the ground truth represents a rectangle-like shape as illustrated in the first row of Fig. 6). As a result, one may concern that the performance improvement of the proposed fusion approaches, as depicted in Table 5, may be not very persuasive due to the seemingly crude ground truth maps. Actually, the rationale of the evaluation dataset has been clarified in [52], and the dataset has been adopted to evaluate video saliency approaches [17]. Although this general support exists, we design two additional experiments to clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid fusion approach. More specifically, the first experiment implements spatial propagation on the independent fusion result to verify whether the performance improvement of the hybrid fusion strategy mainly benefits from spatial propagation or the mixed feature operation, and the second experiment gives a further comparison of the independent fusion approaches and the hybrid fusion approaches using 3 short video clips whose ground truth is manually labeled with accurate boundaries.

In the first additional experiment, spatial propagation on the independent fusion results is implemented as follows. Corresponding to the aforementioned definition,

                            can result in different levels of spatial propagation on the initial independent fusion result. Smaller

                            can generate larger degrees of spatial propagation, and vice versa. Under different 
                              
                                 α
                              
                           , spatial propagation on the independent fusion results is implemented. In addition, the corresponding evaluation results are summarized in Table 6
                           .

As depicted in Table 6, spatial propagation can make the corresponding independent fusion results obtain the highest AuROC scores when 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            = 10. Specifically, spatial propagation can lift the AuROC scores of the multiplicative fusion, the additive fusion, and the maximum fusion to 0.7739, 0.7374, and 0.7220 at most, with an AuROC score increment of 2.95%, 1.95%, and 2.34%, respectively. Although spatial propagation indeed raises the AuROC scores to a certain degree, the increment is mainly on account of the coarse ground truth maps. In order to fairly compare the increment from spatial propagation and the mixed feature operation, we take the multiplicative fusion result as a common input. Compared with the original multiplicative fusion result, KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS can improve the result with an AuROC score increment of 7.91%, 8.88%, and 8.95%, respectively. Although the AuROC score increment from the hybrid fusion approaches (i.e., KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS) may also benefit from the spatial propagation, the additional AuROC score increment from the mixed feature operation in KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS is approximately equal to 4.96%, 5.93%, and 6.00% (i.e., the total increment minus the increment from spatial propagation). Hence, the hybrid fusion plays an important role on spatio-temporal saliency prediction.

In the second additional experiment, for directly demonstrating the superiority of the proposed hybrid fusion approaches, we give a further comparison of the independent fusion approaches and the hybrid fusion approaches using 3 short video clips with the ground truth manually labeled by an accurate border. The 3 short videos contain 57 frames, 95 frames, and 81 frames, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 8
                           , the 3 short video clips are accurately labeled. Using this tiny dataset, composed of 3 short video clips, the fusion results from the independent fusion approaches and the hybrid fusion approaches are summarized in Table 7
                           . As shown in Table 7, the hybrid fusion approaches can overall outperform the independent fusion approaches. Even if the ground truth is defined by the accurate mask, the advantage of the hybrid fusion approaches still exists. Given this consideration, the hybrid fusion approaches indeed benefit moving objects detection as the generated spatio-temporal saliency map matches better to the moving object mask.

Intuitively, both spatial propagation and kernel methods (i.e., KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, or KR-LRK-MFS) can be thought of local diffusion operators because the diffusion influence of the reference unit is just from its local neighboring units. Because spatial propagation just considers the similarity in the location space, spatial propagation is an isotropic diffusion operator. However, kernel methods take account of the similarity in mixed feature space, so kernel methods are anisotropic diffusion operators. Due to the local diffusion character, spatial propagation or kernel methods are impossible to interact with the globally inherent spatial bias in the independent fusion result. Generally speaking, on the basis on the independent fusion result, the prediction performance improvement from kernel methods is mainly by virtue of the anisotropic diffusion operation which obeys Gestalt principles [45]. In order to confirm that, using our constructed dataset with tight ground truth, different levels of spatial propagation are implemented on the independent fusion results, and the corresponding evaluation results are summarized in Table 8
                           . As depicted in Table 8, spatial propagation (i.e., the isotropic diffusion operator) can lift the AuROC scores of the independent multiplicative fusion result, the independent additive fusion result, and the independent maximum fusion result to 0.8843, 0.7726, and 0.7626 at most, with a slight AuROC score increment of 1.06%, 1.13%, and 1.67%, respectively. Furthermore, KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS (i.e., the anisotropic diffusion operators) can lift the AuROC score of the independent multiplicative fusion result to 0.9118, 0.9173, and 0.9194, with an AuROC score increment of 3.81%, 4.36%, and 4.57%, respectively. Taking the independent multiplicative fusion result as a common input, the isotropic diffusion operator (i.e., spatial propagation) can just achieve a very slight improvement (i.e., 1.06%). However, the anisotropic diffusion operators (i.e., KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS) can achieve much larger performance improvements (i.e., 3.81%, 4.36%, 4.57%). Because of losing sight of spatial structure of objects, the isotropic diffusion operator (i.e., spatial propagation) achieves obviously inferior performance compared with anisotropic diffusion operators (i.e., kernel methods). As a complementary to the independent fusion result, kernel methods can effectively improve the prediction performance which is mainly by virtue of the anisotropic diffusion manipulation. As a whole, the superior performance of the proposed hybrid fusion strategy indeed benefits from the combination of spatial and temporal saliency on each individual unit which is outputted by the independent fusion strategy, and the connection constraint from the neighboring units which is provided by kernel methods.

Based on the above experiments, we can give a conclusion that the hybrid fusion approaches, using KR-MFS, can outperform the independent fusion approaches. In addition, the hybrid fusion approaches play a vital role on spatio-temporal saliency estimation, and benefit high-level computer vision tasks (e.g., moving object detection).

For demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model, our model is compared with six publicly available state-of-the-art approaches including Itti’s surprise model [3], Hou’s length increment coding [54], Guo’s quaternion Fourier transform [55], Seo’s self-resemblance model using steering kernel [11], Zhou’s phase discrepancy [56] and Li’s multi-scale wavelet transform [17]. Notice that the origin model from Li et al. [17] is a hybrid approach and adopts the bottom-up attention and top-down supervision. As our proposed model follows a bottom-up style, for fair comparison, the bottom-up model (i.e., the multi-scale wavelet transform) is picked up from the origin model (i.e., the probabilistic multi-task learning) [17] and taken as a comparison approach.

The representative results from various approaches are intuitively depicted in Fig. 9
                        . In addition, the first to sixth row stands for different video saliency detection scenarios in the documentary video subset, advertisement video subset, cartoon video subset, movie video subset and surveillance video subset, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 9(i)–(k), our proposed approach can robust locate the attentional regions under different situations. Compared with the six existing approaches, our approaches including KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LRK-MFS can overall enhance the foreground regions.

Moreover, quantitative results are comparatively reported in Fig.10
                         and Table 9
                        , in terms of ROC curves and AuROC scores respectively. Clearly, our proposed methods, including all the three variants, can outperform the other compared approaches. And among the three models we proposed, KR-LRK-MFS obtains better results than KR-LRL-MFS and KR-LC-MFS.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we first propose kernel regression in mixed feature spaces (KR-MFS) and its entity-models including kernel regression using local constant approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LC-MFS), kernel regression using local regularized linear approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRL-MFS) and kernel regression using local regularized kernel approximation in mixed feature spaces (KR-LRK-MFS). It is worthwhile to note that the application of KR-MFS includes but not limited to spatio-temporal saliency detection. For example, KR-MFS can be potentially used in many other applications, such as object poses estimation from multimodal images which are generated by emerging RGB-D (kinect-style) cameras. In our future work, we will attempt to extend our KR-MFS to more applications.

Based on KR-MFS, this paper proposes a hybrid fusion strategy for spatio-temporal saliency detection. From the visual organization and statistical analysis perspectives, necessity of the hybrid fusion has been discussed. In addition, experiments show that the hybrid fusion strategy, implemented by KR-LC-MFS, KR-LRL-MFS, and KR-LRK-MFS, can achieve better performance than the existing independent fusion strategy (i.e., the independent multiplicative fusion, the independent additive fusion, and the independent maximum fusion).

Benefiting from the hybrid fusion strategy, our proposed spatio-temporal saliency detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Followed by the neurobiological findings, our proposed spatio-temporal saliency model is in the aforementioned modular framework (i.e., the spatial and temporal saliency is first computed, and then fused). Therefore, the proposed model could be easily extended by replacing the corresponding module for specific demand.
