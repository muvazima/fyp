                  This research proposes a solution framework based on discrete-event simulation, sequential bifurcation (SB) and response surface methodology (RSM) to address a multi-response optimization problem inherent in an auto parts supply chain. The objective is to identify the most efficient operating setting that would maximize the logistics performance after the expansion of the assembly plant’s capacity due to market growth. In the proposed framework, we first construct a comprehensive simulation as a platform to model the physical flow of the auto parts operations. We then apply the SB to identify the most important factors that influence system performance. To determine the optimal levels of these key factors, we employ RSM to develop metamodels that best describe the relationship between key decision variables and the multiple system responses. We adapt the Derringer–Suich’s desirability function to find the optimal solution of the metamodels. Computational study shows that our method enables the greatest improvement on system performance. The proposed method helps the case firm develop insights into system dynamics and to optimize the operating condition. It realizes the performance objective of the auto parts supply chain without the need for additional fiscal investment.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The financial crisis has reduced global economic resilience. To address internal and external needs and to adjust economic structure and further stimulate domestic growth, the Chinese government has proposed a “Ten Industrial Development Plan.” Among the many industries, the automobile sector is recognized as the most important manufacturing and logistics industry, and it is the only sector of the manufacturing industry in the Ten Plan that also involves the tertiary (service) industry. Many car manufacturers in China nowadays have established their own third-party logistics providers (3PL) business unit, which serves only its own car manufacturers and practices JIT logistics in parts delivery. The 3PL parts logistics implement milk-run pickup and cross-docking distribution (abbreviated as 3PL-MRCD). When receiving pick-up orders, 3PL will collect parts from milk-run suppliers and transfer them to a regional cross-docking distribution center (CDDC), where parts are consolidated and loaded onto large trucks for truckload (TL) delivery.

Commensurate with the economic boom, China’s automobile market is expected to grow at a rate of 10–15% over the next decade (Feng, Zhang, Zhang, et al., 2011). Many car manufacturers are planning to expand and open new facilities to meet demand. For example, the joint venture of Dongfeng Honda and Peugeot is currently constructing a new assembly plant in Wuhan, central China. The demand for auto parts will understandably increase, causing parts logistics to change dramatically. Existing capacity of the 3PL is inadequate to fulfill the needs. How to respond to the change and effectively manage the parts logistics becomes a leading concern among car manufacturers.

To understand the impact of a plant’s capacity expansion on logistics needs and to identify the best operating settings, we first develop a generic 3PL-MRCD simulation model to serve as an experimental platform to evaluate this complex system. In the model, we simulate the trucks available for deployment in each milk-run pickup and the queuing discipline and experiment with the milk-run routes, total number of parts suppliers, number of receiving and shipping doors and queuing priorities, conveyor length, and dispatching rules for forklifts and trailers, among others. The simulation model evaluates the logistics performance following the expansion of the assembly plants. Through sequential bifurcation (Kleijnen, 2009), Multi-response Optimization approach (Montgomery, 2007) and simulation, the 3PL can identify the optimal parts supply chain design to achieve the manufacturer’s operational goals: minimizing the cycle time and maximizing the throughput.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Researchers have long studied the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Part of the VRP addresses milk-run operations, which assign a set of vehicles to visit a series of suppliers (customers) from whom they must collect (deliver) a required number of items. Du, Wang, and Lu (2007) develop a real-time vehicle dispatching system to consolidate the milk runs and to investigate the system settings by experimenting with several milk-run scenarios. Taillard, Laporte, and Gendreau (1996), Brandão and Mercer (1997), Petch and Salhi (2003), Olivera and Viera (2007), and Salhi and Petch (2007) study a variant of classic VRP; i.e., VRP with multiple routes, in which a vehicle can be assigned to more than one route in a planning horizon. Another variant is with time windows (VRPTW). Surveys on VRPTW can be found in Bräysy and Gendreau (2005a, 2005b). Azi, Gendreau, and Potvin (2007, 2010), and Macedo, Alves, and Valério de Carvalho (2011) apply an exact algorithm to tackle the VRP with time windows and multiple routes (MVRPTW).

Increasingly gaining attention in logistics, cross-docking (CD) rapidly consolidates shipments from suppliers to realize the scale economy of outbound delivery. A conventional distribution center (DC) has five functions: receiving, sorting, storing, retrieving and shipping. A cross-docking distribution center (CDDC) essentially implements JIT logistics inside the DC. By diminishing the need for storing and retrieving, the most expensive functions (Lee & Ho, 2002), CDDC can reduce inventory holding cost and enhance system efficiency.

Most research in CD deals with problems either at the strategic or the operational level. At the strategic level, Jayaraman and Ross (2003) and Ross and Jayaraman (2008) incorporate CD as a single layer in the supply chain and tackle the production, logistics, outbound and transportation (PLOT) problems. Sung and Song (2003) address the problem of locating CDDC and allocating vehicles for cross-docking the service supply chain network. At the operational level, much of the existing research focuses on vehicle scheduling. For example, Boysen, Fliedner, and Scholl (2008), Chen and Lee (2009), Soltani and Sadjadi (2010), and Vahdani and Zandieh (2010) consider the problem where there is only one receiving door and one shipping door. Chen and Song (2009), Boysen and Fliedner (2010), and Alpan, Larbi, and Penz (2011) extend the one-receiving-door-one-shipping-door setting to a two-door scenario. In addition, Rohrer (1995), Magableh, Rossetti, and Mason (2005), and Liu and Takakuwa (2009) examine the CD problem using simulation.

In summary, there is a vast amount of literature on milk runs and on cross-docking. Each individual problem by itself is already very difficult to tackle; thus, no researchers have hitherto addressed them simultaneously and examined the integrated system performance. Moreover, most of them focus on theoretical development and are forced to make rigid (unrealistic) assumptions that differ greatly from the real-world situations (Gue, 1999). In an auto parts supply chain, separating milk-run pickup and cross-docking operations is not feasible, since JIT systems are highly integrated and it is necessary to bring together all external and internal operations under one planning framework. To understand the impact of capacity expansion on manufacturers’ logistics performance, we develop a generic 3PL-MRCD simulation model to serve as an experimental platform, in which decision makers can examine the system performance under dynamic conditions and provide 3PL guidance for adapting to the ideal operations.

Computer-based simulation experiments are the only practical approach to optimize the operation of a complex system (Chen, Tsui, Barton, et al., 2006). Researchers usually employ response surface methodology (RSM) to identify the optimal factor settings. See Shang and Tadikamalla (1998), Irizarry et al. (2001a, 2001b), Shang, Li, and Tadikamalla (2004), Durieux and Pierreval (2004), Kumar and Nottestad (2006), Reis dos Santos and Porta Nova (2006), YalçInkaya and Mirac Bayhan (2009), and Ekren, Heragu, Krishnamurthy, et al. (2010). Even though simulation normally contains various decision factors (Kleijnen, Sanchez, Lucas, et al., 2005), researchers often assume that certain factors are insignificant and exclude them in advance when seeking system optimization. This is because the classical RSM was designed for physical experiments not for computer simulation. When factors increase the RSM experimental efforts grow exponentially, making it impractical and impossible to deal with problems having more than 10 factors (Kleijnen, 2008; Kleijnen et al., 2005). In short, RSM is less suitable for handling large number of factors simultaneously.

As our 3PL-MRCD model is complex and involves many factors, we propose an integrated simulation–optimization framework that first screens out the less important factors, and then applies RSM to identify the optimal conditions for crucial factors. System performances are frequently dominated by a few important factors, due to sparsity-of-effects principle (Montgomery, 2007; Myers, Montgomery, & Anderson-Cook, 2009). The initial screening phase can identify the less influential factors, require less experimental efforts, and suitably employ RSM. Many screening strategies have been proposed to identify important factors (Kleijnen, 2009). In this paper, we apply the sequential bifurcation (SB) screening method because it is the most efficient method specifically developed for simulation experiments (Kleijnen, 2009). SB combines group screening and a sequential step-down procedure, in which factor combinations studied are selected sequentially as the experiment progresses. Factor effects are gradually understood and then used to choose the next design (Bettonvil & Kleijnen, 1997). The method is extended to stochastic simulation by Kleijnen, Bettonvil, and Persson (2006) and Wan, Ankenman, and Nelson (2006, 2010). Our paper is the first to propose a framework to address screening-simulation–optimization issues for large-scale simulated systems with numerous factors. More explicitly, we successfully employ this framework to tackle a real-world 3PL problem originated from an automobile supply chain.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we elucidate the spatial structure and operations of the JIT-based auto parts supply chain under study and develop a comprehensive 3PL-MRCD simulation model. Section 4 focuses on the 3PL parts logistics and shows the results of factor-screening and response optimization on the parts supply chain. Section 5 concludes this research and provides future research directions.


                        Fig. 1
                         shows that parts suppliers (PSs) in China are clustered over three automobile industry zones along the eastern coastline: Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Circum-Bohai-Sea. Yet, a number of joint ventures, such as Dongfeng Honda, Dongfeng Peugeot, ChangAnFord, and Sichuan FAW Toyota, are located in central or southwest China; i.e., Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu, respectively (see “■” in Fig. 1). To realize economies of scale, regional CDDC are established in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing (see “●” within each industry zone). The joint ventures, the PSs and the 3PL have signed a tripartite agreement authorizing the 3PL to implement milk-run pickup and perform JIT distribution. Even though JIT is meant to be adopted when auto plants and their parts suppliers are close, it is still possible in the network with parts suppliers who are geographically distributed over long distance (Kaneko & Nojiri, 2008). Several milk-run regions are established based on the geographical location of PSs, parts volume, and replenishment frequencies. The lower left corner of Fig. 1 illustrates the milk-run regions (symbols “▴”) in the Pearl River Delta. Pickup trucks of the milk-run operation make sequential stops at auto parts suppliers who have received purchase orders to collect parts and deliver them to the CDDC.

The parts supply chain operates a pull system. Once the inventory level falls to the reorder point, assembly plants place a purchase order with CDDC, which aggregates orders and places them with parts suppliers. The purchase orders from a given milk-run region generally will not fill an entire truckload; they simply form a less-than-truckload (LTL). As a result, parts collected from a milk-run pickup are first transferred to CDDC, where parts are sorted according to the assembly plants and then consolidated and loaded onto large trucks for TL transportation. Fig. 1 has displayed the two types of transportation, where LTL is finished within the industry zones and TL stretches for more than 1000kilometer between CDDC and assembly plants.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows the flow of trucks and parts, which reflects the 3PL’s operations. The number of suppliers is different in each milk-run region, and they often are associated with specific parts (see column 1 of Fig. 2). LTL trucks travel back and forth between milk-run suppliers and CDDC, while TL trucks transport between CDDC and the warehouse of assembly plants (APs). Note that the available number of LTL and TL trucks are fixed in the production planning horizon.


                        Fig. 2 also depicts the internal operations of a CDDC, in which one side (receiving dock, RD
                           i
                        ) receives parts from suppliers, while the opposite side (shipping dock, SD
                           i
                        ) routes parts to the factory warehouse near assembly plants. Doors are the primary portal for unloading and loading parts, and the number of doors in receiving and shipping docks may differ. Only one truck at a time is permitted to a door. The LTL truck is also called inbound truck (IBT) in CDDC. As soon as an IBT arrives at CDDC, it is guided to an idle door or waits until a door becomes free. The queuing discipline for waiting trucks is first-come, first-served (FCFS). If more than one door is available, the IBT chooses a door randomly. Meanwhile, workers in CDDC are assigned with both unloading and scanning tasks of the IBT. During the unloading process, forklifts and trailers may be employed depending on the type of parts. Thereafter, parts are either loaded onto an outbound truck (OBT) directly through conveyors to form a full load, or they are sent to a temporary storage area until an OBT arrives. Long storage time is prohibited in JIT practice. Therefore, if any parts dwell at the temporary storage area for more than the threshold time (24hours), they are deemed late and should be transported immediately, often by special delivery arrangement, to the corresponding assembly plants.

The current demand in the Chinese auto market greatly exceeds supply, particularly for cars manufactured by joint ventures. To meet market demand, car manufacturers are highly motivated to maximize the supply-chain efficiency. Accordingly, the performance measures are efficiency-focused. The cycle time (CT) is defined as the average time parts spend at the entire 3PL-MRCD operations, from the time the parts start at the PS site to the time the parts arrive at the AP warehouse. Long CT contradicts the JIT philosophy and is very undesirable. Although time-related measures drive the performance metric, Number of Throughput (NT) is also examined explicitly. The NT is the sum of the shipments picked up at the PSs and delivered to the factory warehouse within a production cycle, say 30days. The objective is to identify the optimal operating conditions for the 3PL-MRCD system so as to minimize CT while maximizing NT.

We use Arena software (Kelton, Sadowski, & Sturrock, 2007) to support the process-centric modeling paradigm for the 3PL-MRCD supply chain. To efficiently design the model and test the decision logic, we start with partitioning the 3PL-MRCD system into seven obviously interrelated submodels, which is a necessary approach when developing a large-scale simulated system (Kelton et al., 2007). Fig. 3
                         is the sequential diagram that displays the flow of the parts through the 3PL-MRCD system. To visually set the submodels apart in the 3PL-MRCD system, we assign each submodel a shade and link them with a thick-arrow line.

                            is the capacity of an IBT. Therefore, if the loads exceed LTLMax
                           , then more IBTs are needed, and the IBTs with LTLMax
                            loads are routed directly to the APs since they have formed a truckload.

The transfer of parts between milk-run regions and CDDC is called LTL transportation, in which LTL trucks (IBTs) are the only transportation resources utilized. We assume that the average distance between the ith milk-run region and CDDC is DM
                           
                           (

                              C
                           . Note M and C subscripts represent the milk runs and the CDDC, respectively.

In a production planning horizon, the number of IBTs is a constant. TQM
                           
                           ,
                           
                              C
                            indicates the number of trucks (Truck Quantity) between milk run and CDDC. Each IBT has two states: busy and idle. Only when the IBT is in the idle state can it be ready for a new milk-run pickup. In the busy state, the IBT is engaged in a milk-run task. When it finishes unloading at the receiving dock in CDDC, it goes idle and becomes ready again for the next operation. When multiple IBTs are available, the longest idle time rule is followed; i.e., the IBT that is free for the longest time will be selected. The time to travel from one point to another depends only on the transportation velocity and the distance. We further assume that the speed of any IBT is constant, VM
                           
                           ,
                           
                              C
                           , whether loaded or empty.

At the receiving dock, three activities—unloading, scanning and scheduling—are involved. We assume there are NRD identical doors at the receiving dock. In column 2 of Fig. 2, the RD
                              c
                            denotes the cth receiving door. As soon as an IBT arrives at CDDC, it is guided to an idle receiving door or waits until a door becomes free. If more than one door is available, the IBT selects a free door randomly. The queuing rule for waiting IBTs is first-come, first-served (FCFS). Workers in CDDC are responsible for unloading IBTs. The unloading time depends on the load size of an IBT from a milk-run pickup (QLTL
                           ) and unloading time (UTRD
                           ) that follows a

                            triangular distribution (in minutes). After unloading, workers perform parts identification by applying bar scanners manually. Misreads occur occasionally due to package orientation or corrupt labels in the scanners. Misreads will result in time waste and prolonged waiting time for the subsequent task. Misreads are either re-scanned or manually inputted. Let STC
                            denote scanning time per unit part and β represent the probability of a misread. Scanned parts are routed out if there are OBTs idle at the shipping dock. Parts are either loaded onto an OBT to form a full load or undesirably placed in a temporary storage area and later uploaded to an OBT.

The temporary storage area serves as a buffer when an OBT is unavailable at the shipping dock. Let CC denote the capacity of the temporary storage area, in which parts also follow FCFS queuing discipline. Due to JIT requirements, parts are generally not allowed to stay in CDDC for more than a threshold time. We thus assume TT as the threshold time at the temporary storage area. At times, a separate truck from another logistics company has to be employed to pick up the overstayed parts.

Major resources inside CDDC include forklifts and trailers. They are dedicated to transferring parts between various stations in CDDC; i.e., receiving dock doors, temporary storage area, conveyor entrance and exit points, and shipping dock doors. We assume that the number of forklifts is NFC
                           , each moving at a velocity of FVC
                           . Similarly, the number of trailers is NTC
                           , each having a velocity of TVC
                           . Both forklifts and trailers have LUTFR
                            load and unload times per unit part at the beginning and end of each transport. We further assume that the capacity of forklifts and trailers is FCC
                            and TCC
                           , respectively. Waiting parts will choose forklifts over trailers since the former can load more shipments at a time and involve less manual labor than the latter. However, trailers are also needed since excessive forklifts will increase the risk of forklift injury or fatalities in an aisle with fixed width. The time to travel from one station to another depends on the transporter velocity and the distance.

An auto parts CDDC normally comprises a series of conveyors, which are a main mode of parts transfer from receiving dock to shipping dock. Conveyors are much safer but less flexible than forklifts. Let NCC
                            denote the number of conveyors, which are identical. Each conveyor has length CLC
                            and velocity CVC
                           .

Assume the number of shipping docks is NSD. Like a receiving dock, as soon as an OBT arrives at a shipping dock in CDDC, it is guided to an idle shipping door or waits until a door becomes free. If there is more than one free door, the OBT selects a free door randomly. The queuing rule for a waiting OBT is FCFS. Let QTL
                            denote the truckload capacity of an OBT. The loading time in minutes, LTSD

The transfer of parts between CDDC and factory warehouse is called TL (truckload) transportation, in which full-load trucks (OBTs) are the only transportation resources utilized. OBT—much like IBT—has busy and idle states and priorities. The IBT and OBT are not substitutable in the auto parts supply chain due to different truck size. The busy state of an OBT starts from receiving a TL transportation instruction, to its return to CDDC after completing a TL transportation task. Let TQC

In this section, we study a 3PL affiliated with a Chinese and Japanese joint venture. It employs 800 workers and produces 240,000 cars annually. The parts supply chain stretches more than 1000kilometer between parts suppliers (PSs) and the assembly plant (AP1) located in Wuhan (see Fig. 1). Past success and the booming Chinese market necessitate an additional plant (AP2). Once the new AP2 becomes operational, the joint venture plans to increase its output steadily through ten developmental stages, until it reaches maximum capacity. We develop a simulation model to delineate the supply chain and to check if and when the current capacity of the 3PL must adapt in order to meet the dual logistics needs of the two assembly plants after AP2 joins the operations.

Parameters associated with parts flow of the 3PL are summarized in Table 1
                        . Many data are from the 3PL’s IT Department, which maintains trucks’ records and CDDC’s operating conditions. To derive additional information, our research team has also spent a month making field observations.

Since the production cycle of the assembly plants is a month, we treat our model as a terminating simulation, which operates 30days in a run but is preceded by five warm-up days. The 3PL-MRCD operates 16hours a day, from 08:00 to 24:00. The initial location for both IBTs and OBTs is the CDDC. Because all members within the supply chain share one information network and are interconnected online, the lead time for milk-run pickup is 0. Specifically, when receiving a milk-run pickup order from assembly plants, the CDDC will assign an available IBT to the pickup task immediately. IBTs stay at the CDDC for their next assignment after they are unloaded, while OBTs travel back to the CDDC as soon as they complete unloading at the factory warehouse. We follow Sargent (2008) to validate the simulation model. The two engineers from the 3PL worked closely with the authors throughout the project and have verified the model results.

The objective of this study is to understand the changes of the 3PL-MRCD performance due to the addition of the assembly plant capacity. The 3PL can thus respond to changes and adapt the operating settings to better serve the supply chain. Since JIT mandates the 3PL to deliver small lots frequently, capacity expansion of the assembly system has a direct implication on replenishment frequencies, which in turn have a great bearing on the performance of cycle time (CT) and throughput (NT) (see Fig. 4
                        ). Since the case firm uses a 10-stage capacity expansion plan, we vary the replenishment frequencies from stages 1 to 10. The corresponding interarrival times, BTM
                        
                        (
                        
                           i
                        
                        ), can be found in column 2 of Table 2
                        .

To better understand the performance of NT, we divide NT into two groups (see Table 2): shipments picked up at the PSs (Number of in-throughput, NIT) and parts received by the factory warehouse (Number of out-throughput, NOT). From Fig. 4, we have the following observations.
                           Observation 1
                           In the initial stages when AP2 starts to function, CT has a slight decline and NT has a marked increase.

In Fig. 4, we found CT declines from 25.32hours to 23.02hours when parts replenishment frequency changes from level 1 to 8. Both NIT and NOT have also increased significantly (see Table 2), which leads to a great surge (from 19,219 to 37,438) in NT. The results are desirable to the 3PL since both performance measures have improved. We conclude that the acceleration of parts’ replenishment frequencies has a positive impact on both CT and NT. This is because reasonably high replenishment frequencies quicken LTL transport from PSs to form a TL delivery, which shortens outbound parts’ waiting time in CDDC and ultimately increases parts assembled by APs.
                           Observation 2
                           After the AP gradually reaches its maximum production capacity, a significant shift from the base level occurs to CT, and NT remains relatively stable.

Note that in Fig. 4 when parts replenishment frequency exceeds level 8, a significant unfavorable surge of CT occurs (from 23.02hours to 85.32hours at Stage 10). Although more parts (NIT) are dispatched by PSs due to more frequent delivery, the actual number of parts arrivals at the assembly plants remain fixed, at about 18,500–18,600 loads (see column 7 in Table 2). A rational explanation is that the existing capacity of the 3PL is unable to keep pace with the growth in logistics needs. Many OBTs have already reached very high utilization, and they are too busy and/or too full to be scheduled for additional shipments. As a result, these tasks would queue up and endure unacceptably long delays. Therefore, the 3PL needs to revamp their parts delivery process from PSs to the APs and identify changes that are needed to best improve CT and NT.

The 3PL-MRCD simulation model has 58 factors that may contribute to the variation of CT and NT, and 21 of them are controllable factors (see Table 3

                         (see Table 1). According to the Pareto (80/20) principle, there are a few factors that are actually dominant and active in a system. In order to identify the few important factors in the 3PL-MRCD system, we chose sequential bifurcation (SB) as our factor screening tool.

SB is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that the simulation outputs (responses) of interest can be represented by the following metamodels:

The first step of SB is to aggregate all K factors in the simulation model into a single large group, and test whether the whole group has a significant effect. If the group indeed has a significant effect, then the second step is to split the group into two subgroups (bifurcation) and test the significance of the subgroup effects. Similarly, SB will next discard the unimportant subgroup and split the significant subgroup into smaller subgroups until all the important factors are identified. Finally, the individual factors labeled as important and unimportant are tested and estimated.

The staff members at 3PL are familiar with the factor settings and offer insights into the effects of factor changes on CT and NT. From their inputs and our experimenting with alternatives, we chose the two levels of individual factors so that changing the level from −1 to +1 does not decrease the expected CT value, but also will not increase NT value. Table 3 shows the influences of factors, where the symbols “↑” and “↓” in the rightmost two columns signify the increasing and decreasing monotonicity, respectively. For example, if NRD (the #9 factor) is changed from −1 (30 doors) to +1 (10 doors), CT will not decrease and NT will not increase. Note that fewer receiving doors will lengthen the waiting time and CT; and since fewer parts can enter into the CDDC, NT will not increase.

Since there are two responses in our study, we use SB to search for the critical factors for CT and NT, respectively. For CT, we first place all 21 factors into one single group and test if the group effect on CT is significant. Table 4

                           =0.05, we conclude that the main effect of the aggregated group of 21 factors is significantly different. In the next step, we split the current group into two subgroups. To increase the efficiency of SB, subgroups are split such that the first new subgroup is a power of two; i.e., grouping #1–16 due to 24, while the other contains the rest of the factors.

In our case, SB stops after 9 splits. The three most important factors and their corresponding estimated main effects are shown in the rightmost column of Fig. 5a in dotted-line frame. They are factors 9, 12, and 13, corresponding to NRD, TQM

Through additional experiments, we observed similar performance when slightly lowering the level to (29, 69, 79). It implies that there will be idle resources if the 3PL maintains the capacity level at NRD

Like SB, RSM is also a sequential procedure and has been applied to stochastic models. The first step of RSM is to find an appropriate approximation for the true functional relationship between the set of independent variables and responses. The following first-order response model is assumed:

For each simulation experiment, the output of CT and NT are measured. The metamodel in Eq. (6) represents the relationship that reflects the responses (CT and NT) of 
                              d
                           . To fit Eq. (6), we use a 2
                              k
                            full factorial design. If the first-order is unfit, we explore the second-order models, Eq. (7), by combining central composite design (CCD). In general, CCD contains a 2
                              k
                            factorial (or fractional factorial) with nF
                            runs (i.e., 2
                              k
                            full factorial design), 2k axial runs (k is the number of decision factors), and nC
                            center runs.

                            factorial design with central run is first designed to fit first-order regression models for both responses (CT and NT) in Eq. (6). Since analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggests that curvature is significant, the first-order models are replaced by the second-order polynomial model, Eq. (7). We use Central Composite Design (CCD), including 23 full factorial design with 6 (=2*3) axial and one central runs, and replicate the simulation 5 times at each non-central point and 10 times at each central point; i.e., (8+6)*5+10=80. Eqs. (10) and (11) below show the metamodels of the simulated responses (CT and NT):

The optimal parameter levels, including natural and coded values, are summarized in Table 5
                           , along with the predicted system performance measures and the resulting desirability. Fig. 6
                            displays the predicted desirability level of “1” in the 3D surface plot along the NRD and TQM

Since the optimal settings of factors are determined by applying the RSM metamodels, it is necessary to confirm the optimality through multiple simulation runs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is the validation criterion and is derived by MAPE=|(w
                        −
                        y)/w
                        |×100%, where w is the simulation output, y is the output predicted by the metamodel, and the threshold of MAPE is set at 3% (Kleijnen & Sargent, 2000). In addition, we seek to verify that the optimal factor levels for NRD, TQM
                        
                        ,
                        
                           C
                        , and TQC
                        
                        ,
                        
                           F
                         indeed significantly contribute to the improvement of CT and NT.

We compare the simulation outputs from four input settings: (i) all factors at current level (Table 3, column 4); (ii) all factors at low level (Table 3, column 3); (iii) important factors at low level while others at high level; and (iv) important factors at the optimal level (Table 5, column 3) while others at high level. Different pseudorandom number (PRN) streams are employed to generate the IID outputs.

Respectively, Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         display outputs of CT and NT through 25 independent replications using a common random number (CRN) in four combinations. These CRNs are meant to reduce the variances of the estimated group effect (Law, 2007). In the figures, the 25 metamodel optimums with mean values of CT=26.6533 and NT=60,809 (see Table 5) are displayed in up-pointing triangle lines. The MAPE values obtained from the 25 confirmatory runs for both responses are in desired levels, since MAPECT
                        =|27.0432–26.6533|/27.0432×100%=1.4% and MAPENT
                        =|59,917–60,689|/59,917×100%=1.5%, far below the threshold of 3%. Therefore, we conclude that the metamodels of Eqs. (10) and (11) are effective decision support tools.

The line with square markers reflects the performance if the 3PL does not respond to assembly capacity expansion, whereas the down-pointing triangle line exhibits the performance when all 21 operational factors are candidates for change. The circle and up-pointing triangle lines reveal the performance if the 3PL only improves the important factors; i.e., (NRD,
                        TQM

Conversely, the three key factors by themselves have already accounted for more than 90% of performance improvement in both CT and NT (see the gaps between the square line and the circle or up-pointing triangle line).

                         lines are very close, indicating that the predicted responses based on values of (30,70,80) are slightly higher than practical needs (28,66,78).

Therefore, at the beginning the 3PL needs to make only a small investment to optimize the few important logistics operations. It can later examine whether the results satisfy the target set by the manufacturer. If not, it can improve other operations gradually in light of their importance. For example, in our case one can then increase the number of forklifts in CDDC (#11 factor) and shorten the threshold time at temporary storage area (#14 factor).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Benefits of a milk-run operation include improved truck utilization, cargo loading efficiency, reduced traffic congestion at assembly plants, reduced total operating costs, and reduced pollution released to the environment. In this research, we proposed a hybrid modeling and solution approach that contains discrete-event simulation, sensitivity analysis, SB factor-screening design, and RSM optimization methodology for a complex system, which is motivated by the need of a Chinese 3PL in the automobile industry. We first develop a generic simulation framework that matches the current operations of most automobile 3PLs in China. Through the simulation model, we study the CT and NT responses and address the what-if questions for the 3PL by modifying the inputs of interest, such as the number of LTL trucks, dock doors, and forklifts. We then focus on a specific 3PL located in Wuhan. Using sensitivity analysis, we find that capacity expansion in the short term improves performance measures (CT and NT), and in the long term the 3PL will fail to keep up with the growth of the logistics needs. For long-term planning, we apply the SB to effectively and efficiently identify the important factors that significantly contribute to CT and NT. We also apply RSM in the post-screening stage to help determine the optimal levels of those key factors.

Due to the complexity of the auto parts supply chain, screening design to identify essential operational variables has gained much attention from a broad array of practitioners and researchers. Our research has innovatively combined SB and RSM to screen factors and optimize system performance for a 3PL-MRCD, a very complex stochastic-dynamic problem. The proposed SB-RSM model helps to configure an efficient and effective system.

Finally, we compare the RSM optimum and the other three input combinations to confirm the advantage of the proposed method. The few important factors identified by the SB indeed have the greatest impact on performance of CT and NT. The optimal solution does lead to highly desired outputs welcome by the 3PL.

Although we have identified the optimal operating conditions for a real-world 3PL-MRCD, there is still a need for further research. Possible future research directions include: (i) extending the SB-RSM model to other 3PL applications; (ii) comparing RSM with Kriging, which is derived from a larger global experimental domain (Ankenman, Nelson, & Staum, 2010) known as global metamodel; (iii) exploiting the SB proposed by Bettonvil and Kleijnen (1997) to multiple responses cases; and (iv) considering other performance measures such as cost, waiting time and resource utilization as they are related to congestion issues, which may become serious when the capacity is fully loaded. Finally, we can develop a simulation model with fewer operations (types) that are comparable so as to reduce the number of factors and simplify the optimization procedure.
