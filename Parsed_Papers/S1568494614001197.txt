                  This paper proposes an efficient adaptive hierarchical artificial immune system (AHAIS) for complex global optimization problems. In the proposed AHAIS optimization, a hierarchy with top-bottom levels is used to construct the antibody population, where some antibodies with higher affinity become the top-level elitist antibodies and the other antibodies with lower affinity become the bottom-level common antibodies. The elitist antibodies experience different evolutionary operators from those common antibodies, and a well-designed dynamic updating strategy is used to guide the evolution and retrogradation of antibodies between two levels. In detail, the elitist antibodies focus on self-learning and local searching while the common antibodies emphasize elitist-learning and global searching. In addition, an adaptive searching step length adjustment mechanism is proposed to capture more accurate solutions. The suppression operator introduces an upper limit of the similarity-based threshold by considering the concentration of the candidate antibodies. To evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of algorithms, a series of comparative numerical simulations are arranged among the proposed AHAIS, DE, PSO, opt-aiNet and IA-AIS, where eight benchmark functions are selected as testbeds. The simulation results prove that the proposed AHAIS is an efficient method and outperforms DE, PSO, opt-aiNet and IA-AIS in convergence speed and solution accuracy. Moreover, an industrial application in RFID reader collision avoidance also demonstrates the searching capability and practical value of the proposed AHAIS optimization.
