                  Firms often sell products in bundles to extract consumer surplus. While most bundling decisions studied in the literature are geared to integrated firms, we examine a decentralized supply chain where the suppliers retain decision rights. Using a generic distribution of customers’ reservation price we establish equilibrium solutions for three different bundling scenarios in a supply chain, and generate interesting insights for distributions with specific forms. We find that (i) in supply chain bundling the retailer’s margin equals the margin of each independent supplier, and it equals the combined margin when the suppliers are in a coalition, (ii) when the suppliers form a coalition to bundle their products the bundling gain in the supply chain is higher and retail price is lower than when the retailer bundles the products, (iii) the supply chain has more to gain from bundling relative to an integrated firm, (iv) the first-best supply chain bundling remains viable over a larger set of parameter values than those in the case of the integrated firm, (v) supplier led bundling is preferable to separate sales over a wider range of parameter values than if the retailer led the bundling, and (vi) if the reservation prices are uniformly distributed bundling can be profitable when the variable costs are low and valuations of the products are not significantly different from one another. For normally distributed reservation prices, we show that the bundling set is larger and the bundling gain is higher than that for a uniform distribution.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

Price bundling is the sale of two or more separate products in a single package (Stremersch & Tellis, 2002). SAP and Microsoft, for instance, offer their products as software suites comprising several different programs. This is an instance of pure bundling by an integrated firm where only the bundle is sold. In the TV industry pure bundles of information goods are offered in a supply chain setting, where channels aggregate content from a number of third-party firms. An example of pure bundling involving a classical retailer and independent suppliers is that German electronics retailer Conrad sells certain low-end electric guitars and low-end amplifiers only bundled together. On 22.02.2010, for instance, Conrad offered 20 low-end guitars on the website www.conrad.de with a mean price of €132.38, and 15 low-end amplifiers with a mean price of €111.51. Also 7 bundles consisting of a guitar and an amplifier that were not sold separately were offered. In most cases one of the suppliers conferred his brand name to the bundle and the mean bundle price was €194.71, i.e. on average a discount of 20.17% was given. Examples of mixed bundling in a supply chain are McDonald, who sells both drinks and burgers individually as well as in bundles at discounted prices, and Amazon, who offers its customers the choice of buying single books or books bundled with others at discounted prices.

Various explanations for bundling have been proposed in literature. The use of bundling for price discrimination by an integrated monopolist has been studied in Adams and Yellen (1976), Bitran and Ferrer (2007), Eckalbar (2006), Fang and Norman (2006), Hanson and Martin (1990), Hubbard, Saha, and Lee (2007), McAffe, McMillan, and Whinston (1989), McCardle, Kumar, and Tanga (2007), Oldenrog and Skiera (2000), Salinger (1995), Schmalensee (1984) and Stremersch and Tellis (2002). The assumptions of this stream of research are summarized in Oldenrog and Skiera (2000) as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              The variable costs of the products are constant.

The variable costs of a bundle is determined by the sum of the costs of the products that comprise the bundle.

Consumers require only one unit of a product.

The reservation price for the bundle is determined by the sum of the reservation prices for the products comprising the bundle.

We demonstrate the intuition behind pure bundling using the reservation prices shown in Table 1
                        . We start out by assuming zero variable costs. In Example 1 the optimal prices for selling the items separately are clearly 90 for product 1 and 80 for product 2. It follows that the firm can sell each product to customers A and B, making a profit of 90*2+80*2=340. If the price for a pure bundle comprising both products is set at 180, both consumers buy the bundle and the firm can increase her profit by 20–180*2=360. To understand this phenomenon let us investigate the consumer surplus defined as the difference between the reservation price of the consumer and the price set by firm. In the separate sales case consumer A has a positive surplus of 100–90=10 for product 1 and consumer B of 100–80=20 for product 2, so that total consumer surplus is 30. If the firm bundles, only consumer B has a surplus of 190–180=10, i.e. profit has increased because the 10 units of difference to the average willingness to pay of 90 have been transferred from product 1 to 2 for consumer A. As can be seen, the variations in reservation prices by products and consumers are moderated significantly when the products are sold as bundles, creating a greater opportunity for extracting the consumer surplus. As shown in Example 2 of Table 1, this effect is stronger if the reservation prices are perfectly negatively correlated with a high variance and have a high mean valuation. Here, the optimal profit when selling separately is 60*4=240, while the optimal bundle profit is 160*2=320 and all consumer surplus is extracted. On the other hand, bundling is not beneficial in cases of positive correlation as the variance in reservation prices is not reduced. In Example 3, for instance, the optimal profit is 80*2+60*2=280 for both separate sales and bundling. Also, the bundling gain is reduced if the mean valuations of the products differ as the product with the smaller value limits the amount of willingness to pay that can be transferred between the products. In Example 4 in the separate sales it is optimal to sell Product 1 to consumer A only, resulting in a profit of 100+20*2=140. The bundling profit, on the other hand, is 40*2=80 only, as willingness to pay can only be transferred for consumer B. Bundling also looses its appeal for products with significant variable costs. Assuming variable costs of 85 in Example 1 results in a profit of 360−85*4=20 for the bundle. In the case of separate sales it is optimal to set the price per unit to 100 and to sell product 1 to consumer A and to sell product 2 to consumer B only, which results in a profit of 15*2=30. Thus, in the case of significant variable costs it is better to focus on the consumers with high valuations only, i.e. in our case it is better to sell two units for a margin of 100–85=15 instead of selling four units at a margin of 90–85=5.

Do these findings hold in a supply chain setting, too? In this paper we investigate the profitability of bundling if the maximization of the profit function of an integrated firm is replaced by the equilibrium of a game between a retailer and several suppliers. In particular we investigate situations where either all parties coordinate (first-best supply chain bundling), the suppliers coordinate (supplier led bundling) or the each party acts autonomously (retailer led bundling). While some of our findings are as expected, others are somewhat counter-intuitive. Our first finding that the retailer’s margin equals the supplier’s margin establishes that the equilibrium is Pareto optimal. The second finding that a supplier led bundling obtains higher gains in the supply chain than that of a retailer led bundling stems from the fact that in the later case profit must be divided equally between n
                        +1 parties (with n suppliers) whereas in the former case profit is divided equally between 2 parties, the retailer and the coalition of suppliers. The third finding that the supply chain has more to gain from bundling relative to an integrated firm may not appear intuitive but it follows from the fact that in the separate sales scenario the supply chain profit is smaller than that of the integrated firm (because of double marginalization), and in the first-best bundling scenario both profits are identical. Therefore the net change in profit in the supply chain exceeds the corresponding value in the integrated firm. The fourth finding that the first-best supply chain bundling remains viable over a larger set of parameter values follows from the third finding above in that the parameter values that cause the net change in profit to be negative in the integrated firm scenario may continue to generate a positive net change in the first-best supply chain scenario. The fifth finding that supplier led bundling is preferable to separate sales over a wider range of parameter values than if the retailer led the bundling follows from our second finding for reasons similar to that explained in the fourth finding. The sixth finding that bundling can be profitable when the variable costs are low and valuations of the products are not significantly different from one another is specific to the case when reservation prices are uniformly distributed. In this case the profit made with the bundle is higher for supplier led bundling than for the integrated firm if the valuations are about the same, but bundling remains viable over a smaller set of parameter values. For normally distributed reservation prices the bundling gain is always higher than that for the integrated firm and bundling is profitable for a larger set of parameters.


                        Oldenrog and Skiera (2000) start their investigation of the benefits of bundling strategies with the observation that the reservation price distribution for the bundle is obtained as the convolution of the reservation price distributions of the components (Assumption 4 above). The variance of this distribution is clearly dependent on the correlation between the reservation prices of the products comprising the bundle and, therefore, it may or may not exceed the variances of individual products. If, in addition, the correlation between the reservation prices of the items and the respective variable costs are low, a monopolist can extract more consumer surplus by offering the bundle instead of selling the items separately (see, e.g., Oldenrog & Skiera (2000)). Therefore bundling is especially attractive for information goods of which large numbers can be bundled conveniently (see Bakos & Brynjolfsson (1999)). In the case of independent symmetric log-concave reservation price distributions Fang and Norman (2006) derive conditions for the profitability of pure bundling.

Various methods have been used to arrive at these findings: McCardle et al. (2007) and Eckalbar (2010), for instance, employ uniformly distributed reservations prices to study bundling decisions involving two items. While interesting analytical results can be obtained using uniform distributions, modeling the impact of correlation and tackling bundles consisting of more than two products can still be cumbersome. For this reason researchers such as Oldenrog and Skiera (2000) and Schmalensee (1984) employ simulation techniques with a normal distribution. The results obtained in Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) rely on Chebyshev bounds, while Fang and Norman (2006) use the notion of peakedness of distributions.

Note that Assumption 4 above is not valid if the items are complements or substitutes. In Venkatesh and Kamakura (2003) it is found that the willingness-to-pay distribution of the bundle is shifted upwards by product complementarity. Thus the bundle-discount narrows and the bundling set (defined as the set of variable costs and distribution-parameters of reservation price that ensure that bundling is profitable) becomes larger. On the other hand, substitutes are better sold unbundled. Also the existence of a bundle-price can influence consumers’ evaluation (see Johnson, Herrmann, & Bauer (1999) and Drumwright (1992)). As shown by Soman and Gourville (2001) the sunk cost nature of a bundle price can decrease a consumers likelihood of consuming a paid-for service. If a firm can achieve cost savings through bundling, Assumption 2 above is violated. Consolidators, for instance, can obtain operational cost savings, and module integrators can utilize scale economies and reduce coordination costs. Evans and Salinger (2005) show that such cost savings on the supply side can be substantial and a rationale for bundling per se.

Bundling can also be explained as a competitive strategy. As shown by Nalebuff (2004) an incumbent with a monopoly can deter entry by bundling two goods so that each one protects the monopoly of the other one. In Gal-Or (2004) the profitability of bundling is evaluated in the context of negotiations between a monopolist and intermediaries that sell its products to consumers. In such a setting, the monopolist can utilize bundling to block negotiations between the intermediaries and a rival firm, which competes against the monopolist in a complementary market. Bakos and Brynjolfsson (2000) show that in addition to the reduction of the variance of the willingness to pay distribution bundling offers a number of competitive advantages in information goods markets.

Several works deal with supply chain issues in the case of bundling from the viewpoint of procurement and inventory policy: Bulut, Gürler, and Se¸n (2009) look at revenue management of bundles, Gürler, Öztop, and Se¸n (2009) study optimal bundle formation and pricing of products with limited stock and supply. Rosenthal, Zydiak, and Chaudhry (1995) study vendor selection and bundling, and Ernst and Kouvelis (1999) investigate inventory control problems for mixed bundles. Other works study mechanisms to distribute the revenues obtained from selling a pure bundle among the contributing parties. For instance, Ginsburgh and Zang (2001) show that the equal distribution of the revenue from a museum pass among the museums actually visited by the particular card holder resembles the Shapely value of the respective cooperative game.

The distribution channel aspect of a supply chain has only recently been investigated. For the separate sales case it is well-known that an uncoordinated determination of margins leads to a suboptimal retail price, reduced volume and a lower profit for all parties (see, e.g., Jeuland & Shugan (1983) and Parakis & Roels (2007)). One therefore can speculate that this coordination problem becomes more severe in the case of bundling, as all supply chain members must jointly agree on a bundle price and margins, whereas a simple coordination between the retailer and each supplier suffices in the case of separate sales. Thus, potential gains of price discrimination might well be offset by losses if margins are set independently, leading to a decrease in the viability of bundling in a supply chain. Bhargava (2012) studies pure and mixed bundling in a vertical distribution channel with uniformly distributed valuations in the range [0,1] where manufacturers set prices as Stackelberg leaders. He finds that this setting leads to overpricing by the manufacturers and that the bundle accounts for a smaller fraction of sales than would occur for the integrated firm in the case of mixed bundling. General aspects of the coordination of product, process and supply chain design are studied, e.g., in Petersen, Handfield, and Ragatz (2005) and Rungtusanatham and Forza (2005).

In this paper we study the use of pure bundling for price discrimination in a two-tier supply chain with one retailer and several manufacturers, based on Assumptions 1–4 above. We assume that all supply chain partners are equally strong so that coordination is achieved via a Nash equilibrium of a one-shot game. We compare the bundling set and bundling gain when the production and retail functions are integrated in a single firm, with those of three supply chain scenarios with different levels of coordination. In the first-best scenario, bundle margins are determined so as to optimize the profit of the whole supply chain. At the other end of the spectrum is the scenario where the retailer gets each supplier to participate in the bundle, and a non-cooperative one-shot game between the retailer and the suppliers yields a positive retailer and supplier margin of the bundle. Between these two extremes, lies a scenario where the suppliers coordinate with one another to initiate bundling and enter, as a single party, into a two-party non-cooperative one-shot game with the retailer. In Section 2 we develop a characterization of the equilibrium solutions for each of these scenarios for the supply chain as well as the integrated firm, using generalized reservation price distributions. Then we investigate the application of these findings and quantify the loss of efficiency for a scenario with specific distributions of reservation prices. First, we analyze the case of uniform distribution of reservation prices in Section 3. This is followed by a study using the normal distribution that enables us to analyze the impact of correlated reservation prices in Section 4. We conclude by summarizing our main findings and proposing areas for further research in Section 5.

                        . According to Assumption 4 the distribution of the reservation price for the bundle G(p) is given as the distribution of the sum the reservation prices. We will assume that G(p) possesses the IGFR-property. The demand for the bundle is given then as d(p)=
                        S(1−
                        G(p)), where p is the price of the bundle, and the price elasticity of demand is given as ∊(p)=
                        p g(p)/(1−
                        G(p)).

Depending on the mechanism used for setting margins, six different scenarios exist. These are summarized in Table 2
                        .

Common to all scenarios is that K decision makers set their respective profit margin h
                        
                           k
                        , k
                        =1,…,
                        K so as to maximize their profit h
                        
                           k
                        
                        D(q), where D(q) is the respective expected demand at price q. In the case of unbundled scenarios D(q)=
                        d
                        
                           j
                        (p
                        
                           j
                        ), while in the bundling scenarios D(q)=
                        d(p). Differentiating h
                        
                           k
                        
                        D(q) leads to the following set of K profit optimizing equations, one for each decision maker:

As all supply chain members are equally powerful, the decision to bundle is Pareto-optimal, i.e. each party makes a higher profit with the bundle than that in the separate sales case. Clearly, supplier j would agree to bundle if he can make a profit larger than

Several possibilities exist for establishing the bundle margins in a supply chain. The first best solution for the supply chain is obtained if the margins are set to maximize the profit the supply chain makes with the bundle Π
                        =(m
                        +
                        w)d(p), where d(p)=
                        S(1−
                        G(p)) is the demand for the bundle and p

                        m

                        w
                        +
                        c. Clearly, here the solution resembles the bundling case of the integrated firm, and it can be shown that the supply chain is coordinated. Thus, in the “supply chain, first best” scenario p

                         and Π

                        . However, now the separate sales alternative is not the unbundled integrated firm but the unbundled supply chain, which yields a profit of Π

The fact that in the case of electronic retailer Conrad usually one of the suppliers conferred his brand name to the bundle is an indication that in this case bundling was initiated by suppliers who then entered the margin determination game with the retailer as a single party. Note that there is an implicit “supply chain, supplier bundling” when an intermediary such as a wholesaler purchases the items from different suppliers and sells them as a bundle to a retailer or when a dominant supplier procures the other n
                        −1 items needed for the bundle. In this scenario, the retailer’s goal is to maximize her profit π
                        =
                        md(p) and the suppliers want to maximize θ
                        =
                        wd(p). Thus, here K
                        =2 in (6) so that the optimal price of the bundle is given as

This implies (i) when the suppliers form a coalition to bundle their products the bundling gain in the supply chain is higher and retail price is lower than when the retailer bundles the products and (ii) supplier led bundling is preferable to separate sales over a wider range of parameter values than if the retailer led the bundling.

Summarizing we can therefore state the following Theorem:
                           Theorem 1
                           
                              The bundling set of the supply chain first best scenario is at least as large as than the bundling set of the integrated firm. The bundling set of the supply chain retailer bundling scenario is not larger than that of the supply chain supplier bundling scenario which is not larger than the bundling set of the supply chain first best scenario: R
                              
                                 i
                              
                              ⊆
                              R
                              
                                 f
                              
                              , R
                              
                                 r
                              
                              ⊆
                              R
                              
                                 s
                              
                              ⊆
                              R
                              
                                 f
                              
                              .
                           

This implies that although the profit with bundling in the supply chain first-best scenario will be the same as that in the integrated firm scenario, supply chain bundling will be preferred to separate sales over a wider range of parameter values. It also implies that of the three supply chain bundling scenarios in Table 2, retailer led bundling will be the least preferable.

                         we derive results for specific reservation price distributions. For clarity of exposition, we at first limit the number of suppliers to two in the following analyses, and then investigate larger bundles. We start by looking at the case where reservation prices are independent and follow a uniform distribution. Then we study bundling in the case of normally distributed reservation prices with various degrees of correlation.

We assume that the reservation price (willingness to pay) for product 1 is uniformly distributed in the range [0, r], r
                        ⩾1 and the reservation price of product 2 is uniformly distributed in the range [0,1] (see Eckalbar (2010) for a similar setting). Thus, in the unbundling case G
                        1(p
                        1)=

                        (p) increases with p while the denumerator decreases with p, (13) is IGFR. For the variable costs we assume that they are proportional to the valuation of the product, i.e., c
                        1
                        =
                        γr and c
                        2
                        =
                        γ so that c
                        =(1+
                        r)γ with 0⩽
                        γ
                        ⩽1. Clearly, while simplifying the analysis by reducing the number of parameters, linking the ratio of the variable costs c
                        1/c
                        2 to the distribution of reservation prices limits the generality of results. Nevertheless, in most practical cases it is reasonable to assume that a product that is valued higher by consumers entails a higher variable cost.

To gain first insights into the logic of bundling by an integrated firm in this setting we study the case r
                        =2 and γ
                        =0 depicted in Fig. 1
                        . Here, the profit maximizing price resembles the price where the revenue attains its optimum, which according to (7) and (8) is given by ∊(p)=1. As already demonstrated via the examples given in the motivation section, bundling induces a pooling of preferences if the correlation between the reservations prices is low. Because of this effect, the density of consumers with average reservation prices for the bundle is larger than in the separate sales case. Thus, increasing the bundle price from 0 fewer consumers are lost than that in the unbundling case, as indicated by the lower elasticity and the flatter demand function for small p in region 1 of the reservation price distribution of the bundle. With increasing bundle price, the density of consumers with a willingness to pay below this price increases faster than in the separate sales case so that the price elasticity of the bundle grows faster. Thus, in the bundling case the price where ∊(p)=1 is reached earlier than in the separate sales case, resulting in an optimal bundle price of 5/4 versus 3/2 in the separate sales case, and even though a discount is given the revenue is higher as more consumers buy the bundle.

Next, we investigate the size of the bundling gain for any r and γ. In Appendix B it is shown that the sum of the optimal prices in the unbundling case is expressed as (1+
                        r)(1+
                        γ)/2 and that in this case the optimal profit is expressed as Π
                        
                           iu
                        
                        =(1+
                        r)(1−
                        γ)2/4. Table 3
                         summarizes the optimal prices and profits and the resulting bundling gains for the three regions in (13) derived in Appendix B and Fig. 2
                         depicts the bundling gain on the z-axis as a function of r and γ and the resulting bundling set. In the integrated firm scenario (Fig. 2) the bundling gain at first increases in r from r
                        =1 to r
                        =32/27 but then decreases in r for r
                        >32/27. As shown in Appendix B.4 this effect can be explained by the interplay of the “value” and the “similarity” effect. Note that at a small value of r (r
                        =1) the valuations are very similar, so that by increasing r more consumer surplus can be transferred between the products and the profit made with the bundle increases faster than in the separate sales case (see Example 2 in Section 1.1). However, for values of r larger than r
                        =32/27 the differences in the valuations of product 2 limit the consumer surplus that can be transferred between the products (see Example 4 in Section 1.1).

Following the intuition garnered in Section 1.1 it is clear that the bundling gain decreases in γ in all regions. In distribution region 3 it is negative at γ
                        =1/4, r
                        =1 and decreasing in both r and γ so that bundling is not chosen if 1/4⩽
                        γ
                        ⩽1 (see Table 3). The critical values for γ
                        ∗ for the bundling gain to be positive in the other two distribution regions are obtained by solving Π

                        ∗ is obtained numerically, yielding e.g. γ
                        ∗
                        =0.138 for r
                        =1 and as can be seen from (16) and Fig. 2, γ
                        ∗ is decreasing in r in distribution region 1 and 2. Summarizing we thus can state that in the case of independent uniformly distributed reservation prices the integrated firm chooses bundling for high margin products with similar valuations: the variable costs must be lower than 13.8% of the maximum reservation price and the bundling gain attains its maximum of 5/108 for r
                        =32/27 and γ
                        =0.

As shown in Section 2, the optimal bundle price and bundle profit in the supply chain first best scenario are the same as for the integrated firm. They therefore can be obtained from Table 3, too. However, now the bundling gain is given as the difference between the bundle profit of the integrated firm and the profit of the unbundled supply chain. In Appendix B it is shown that the sum of the optimal prices charged by the unbundled supply chain is (1+
                        r)(2+
                        γ)/3 and that in this case the optimal profit is expressed as Π
                        
                           su

                        r)(1−
                        γ)2/9. Table 4
                         summarizes the resulting bundling gains for the three distribution regions as derived in Appendix B and Fig. 3
                         depicts the bundling gain on the z-axis as a function of r and γ and the resulting bundling set.

In the supply chain first best scenario the bundling gain is decreasing in γ in all regions, same as in the case of the integrated firm. Also, bundling is not chosen for γ
                        ⩾1/4 in distribution region 3, as the bundling gain is 0 for γ
                        =1/4 and r
                        =1 and decreasing in r and γ. However, in contrast to the integrated firm, the bundling gain is increasing in r everywhere in distribution regions 1 and 2. To understand this phenomenon we investigate the effects of double marginalization further. In Appendix B.1 it is shown that with a linear demand function the supply chain profit is reduced by 1/9th, if the retailer and the supplier independently optimize their margins. Therefore, the bundling gain in the supply chain first best scenario in region 2 can be written as Π

                           iu
                        /9=(1+
                        r)(1−
                        γ)2/36 with respect to r is (1−
                        γ)2/36, while the first derivative of the bundling gain of the integrated firm Π
                        
                           ib

                           iu
                         shown in Table 3 with respect to r is −(1−2γ)2/16r
                        2. Thus, as (1−
                        γ)2/36⩾(1−2γ)2/16r
                        2 for r
                        ⩾3/2, in the supply chain first best scenario the bundling gain in region 2 is increasing in r while it is decreasing in r for the integrated firm. In the supply chain first best scenario the effect of the elimination of double marginalization is stronger than the similarity effect of bundling, and the bundling set is given as R
                        
                           f
                        
                        ={(r, γ)∣0⩽
                        γ
                        <1/4} (see Fig. 3). We thus can summarize that in the supply chain first best scenario both the range of bundling opportunities and the bundling gain are significantly enlarged compared to the integrated firm due to the added opportunity of eliminating double marginalization and coordinating the supply chain. In this scenario the bundling gain increases with r and the critical value for γ for bundling to be beneficial is about two times as high as that in the integrated firm.

Let us now turn to the supply chain retailer bundling scenario. In Appendix B.2 it is shown that for this scenario no interior solution exists for the bundle price in distribution region 1. Table 5
                         summarizes the results for the remaining distribution regions as derived in Appendix B. As can be seen from Table 5, the bundling gain for the retailer in the supply chain retailer bundling scenario decreases in r and γ in region 2 and 3 and is negative for the minimum values r
                        =3/2 and γ
                        =0 and r
                        =1 and γ
                        =0, respectively. Therefore, there is no constellation where bundling is chosen in the supply chain retailer bundling scenario. Thus, if the determination of the margins is not coordinated, a supply chain cannot reap the benefits of price discrimination via bundling.

We now turn to the supply chain supplier bundling scenario. As shown in Appendix B.2, no interior solution exists for the bundle price in distribution region 1. Table 6
                         summarizes the results for the remaining distribution regions as derived in Appendix B. As can be seen from Table 6 and Fig. 4
                         the bundling gain on the z-axis is decreasing r and γ everywhere, attaining its maximum at r
                        =1 and γ
                        =0, the maximum value of 1/18 being larger than that for the integrated firm.

In Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         we compare the bundling gains of the integrated firm and supply chain supplier bundling for the cases r
                        =1 and γ
                        =0 separately. It is interesting that while the bundling gain from supplier bundling is monotonically decreasing in r, it can increase for the integrated firm for low values of r. Fig. 7
                         depicts the respective bundling sets. Consider the distribution region 2 first. In this region, the demand function for the bundle is linear, same as the demand function in the separate sales case. According to Appendix B.1, profit is reduced by 1/9th if two parties independently optimize margins when compared to the integrated firm. Consequently, here not only the profit in the case of separate sales is reduced by 1/9th, but also the profit made with the bundle, so that in region 2 the bundling gain can be written as Π
                        
                           ss

                           s
                        
                        ={(r, γ)∣0⩽

                           su
                        } is the same as for the integrated firm. Also note that the bundle price is located in the distribution region 3 for supplier bundling, and it is located in region 1 for the integrated firm. As the demand in region 3 is very elastic (compared to region 1), for small values of γ the increase in the optimal bundle price due to double marginalization is lower than that in the separate sales case. This results in a higher bundling gain than that for the integrated firm for r
                        ⩽1.25 and γ
                        ⩽0.05. However, as the loss of sales increases with increasing prices, the decrease in bundling gain with increasing γ is steeper. As can be seen from Table 6, in distribution region 3 the equation (1+

                         is 1.94% smaller than R

Thus, in the supplier bundling scenario the conditions for bundling are strengthened: when compared to the integrated firm, bundling becomes more profitable for products with similar valuations and high margins. On the other hand, the bundling gain is lower for products with higher variable costs and different reservation price distributions. As bundling is not chosen in the retailer bundling scenario, the supplier bundling scenario should be prevalent. This is exemplified by the case of electronics retailer Conrad introduced in Section 1.1. In this case the discount of 20.17% observed corresponds to the supplier bundling scenario with r
                        =1.19 and γ
                        =0.1 (see Appendix B.3). We summarize the above results in the following theorem:

Next, we study the effect of adding a third product to the bundle. We will assume that the reservation price distribution of this product is uniform, too, in the range [0, s], s
                        ⩾
                        r. The respective willingness to pay distribution is derived in Appendix C. To keep the analysis simple, we only vary s while keeping the upper limits of the distribution of reservation prices constant at 1 and 1.5 for the remaining two products, respectively. Fig. 8
                         shows the resulting profits for the scenarios in Table 2 for the case γ
                        =0 calculated numerically for s in the range of 1.6 and 5.5.

The thin, solid line presents the optimal profit for the integrated firm and bundling. It is identical with the supply chain first best scenario. The thin, dashed line shows the profit achieved by the integrated firm when an unbundling strategy is applied. The thick lines show the results for various coordination schemes in the supply chain scenario. The long-dashed line depicts the results for supplier bundling whereas the dot-dashed line shows the profits for retailer bundling. The dotted line gives the results for unbundling in the supply chain case. Clearly, all scenarios show increasing profits with increasing s. For lower values of s, supplier bundling is a good strategy, outperforming the unbundling strategy of the integrated firm.

                         (supply chain first best scenario). It can be seen that the highest relative advantage is obtained for low values of s in all settings. Retailer bundling is strictly dominated by the unbundling strategy and thus never beneficial. Both, the first best bundling strategy as well as supplier bundling outperform unbundling for the investigated region of s. Therefore, one can conclude that the bundling gain can be increased by adding high-margin products with similar valuation to an existing bundle.

In order to study the influence of the correlation of reservation prices on the bundling region of the various scenarios we employ a normal distribution for G
                     
                        j
                     (p
                     
                        j
                     ), j
                     =1, 2 with μ
                     =1 and σ
                     =1. We then numerically solve (7)–(11) for different values of the correlation coefficient ρ and the two cost scenarios c
                     1
                     =
                     c
                     2
                     =0 and c
                     1
                     =
                     c
                     2
                     =1. The results for zero and positive cost scenarios are shown in Figs. 10 and 11
                     
                     .

The lines parallel to the x-axis indicate the profit that can be realized if the products are sold separately. It can be seen that here the profit of the integrated firm (thin, dashed line) is always higher than that of the supply chain (thick, dotdashed line) due to double marginalization. In the low cost scenario, the highest bundling benefit for all contractual variants arises if the correlation between reservation prices is negative as here the demand becomes more homogenous (see Oldenrog & Skiera (2000)). The highest profit (thick, full line) is achieved in the supply chain first best scenario. In that case, profits are identical with the integrated firm. While bundling becomes unfavorable for the integrated firm when the correlation between reservation prices turns positive, in the supply chain first best scenario bundling is advantageous over unbundling over the entire range of correlations due to the fact that the profit in the unbundling case is lower than that in the integrated firm. The supply chain supplier bundling (thick, dashed line) and the supply chain retailer bundling scenario (thick, dotted line) are both affected by double marginalization and therefore show lower profits. As a consequence, in the supply chain retailer bundling is not an interesting option to increase profits. Only in the case of a high negative correlation between reservation prices and zero cost, the supply chain retailer bundling outperforms unbundling. In contrast to the case of uniformly distributed reservations prices, now the bundling set of the supply chain supplier bundling scenario is slightly larger than in the case of an integrated firm.

If costs are sufficiently high (Fig. 11), bundling is not beneficial for the integrated firm as the profit earned by selling a bundle is always lower than the profit if products are sold separately. For the case of the supply chain, retailer and supplier bundling also yield lower profits as compared to the unbundling solution irrespective of the correlation between reservation prices. Supply chain first best bundling, however, enables higher profits than unbundling if the correlation is either highly negative or highly positive, as here the demand structure becomes more heterogeneous, so that the number of customers with a reservation price higher than the variable costs increases (see Oldenrog & Skiera (2000)).


                     Fig. 12
                      illustrates the bundling sets for the various scenarios. Note that, starting with the smallest set, each region is a subset of the next bigger one. Retailer bundling shows the smallest set (I) and is only feasible in a very small region. Thus, this option is almost prohibitive for bundling. In the integrated firm, bundling turns out to be beneficial in the set I+II. It can be seen that if costs are zero, bundling for the integrated firm bundling is beneficial if the correlation of the reservation prices lies in an approximate range of [−1; −0.3]. With higher costs, the interval decreases. The supplier bundling scenario (I+II+III) exhibits a higher set of profitability. If costs are zero, the profitable range lies between [−1; +0.3]. By far, the largest set is covered under the supply chain first best bundling mechanism (IV). As the benchmark for bundling is the unbundling solution of the supply chain, in that case bundling is beneficial for all possible correlations of reservation prices for a wide set of possible costs.

Due to the fact that managers may have considerable uncertainty about the true correlation between articles, we seek a better understanding of the incentives to bundle in the various contractual settings. Therefore, we analyze the profit potential by the usage of bundling in Fig. 13
                      for the low cost scenario and in Fig. 14
                      for the high cost scenario over the range of possible correlations of reservation prices. In the case of low costs, bundling of products seems to be a dominant strategy if a supply chain first best solution can be achieved (thick, full line). The thin, full line shows the increase in profit for the integrated firm whereas the thick, dashed line shows the potential for supplier bundling. Both show a similar pattern. While the benefit of both scenarios converges to zero with increasing correlation, in the case of a supply chain first best solution, the profit increase exceeds 20% even with a very high positive correlation. In the case of retailer bundling (thick, dotted line), the bundling benefit decreases very fast, so that with this coordination mechanism bundling is only applicable in a very narrow range of correlations. Retailer bundling carries a high risk of a substantial profit loss compared to the unbundling strategy if the correlation estimate is not accurate. For the case of high costs, only a supply chain that is coordinated by a supply chain first best solution, can benefit from the application of price bundling. As the sum of normally distributed random variables is normally distributed, too, one can directly transfer these findings to bundles comprising more than two products by interpreting the willingness to pay distribution of one product as the reservation price distribution a bundle. Due to the central limit theorem, these results have relevance for reservation price distributions other than the normal distribution, too.

In this paper we have investigated the influence of the level of cooperation in a supply chain on the usage of opportunities for increasing profit via bundling as a price discriminating device. We found that if the setting of bundle margins is not coordinated, bundling is adopted only in the case of very high negative correlation and low variable costs. On the other hand, the supply chain wide optimization of the bundle price significantly broadens the bundling set compared to that of the integrated firm due to the elimination of double marginalization so that bundling is chosen for products with very different valuations. If the product is sold via an independent retailer and the suppliers coordinate, the bundling set and the bundling gain are similar to that of an integrated firm, where the differences depend on the reservation price distributions. In the case of independent uniform distributions, the bundling region is slightly smaller and the bundling gain is smaller except for products with the same valuation and small variable cost. In the case of normally distributed reservation prices the bundling set and bundling gain are larger than for the integrated firm. The practical example that motivated this research points into the direction that real-world supply chains indeed use this coordination mechanism. However, clearly more empirical work on bundling in the supply chain context is needed to broaden this argument.

Summarizing these findings from a managerial point of view we propose that the properties of products suitable for price discrimination via bundling do not change when moving from an integrated firm to a supply chain. In both cases high margin products with similar valuations and low correlation are good candidates for bundling. However, the pricing and margin setting process has to be carefully coordinated in a supply chain setting: while a supply chain wide coordination yields the additional benefit of eliminating double marginalization, a purely local optimization essentially eliminates all bundling opportunities. If a supply chain wide coordination is not possible, at least the suppliers should coordinate, which depending on the type of reservation price distributions present yields a bundling gain that is slightly larger or slightly smaller than those obtained by an integrated firm.

Our research points to interesting directions for new research. First, it should be possible to extend our research to a multi-retailer scenario, where retailers in different geographical regions face different distributions of reservation price. Second, it would be instructive to study the impact of component bundling further upstream in the supply chain. Third, the mixed bundling scenario in a supply chain context, though algebraically complex, may have interesting implications for the parties concerned. Finally, sharper bounds independent of distributional assumptions would be a fruitful area of future research.
