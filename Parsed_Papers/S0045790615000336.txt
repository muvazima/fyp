                  Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) have been used for sensitive applications such as video surveillance and monitoring applications. In a WMSN, storage and transmission become complicated phenomena that can be simplified by the use of compressed sensing, which asserts that sparse signals can be reconstructed from very few measurements. In this paper, memory-efficient measurement matrices are proposed for a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)–discrete cosine transform (DCT) hybrid approach based video compressed sensing (VCS). The performance of the framework is evaluated in terms of PSNR, storage complexity, transmission energy and delay. The results show that the proposed matrices yield similar or better PSNR and consume less memory for generating the matrix when compared with a Gaussian matrix. The DWT–DCT based VCS yields better quality and compression when compared with DCT and DWT approaches. The transmission energy is 50% less and the average delay is 52% less when compared to raw frame transmission.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A WMSN consists of simple and low-cost sensor nodes that are used for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, healthcare monitoring and surveillance applications. In the case of surveillance applications, sensor nodes with multimedia capability are deployed in the area of interest to detect anomalies. These sensor nodes will capture and transmit the surveillance video wirelessly to the network operator. Transmission of multimedia data that range from several megabytes to a few gigabytes is a challenging task because it imposes requirements for large amounts of storage and high bandwidth for transmission. These challenges can be overcome by using an emerging technique called compressed sensing (CS), which asserts that the original signal can be reconstructed from a small number of measurements [1]. CS can be applied to sparse signals or compressible signals. The original signal is made sparse using a transform basis, and a measurement matrix is applied to the sparse signal to obtain the measurements. These measurements are transmitted for reconstruction at the receiver side. There are many reconstruction algorithms, such as basis pursuit, greedy algorithms and iterative algorithms, for reconstructing the original signal from the measurement vector.

The objective of this paper is to implement VCS based on a DWT–DCT hybrid approach and to propose efficient measurement matrices for VCS. This VCS framework is based on a block-based approach; CS is applied to all of the blocks to obtain the measurements. The performance of the system with the proposed measurement matrices is evaluated by analysing the PSNR, percentage of reduction in samples, storage, energy complexity, transmission energy and end-to-end delay.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief survey of related works. Section 3 provides a brief description of the CS technique, and Section 4 provides details about VCS based on the DCT, DWT and DWT–DCT hybrid approach. This section also explains in detail the proposed measurement matrices and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, whereas Section 5 discusses the simulation and experimental results in detail; finally, Section 6 gives the conclusions and proposed future work.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

This section provides a brief discussion of works related to VCS along with the advantages and limitations of each technique.

Akyildiz et al. [2] provided a survey of techniques used in the algorithms, hardware and protocols for WMSNs. Different architectures of WMSNs are explored along with their advantages and disadvantages. Different varieties of low-resolution and medium-resolution image sensor nodes and their collaborative processing are also explained. The authors have also discussed the working of wireless nodes in different layers of transmission. The network management and security used for multimedia transmission purposes are also emphasized.

In [3,4], the authors have explained in detail the basics, theorems and mathematics involved in CS and how the mathematics can be implemented in real time. They have motivated the design of new sampling schemes and devices that provide information required for signal recovery using the smallest possible representation.

Gan [5] has proposed block-based CS for natural images, in which image acquisition is conducted in a block-by-block manner. The image reconstruction algorithm includes both linear and nonlinear operations such as Wiener filtering, projection onto the convex set and hard thresholding in the transform domain. The results show comparable performances between block-based CS systems and current CS schemes, but the former have much lower implementation costs.

Han et al. [6] have proposed an image representation scheme using CS because it reduces the computational complexity of the image/video encoder used in the compression process. The encoder first divides the image into two parts, dense and sparse components, where the sparse component alone is encoded using CS. The number of random measurements needed and the decoding complexity are reduced considerably. Yu et al. [7] proposed a method to construct a Toeplitz-structured matrix with chaotic sequences for CS and proved that the Toeplitz-structured Chaotic Sensing Matrix retains the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), which guarantees exact recovery. The results show similar or better performance compared with the Chaotic Sensing Matrix and the Gaussian Sensing Matrix.

Gleichman and Eldar [8] stated that the necessity of prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal can be avoided by using blind CS. They have proven that under some unique constraints, their methods could produce comparable results to those of conventional CS techniques. Jain and Tewari [9] slightly modified OMP to generate Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement (OMPR), which replaces an existing support element with a new one. They have explained different methods for faster implementation of OMPR algorithms, such as using a hash function. Additionally, performance for noisy samples was also analysed.

Schaeffer et al. [10] presented a method to predict the optimal real-time compression rate for videos. During the acquisition of input data, the video is spatially compressed. Simple filters and polynomial fittings are used so that the hardware implementation is easy. The quality of the reconstructed video can also be improved without increasing the amount of video stored.

Schenkel et al. [11] proposed a scheme for wireless video multicast based on CS. When multicasting video signals, CS is applied to generate measurements of equal importance from a video such that a receiver with a better channel will naturally have more information to reconstruct the content effectively. They have also examined how the properties of the natural image can be exploited to improve the reconstruction performance by adding small side information. They experimented with different matrices to improve performance, not only on the receiver side but also on the transmitter side.

Jiang et al. [12] proposed a method to separate moving objects from the background in a surveillance video. Low rank and sparse decomposition of the matrix was used to reconstruct the video acquired by compressive measurements. The low rank matrix was used to identify the background, and the sparse matrix represented any moving objects present in the video. The experimental results showed that very few measurements were needed to extract moving objects in the surveillance video.

In [13], Balouchestani et al. provided the most recent survey of CS theory applied to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The authors also proposed new sampling methods for information, data networks and a new recovery algorithm. In [14], Pudlewski et al. explained compressive video streaming for WMSN. They found that new cross-layered network protocols combined with video encoders based on CS can provide solutions to the problems caused by encoder complexity and limited resiliency to channel errors. The surveillance image when CS is used shows better reconstruction results compared to the same surveillance image reconstructed using JPEG for bit error rates (BERs) to the powers of −5, −4 and −3.

In [15] and [16], Zhang et al. proposed a new framework for image CS recovery via collaborative sparsity and structural group sparse representation (SGSR) modelling, respectively. An efficient augmented Lagrangian-based technique and an iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm-based technique were also developed to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results showed that this novel CS recovery strategy increased the image quality by a large margin compared with current state-of-the-art schemes.

Sungkwang and Fowler [17] proposed block-based CS sampling with a smooth projected Landweber (BCS-SPL) reconstruction framework for video. The authors have incorporated the motion estimation/motion compensation (ME/MC) framework into the reconstruction process of BCS-SPL. The results showed that the independent frame by frame reconstruction was fast but that the reconstruction achieved by MC-BCS-SPL had significantly higher quality.

Liu et al. [18] proposed a sparsity-aware motion-accounting decoder for video streaming systems with plain CS encoding. The decoder performs sliding-window interframe decoding that adaptively estimates Karhunen–Loève bases from adjacent previously reconstructed frames. This decoder enhances the sparse representation of each video frame, improving the reconstruction quality of video at any fixed CS rate. The sparsity-aware motion-accounting decoder outperforms the conventional fixed-basis intraframe and interframe and K-SVD decoders.

Jha et al. [19] proposed a CS-based sparse representation of the directional empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) residue of the frame. The wavelet transform and the noiselet transform are used as a sparsifying matrix and sensing matrix, respectively, for CS measurements. The experimental results show that the proposed approach provides better compression results compared with the standard wavelet transform in CS schemes.

Compressed sensing is a new approach in which sensing and compression are performed simultaneously, resulting in a significant reduction in sampling and computation cost at the sensor. CS theory states that the original signal can be reconstructed from very few measurements; hence, it is also called sub-Nyquist sampling. This technique ultimately reduces the complexity of the process, requires much less storage capacity and uses less bandwidth. CS provides accurate recovery of the signal represented by a vector of length

                      measurements [1].

An important requirement of the CS technique is the sparsity of the input signal. Every signal,

                                 N

                      non-zero coefficients. The ultimate goal of CS is to construct a set of M samples so that the unknown signal 
                        
                           Z
                        
                      can be recovered from the sample measurements. Thus an

                      measurements are needed. For the reconstruction process to be perfect, the measurement matrix must obey certain properties, such as the incoherence property and the restricted isometry property. In [20], Candes and Tao explained that the restricted isometric property constrains the measurement matrices such that the reconstruction of the measurement vector will be flawless. The idea of CS is explained by the block diagram shown in Fig. 1
                     .

The diagram explains how CS is performed to obtain the measurements. The input signal is made sparse because CS can only be applied to sparse signals. The signal can be made sparse using any transform domain, such as DCT or DWT. After being sparsified, the signal is converted into a single vector called the sparse vector. The sparse vector consists of 
                        
                           K
                        
                      non-zero values that represent the sparsity level of the vector. The measurement matrix of dimension 
                        
                           M
                           ×
                           N
                        
                      is generated by calculating the minimum number of measurements 
                        
                           M
                        
                      required for reconstructing the original signal. The measurement matrix is applied to the sparse vector to obtain the measurements. These measurements are then transmitted for reconstruction at the receiver end.

This section discusses the implementation of the proposed VCS based on the DWT–DCT hybrid approach and compares it with the VCS based on DCT and DWT approaches. Efficient measurement matrices are proposed and implemented that are further compared with the Gaussian measurement matrix. In this framework, measurement matrices are proposed using a combination of multiple matrices. The block-based approach is adopted for VCS in order to reduce the size of the measurement matrix that is used to obtain the measurements. Considering the constraints of WMSN, a small measurement matrix is used to reduce the storage capacity required. The measurements that are obtained from the framework are transmitted and reconstructed using the OMP recovery algorithm.

Sparsity is an underlying concept in most of today’s filtering and compression applications. A signal is said to be sparse or compressible when the transform coefficient vector has a small number of large-amplitude coefficients and a large number of small-amplitude coefficients. In this paper, the DWT–DCT hybrid approach is used for a sparse representation that combines the advantages of both DCT and DWT.

Each block is sparsified using DCT, as described in (8), and converted into a single vector

                            called a sparse vector because it has only a few non-zero coefficients. The number of non-zero elements in the sparse vector represents the sparsity level

When DCT is applied to the block, most of the significant information is concentrated in a few non-zero coefficients only; it thereby achieves a higher compression rate.

DWT is applied to each block as described in (10) and (11), which results in four bands (LL, LH, HL, and HH). Given an image block

                            indicates the index of LH, HL, HH bands. The LL band contains the approximation coefficients, and the other three bands contain the detail coefficients. The LH, HL and HH bands will be sparse, that is, converted into a sparse vector. DWT has multi-resolution capability, thus achieving better quality.

This approach combines the advantages of both DCT and DWT, achieving better quality with a higher compression rate. DWT is applied to each block using (10) and (11), which results in four bands, and then DCT is applied to the LH, HL and HH bands using (8), achieving more sparsity. These bands with few non-zero coefficients are converted into a single vector called the sparse vector to which the measurement matrix is applied to obtain the measurements.

The measurement matrix is generated based on the number of measurements required for reconstruction as in (7). Two measurement matrices are proposed using multiple matrices, such as the Gaussian matrix, the Binary matrix and the Toeplitz matrix. The first proposed matrix is called the Combination matrix, which is defined as the Kronecker product of the Gaussian matrix and the Toeplitz matrix. The second matrix, called the Hybrid matrix, is generated by combining the Toeplitz matrix and the Binary matrix.

This matrix is obtained by taking the Kronecker product of the Gaussian matrix and the Toeplitz matrix. The Gaussian matrix is used universally, as it can be paired with any sparse matrix. It also yields better results in terms of PSNR. The Toeplitz matrix is highly preferred because the number of elements used in the measurement matrix is less. The Toeplitz matrix is a square matrix, and the elements are constant along its diagonal.

These proposed matrices are memory efficient, as they require fewer elements to generate the matrix when compared with the existing Gaussian matrix. The measurement matrix is applied to the sparse vector to obtain the measurement vector 
                              
                                 y
                              
                            that is transmitted to the receiver side, where it is then reconstructed using the OMP algorithm.

The OMP algorithm is one of the greedy algorithms designed to reconstruct the sparse vector from very few measurements by exploiting an iterative procedure. The iterations required to obtain the estimated sparse vector are the same as the sparsity level. This algorithm goes through an iterative procedure to minimize the residual error [23]. The OMP algorithm has five major steps, as shown in Table 1
                        
                     

The OMP algorithm yields better recovery and has less computational complexity. The inverse transform is applied to the estimated sparse vector using (9) and (12) to reconstruct the original frame. The DWT–DCT hybrid approach-based VCS with proposed measurement matrices yields better PSNR and requires less storage capacity, which makes it more suitable for video surveillance applications in WMSNs.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The DWT–DCT approach-based VCS using the proposed Combination matrix and Hybrid matrix is implemented in MATLAB and the performance of the measurement matrix is analysed in terms of PSNR, storage and energy complexity. The measurements obtained from the VCS framework are transmitted in real time using TelosB motes. Experimental analysis is carried out by evaluating the quality of reconstruction, transmission energy and end-to-end delay.

The video sequences considered for implementation are xylophone, akiyo and football. The first four video frames of size 240×320 are considered for implementation.

                        . An analysis of the quality of the reconstruction for CS based on the DCT, the DWT and the hybrid DWT–DCT approaches is presented in detail.

In the DCT approach, frames are divided into blocks of size 8×8 and sparsified by applying DCT to each block. After being sparsified, the blocks are converted to a single vector, which is called the sparse vector. The sparsity level of the sparse vector is fixed at K
                           1
                           =5, and the minimum number of measurements is calculated to be M
                           1
                           =21 using (7). The Combination matrix and the Hybrid matrix are applied to each sparse vector to obtain the measurement vector. These measurement vectors are transmitted to the receiver side for reconstruction. The OMP algorithm is used to obtain the estimated vector, and further blocks are reconstructed by applying the inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). Fig. 3
                            shows the reconstructed frames along with average the PSNR using DCT for the xylophone, akiyo and football sequences for M

For the DWT approach the frames are divided into blocks of size 
                              
                                 16

                           , and DWT is applied to each block, yielding four bands of size 8×8. After sparsifying, it is converted to a sparse vector, and the measurements are obtained by applying the Combination matrix and the Hybrid matrix. The blocks are finally recovered by applying the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) to the estimated sparse vector. Fig. 4

In the DWT–DCT hybrid approach, the frames are divided into blocks of size 
                              
                                 16

                           , and DWT is applied to each block, yielding four bands of size 8×8. DCT is applied to each band, yielding a higher compression rate. After sparsifying, it is converted to a sparse vector to which the proposed measurement matrices are applied to obtain the measurements. The blocks are finally recovered by applying IDCT and IDWT to the estimated sparse vector. Fig. 5
                            shows the reconstructed frames along with the average PSNR using DWT–DCT for the xylophone, akiyo and football sequences for M

                           .

From Table 2, it is evident that the average PSNR increases with the number of measurements. It can also be seen that the average PSNR for the Combination matrix and the Hybrid matrix is similar or better when compared with that of the Gaussian matrix [17,18]. It is clear that the DWT–DCT hybrid approach yields better PSNR for fewer measurements than DCT and DWT, which proves that the DWT–DCT hybrid approach has better quality at higher compression rates.

Consider an experimental setup for transmitting the compressed measurements of video between an end-to-end PC. The DWT–DCT hybrid-based VCS is implemented in a PC, and compressed measurements are relayed wirelessly via the deployed network to the destination where the video is reconstructed. The deployed network consists of TelosB nodes operated under the Contiki OS platform. The TelosB consists of a low-power MSP430 microcontroller, a Chipcon CC2420 transceiver, 10KB RAM, 48KB flash and 1MB external flash memory [24]. The Contiki OS is an open source embedded operating system that was designed for WSN [25]. The experimental analysis is carried out in terms of quality of reconstruction, transmission energy and end-to-end delay. The source node attached to the PC at the transmitter side broadcasts the measurements in the form of packets to the sink node via relay nodes. The sink node, which was deployed at a distance of 5m from the source node, receives the measurements from which the video is recovered in a PC. Fig. 6
                         shows the reconstructed frames along with the average PSNR obtained using the Combination matrix and the Hybrid matrix for the xylophone, akiyo and football sequences from the measurements received by the sink node.

The experimental results of the DWT–DCT hybrid approach in terms of PSNR are shown in Table 3
                        . This table shows the comparison between the Gaussian matrix, the Hybrid matrix and the Combination matrix in terms of PSNR.

It is observed from the table that, on average, the PSNR of the frames is approximately 1.5dB less when compared to the simulation results given in Table 2. This reduction in PSNR is due to the packet loss that occurred during transmission.

To compute the energy consumed for transmission in real time, the powertrace tool in the Contiki OS was used [26]. The computed energy was compared with a theoretical energy calculation. The transmission energy per bit

On average, the energy consumed for transmitting the measurements of a single frame is 50% less when compared to the theoretical energy consumption for raw frame transmission. Fig. 7
                            shows the screenshot of the measurements received for a single frame in the Contiki OS platform. The energy consumption per frame calculated using the powertrace tool is also shown in the screenshot.

The end-to-end delay in the network is calculated by computing the time taken to transmit the measurements and the propagation delay of the link. The transmission delay is obtained from the powertrace tool. In WSN, the sensor nodes are only a short distance apart, and hence, the propagation delay is negligible.

In the case of a multi-hop network, the end-to end-delay in the network is the sum of the delay of each link

                            represents the number of hops between the source node and the destination node.

From Table 5
                           , it is observed that the end-to-end delay increases as the number of bits and hops increases. The average end-to-end delay for transmitting the measurements is 52% less when compared to the raw frame transmission, which has an average delay of 2ms for a single hop. For timely delivery of data, the delay in the network must be small, which proves that the proposed VCS technique is efficient for WMSN.

The complexity is analysed in terms of storage, the energy for generating the measurement matrix and the percentage of reduction in samples. Storage complexity is analysed by calculating the number of elements to be stored in the WSN node for generating the matrix, and energy complexity is analysed by computing the energy consumed for generating the measurement matrix.

                            requires two elements for the Toeplitz matrix (with entries −1 & +1) and two elements for the Binary matrix (with entries 0 & 1). Table 6
                            shows the comparison of Gaussian, Combination and Hybrid matrices in terms of the number of elements required to generate the matrix.

From Table 6, it is evident that the number of elements required to generate the measurement matrix increases with the number of measurements. The Combination matrix requires fewer elements compared with the Gaussian matrix and the Hybrid matrix requires many fewer elements when compared with the Gaussian matrix and the Combination matrix.

The energy consumed for generating the measurement matrix is computed using (18)–(20).

From Fig. 8(a), it is observed that upon increasing the number of measurements, the PSNR also increases, but the percentage of reduction in the samples decreases. It is also observed that the DCT approach achieves higher compression rate and the DWT–DCT hybrid approach achieves better PSNR compared with the DWT approach for the same percentage of compression. Fig. 8 (b) shows a comparison of the DCT, DWT and DWT–DCT approaches in terms of PSNR and percentage of compression. The values observed from Fig. 8(b) are given in Table 9
                           .

From Table 9 and Fig. 8(b), it is evident that DWT achieves better PSNR when compared with DCT. It is also observed that the DWT–DCT approach achieves a PSNR of approximately 30dB with 52% reduction in samples, whereas for the DWT approach, it is only a 40% reduction. It is clear that the DWT–DCT hybrid approach achieves better quality even at higher compression rates compared to the DCT and DWT approaches.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

A VCS framework based on the DWT–DCT hybrid approach is implemented using the proposed Combination matrix and Hybrid matrix. The performance of the measurement matrix is evaluated in terms of PSNR, storage and energy complexity. Transmission energy and delay are analysed experimentally with the help of TelosB nodes. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed matrices are memory and energy efficient while maintaining an acceptable range of PSNR. The DWT–DCT hybrid approach yields better PSNR for fewer measurements when compared with standalone DCT and DWT approaches. The experimental results show that on average, the transmission energy is 50% less and the end-to-end delay is 52% less when compared with raw frame transmission.

Conventional wireless sensor nodes do not have adequate memory, power and bandwidth for multimedia applications. The future work is to develop customized hardware that can incorporate the VCS technique. The transmission energy can be further reduced by encoding the measurements before transmission. The customized hardware should have a camera module to capture the scene, a processor with high processing speed and adequate memory to process the video using the CS technique. To capture and process only the scene of interest or to detect anomalies, the camera module must be associated with a PIR sensor, which triggers the camera only upon interruption. This highly efficient hardware could then be used for video surveillance applications in WMSN.
