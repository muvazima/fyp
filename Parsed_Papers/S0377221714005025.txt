                  In this paper, we consider that the judgments provided by the decision makers (DMs) cannot be aggregated and revised, then define them as hesitant judgments to describe the hesitancy experienced by the DMs in decision making. If there exist hesitant judgments in analytic hierarchy process-group decision making (AHP-GDM), then we call it AHP-hesitant group decision making (AHP-HGDM) as an extension of AHP-GDM. Based on hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) to collect the hesitant judgments, we develop a hesitant multiplicative programming method (HMPM) as a new prioritization method to derive ratio-scale priorities from HMPRs. The HMPM is discussed in detail with examples to show its advantages and characteristics. The practicality and effectiveness of our methods are illustrated by an example of the water conservancy in China.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Saaty, 1977, 1980a) is a popular and powerful technique for decision making, which is built on the human being’s intrinsic ability to structure his/her perceptions or ideas hierarchically. Through pairwise comparisons of similar things against a given criterion, the decision makes (DMs) can provide judgments to represent the intensity of the importance of one thing over the other. AHP has wide applications in decision making problems (Dong, Hong, Xu, & Yu, 2013; Forman & Peniwati, 1998; Grošelj & Zadnik Stirn, 2012; Vaidya & Kumar, 2006; Xu, 2000; Xu & Wei, 1999).

To deal with the AHP problems, Saaty (1980a) proposed four basic steps. (1) Modeling: it involves the construction of a hierarchy at different levels of criteria, subcriteria and alternatives. (2) Valuation: based on a 1–9 ratio-scale measure, the DMs provide judgments over paired comparisons of objectives at each level of the hierarchy. (3) Prioritization: using prioritization methods to derive local priorities of the objectives at each level of the hierarchy. (4) Synthesis: using aggregation procedures (such as the weighted arithmetic average and the geometric mean) to synthesize the local priorities into global priorities of the alternatives.

In AHP-group decision making (AHP-GDM) (Ramanathan & Ganesh, 1994; Saaty, 1989), the DMs are forced to aggregate their individual judgments into group judgments to describe the relationship between the compared objectives. However, if the DMs cannot reach consensus with respect to the aggregated judgment(s), the confidence of the DMs to the final results may be reduced. This similar problem has also been considered by Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996). They claimed that many circumstances make such an aggregation process difficult. For example, with respect to an aggregated judgment, the DMs cannot agree with it in any case, but prefer to retain their original judgments.

In the existing works, the common solution to this problem is to revise the DMs’ judgments to establish consensus paths, which is called a consensus reaching process. For example, Altuzarra, Moreno-Jiménez, and Salvador (2010) developed a Bayesian approach; Dong, Zhang, Hong, and Xu (2010) proposed some consensus models. If the DMs are not willing to revise their judgments, then the interval judgments that use intervals of numerical values can be applied to represent the margins of errors in judgments. For example, Saaty and Vargas (1987) originally proposed interval judgments in AHP, and computed the probability of rank reversal of the compared objectives.

However, if we consider AHP as another way to access an additive value function, it should be held to the standard as no rank-reversal. As early as 1982, Kamenetzky (1982)’s seminal work lays this out nicely. Moreover, Forman and Gass (2001) argued that the ratio-scale measure convey more information than the interval measure, and AHP must use ratio-scale priorities for the objectives above the lowest level of the hierarchy.

Following the traditional ratio-scale measure, and if the original judgments provided by the DMs cannot be aggregated and revised, is it possible to generate reasonable ratio-scale priorities of the compared objectives? In this paper, we define a hesitant judgment that includes several possible values to indicate the original judgments provided by the DMs, where the values in the hesitant judgment cannot be aggregated and revised. The hesitant judgments can be used to describe the hesitancy experienced by the DMs when they make comparisons. Then we develop a hesitant multiplicative programming method (HMPM) as a new prioritization method to derive ratio-scale priorities from hesitant judgments. Since all the original possible judgments provided by the DMs are preserved without aggregations and revisions, the overall confidence of the DMs to the results produced by the HMPM should not be reduced.

With respect to AHP-GDM, if there exist hesitant judgments, then we call it AHP-hesitant group decision making (AHP-HGDM) as an extension of AHP-GDM. To systematically introduce this topic, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic concepts related to hesitant judgments. Section 3 develops the HMPM. Section 4 gives some necessary discussions. In Section 5, we give a real-life example to illustrate our results. Section 6 summarizes this paper and offers some concluding remarks.


                     Saaty (1980b) gave a 1–9 ratio scale (see Table 1
                     ) as a basis for the decision makers (DMs) to provide judgments over paired comparisons of objectives. Then a common tool, multiplicative preference relations (MPRs), is used to collect the judgments. With respect to a set of objectives X

The idea of introducing hesitancy can refer to hesitant fuzzy sets (Torra, 2010), which is a hot topic recent years (Xu & Xia, 2011; Zhu & Xu, 2013, 2014; Zhu, Xu, & Xia, 2012, 2013). Since hesitant fuzzy sets have the advantage to handle imprecise whereby two or more sources of vagueness appear simultaneously, Xia and Xu (2013) extended this concept of hesitancy to MPRs, and developed the concepts of hesitant multiplicative sets (HMSs) and hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs). For our purpose, we now restate these concepts as follows.

                           z(x) can be called a hesitant multiplicative element (HME). Since a HME may consist of several possible values, it can be considered as a hesitant judgment in the decision making environment. Based on HMEs, hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) can be defined as follows.

The hesitant multiplicative programming method (HMPM) is a prioritization method, which arises from a fuzzy programming method (FPM) originally introduced by Mikhailov (2000). The FPM transforms the prioritization problem into a fuzzy programming problem that can easily be solved as standard linear programming. The FPM has some attractive properties, such as simplicity in computation, good precision and rank preservation. As an extension of the FPM, the HMPM preserves these advantages, and can reduce to the FPM in some cases.

To develop the HMPM, we first give its geometric representation in dealing with a prioritization problem. Considering some decision makers (DMs) involved in a decision making problem, they provide hesitant judgments over paired comparisons of objectives to construct a HMPR, Z

                     , then the satisfaction degree of the DMs to the priorities equals 1; otherwise, the satisfaction degree should decrease to some deviation limits. Therefore, we can use the concept of fuzzy sets (Foulds, do Nascimento, Calixto, Hall, & Longo, 2013; Wang, Liu, Pedrycz, Zhu, & Hu, 2012; Zadeh, 1965) to describe such conditions.

                        ij
                     (w), we measure the satisfaction degree of the priorities by a linear membership function m
                     
                        ij
                     (w) with a deviation parameter t. The satisfaction degrees described by the membership function are shown in Fig. 1

We call this linear programming model the HMPM as a prioritization method for HMPRs. It can deal with hesitant judgments and produce the solution of priorities with the maximum satisfaction degree λ. Since λ is used to measure the satisfaction degree of the DMs to the solution, we call it a group satisfaction index (GSI). The bigger the value λ, the higher the satisfaction degree. Obviously, the HMPM can also deal with MPRs if there is no hesitancy.

Using the HMPM to deal with a HMPR Z
                        =(z
                        
                           ij
                        )
                           n×n
                        , we can get a priority vector w with the GSI λ. With respect to w, we can also get a corresponding set of judgments A
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ={a
                        
                           ij
                        ∣i, j
                        =1,2…,
                        n,
                        i
                        <
                        j}, where a
                        
                           ij
                        
                        ∈
                        z
                        
                           ij
                        . So we can find that the HMPM is to select the judgments from each HME in Z to best satisfy the consistency property shown in Eq. (5). In most cases, we get a unique GSI. But if there are two, or more solutions with the same value of the GSI, a further decision is required for the DMs. We now give a special case for illustration.

In such a case, the DMs need to make further decisions with respect to the two solutions, which is much easier by some simple decision techniques. In practical applications, we rarely get two or more solutions by the HMPM, especially in the AHP problems with large number of objectives to compare.

The deviation parameter t is determined by the DMs to define the deviation limit. According to Eqs. (10)–(13), we can find that the deviation parameter influences the values of the membership degrees, and then influences the values of the GSI.

It is clear that for different t, we can get different λ, but the same

                                                2
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              . So a large value of t guarantees the positive λ, but does not influence the values of the priorities produced by the HMPM. Without loss of generality, we set t
                              =1 in the rest of the paper.

In this section, we conclude some characteristics of the HMPM with some illustrative examples.
                           
                              (1)
                              The HMPM can deal with hesitant judgments without aggregations and revisions, and can directly produce ratio-scale priorities of compared objectives, which is efficient in computation.

The HMPM does not necessarily need a complete HMPR. So the DMs are freedom to provide crisp, hesitant, or even ignore some judgments, which increases the richness of input data in HMPRs.

                                    The HMPM pays attention to the judgments, whose values are consistent following the consistency property as in Eq. (5), not the whole judgments.

To illustrate this characteristic of the HMPM, we now give a comparison between the HMPM and an aggregation method introduced by Xia and Xu (2013). For a set of HME z

                              2)=1.6931, s(x

                              ≻

Using the HMPM to deal with Z

                              . It is clear that the preference order of the objectives is the same as the aggregation method above. However, the HMPM pays attention to the judgments, whose values are consistent following the consistency property as in Eq. (5), while the aggregation method focuses on the whole judgments instead.

                               which is also in accordance with the preference order above. But this result pays attention to the whole judgments.

In AHP-GDM, if there exist hesitant judgments, then we call it AHP-HGDM. There are two possible ways to construct the AHP-HGDM problems.
                           
                              (1)
                              For the decision making problems with a hierarchy, the DMs act as an union (or a decision group) to provide hesitant judgments over paired comparisons of the objectives to construct (incomplete) HMPRs at each level of the hierarchy.

In the traditional AHP-GDM problems, if some judgments for a comparison cannot be aggregated due to the strongly divergent opinions among the DMs, then it is a hesitant case, where the HMPM is used as the prioritization method to deal with hesitant judgments.

We give a real-life example in this section to show our results. Zhang (2009) introduced a water conservancy problem in China. This is an AHP-GDM problem with a hierarchy structure described as follows: set the reasonable allocation of the water conservancy investment of river basins in China as the goal level, seven water conservancy projects as the criterion level and seven river basins as the alternative level.

The river basins are Yangtse River basin, Yellow River basin, Haihe and Luanhe Rivers basin, Song and Liao Rivers basin, Inland Rivers basin, Huaihe River basin, and Zhujiang River basin. The water conservancy projects are the reservoir project, the irrigation project, the flood control and prevention project, the waterlog control project, the water supply project, the hydropower project, and the water and soil conservation project. The hierarchy structure is shown in Fig. 2
                     .

In the AHP-HGDM environment, we assume that some invited DMs acting as a decision group to provide judgments over paired comparisons of the objectives at each level of the hierarchy, where the judgments can be crisp, hesitant, or even be ignored. We list the judgments in Tables 3 and 4
                     
                     .

Using the HMPM to deal with the judgments in Tables 3 and 4, we can get the priorities of the compared objectives shown in Tables 5 and 6
                     
                      respectively.

In the final synthesis step, we use weighted arithmetic average to synthesize the priorities of the alternatives. Let w
                     
                        c
                      be the priority vector of the projects shown in Table 5, A
                     
                        r
                      (r
                     =1,2,…,7) be the priorities of the river basins shown in Table 6, then the global priorities of the river basins can be obtained as

                           (
                           r
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           7
                           )
                        
                     . The results are shown in Table 7
                     .

From Table 7, we know that the preference order of the seven river basins is as follows: Yangtse River≻Yellow River≻Song and Liao Rivers≻Huaihe River≻Haihe and Luanhe Rivers≻Zhujiang River≻Inland Rivers, where Yangtse River basin should be invested more than other rivers basins.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Analytic hierarchy process-hesitant group decision making (AHP-HGDM) is an extension of AHP-group decision making (AHP-GDM). In AHP-HGDM, hesitant judgments that each may include several possible values are used to indicate the original judgments provided by the decision makers (DMs). Generally, we assume that the hesitant judgments cannot be aggregated or revised. Two possible ways have been shown to construct the AHP-HGDM problems. To deal with the AHP-HGDM problems, hesitant multiplicative preference relations (HMPRs) have been introduced as a basic tool to collect hesitant judgments. Then we have developed a hesitant multiplicative programming method (HMPM) as a new prioritization method to derive ratio-scale priorities from HMPRs. This method pays attention to the judgments, whose values are consistent following a developed consistency property of HMPRs. The advantages of the HMPM have been summarized. With illustrative examples, we have shown that AHP-HGDM is practical, efficient, and has much sense to the AHP theory.
