@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The interpolation of a curve network by a smooth parametric surface has been a well-studied problem in literature since the second half of last century. Indeed it is easier and more intuitive to describe a complicated 3D free-form surface by creating a curve network than to directly manage surface control points.

Given a curve network, in the literature this interpolation problem is faced up by considering different approaches. For instance a classical one is based on blending-function methods (Barnhill, 1976; Bos et al., 1996; Delvos and Schempp, 1989; Gordon, 1969, 1971, 1993). Some other ones consist in the interpolation of the curve mesh either by a smooth regularly parametrized surface with one polynomial piece per facet (Peters, 1991) or by subdivision schemes (Conti and Dyn, 2005).

We recall that, in general, most surface fitting methods fall into one of two categories: global or local methods. A global method represents a surface by a ready available expression on the whole parametric domain and it is generally obtained either by solving a system of equations or by other schemes, for instance the ones based on the quasi-interpolation, that do not require to solve any system of equations. Local methods are more geometric in nature, constructing the surface patch-wise, using only local data for each step and imposing the required smoothness patch by patch.

Moreover it is well known that NURBS, based on rectangular patches, are a widely used computational geometry technology in CAGD, thanks to their many good properties. Tensor product B-spline surfaces are a specific kind of NURBS (Hoschek and Lasser, 1989; Piegl and Tiller, 1995). However, sometimes the above surfaces can create unwanted oscillations and some inflection points on the surface, due to their high coordinate degree. An example of tensor product B-spline surface interpolating a B-spline curve network is proposed in Piegl and Tiller (1995, Chap. 10). It is obtained from a blending-function method based on a special application of Gordon type schemes (Gordon, 1969, 1971, 1993), constructing three different surfaces expressed by means of B-spline functions belonging to different spaces, so that the bivariate resulting one is not defined on the rectangular grid associated to the knot vectors of the curve net, since a knot refinement is required.

NURBS on triangulations can avoid the unwanted oscillations, since they have a total degree lower than the one of NURBS based on rectangular patches. Therefore they can be very useful in CAGD (Wang and Li, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c).

In this paper we want to combine the advantageous features of the above cited techniques, proposing a new global method, to generate a surface interpolating a given B-spline curve network and using as blending functions bivariate B-splines on a criss–cross triangulation

                      quadratic B-spline curve networks and we define a parametric surface that satisfies the above interpolation constraint and it is based on the B-spline functions spanning the space

We remark that this space has been widely studied, with reference to its dimension, local basis, approximation power, etc. and it has been used in many applications (see Dagnino and Lamberti, 2008, 2007; Dagnino et al., 2012, 2013; Lamberti, 2009; Sablonnière, 2003a, 2003b; Wang, 2001; Wang and Li, 2004a and references therein). This paper wants also to be a further contribution to the researches on the surface construction based on above blending functions spanning

The structure of this paper is the following.

In Section 2 we define the B-spline curve network with its compatibility conditions.

In Section 3 we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the B-spline interpolating surface and we prove its uniqueness. Moreover, we propose a constructive algorithm for its generation and some notes on the behaviour of the surface control points generation process with respect to the round-off error.

Finally, in Section 4 we present some numerical and graphical applications. In particular we numerically validate the uniqueness of the surface interpolating the given B-spline curve network and we compare our method with two other ones, based on classical biquadratic tensor product B-spline functions. Moreover we underline that the rectangular topology of the parametric domain is not a too tight constraint for the object shape.

                            (Dagnino et al., 2008, 2012), from (14), (1) and (25), we get (20).

Similarly, by setting 
                              u
                              =

                            in (13), (21) holds.

By using the same logical scheme, from (15), we can show (17), (18) and (19).  □

From Theorem 3.1 we can immediately get that

                      generation process by (26), with respect to the round-off error growth. Linear growth of error is usually unavoidable, while exponential growth should be avoided, since this leads to unacceptable inaccuracies (Burden and Faires, 2005, Chap. 1, p. 32). In the following theorem, we show that such a growth is linear.

We can remark that if the sequence of partitions 
                        {
                        U
                        ×
                        V
                        }
                      is uniform, i.e. 
                        A
                        =
                        1
                     , then Theorem 3.3 holds.

In this section we present several applications.

In the first one we validate the theoretical results of Theorem 3.2, i.e. we verify that the surface (13) is unique and it is independent of 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              11
                           
                        
                      choice.

In the second one we propose a comparison with two other methods based on biquadratic tensor product B-splines.

Finally, with the third one we want to underline that the rectangular topology does not limit the shape of the curve network. Indeed we will consider a curve net where three-sided and four-sided facet are present.

It is easy to verify numerically that the given curve networks in all above applications are isoparametric curves of the generated surfaces.

It is well known that the control points of a spline surface usually should give an idea of its shape and its possible symmetries. In (26)–(27) we obtain all control points of the spline surface interpolating the network (1) depending on the curve control points and on 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 11
                              
                           
                        . Then different choices of 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 11
                              
                           
                         lead to different surface control points, some of which do not respect such shape property. However in this application we are not interested in the surface control point shape, because here we just want to underline the uniqueness of the surface (13), interpolating (1). For this reason in the following example we take two different 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 11
                              
                           
                         that provide two quite different control point sets, but the same surface interpolating the curve network, as proved in Theorem 3.2.

                         (Fig. 5(b)), as we have also numerically verified. Moreover, we can note how very different are the surface control points corresponding to the different choices of

                        . In particular, in order to obtain a control net that gives an idea of the surface shape, we choose 
                           
                              
                                 C

                         by minimizing the area of the bilinear surface representing the control net, as done for obtaining the net shown in Fig. 5(a).

In this section we compare our method with two other ones, based on classical biquadratic tensor product B-splines: i) the first one provides a tensor product B-spline surface after a minimization process; ii) the second one consists in the construction of a Gordon-type

We can remark that the shapes of the generated surfaces are comparable from the graphical point of view.

Moreover, we have also compared them from a numerical point of view. Indeed, let G be a

We remark that the surfaces 
                           S
                         and 
                           G
                         seem to have the same behaviour. However, we have to note that the constructions both of 
                           T
                         and of 
                           G
                         are computationally more expensive than the one of the surface 
                           S
                        , here proposed. Indeed, the generation of 
                           T
                         requires a minimization process to evaluate

                                 ⁎
                              
                           
                         in (38), while for the generation of 
                           G
                         we have to construct three different surfaces by using B-splines belonging to different spline spaces, so that the bivariate resulting surface is not defined on the rectangular grid associated to the knot vectors of the curve network, since knot refinement is required.

Here we want to underline that the rectangular topology of the parametric domain Ω does not constrain the curve network to have a 4-sided facet.

In the following test we interpolate the B-spline curve network shown in Fig. 8
                        (a), where three-sided and four-sided facet are present.

In this paper we have investigated the problem of interpolating a B-spline curve network, in order to create a surface satisfying such a constraint and defined by blending functions spanning the space

                        )
                     . We have proved the surface existence and uniqueness, providing a constructive algorithm for its generation.

We have also presented numerical and graphical results and comparisons with tensor product B-spline surfaces.

According to Piegl and Tiller (1995, Chap. 10), we have restricted the curves of the network to be nonrational. Theoretically, the construction, discussed in this paper, can be carried out in homogeneous space for rational curves, but it is generally not practical to do so and the three-dimensional results can be unpredictable. If rational curves are involved, it is recommended using constrained approximation techniques to obtain nonrational approximations of the rational curves to within necessary tolerances.

Finally, we remark that an interesting open problem could be the construction of B-spline surfaces interpolating a curve network of the following form
