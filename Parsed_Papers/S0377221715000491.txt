                  Patriksson (2008) provided a then up-to-date survey on the continuous, separable, differentiable and convex resource allocation problem with a single resource constraint. Since the publication of that paper the interest in the problem has grown: several new applications have arisen where the problem at hand constitutes a subproblem, and several new algorithms have been developed for its efficient solution. This paper therefore serves three purposes. First, it provides an up-to-date extension of the survey of the literature of the field, complementing the survey in Patriksson (2008) with more then 20 books and articles. Second, it contributes improvements of some of these algorithms, in particular with an improvement of the pegging (that is, variable fixing) process in the relaxation algorithm, and an improved means to evaluate subsolutions. Third, it numerically evaluates several relaxation (primal) and breakpoint (dual) algorithms, incorporating a variety of pegging strategies, as well as a quasi-Newton method. Our conclusion is that our modification of the relaxation algorithm performs the best. At least for problem sizes up to 30 million variables the practical time complexity for the breakpoint and relaxation algorithms is linear.

where aj
                      ≠ 0, j ∈ J, and the sign is the same for all j ∈ J. Further, we assume that there exists an optimal solution to problems (1) and (2). For brevity, in the following discussions we define Xj
                      ≔ [lj, uj
                     ], j ∈ J.

Problems (1) and (2) arise in many areas, e.g., in search theory (Koopman, 1999), economics (Markowitz, 1952), stratified sampling (Bretthauer, Ross, and Shetty, 1999), inventory systems (Maloney and Klein, 1993), and queuing manufacturing networks (Bitran and Tirupati, 1989). Further, these problems occur as subproblems in algorithms that solve the integer resource allocation problem (Mjelde, 1983, Section 4.7; Ibaraki and Katoh, 1988, pp. 72–75; Bretthauer and Shetty, 2002b), multicommodity network flows (Shor, 1985, Section 4.2), and several others. Moreover, problems (1) and (2) can be used as subproblems when solving resource allocation problems with more than one resource constraint (Federgruen and Zipkin, 1983; Mjelde, 1983), and to solve extensions of problems (1) and (2) to a nonseparable objective function ϕ (Dahiya, Suneja, and Verma, 2007; Mjelde, 1983). The books Mjelde (1983), Ibaraki and Katoh (1988), and Luss (2012) describe several extensions, such as to minmax/maxmin objectives, multiple time periods, substitutable resources, network constraints, and integer decision variables.

Many numerical studies of the problems (1) and (2) have been performed; for example, see Bitran and Hax (1981), Nielsen and Zenios (1992), Robinson, Jiang, and Lemke (1992), Kodialam and Luss (1998), Kiwiel (2007), Kiwiel (2008a), and Kiwiel (2008b). Our numerical study is however timely and well motivated, since except for those by Kiwiel (2007); 2008a); 2008b), where the quadratic knapsack problem is studied, none of the earlier approaches study large-scale versions of problem (1) or (2). There are also several algorithms (e.g., Nielsen and Zenios, 1992, Section 1.4; Stefanov, 2001) which are claimed to be promising, but have not been evaluated in a large-scale study. Only one earlier study (Kodialam and Luss, 1998) evaluates the performance of algorithms for the problems (1) and (2) with respect to variations in the portions of the variables whose values are at a lower or upper bound at the optimal solution (see Section 6.2), and this is done for modest size instances (n = 104) only. Further, no study has been done on the computational complexity for non-quadratic versions of the problems (1) or (2). Our numerical study also incorporates improvements of the relaxation algorithm, as presented in Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.5, and utilizes performance profiles (Dolan and Moré, 2002).

As a final note on the compuational tests, we only consider problem instances where the dual variable corresponding to the resource constraint (1b), respectively (2b), can be found in closed form; otherwise, we would need to implement a numerical method in some of the steps, e.g., a Newton method. We consider only customized algorithms for the problem at hand, since we presume that they perform better than more general algorithms under the above assumption.


                     Patriksson (2008) presents a survey of the history and applications of problems (1) and (2). Since its publication several related articles have been published; the survey of Patriksson (2008) is therefore complemented in Section 2. Section 3 presents a framework of breakpoint algorithms, resulting in three concrete representatives. Section 4 presents a framework of relaxation algorithms, and ultimately six concrete example methods. In Section 5 we describe a quasi-Newton method, due to Nielsen and Zenios (1992), for solving the problem (2). Section 6 describes the numerical study. A test problem set is specified and the performance profile used for the evaluation is defined. In Section 7, we analyze the results from the numerical study. The structure is such that we first compare the relaxation algorithms, second the pegging process, and third the best performing algorithms among these two with the quasi-Newton method. Finally, we draw overall conclusions.

We here extend the survey in Patriksson (2008), using the same taxonomy, and sorted according to publication date.

Breakpoint search algorithm applying median search of all breakpoints.

Breakpoint search algorithms: Brucker (1984), Calamai and Moré (1987), Pardalos and Kovoor (1990), and Maculan, Santiago, Macambira, and Jardim (2003); sorting and searching methods: Knuth (1998) and Kiwiel (2005).

Develops a general O(n) breakpoint algorithm; shows that the algorithms of Pardalos and Kovoor (1990) and Maculan et al. (2003) may fail even on small examples; presents a modification of the breakpoint removal in the algorithm of Calamai and Moré (1987). Numerical experiments (n ∈ [50 × 103, 2 × 106]) for uncorrelated, weakly, and strongly correlated data; the new algorithm wins in CPU time over those in Brucker (1984) and Calamai and Moré (1987) by 23 percent, and 21 percent, respectively, on average.

A family of breakpoint search algorithms that include several choices of breakpoints for a median search and updates of quantities used for evaluating the piecewise linear implicit constraint function at the median point.

Applications in resource allocation (Bitran and Hax, 1981; Bretthauer and Shetty, 1997; Hochbaum and Hong, 1995), hierarchical production planning (Bitran and Hax, 1981), network flows and transportation (Cosares and Hochbaum, 1994; Helgason et al., 1980; Nielsen and Zenios, 1992; Shetty and Muthukrishnan, 1990; Ventura, 1991), constrained matrix problems (Cottle, Duvall, and Zikan, 1986), quadratic integer programming (Bretthauer, Shetty, and Syam, 1996; 1995; Hochbaum and Hong, 1995), Lagrangian relaxation (Held, Wolfe, and Crowder, 1974), and quasi-Newton methods (Calamai and Moré, 1987); O(nlog n) sorting algorithms for the solution of the Lagrangian dual problem (Held et al., 1974; Helgason et al., 1980), O(n) algorithms based on median search (Brucker, 1984; Calamai and Moré, 1987; Cosares and Hochbaum, 1994; Hochbaum and Hong, 1995; Maculan and de Paula, 1989; Maculan, Minoux, and Plateau, 1997; Pardalos and Kovoor, 1990) and approximate median search methods with O(n) average-case performance (Pardalos and Kovoor, 1990); primal pegging algorithms with O(n
                              2) worst-case performance (Bitran and Hax, 1981; Bretthauer et al., 1996; Michelot, 1986; Robinson et al., 1992; Ventura, 1991; Zipkin, 1980)

Develops several variants of O(n) breakpoint search algorithms, including some ideas earlier proposed in, e.g., Pardalos and Kovoor (1990), Cosares and Hochbaum (1994), Hochbaum and Hong (1995), and Maculan et al. (1997); remarks that the more complex choices made in Maculan and de Paula (1989), Pardalos and Kovoor (1990), Cosares and Hochbaum (1994), Hochbaum and Hong (1995), and Maculan et al. (1997) also means that for some simple cases cycling may occur, and also provides convergent modifications for each of them. Numerical experiments (n ∈ [50 × 103, 2 × 106]) for uncorrelated and weakly and strongly correlated data, and for both exact and inexact computations of the median; comparisons made with the O(n) versions from Brucker (1984) and Calamai and Moré (1987), reporting that a version (Algorithm 3.1) using exact medians is about 20 percent faster than the other ones; refers to an as yet unavailable technical report from 2006 for more extensive tests and comparisons with pegging methods.

Pegging.

Applications: same references as in Kiwiel (2008a); breakpoint search methods (Calamai and Moré, 1987; Cosares and Hochbaum, 1994; Held et al., 1974; Helgason et al., 1980; Hochbaum and Hong, 1995; Kiwiel, 2007; Maculan and de Paula, 1989; Maculan et al., 1997; Maculan et al., 2003; Pardalos and Kovoor, 1990); pegging methods (Bitran and Hax, 1979; 1981; Bretthauer et al., 1996; Luss and Gupta, 1975; Michelot, 1986; Robinson et al., 1992; Shor, 1985; Ventura, 1991).

Develops a basic pegging algorithm and proposes several implementational choices for the solution of the reduced problem and the updates; shows that the algorithms in Michelot (1986), Robinson et al. (1992), and Bretthauer et al. (1996) fail on a small example, and that there is a gap in the convergence analysis in Bitran and Hax (1981) (which is also closed) that affects algorithms whose analyses rest on that in Bitran and Hax (1981) (e.g., Ventura, 1991); provide more efficient versions of several of these methods, including the introduction of incremental updates which reduce computations, and a more efficient stopping criterion. Numerical experiments (n ∈ [50 × 103, 2 × 106]) for uncorrelated and weakly and strongly correlated data; comparisons made with the breakpoint search method of Kiwiel (2008a) which uses exact medians; on average the latter is 14 percent slower while at the same time it has a more stable run time; it is remarked that the advantage of pegging over breakpoint search has been reported also in Ventura (1991) and Robinson et al. (1992).

Claims (without a proof) that the complexity of the algorithm is O(n), but the algorithm presented makes use of a mean-value method for the evaluation of the breakpoints which in the worst case results in 2n − 1 iterations. We also note that each iteration consist of O(n) operations, whence the complexity is O(n

Pegging; improves the pegging algorithm in Bitran and Hax (1981) by allowing the primal box constraints to be checked implicitly, using bounds on their Lagrange multipliers.

Compares their methodology with the method in Bitran and Hax (1981) on random test problems. On randomized quadratic continuous knapsack problems (n ∈ [5 × 103, 2 × 106]) their algorithms wins by 8–10 percent, except for the smallest problems where the method in Bitran and Hax (1981) wins by 12.5 percent. Two other types of test problems are also investigated, wherein the quadratic continuous knapsack problem arises as a subproblem: quadratic network flows, and portfolio optimization. In the former case, the algorithm (based on conjugate gradients) is taken from Arasu (2000). Here, the pegging algorithm proposed wins over that in Bitran and Hax (1981) by 10–48 percent, with n ∈ [200, 5 × 103]. In the portfolio optimization algorithm, which is based on a progressive hedging method described in Arasu (2000), the quadratic continuous knapsack problem arises as a subproblem. Here, the range of n is not completely disclosed; however, the speed-up over the method in Bitran and Hax (1981) is reported to be 21–25 percent.

The problem at hand is a subproblem in a branch–and–bound procedure for the solution of an integer-restricted version of the problem.

Applications to the newsvendor problem (Abdel-Male et al., 2004; Erlebacher, 2000), resource allocation (Bitran and Hax, 1981; Hochbaum, 1994), production (Bretthauer et al., 1995), and stratified sampling (Bretthauer et al., 1999); efficient methods for the continuous relaxation (Bretthauer and Shetty, 1995; Kodialam and Luss, 1998; Stefanov, 2001; Zhang and Hua, 2008); heuristics for the integer program based on rounding of the solution to the continuous relaxation (Bretthauer and Shetty, 1995; Hua, Zhang, and Liang, 2006); algorithms for the integer program based on the solution of continuous problems and branch–and–bound (Bretthauer and Shetty, 1995; 2002b).

Utilizing the algorithm from Zhang and Hua (2008) to solve the continuous relaxations (and rounding to produce feasible solutions), the authors develop a branch–and–bound algorithm. It is compared with the methods from Bretthauer and Shetty (1995) as well as with branch–and–bound algorithms utilizing a variety of tree search principles, on instances with quadratic objectives, according to problem generation principles from Bretthauer and Shetty (2002b) (n ∈ {10, 15, 500, 1000, 2000}).

Breakpoint search utilizing a heap data structure, based on an initial multiplier estimate using a secant Newton method.

Applications (Calamai and Moré, 1987; Dai and Fletcher, 2006; Helgason et al., 1980; Nielsen and Zenios, 1992; Shetty and Muthukrishnan, 1990); multiplier algorithms (Brucker, 1984; Calamai and Moré, 1987; Helgason et al., 1980; Maculan et al., 2003; Pardalos and Kovoor, 1990); pegging methods (Bitran and Hax, 1981; Bretthauer et al., 1996; Kiwiel, 2008b; Michelot, 1986; Robinson et al., 1992; Shor, 1985; Ventura, 1991); quasi-Newton methods (Cominetti, Mascarenhas, and Silva, 2014; Dai and Fletcher, 2006).

Numerical experiments (n = 6.25 × 106) on random test problems, examining (a) the best number of initial (secant) Newton iterations, and (b) the performance against a primal pegging algorithm. Overall, breakpoint search is favorable on its own given a good initial mulitiplier estimate; otherwise, 3 or 4 iterations of the secant Newton method is a good initialization procedure.

The KKT conditions, as defined in (3), are relaxed into a system of non-smooth equations through the utilization of the Fischer–Burmeister (Fischer, 1992) smoothing function; a Newton-like algorithm is then employed for these equations for a sequence of values of the smoothing parameter. The algorithm is shown to asymptotically and superlinearly converge to the unique optimal solution.

Survey (Patriksson, 2008); methodologies (Stefanov, 2004); applications (Koopman, 1999).

Three sets of numerical experiments. Main experiment (n ∈ [102, 104]) on randomized problems; compares with the pegging algorithm in Stefanov (2004), noting that the proposed algorithm is faster. The proposed methodology is however terminated based on a nonzero value of the Fischer–Burmeister smoothing function, whence the final solution need not be feasible or optimal. Second set of experiments on a problem taken from Wilkinson and Gupta (1969) (n = 4), showing no comparisons. Third experiment on data from the Bureau of Water Conservatory (n = 5), showing no comparisons.

An approximative Newton method for the Lagrangian dual problem utilizing a secant globalization and variable fixing.

Applications to resource allocation (Bitran and Hax, 1981; Bretthauer and Shetty, 1997; Hochbaum and Hong, 1995), multicommodity network flows (Helgason et al., 1980; Nielsen and Zenios, 1992; Shetty and Muthukrishnan, 1990), Lagrangian relaxation using subgradient methods (Held et al., 1974), quasi-Newton updates with bounds (Calamai and Moré, 1987), semismooth Newton methods (Ferris and Munson, 2004); related methods (Dai and Fletcher, 2006; Kiwiel, 2008b), where the latter method is shown to be equivalent to the proposed one when there are only lower bounds or lower bounds.

Numerical experiments (n ∈ [50 × 103, 2 × 106]) comparing the proposed method to a secant method (Dai and Fletcher, 2006), breakpoint search (Kiwiel, 2008b), and median search (Kiwiel, 2008a on problems with uncorrelated, weakly correlated, and correlated data. The proposed Newton method is overall better—about 30 percent better on the larger instances. A further test is made on the classification problems described in Dai and Fletcher (2006) arising in the training in support vector machines; as the Hessian is non-diagonal, a projected gradient method is used, leading to subproblems of the type considered. Here, Newton’s method is superior.

A damped feasible interior-point Newton method for the solution of the KKT conditions.

Survey (Patriksson, 2008); application to resource renewal (Melman and Rabinowitz, 2000); methodologies (Brucker, 1984; Kiwiel, 2008a; Melman and Rabinowitz, 2000; Pardalos and Kovoor, 1990; Robinson et al., 1992).

The algorithm is introduced for problems where subsolutions are not available in closed form. Shows that the linear system defining the Newton search direction is solvable in O(n) time. Numerical experiments (n ∈ [102, 106]) conclude that the interior point method wins over breakpoint search, often by an order of magnitude.

Algorithms based on the Lagrangian relaxation of the explicit constraint (1b) have an older history than the relaxation algorithms. This is probably due to the fact that the relaxation algorithm quite strongly rests on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, which did not become widely available until the end of the 1940s and early 1950s with the work of John (1948), Karush (1939), and Kuhn and Tucker (1951). Lagrangian based algorithms have been present much longer and the famous “Lagrange multiplier method” for equality constrained optimization is classic in the calculus curriculum. Indeed, Lagrange multiplier techniques for our problem (1) date back at least as far as to Beckmann (1952); see Patriksson (2008) for a survey of the history of the problem.

Considering problem (1) and introducing the Lagrange multiplier μ for constraint (1b), we obtain the following conditions for the optimality of x* in (1):

                      and moreover differentiable there. Suppose, for example, that for each j, ϕj
                     ( · ) + μgj
                     ( · ) is weakly coercive on Xj
                      for every μ ≥ 0 [that is, that either Xj
                      is bounded or that for every μ ≥ 0, ϕj
                     (xj
                     ) + μgj
                     (xj
                     ) tends to infinity whenever xj
                      tends to ± ∞], and that ϕj
                      is strictly convex on Xj
                     . In this case the derivative q′ exists on

If we assume that μ* ≠ 0, we search for μ* > 0 such that q′(μ*) = 0 [or, in other words, g(x(μ*)) = b], that is, we need to solve a special equation in the unknown entity μ, where the function q′ is implicitly defined, but is known to be decreasing since q is concave. This equation can of course be solved through the use of any general such procedure [for example, bisection search takes two initial values

Two decisions thus need to be made: how to find the index j*, and how to perform the interpolation. Starting with the former, the easiest means is to run through the indices in ascending or descending order to find the index where q′ changes sign. If we have access to the indices j+ and j− for which

                      then we can choose the midpoint index, check the corresponding sign of q′, and reduce the index set accordingly. Given the sorted list, we can also find this index in some randomized fashion.

As remarked above, algorithms such as bisection search can be implemented without the use of the breakpoints, and therefore without the use of sorting, as long as an initial interval can somehow be found; also general methods for solving the equation q′(μ) = 0, such as the secant method or regula falsi, can be used even without an initial interval; notice however that 
                        
                           q
                           ∉
                           
                              C
                              2
                           
                           ,
                        
                      whence a pure Newton method is not guaranteed to be well-defined.

While the sorting operation used in the ranking and bisection search methods takes O(nlog n) time, it is possible to lower the complexity by choosing the trial index based on the median index, which is found without the use of sorting; the complexity of the algorithm is then reduced to O(n). It is not clear, however, that the latter must always be more efficient, since the “O” definition calls for n to be “large enough”.

We also remark that in the case when the problem (1) arises as a subproblem in an iterative method, as the method converges the data describing the problem will tend to stabilize. This fact motivates the use of reoptimization of the problems, which most obviously can be done by using the previous value of the Lagrange multiplier as a starting point and/or utilizing the previous ordering of the breakpoints; in the latter case, the O(nlog n) sorting complexity will eventually drop dramatically.

In Section 3.1 we consider the breakpoint algorithm for the equality problem (2). In Section 3.2 we describe three pegging methods and in Sections 3.3–3.5 we apply these pegging methods to the breakpoint algorithm. Finally, in Section 3.6 we briefly discuss the convergence and time complexity of the breakpoint algorithm.

We now consider problem (2) where the inequality of the primal constraint is replaced by an equality. For the problem to be convex, the resource constraint (2b) has to be affine, i.e., g(x) ≔ ∑
                           j ∈ J
                        
                        ajxj
                         − b. Beside the resource constraint, the Lagrangian and the optimality conditions will take the same form as for problem (1) but with one important difference; μ is unrestricted in sign, whence the condition (3a) is replaced by “g(x*) = b”.

The origin of the pegging process is found in the relaxation algorithm; see, e.g., Bitran and Hax (1981). The purpose of pegging is to predict properties of the primal variables in the optimal solution from an arbitrary dual value. In Sections 3.2.1–3.2.3 we show how to predict if an optimal primal variable value equals its lower or upper bound, or is strictly within any of the bounds.

If we can determine if a variable equals its lower bound at the optimal solution then we add its variable index to a set L and reduce the original problem. Similarly, if we know that a variable equals its upper bound at the optimal solution then we add the variable index to the set U. Using the sets L and U when solving problem (1) or (2) will be referred to as 2-sets pegging.

Consider problem (6). Assuming that μ* > 0, the constraint (1b) has to be fulfilled with equality. For any given dual variable μk
                            we can determine the primal solution x

                           ) of problem (6) from condition (5). We know from Section 3 that all optimality conditions (3) except the resource constraint (1b) are satisfied. Moreover, we know that the resource constraint has to be fulfilled with equality, in order for the solution to be optimal. Substituting x

If Case 3 or 4 holds it is possible to find a closed form of the optimal solution to the problem (1), see Bretthauer and Shetty (2002b, Proposition 10). Considering problem (2), Cases 3 and 4 cannot occur, since the resource constraint is affine, i.e.,

                            then xj
                           (μ) is nondecreasing and vice versa. This is an essential property for the validity of the pegging process. We can indeed state the following proposition (a similar one can be stated for problem (2), but without the assumption μ* > 0):

As in the 3-sets pegging principle in Section 3.2.2 we determine if a variable takes the value of the lower or upper bound or if the variable strictly belongs to the interval between the lower and upper bound. For 5-sets pegging we also determine if a variable is larger than the lower bound or smaller than the upper bound. 5-sets pegging for problem (1) is used in De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer (2012), generalizing a method from Kiwiel (2008a).

                            equals the upper bound; this might reduce future calculations. The proof of the following proposition follows from the monotonicity of gj
                            and xj
                           (μ) (see De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer, 2012 for a proof).

If we can determine if the value of a variable xj

                         from (5) in future iterations (see Proposition 2). This might save us some operations. Define a set of indices for the lower and upper limit being within the interval of the lower and upper breakpoint for a variable:

                        . From Proposition 2 we have that if j ∈ M then

                         violates the bounds in future iterations. But we should have in mind that to determine if j ∈ M requires some extra operations. If we let the initial values of the limits be

                        . Hence, to avoid unnecessary operations we start by checking if j ∈ M when

                              ∞
                           
                        ; this is in contrast to the algorithms in Kiwiel (2008a, Section 3) and De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer (2012).

We finally define the contribution to the resource constraint from the variables including M: γ(μ) ≔ ∑
                           j ∈ M
                        
                        gj
                        (xj
                        (μ)). Note that the value of γ depends on the value of the parameters in ϕj, gj
                         and μ. If we can separate the parameters from the multiplier μ, i.e., if γ is additively and/or multiplicatively separable [that is, γ(μ, ·) = γ
                        1(μ)γ
                        2( · ) + γ
                        3( · )] then the values of γ
                        2 and γ
                        3 can be calculated successively so that no calculations are done more than once. Consider, for example, the negative entropy function, ϕj
                        (xj
                        ) ≔ xj
                        log (xj
                        /aj
                         − 1) and the resource constraint function gj
                        (xj
                        ) ≔ xj

As in the algorithm MB2 in Section 3.3 we peg the variables whose values equal the lower or upper bounds, and as in MB3 we determine if a variable is strictly within the bounds. Further, we determine if a variable is smaller than the upper bound or larger than the lower bound as in Section 3.2.3. Define a set L
                        − of indices where the optimal solution is known to be strictly smaller than the upper bound in the optimal solution, i.e.,

                         = uj
                        . This will in some cases save us some operations. Further when we determine if xj
                         ∈ M we only need to check if this holds for j ∈ U
                        + or j ∈ L
                        − depending on if we update the lower or upper bound of the dual variable. This differs from the algorithm in De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer (2012) since that algorithm finds M from U
                        +∪L
                        −. Note that we make use of information from earlier iterations when updating δ. When updating δ in De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer (2012) information from earlier iteration is negligible hence some operations are repeated.

Similar to Kiwiel (2008a) and De Waegenaere and Wielhouwer (2012) it is possible to show that the breakpoint algorithms converge to the optimal solution. Consider the time complexity for algorithm MB2, MB3 and MB5. Assuming that the median function median( · ) is linear, we have Cin operations in each of the Steps 0–3.2 for some constants Ci
                         for i ∈ {0; 1; 2; 3.1; 3.2} corresponding to Step 0–3.2 respectively. Since we use a median search function the number of iterations will terminate in log2(n) iterations (in the worst case). Hence the time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog2(n)). However in Brucker (1984) a proof for a time complexity of O(n) is given for the breakpoint algorithm solving the quadratic knapsack problem (24).

In a relaxation algorithm for the problem (1) we iteratively solve the problem relaxed from constraints (1c), i.e., we solve the following problem:

Hence, we solve the problem (9), obtaining a solution

                     ; otherwise Δ = ∇ and we have found the optimal solution. If Δ ≠ ∇, then we reduce the problem by removing the fixed variables, and adjusting the right-hand side of the constraint (1b) to reflect the variables fixed. If any free variables are left, we re-solve problem (9) and repeat the procedure, otherwise we have obtained an optimal solution.

The rationale behind this procedure is quite simple and natural: Suppose that Δ > ∇ holds. We have that

Since in each iteration at least one variable is pegged to an optimal value, the algorithm is clearly finite. The most serious disadvantage of the algorithm may be the requirement that the problem without the variable bounds present must have an optimal solution. The computational efficiency of this method is also determined by whether or not it is possible to provide an explicit formula for each

For the breakpoint algorithm we determine x from (5) for an arbitrary multiplier μ; then we explicitly evaluate the optimality of x by substituting it into the resource constraint (1b). The explicit evaluation leaves us with one out of three possible scenarios: (8a)–(8c). For the relaxation algorithm the traditional method to evaluate a solution to the problem (9) is to calculate the total deficit and excess at

Evaluating the optimality from (12a) to (12c) will be referred to as an implicit evaluation. For the relaxation algorithm we next show that the implicit and explicit evaluations are equivalent. Propositions 4 and 5 below state the relations between explicit and implicit evaluation. The proof of Proposition 5 is similar to the proof of Proposition 4.

                               must satisfy the resource constraint. We know that Δ, ∇ ≥ 0 since gj
                               is increasing. Hence, if Δ = ∇ then (8a) holds, if Δ > ∇ then (8b) holds, and if Δ < ∇ then (8c) holds.□

                               is monotonically decreasing for all j ∈ J, then the explicit evaluation (8a)–(8c) is equivalent to the implicit evaluation (8a)–(8c), i.e., (12a) ⟺ (8a), (12c) ⟺ (8b), and (12b) ⟺ (8c).

In the breakpoint algorithms in Section 3, we use the dual variable to determine if xj
                         equals a bound or if it lies in between the bounds; see (5). In relaxation algorithms the traditional way to solve the problem (1) is to determine the primal optimal solution

                              j
                           
                         of the relaxed problem (9) and then simply check if 
                           
                              
                                 x
                                 ^
                              
                              j
                           
                         is within the lower and upper bounds; see (10). An alternative is to find the optimal dual variable 
                           
                              μ

                         of the relaxed problem (9) and then (similar to the breakpoint algorithm in Section 3) determine the primal variables from (5). Of course this requires us to determine the breakpoints. However, for the variables that violate the bounds (1c) we do not have to determine xj
                         from the relation ϕj
                        (xj
                        ) + μgj
                        (xj

Considering the performance of a relaxation algorithm two decisions need to be made: should the relaxed solution of the problem be evaluated implicitly from ∇ and Δ or explicitly from ∑gj
                         (see Section 4.1)? Should the algorithm solve the primal or dual relaxed problem (see Section 4.2)? An overview of the relaxation algorithm and its possible realizations is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The leftmost path in the figure is the classic primal relaxation algorithm of Bitran and Hax (1981), the rightmost path in the figure is implemented in Stefanov (2001), and the algorithm that applies the right path in Step 1 and the left path in Step 2 is implemented in Kim and Wu (2012). Beside these two paths no other paths have been explored. Our intention is to evaluate the theoretically and practically best performing paths. Since no earlier studies have applied 3- or 5-sets pegging for the relaxation algorithm, our intention is to apply these two more sophisticated pegging methods.

In Section 4.3.1 we present an algorithm corresponding to the leftmost path in Fig. 1; in Section 4.3.2 we present an algorithm which utilizes the rightmost path in Step 1 of Fig. 1 and then changes to the left path in Step 2 of the figure; in Section 4.3.3 an algorithm corresponding to the rightmost path of Fig. 1 is presented; and in Section 4.3.4 an algorithm that utilizes the rightmost path in Step 1 of Fig. 1 and then utilizes the theoretically best path in Step 2 is presented. All algorithms in Sections 4.3.1–4.3.4 utilize 2-sets pegging. In Section 4.3.5 we describe how 3- and 5-sets pegging can be utilized in these.

                              Remark 3
                              For the equality problem (2), μ is unrestricted; hence the algorithm for problem (2) will be similar to the above, except we ignore Step 0.

In Step 1 we have to calculate

                                 | times. In Step 2 we need to find xj
                                  which needs at most 2|Jk
                                 | comparisons. We also have to calculate ∇
                                    k
                                  and Δk
                                 , which implies 2|L∪U| operations.

Instead of evaluating the primal variables in Step 1 as in the algorithm PIR2 in Section 4.3.1, we can evaluate the dual variable μ. Note that if we evaluate the dual variable, then we have to determine the breakpoints in the initialization. Our modification of the algorithm in Section 4.3.1 takes the following form (Steps 0 and 3 are same as in PIR2 and are therefore not repeated):

                              In Step 1 we need to find the optimal dual solution μk
                                  to the relaxed problem. In Step 2 we need at most 2|Jk
                                 | comparisons but we only need to calculate

                                  for j ∈ {L∪U}. For the evaluation we need to calculate ∇
                                    k
                                  and Δk
                                 , which implies 2|L∪U| operations.

As in the algorithm DIR2 in Section 4.3.2 we evaluate the dual variable but instead of evaluating the relaxed solution implicitly we do it explicitly. Define βl

Hence, if (P + Q)|Jk
                           | < (2P + 2Q)|U(μk
                           )∪L(μk
                           )| or, equivalently, |Jk
                           | < 2|U(μk
                           )∪L(μk
                           )|, then using the explicit evaluation of the relaxed solution

                            in Step 2 would require less operations, and it would be more successful to use the algorithm in Section 4.3.3. If however |Jk
                           | > 2|U(μk
                           )∪L(μk
                           )|, then there will be less operations if we use the algorithm in Section 4.3.2. So, we propose a new algorithm that utilizes the cardinalities of the sets Jk

From the proof of convergence of the relaxation algorithm (see Section 4.4) we have that the algorithm improves the lower or the upper bound for the dual variable in each iteration. Hence, similar to the breakpoint algorithm (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5) it is possible to apply 3- and 5-sets pegging for the dual relaxation algorithms DIR2, DER2 and DBR2. Similar to the relaxation algorithm we will denote a relaxation algorithm that uses 3-sets-pegging with a suffix “3”, e.g., DBR3, and one that uses 5-sets-pegging with a suffix “5”, e.g., DBR5. The implementation of 3- and 5-sets pegging is similar for the three dual relaxation algorithms; therefore only DIR3 and DIR5 are given (Step 0 is similar as for PIR in Section 4.3.1):

For the inequality problem (1), optimality and validation for the pegging process for the primal relaxation algorithm PIR2 was established by Bretthauer and Shetty (2002b, Propositions 1–9). Let k* be the iteration where the algorithm terminates. Then Bretthauer and Shetty state that the primal relaxation algorithm generates the following solution for problem (2):

                         Bretthauer and Shetty establish that this solution fulfills all KKT conditions, and therefore is optimal.

The optimality and convergence for the equality problem (2) can be established similarly to the proof for the inequality problem given in Bretthauer and Shetty (2002b) except for the proof for feasibility of the dual variables corresponding to the lower and upper bounds (Propositions 8 and 9 in Bretthauer and Shetty, 2002b). Additionally we do not have to prove that μ* ≥ 0 (Proposition 4 in Bretthauer and Shetty, 2002b) for the equality problem. Therefore we give a complementary proof for the feasibility of the dual variables corresponding to the lower and upper bounds. For the equality problem (2) we have that gj
                        (xj
                        ) = ajxj
                         and in the proof we will assume that aj
                         > 0.

The algorithms in Sections 4.3.2–4.3.4 will also converge to the optimal solution since they are equivalent to PIR.

                         and ∇
                           k
                        , which gives at most C

                        n operations for a constant C
                        2. Steps 3.1 and 3.2 give at most 2n + 1 operations. Further, in the worst case the algorithm only pegs one primal variable in each iteration, which results in n iterations. Hence, we conclude that the algorithm has a complexity of O(n
                        2).


                     Nielsen and Zenios (1992, Section 1.4) develop a quasi-Newton method for finding the dual optimal solution μ* of the problem (2). It is assumed that the objective term ϕj
                      is strictly convex with a derivative 
                        
                           ϕ
                           j
                           ′
                        
                      whose range is 
                        R
                     . They compare their numerical method with three linesearch methods: Helgason et al. (1980), Censor and Lent (1981), and Tseng (1990). Their results show that their numerical method always performs well compared with the other algorithms. They implement their algorithms on a massively parallel computer. This is not our intention. But since the algorithm seems to perform well on parallel computers it makes sense to evaluate it on non-parallel computers.

                     −(μ) is concave (Nielsen and Zenios, 1992, Proposition 8). For some problems, the inverse of the derivative might however result in imaginary values. One solution to this problem is to consider the equivalent maximization problem of (2), i.e., to maximize
                        x
                      − ϕ(x).

                        Remark 9
                        In practice we will choose ɛ > 0 and the algorithm will in most cases stop such that |Ψ(μk
                           )| > 0. Hence we will end up with an approximate solution of the optimal dual variable μ*. The map from the dual space to the primal might not be linear. Hence the primal error might be larger than we expect, i.e.,

This section serves to provide an overview of the procedure for the numerical study. In Section 6.1 we define problem instances for the numerical study. Some theory on how the problem instances can be designed follows in Section 6.2. In Section 6.3 we give a brief overview of performance profiles (Dolan and Moré, 2002) which are used for the evaluation of the numerical study. Finally, in Section 6.4, we describe the computational environment.

For the numerical study we consider five common special cases of problem (2); it also covers the inequality problem (1) when μ* > 0. Only finite values of the lower and upper bounds (2c) are considered, i.e., for j ∈ J, lj
                         > −∞ and uj
                         < ∞. The five problem cases are briefly specified next:

If we have a large population and would like to perform a statistical research among the population, it is practically infeasible to examine every single individual in the population. Instead we can stratify the population into n strata. An example of a stratum might be people of a certain age. Let M be the number of individuals in the entire population and Mj
                               the number of individuals in strata j. If we want to minimize the variance of the entire population we need to allocate the number of samples xj
                               from each strata from:

In the theory of search problem it is determined how a resource b of time should be spent to find an object among n subdivisions of an area with the largest probability. It is assumed that we know the probability mj
                               for an object to be found in subdivision j. The objective component ϕj
                               describes the probability of finding the object in subdivision j and takes the form:

Similarly to the numerical study in Kodialam and Luss (1998), we divide our set of test problem instances into groups containing different portions of the activities within the lower and upper bounds at the optimal solution. Let 
                           
                              H
                              :
                              =
                              {
                              
                              j
                              ∈
                              J
                              ∣
                              
                                 l
                                 j
                              
                              <
                              
                                 x
                                 j
                                 *
                              
                              <
                              
                                 u
                                 j
                              
                              
                              }
                           
                        . Then, the percentage is determined as |H|/n. To motivate this approach, we refer to the variance of CPU times for different portions of active activities in Kodialam and Luss (1998). Further, similar to the numerical study in Kiwiel (2007), we consider different problem sizes n since the theoretical CPU time for different algorithms vary between O(n) and O(n
                        2).

For the problem set, we pseudo randomize the parameters lj, uj
                         and all the parameters associated with ϕj
                         and gj
                        . In the numerical study we use a linear resource constraint such that gj
                        (xj
                        ) = ajxj
                        , where aj
                         > 0 for all j ∈ J. This simplifies the design of the problem set, since ϕj
                         is convex and lj
                         < uj
                         for all j ∈ J. We have that

                        Dolan and Moré (2002) propose a performance profile for the evaluation of optimization software. The method is briefly summarized as follows: Assume that we have a set A of algorithms that consist of na
                         algorithms and a problem set P that consists of np
                         problem instances. Let t

The algorithms are implemented in Fortran 95, compiled with gfortran under mac OS X 10.8.2 (2.5 GHz Intel Core i5, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3).

In this section we present the results from numerical experiments of the problems defined in Section 6.1. If nothing else is mentioned, 100 problem instances of each problem is evaluated for each problem size. Further, the problem instances are designed such that different values of |H|/n are considered, see Section 6.2.

The development of numerical experiments for the problem (1) is illustrated in Table 1
                     , where we cite the size of the largest test problem reported during each decade; the table is an extension of Table 2 in Patriksson (2008).

In Section 7.1 we present performance profiles for the relaxation algorithms defined in Section 4. In Section 7.2 we evaluate the pegging process for both the breakpoint and the relaxation algorithm defined in Section 3. In Section 7.3, the best performing relaxation algorithm and breakpoint algorithm are compared with the quasi-Newton algorithm in Section 5. In Section 7.4 we give a critical review of the numerical study. Finally, in Section 8, we make some overall conclusions.

In the following Figs. 2–4
                     
                     
                      we show performance profiles, as defined in Section 6.3, for three competing sets of algorithms. To summarize the appearance of these plots, for each plot and corresponding competing set of algorithms, the graph for one algorithm shows the portion (between 0 and 1 on the y-axis) of the problem instances considered that are solved within τ (on the x-axis) times the fastest algorithm in the test for problem p. In particular, the value of ρa
                     (1) is the portion of the problems in which algorithm a is the fastest, and

                      is the probability that algorithm a will solve a problem p in P. (The latter information is particularly illustrative and relevant for Fig. 4.)

We evaluate the different paths in Fig. 1. First, recall that PIR2 determines the primal variables while DIR2 determines the dual variable. As can be seen in the leftmost performance profile in Fig. 2, DIR2 is the fastest in 67.8 percent of the problem instances solved. The result is what we can expect from theory, since DIR2 does not need as many operations in Step 1; see Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. PIR2 is faster in 32.2 percent of the problems solved; the latter cases stem mainly from to the negative entropy problem (28) but also from the theory of search problem (27) and the stratified sampling problem (25) when n and |H|/n is small. The reason for PIR2 to be faster in almost all cases for the negative entropy problem is due to the computationally simple expression of the primal variables

                        . Also the computations of the breakpoints might be a larger part of the total time when the equations for the primal/dual variables are simple.

We recall that DER2 applies explicit evaluation, DIR2 applies implicit evaluation and DBR2 applies the theoretically most profitable evaluation. The results are in favor of DBR2 and DIR2; see the rightmost performance profile in Fig. 2. DBR2 is fastest in 70.6 percent, DIR2 is fastest in 25.9 percent and DER2 is fastest in 4.7 percent of the problems solved. (Note that 70.6 percent + 25.9 percent + 4.7 percent = 100.2 percent; in some cases two algorithms are equally fast.)


                        Fig. 2 also shows that the performance of DIR2 and DBR2 are quite similar. For just a few cases DIR2 is more than 1.30 times slower than the fastest algorithm while for as few cases DBR2 is only 1.2 times slower than the fastest algorithm. On average DBR2 performs somewhat better than DIR2.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

For the problem set considered, it is more profitable to evaluate the dual variable even if we have to compute all the breakpoints at the beginning of the algorithm. Hence for the problem set considered DIR2 seems to outperform PIR2.

For the problem set considered, the results show that in most cases it is more profitable to evaluate a solution x

                               implicitly. The small difference between the performance of DBR2 and DIR2 implies that in most cases |Jk
                              | > 2|L(μk
                              )∪U(μk
                              )|. We conclude that DBR2 performs slightly better than DIR2 which agrees with the theory in Section 4.3.4.

We compare the three pegging approaches for the breakpoint and relaxation algorithms described in Sections 3.3–3.5 and 4.3.5, respectively. For the breakpoint algorithm median search is implemented similarly to Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery (1992, Section 8.5).

The performance profiles in Fig. 3 show that 5-sets pegging is nearly always the fastest (MB5 in 95 percent and DBR5 in 94 percent of the problem instances solved). Additionally, when 5-sets pegging is not fastest it is never more than 10 percent slower than the fastest algorithm. It is obvious that for the few cases when 2-sets pegging performs best are when few optimal primal variables equals the lower or upper bounds (|H|/n is small). This follows from the fact that 2-sets pegging does not check if the variables belong to the additional sets that are used in 3- and 5-sets pegging.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In general 5-sets pegging is the most profitable.

                                 Numerical experiments for a breakpoint algorithm applying bisectional search of a sorted sequence of breakpoints, using quicksort as in Knuth (1998, Section 5.2.2), was also performed. The algorithm was on average 1.5 times slower than MB2. Also the algorithm in Zipkin (1980), where the upper bounds are relaxed, was evaluated. The algorithm performed poorly, on average 2.9 times as slow as the breakpoint algorithm applying sorting.

In this section we compare the best performing relaxation algorithm (DBR5), the best performing breakpoint algorithm (MB5), and the numerical quasi-Newton method (NZ) in Section 5. For NZ we use the stopping criterion

                         which is weaker than the stopping criterion in Nielsen and Zenios (1992) ( < 10−4). This will of course give us an approximate optimal solution only. The initial value of the dual variable μ is set to the mean of the breakpoints μ

                        0 = (∑

                        )/aj
                        )/n. If the algorithm does not terminate within 300 CPU seconds then we terminate the algorithm and consider the problem as unsolved.

The reader may have noticed that the breakpoint algorithms in Sections 3.3–3.5 are given without the use of the sets for the pegging process (L, U, M, L
                        −, U
                        +) while the relaxation algorithms in Section 4.3.1–4.3.5 are given with the use of these sets. Of course the notation using these sets, as for the relaxation algorithms, are theoretically more elegant. However, our implementations of the algorithms in Fortran 95 showed that for breakpoint algorithms it was in general more profitable to not use the pegging sets.


                        Fig. 4 shows the performance profile for the algorithms. In general, we can see a significant advantage of using DBR5 since it is fastest for 99.0 percent of the problem instances solved. Moreover, when DBR5 is not the fastest algorithm it is almost as fast as the fastest. From the figure we also see that MB5 is more than 2.7 times slower than the fastest algorithm in 50 percent of the problem instances solved.

The Newton method terminated the fastest for only 1 percent of the test problems, which probably is due to good initial values. Also we should have in mind that NZ terminates with an approximate solution only. The Newton method performs relatively well for the quadratic problem (24), the theory of search problem (27), and the negative entropy problem (28) when |H|/n > 0.8. It is not very successful for the stratified sampling problem (25) and the sampling problem (26). We can see from the performance profile that in 28 percent of the problem instances tested, NZ is more than 5.5 times slower than DBR5 (the fastest algorithm). In 5.3 percent (158/3000) of the problem instances the algorithm does not solve the problem; these problem instances mainly stem from the stratified sampling problem (25) and the sampling problem (26) when |H|/n < 0.3.

By comparing the performance profiles in Fig. 4, we can see that they are very similar. In other words, relative to each other, the performance of the algorithms seems to be similar for different problem sizes n.

Considering the breakpoint algorithm MB5, Fig. 5
                         shows that the CPU time increases when the number of optimal primal variables strictly within the bounds |H|/n grows for the problems in the problem set. Concerning the relaxation algorithm DBR5 the result shows no significant dependence of |H|/n, neither does NZ.

In Fig. 6
                        , we can see that the CPU time for MB5 and DBR5 is linear for n ∈ [50 × 103, 2 × 106] respectively n ∈ [50 × 103, 30 × 106]. This is impressive, since DBR5 has a worst-case time complexity of O(n
                        2). For problem sizes a bit larger than 30 × 106 variables the CPU time tends to increase faster. However, additional computations on a more powerful computer have shown that, for the relaxation algorithm, the quadratic problem has a linear time complexity up to n = 90 × 106, the sampling problem up to n = 100 × 106, the theory of search problem up to n = 70 × 106 and the negative entropy problem up to n = 110 × 106. Hence we would also like to stress that the linearity probably is constrained by the memory of the computer rather than the algebra in the algorithm.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

Even if NZ only finds an approximate solution and even if the stop criterion is weak, NZ is outperformed by DBR5. Hence, we see no reason to evaluate methods for finding the exact optimal solution x* from the approximate solution 
                                 
                                    
                                       x
                                    
                                    
                                       ɛ
                                    
                                    *
                                 
                               generated by NZ. In many cases, NZ fails to solve the stratified sampling problem (25) and the sampling problem (26). This is probably due to the stiffness of the problems.

MB5 performs very well for problems where |H|/n is small. This is due to the pegging process: since we peg a large part of 
                                 
                                    
                                       x
                                       j
                                       k
                                    
                                    ∈

                               in each iteration, the problem is reduced in the next iteration. This follows from the reduction of breakpoints by half in each iteration; note that this does not hold for the relaxation algorithm. This might be the reason for MB5:s dependency of |H|/n. However, DBR5 performs best for almost all of the problem instances solved and it is worth noting that DBR5 never performs poorly.

When we set up the initial values for NZ, we tried different initial values and concluded that the one used was the most profitable on average. However, especially if we customize initial values for each problem, there may still be potential improvements available.

Considering the results in Section 7.1, we consider the dual algorithm (DIR2) to outperform the primal algorithm (PIR2) since it performs better in general. Then we continued to evaluate several modification of the dual algorithm while similar modifications of the primal relaxation algorithm were not evaluated, i.e., we do not evaluate blended evaluation or 3- and 5-sets pegging for the primal algorithm. However since the plausible modification of the primal algorithm would take the same form as for the modification of the dual algorithm it is assumed that a modified dual algorithms will outperform a similar modified primal algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have complemented the survey in Patriksson (2008) on the resource allocation problem at hand, and introduced, and critically evaluated, new implementations of breakpoint and relaxation algorithms for its solution.

The results show that our new implementations (DIR2 and DBR2) of the relaxation algorithm outperform the earlier algorithms (PIR2 and DER2). Hence we should evaluate the dual variable for the relaxation algorithm, i.e., DIR2 outperforms PIR2. Moreover, it is more profitable in theory, as well as in practice, to apply blended evaluation, i.e., DBR2 outperforms DER2 and DIR2. Our results, as well as the results in Robinson et al. (1992), Kodialam and Luss (1998), and Kiwiel (2008b), imply that the relaxation algorithm is to prefer when a closed form of the dual variable μ can be found.

We introduced 3- and 5-sets pegging for the relaxation algorithm and showed that it is most profitable to apply 5-sets pegging, which also holds for the breakpoint algorithm.

For the problems considered, MB5 and DBR5 have a practical time complexity of O(n) also for very large values of n. We also showed that the relaxation algorithm DBR5 performs better than both the Newton-like algorithm NZ and the breakpoint algorithm MB5. Potential future improvements include the implementation of a pegging method for a Newton-like algorithm and/or a hybrid of the different algorithms (NZ, DBR5 and MB5), and, hence, it would be of interest to compare the best algorithms from our study to these.

The findings made herein can most certainly be profitably utilized also in the efficient solution of the more complex versions of the resource allocation problem discussed, for example, in the books by Mjelde (1983), Ibaraki and Katoh (1988), and Luss (2012).
