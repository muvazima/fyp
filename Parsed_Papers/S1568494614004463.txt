                  The Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) is a very efficient multiobjective evolutionary algorithm introduced in recent years. This algorithm works by decomposing a multiobjective optimization problem to many scalar optimization problems and by assigning each specimen in the population to a specific subproblem. The MOEA/D algorithm transfers information between specimens assigned to the subproblems using a neighborhood relation.
                  In this paper it is shown that parameter settings commonly used in the literature cause an asymmetric neighbor assignment which in turn affects the selective pressure and consequently causes the population to converge asymmetrically. The paper contains theoretical explanation of how this bias is caused as well as an experimental verification. The described effect is undesirable, because a multiobjective optimizer should not introduce asymmetries not present in the optimization problem. The paper gives some guidelines on how to avoid such artificial asymmetries.
