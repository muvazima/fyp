                  Radiological assessment of treatment effectiveness of guided bone regeneration (GBR) method in postresectal and postcystal bone loss cases, observed for one year. Group of 25 patients (17 females and 8 males) who underwent root resection with cystectomy were evaluated. The following combination therapy of intraosseous deficits was used, consisting of bone augmentation with xenogenic material together with covering regenerative membranes and tight wound closure. The bone regeneration process was estimated, comparing the images taken on the day of the surgery and 12 months later, by means of Kodak RVG 6100 digital radiography set. The interpretation of the radiovisiographic image depends on the evaluation ability of the eye looking at it, which leaves a large margin of uncertainty. So, several texture analysis techniques were developed and used sequentially on the radiographic image. For each method, the results were the mean from the 25 images. These methods compute the fractal dimension (D), each one having its own theoretic basis. We used five techniques for calculating fractal dimension: power spectral density method, triangular prism surface area method, blanket method, intensity difference scaling method and variogram analysis.
                  Our study showed a decrease of fractal dimension during the healing process after bone loss. We also found evidence that various methods of calculating fractal dimension give different results.
                  During the healing process after bone loss, the surfaces of radiographic images became smooth. The result obtained show that our findings may be of great importance for diagnostic purpose.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Healing time of extensive bone deficits in jaws arising after cyst removal and left empty, is prolonged. Very often bone loss areas do not heal completely leading to volume deficit of the alveolar process and subsequent cosmetic defect especially in anterior parts of the oral cavity [1,2]. The filling of postresectal and postcystal areas with connective tissue instead of bone, may result in pain symptoms as well as difficult radiological differential diagnosis of connective tissue scars with chronic periapical granulation tissue and even with root cyst [3–6]. Many treatment methods are used aiming at filling the osseous cavity with properly woven bone tissue. They are all defined as Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) [7,8]. Definitely, the bone itself is the best regenerating intraosseous loss zones material to be considered [9]. However, it is connected with obtaining sufficient amount of material through making a new wound in the donor place and another bone loss in the jaws. Therefore, alternative solutions are being searched for, basing mainly on xenogenic or alloplastic bone replacing materials, regenerative membranes as well as morphogenic proteins and polypeptide growth factors [10–13].

Regeneration is a key process in healing of bone deficits. Bone loss areas of the diameter greater than 5mm rarely undergo idiopathic restoration. Therefore, the augmentation procedure allows a proper remodeling of a bone structure. The visual assessment of a bone roughness alone is a subjective test. Interpretation of the bone regeneration range after xenogenic material application on the other hand, demonstrates substantial increase in bone density. The results may show proper bone remodeling or the lack of total material integration. That is why there is still need to search for alternative methods of radiographic interpretation of the treatment results.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the texture images provide sufficient data for the analysis of bone structures. Texture measures use statistical [14–16] or structural approaches [17–19]. Fractal methods are considered appropriate for quantifying changes in bone structures, with the ever popular fractal dimension used as descriptor of texture roughness. Fractals, introduced by Mandelbrot [20], are sets of mathematical functions which characterize the geometrical structures of complex, irregular and self-similar systems at multiple scales. Mandelbrot and Van Ness [21] drew attention to the fact that the surfaces occurring in nature should be recognized as the result of random walk. Shaping them, we modeled using fractional Brownian movements.

Mandelbrot described fractal as an object whose Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension or the fractal dimension D is greater than its topological dimension. The fractal objects are characterized by [22]: large degree of heterogeneity, self-similarity, and lack of a well-defined scale. Hausdorff definition is a mathematical foundation of various methods of the fractal dimension estimating. Thus according to various algorithms there are various kinds of fractal dimension For all the methods, the relationship between selected parameters is governed by a power-law [23]:

                                 ε
                                 )
                                 =
                                 const
                                 ⋅
                                 
                                    ε

                                       D
                                       )
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     where: M(ε) are the results of measurements, exponent f(D) a simple function of the fractal dimension D, ɛ is a scale. There is a direct relationship between the exponent and the value of the fractal dimension. So we look at a particular object or phenomenon at different scales. We can calculate D in many ways because Hausdorf-Besicovitch's definition is too complicated for practical estimation, but it helps to create many other definitions and algorithms. These methods compute the fractal dimension, each one having its own theoretic basis. The applied algorithms are different, but they all follow the same basis summarized by the three steps:
                        
                           1.
                           measuring the quantities of the object using different step size,

plotting log-log and fitting using a least-squares regression line through the data points,

estimating D as the slope of the regression line.

These algorithms include three main group measurements: box counting, fractional Brownian motion and perimeter area. To detect texture changes, these methods are applied locally (in small regions centered on the sub-images) (Fig. 1
                     ).

The aim of the present study was to estimate fractal dimension on radiovisiographic images using different algorithms: power spectral density method [24], triangular prism surface area method [25], blanket method [26], intensity difference scaling method [27] and variogram analysis [28], and comparing them to determine the physical roughness.

Treatment results of 25 patients (17 females, 8 males) aged from 18 to 53 (av. 35.6y) with initial diagnosis of root cysts, from Department of Oral Surgery Medical University of Bialystok, were analyzed. Patients generally healthy, in a condition not affecting bone healing process, were qualified for the research. All surgical interventions were conducted under local anesthesia. Bone deficits after all procedures were filled with Bio-Oss xenogenic material and covered with BioGide (Biomateriale Geistlich) resorbable membrane. Bio-Oss is a natural specimen derived from decalcified bovine bone. It is produced on the basis of animal limbs coming from selected farms only. It is characterized by high biocompatibility. Its similarities to human bone may be observed in morphology, crystals structure, chemical composition and internal surface. The Bio-Oss material's porosity is 60% and is equal to human's. Crystals of the specimen are of 0.25–1mm size.

The radiological assessment was performed directly after surgical treatment and 12 months following the intervention (Fig. 2
                     ). Each and every surgical procedure needs a control check-up and estimation of the treatment effectiveness. In a year time after intervention in case of an asymptomatic postsurgical period, radiographic evaluation of periapical region has to be made. A total remodeling of empty inraosseous spaces takes place in first 6–12 months. On the control image, size of the bone loss, bone trabeculae filling the hole, marrow cavities, compact bone surrounding shortened tooth root in case of apical resection, have to be assessed. Therefore, 12 month long observation period seems to be the optimal time. However, the exception of earlier control examination is necessary in case of inflammation of surgical area that stands for a healing complication. Set of Kodak RVG 6100 with effective resolution over 14pl/mm, together with collimator narrowing the radiation beam in a 90 degrees angle technique and constant exposure time of 0.08s were used. The image was saved as graphic files MPG, archived and analyzed.

@&#METHODS@&#

Computer representation of radiographic image is an image matrix, where the gray levels estimate the intensity I. The shades of gray corresponding to elements I(x, y) form a more or less complicated surface. Lack of well defined scale for fractal analysis justifies this approach. The measurement of the roughness of this surface area can provide interesting characteristics. Several texture analysis techniques were developed and used sequentially on the medical images. Each of the methods computing fractal dimension discussed below has its own approach to obtaining the power law which describes the relationship with the scale of measurement, and the results of measurement.

Variogram V(ɛ), that is the expected value of the squares of the differences between the gray levels of two pixels located at a distance ɛ from each other. For a given distance ɛ there are many pairs of pixels, we have many scales in a given image.

Implementation of these methods was done on an Intel I5 Machine workstation. The code was written in C++ (Borland International), and Matlab R2008b. The time of calculation is strongly connected with programming language. Compiled language C++, that produces native binary processor code, is more than 70 times quicker than comparable solution written in interpreted language like Matlab. If the algorithm is computationally complex, it will be better to use a compiled language. The results of computations are of course the same. The best way is to use both languages: Matlab for easiness of prototyping and C++ for speed of computing. For intensity difference scaling method the use of C++ reduces the calculation time to 30s.

                      shows radiovisiographic images with marked regular and irregular regions of interest (a) before the apical surgery, (b) directly after surgical procedure, (c) 12 months after surgery. For the analysis 63×63 regions of interest were taken, because one large region would result in a long calculation time. Special positioners allowing for repeatable images were used during radiographic picture taking, especially for the follow-up visits. All radiographic examinations were made using the straight angle technique that guaranteed recurrence of the results which was essential for digital analysis of the radiograms. In this paper, images after surgical procedure (group I) and 12 months later (group II) were compared. Images before the apical surgery differ from the post surgical state in a visible way. Radiological investigation is used for the assessment of the healing process after bone loss in resected and cystic areas.

Significant increase (P
                     <0.001) of fractal dimension of radiovisiographic images was found in patients directly after surgical procedure (group I) for all methods (Table 1
                     ). Statistical analysis was performed by means of non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. The results of the mean values of fractal analysis of regular and irregular regions of Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4
                      and Table 1.

                     , visualizations of differences between the mean values of fractal dimension estimated using various methods from Fig. 4 are shown. For both groups I and II very significant differences appear in the estimates obtained by using different algorithms.

The ability of bone tissue to proliferate is seen in case of intraosseous deficits with rich blood supply with an easy access to osteoinductive proteins, where biomaterials show their osteoinductive action. A new bone tissue at the periphery of the empty space as well as osteoblasts stimulation, osteoid accumulation and bone trabecules formation until total deficit fulfillment, may be seen on the first month after the surgical procedure. It altogether is responsible for changes seen in radiographic image.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Apicoectomy is the treatment method standing for resection of the root apex along with inflammatory changes. The periapical surgery with cyst enucleation is strictly related to enormous bone loss that heals for a long period of time and moreover does not close up completely. Guided Bone Regeneration is the one recommended in filling bone deficits. Radiological investigation is used for assessment of the healing process after bone loss. In standard radiology, bone properties are identified using reduced shadow density in a radiogram. The interpretation of the image depends on who does it, which causes a large margin of uncertainty. Subjective evaluation of changes observed during the healing process after bone loss, encourages search for measurable algorithms.

In the paper of Southard et al. [34], alveolar process bone during simulated osteoporosis using fractal dimension was analyzed. A strong correlation between generalized demineralization and decreasing fractal dimension was found. Wagle et al. [35] showed that an increase in normal fractal dimension varies along the entire root length from the apex to the cementoenamel junction. In other papers radiographic images representing bone loss texture were analyzed [33,36–40]. The usefulness of the fractal methods in the analysis of the bone structure was confirmed.

Our study showed the differences in radiovisiographic images in patients directly after surgical procedure and then 12 months later. It is shown that fractal dimension values were significantly higher in the first group than in the second group. The results of fractal dimension performed using power spectral density method, triangular prism surface area method, blanket method, intensity difference scaling method and variogram method were different. However, for all the methods of fractal dimension, radiographs made directly after surgical procedure were higher than 12 months later. Texture analysis showed that during the healing process after bone loss, the images became smooth. Differences in values of fractal dimension estimated by various algorithms are inevitable. Comparison between radiographs is possible only when using the same method. The fractal dimension is a non-morphometric parameter. In fact, we have many kinds of fractal dimensions. The differences can be very substantial. Furthermore, different authors could feature in different ways binding value of the exponent f(D) with D. For example, for spectral method, the relationships between slope β and D are: D
                     
                        s
                     
                     =4+
                     β/2, according [28], or D
                     
                        s
                     
                     =7−
                     β/2 [41].

It seems that the medical image fractal dimension can be used as comparative statistics in comparing the two images or two regions of interest.
