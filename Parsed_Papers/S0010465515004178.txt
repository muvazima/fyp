                  This work extends the previous two-dimensional compact scheme for the Cahn–Hilliard equation (Lee et al., 2014) to three-dimensional space. The proposed scheme, derived by combining a compact formula and a linearly stabilized splitting scheme, has second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. The discrete system is conservative and practically stable. We also implement the compact scheme in a three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement framework. The resulting system of discrete equations is solved by using a multigrid. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm by several numerical experiments.

                      is the outward normal vector at the boundary. The CH equation has been widely used in many fields such as in the physical and materials sciences  [3–5], fluid dynamics [6–9], biological simulations  [10,11], image processing [12,13] and surface/volume reconstruction  [14]. Therefore, it is very important to develop accurate and efficient numerical schemes to solve the CH equation.

Many research papers have been published on the numerical methods for the CH equation [15–24]. Regarding time discretization, most of the schemes referenced above have used explicit, implicit–explicit, Crank–Nicolson or Adams–Bashforth methods. However, as the CH equation has fourth-order spatial derivatives and a nonlinear term, the use of an explicit time scheme leads to severe time step restrictions to ensure stability. Although the fully implicit approach can use a large time step, it only has first-order accuracy in time and therefore requires small time steps to guarantee accuracy. On the other hand, for higher-order numerical solutions, the Crank–Nicolson and Adams–Bashforth methods would be better choices.

Regarding space discretization, most of these numerical solutions have second-order accuracy in spatial discretizations. Compact difference methods have been developed for biharmonic  [25,26], convection–diffusion [27,28], Poisson  [29–31], Navier–Stokes  [32], and Helmholtz  [33] equations. These methods achieve high-order accuracy without a significant increase in the number of grid points in each coordinate direction. It should be pointed out that in the finite difference framework, we can straightforwardly derive high-order schemes by increasing the number of grid points in each coordinate direction. However, this may be problematic when those points are close to the domain boundary. Possible ways in which to overcome this challenge would either be to switch to a different solver in proximity of the boundary or to introduce a second boundary layer by interpolation  [31]. This, however, generally lowers the overall accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, when multigrid or adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods are used, this problem becomes more obvious, because the same spatial operators would have to be performed on both coarse and fine grid levels, which is much more difficult. Therefore, compact high-order schemes, which need less information from neighboring grid points, are better choices.

To date, there are few studies of the CH equation, which have used the high-order difference method. Li et al.  [34] established a three-level linearized compact difference scheme for the CH equation. Song  [35] discretized the CH equation by using a fourth-order compact difference scheme in space and first-order, second-order, or third-order implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta schemes in time. Lee et al.  [36] presented a fourth-order spatially accurate and practically stable compact difference scheme for the CH equation in two-dimensional space. However, we are not aware of any results for the three-dimensional CH equation on second-order time and fourth-order space discretization, a combination known to exhibit excellent stability.

The objective of this paper is to propose a high-order compact scheme for the CH equation in three-dimensional space. We demonstrate that our scheme has second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space, which is an extension of the previous results for two-dimensional space  [36]. The discrete system has the ability to preserve mass conservation, uses large-size time steps and exhibits excellent stability. We solve the resulting system of discrete equations by a linear multigrid. In addition, we implement our approach in the AMR framework. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm by conducting several numerical experiments.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we derive the fourth-order compact finite difference scheme and its properties are proved. In Section  3, we present the numerical experiments. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section  4.

Here, we consider the periodic boundary conditions to simplify the presentation. We use an approximation storage multigrid method to solve the linear discrete system (10) and (11) at the implicit time level. For additional details and background information pertaining to the multigrid method, please refer to the reference text  [40]. We define the discrete total energy functional by

                         suggest the phases are gathered together and the surface becomes smooth due to the CH equation. In Fig. 2, we also observe that with our proposed scheme, the total discrete energy is non-increasing and the mass concentration of the numerical solution remains.

Here we consider the spatial and temporal convergence tests of the proposed method. We obtained the spatial convergence rate by performing a number of simulations with increasingly finer grids

                        . Because we refined the spatial and temporal grids by a factor of 4 and 2, respectively, the ratio of successive errors should increase by a factor of 4. The errors and rates of convergence obtained by these definitions are given in Table 1
                        . The results suggest that the scheme has fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time, as expected from the discretization.

                         shows the total energy evolution, which suggests that our proposed scheme allows the use of large time steps. In addition, the evolving patterns are similar when

                         are chosen. We record the time by the CPU after ten time steps. Note that each iteration is run until the maximum error of the residual is less than 10−6. Because we refined the spatial grids by a factor of eight, computational times should ideally also be increased by a factor of eight due to the discretizations (10) and (11) and the multigrid method that was used.

                         shows the averaged CPU times versus the number of points on the mesh grid (

Next, we performed a numerical experiment using an example of spinodal decomposition of a binary mixture. Spinodal decomposition is a mechanism by which a solution of two or more components separates into different phases  [1,2,41]. Here, we will consider this problem for the CH equation with the initial condition

The AMR method  [42,43] is more efficient than a method based on uniform mesh because it allows multi-resolution in interesting regions without requiring a fine grid resolution across the whole domain. This advantage has been widely exploited  [44–46]. Our method can be straightforwardly applied to an AMR framework. The initial condition is chosen as

                         shows the evolution resulting from the use of the AMR method and the consequent dynamical adjustment of the hierarchical structure of the grid around the interface transition region. This simulation demonstrates that our proposed higher-order numerical scheme can be straightforwardly applied to AMR framework.

One of the applications of the CH equation is to obtain triply-periodic minimal surfaces. The surfaces, which have a constant mean curvature everywhere on the surface and are periodic in three independent directions, are often referred to as triply periodic minimal surfaces. Triply-periodic minimal surfaces  [47] are of special interest to physical scientists, materials scientists and mathematicians, because the geometry of triply periodic minimal surfaces strongly influences the physical properties of the material.

                        .  [5] generated triply periodic constant mean curvature surfaces using a Cahn–Hilliard method. Starting from the periodic nodal surface approximation to minimal surfaces, they generated various constant mean curvature surfaces with given volume fractions. We generate initial configurations with the desired topology by taking the following explicit approximations of the Schwarz primitive (P), Schwarz diamond (D), and Schoen gyroid (G)  [5,47] on the unit domain:

                         It should be pointed out that the above explicit forms are neither minimal nor constant mean curvature surfaces  [5]. For each case, we perform three tests of which the first two are performed with our proposed fourth-order scheme. In these two tests, the values of 
                           ϵ
                           =

                           h
                         are chosen to be the same, but different spatial step sizes, namely 
                           h
                           =
                           1

                           128
                         are used. In the third test, we use second-order schemes such as those introduced in  [5] and choose the following parameters: 
                           ϵ
                           =

                           t

                           0.1563
                        , respectively. Fig. 8(b) shows the zero contours of 
                           ϕ

                              z
                              )
                           
                         and Fig. 8(c) is the closed view of Fig. 8(b). These results suggest that our proposed method can generate a family of the triply periodic constant mean curvature surfaces. Furthermore, we find that the agreement between the solutions computed by second-order schemes with 
                           h
                           =

                           128
                         and our proposed method with 
                           h
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           64
                         is good. We also list the CPU time for the three cases in Table 2
                        . These results indicate that the accuracy of the numerical solutions can be improved by using smaller time steps in the second-order scheme. Therefore, this approach required much more computational time than a fourth-order scheme.

We extend our proposed method to volume reconstruction from slice. Three-dimensional volume reconstruction from a sequence of medical images has numerous applications such as medical diagnostics, plastic and artificial limb surgery, and treatment planning  [48]. For three-dimensional volume reconstruction using slice data, we considered a modified Cahn–Hilliard equation containing a fidelity term  [14]:

                         in the input slice. The algorithms (15) and (16) have two features. One of which is that the values in the input slice are close to those in the original input slice. The second feature is that in the non-input slice, the values are obtained by curvature-driven diffusions and utilizing the volume information from the original (known) input slice data. Our proposed scheme can be extended to discretize Eqs. (15) and (16) as:

                         are chosen. Note that in this section, we use a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition to ensure that both the concentration and the chemical potential corresponding to match the requirement of the volume reconstruction from slice. Fig. 9(c) shows the result of volume reconstruction from medical images of a human bone (tibia and fibula). As can be seen, our algorithm renders a good representation of the bone image and produces good visual quality.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we extended the previous two-dimensional compact scheme for the Cahn–Hilliard equation to the three-dimensional space. The proposed scheme, derived by combining a compact formula and linearly stabilized splitting scheme, has second-order accurate in time and fourth-order accurate in space. The discrete system can preserve the total mass and can use large time step sizes and exhibits excellent stability. In addition, our approach also provides a framework that can be extended to discretize most existing modified Cahn–Hilliard equations and adaptive mesh refinement framework. Several numerical experiments were performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
