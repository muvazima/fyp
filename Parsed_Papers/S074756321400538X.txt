                  For acquiring new skills or knowledge, contemporary learners frequently rely on the help of educational technologies supplementing human teachers as a learning aid. In the interaction with such systems, speech-based communication between the human user and the technical system has increasingly gained importance. Since spoken computer output can take on a variety of forms depending on the method of speech generation and the employment of prosodic modulations, the effects of such auditory variations on the user’s learning achievement require systematic investigation. The experiment reported here examined the specific effects of speech generation method and prosody of spoken system feedback in a computer-supported learning environment, and may serve as validational tool for future investigations of spoken computer feedback effects on learning. Learning performance in a basic cognitive task was compared between users receiving pre-recorded, naturally spoken system feedback with neutral prosody, pre-recorded feedback with motivating (praising or blaming) prosody, or computer-synthesized feedback. The observed results provide empirical evidence that users of technical tutoring systems benefit from pre-recorded, naturally spoken feedback, and do even more so from feedback with motivational prosodic modulations matching their performance success. Theoretical implications and considerations for future implementations of spoken feedback in computer-based educational systems are discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Today’s learning is not anymore restricted to the classroom where human students are instructed by human teachers. Learners frequently employ educational technologies like e-learning platforms, smartphone applications or console games to improve their skills and further their knowledge. Tools like computer-assisted instruction and intelligent tutoring systems (e.g., Cognitive Tutor,

                     ) have been specifically developed to simulate human teachers’ and tutors’ behavior and support learners in reaching their study objectives by giving targeted assistance and adaptive feedback customized to their users’ individual knowledge and performance (Larkin & Chabay, 1992; Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995; Bayraktar, 2001; Shute & Towle, 2003; Woolf, 2010; Graesser, Conley, & Olney, 2012).

In the interaction with such educational technologies, like in any interaction between human users and technical systems, a multitude of dialogue forms can occur, ranging from simple commands to information retrieval dyads to elaborate ‘conversations’ (Allen et al., 2001). Besides the content of the system’s contributions to such dialogues, an important issue to consider is the form in which the system output is generated. In principle, a tutoring system’s contributions to the dialogue can be transported in a variety of ways. They can be presented through visual as well as auditory channels, and in both modalities verbal (written text or speech; e.g., AutoTutor) and non-verbal output (symbols, colors, or tones; e.g., Andes) are possible. In certain (non-tutorial) applications, even tactile feedback has been proven useful (Akamatsu, Mackenzie, & Hasbroucq, 1995). However, due to its closeness to the predominant inter-human dialogue form and based on the ever increasing demand for hands-free and eyes-free interfaces, there is a continuing trend towards speech-based system interfaces, regarding both user input and computer output (Cohen & Oviatt, 1995; Nass & Gong, 2000; Allen et al., 2001; Graesser, VanLehn, Rosé, Jordan, & Harter, 2001; Nass & Brave, 2005).

When considering this development, it becomes crucial to take a closer look at the potential effects of auditory variations in such ‘spoken’ system output. Especially for developers of computer-based tutoring systems it is highly relevant to know not only with which words the technical tutor should respond to the learner’s input, but also how the speaking system’s voice should sound to optimally support the user’s learning progress. Therefore, besides the content of the feedback given by the program, it is essential to empirically validate the effects of the way in which the feedback is spoken on users’ learning performance.

One highly important aspect of speech is its prosody, i.e., the rhythm, stress, and intonation of the produced utterances. In human-to-human interaction, prosody is employed as a linguistic means serving a variety of purposes. Prosodic variations are employed by human speakers to separate the speech stream into structural units (syntactic prosody), but also to express emotions and intentions (emotional prosody). Human recipients then use these prosodic cues to analyze the syntactic structure of the sentence (parsing) and to assess the intentions and feelings of the speaker. In an educational context, teachers may employ emotional prosody to underline evaluative feedback and motivating comments which are part of the standard initiation–response–feedback (IRF) exchange (cf. Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975).

While in the last few decades a substantial amount of research has been conducted with regard to the production and processing of syntactic as well as emotional prosody in the interaction between humans (see, e.g., Frick, 1985; Price, Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, & Fong, 1991; Baum & Pell, 1999; Scherer, 2003; Friederici & Alter, 2004; Wildgruber, Ackermann, Kreifelts, & Ethofer, 2006; Wolff, Schlesewsky, Hirotani, & Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, 2008), little effort has been directed towards enlightening the role of prosody in the context of human–computer interaction, especially regarding the effects of emotional prosody produced by the computer. Available data from this field rather focused on the recognition and classification of human prosody by technical systems (cf. Cowie et al., 2001; Schuller, Rigoll, & Lang, 2003; El Ayadi, Kamel, & Karray, 2011) or on the problem of how to simulate prosodic variations in synthesized speech (e.g., Murray & Arnott, 1993; Schröder, 2001, 2009; Burkhardt & Stegmann, 2009), but in how far prosodic variations employed by a technical system might influence a human user attempting to interact with the system remains a largely open question. Even though several basic emotions are now prosodically implemented in various speech synthesizing programs (for a continuously updated overview, see Burkhardt, 2014), thereby rendering an examination of their impact feasible, controlled empirical studies in this regard are still pending.

Computer-assisted learning can be expected to be particularly susceptible to the impact of prosodic variations in the system output, since it constitutes an environment in which feedback given by the technical system plays an important role for the user’s learning progress and the user is thus effectively dependent on the system feedback. Therefore, it is especially interesting to examine whether prosodic modulations in system feedback can enhance users’ learning success in the task they are trying to complete with the system’s help.

In the context of learning, it is opportune to select prosodic variations that are known to have a motivating effect in human learning, since—besides other factors like intelligence, task-specific skills, or attention—the learner’s motivation has long been known to have a substantial effect on learning success (Stipek, 2001; Pintrich, 2003), especially in situations where learning is self-regulated (Zimmerman & Schunk, 2012, chap. 1) and computer-assisted (Song & Keller, 2001).

An individual’s motivation for a particular behavior is partially based on dispositional sources which are relatively stable and unaffected by external factors, e.g., the individual’s need for achievement (Murray, 1938; McClelland, Atkinson, & Clark, 1953; McClelland, 1985; Thrash, Elliot, & Schultheiss, 2007), esteem needs (Maslow, 1954), need for competence (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2002), causal attributions for success and failure (Weiner, 1979, 1985, 2005, chap. 5), or goal orientation (Dweck, 1986; Ames & Archer, 1988; Elliot, 2005, chap. 4), and partially stems from the intrinsic interest and pleasure in the behavior itself (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Renninger, 2000). However, the desired behavior can also be extrinsically motivated by the prospect of desirable outcomes (Ryan & Deci, 2000a, 2000b).

In educational initiation–response–feedback exchanges, praise and blame are frequently consulted for this purpose: Here, positive feedback (i.e., informative feedback following a correct response) is often accompanied by praising comments, while negative feedback (i.e., feedback following an incorrect response) often entails blame or criticism in addition to its informational content. It is noteworthy that there may also be paradoxical effects of praise and blame on students’ motivation; however, these appear to be limited to specific circumstances, like excessive praise for success in a task perceived as very easy, or in a task that other students did not receive praise for (e.g., Meyer, 1992; Miller & Hom, 1996; Kaspar & Stelz, 2013). Similarly, negative effects of praise on students’ achievement have been reported in cases where praise has been administered unsystematically, i.e., independent of the correctness of the students’ responses (Brophy, 1981). If, on the other hand, praise and blame are employed in a contingent fashion focusing on the student’s individual mastery of the task, they can be considered effective tools of operant conditioning (cf. Skinner, 1953; see also O’Leary & O’Leary, 1977; Brophy, 1981; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002; Pintrich, 2003; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Couched in this framework, praise (or more generally, positive reinforcement) is employed to enhance a desired behavior (i.e., correct responses), while blame (or more generally, punishment) serves to reduce the occurrence of undesired (i.e., incorrect) behavioral responses.

At this point, it is useful to consider how the assumed effects of praise and blame may translate to feedback given by a technical system. Since there is ample evidence that users tend to treat computers like human beings – attributing them with emotions and intentions even though they are fully aware that computers are not human (i.e., the CASA—Computers Are Social Actors—Paradigm; Reeves & Nass, 1996; Nass & Moon, 2000; Lee & Nass, 2010, chap. 1), it is reasonable to assume that such conditioning mechanisms may have similar effects if employed by a technical system. Following the effective usage of praise and blame in human education, it therefore appears suitable to examine the implementation of praising and blaming prosody into the feedback given by a technical tutoring system. If computer-assisted learning is in fact susceptible to the usage of prosodic praise and blame, we should thus be able to observe an improved learning performance with prosodically motivational feedback in comparison to prosodically neutral feedback.

On a semantic level (i.e., regarding the textual content of the utterances, not their prosody), at least the effects of computer-generated praise have been examined before (Fogg & Nass, 1997). While the authors did not report any effects on actual task performance, they showed that (written) praise given by a computer can have beneficial effects on the users’ subjectively perceived performance, their mood, and their evaluation of the computer. Since this was the case with “sincere” praise (i.e., praise described to participants as contingent upon correct responses) as well as with “flattery” (i.e., praise described as independent of response correctness), the authors suggested that “computers should praise people frequently—even when there may be little basis for the evaluation” (Fogg & Nass, 1997, p. 559). Similarly, Mumm and Mutlu (2011) observed an increase in self-reported motivation and willingness to continue with the task when written praise was given irrespective of participants’ actual task performance (speed in a letter-counting task).

However, while such non-contingent praising feedback may improve psychological parameters such as the user’s affect and feelings of self-efficacy (cf. Bandura, 1977, 2012), the question of potential effects on actual task performance remains unanswered. It is conceivable that, in a computer-supported learning environment, unconditional praise should not be able to enhance actual performance since—not being contingently combined with informative feedback on performance—it cannot be effectively capitalized on for learning (see above; Brophy, 1981; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002; Pintrich, 2003; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). By comparison, feedback that is semantically contingent with respect to the correctness of the user’s input, i.e., positive feedback (e.g., “yes”) for correct responses and negative feedback (e.g., “no”) for incorrect responses, provides a dependable information source for learners to rely on, and it can be experimentally combined with the application of either neutral or praising/blaming prosody to examine the motivational effects of those variations on actual user performance. Consequently, this approach was chosen for the experiment presented here.

A second point of interest regarding the optimization of spoken feedback in speech-based tutorial systems addresses the question in how far user performance may be affected not only by motivational prosody but also by the employed means of feedback generation. Here, one needs to differentiate between utterances that are pre-recorded from a human speaker and later played back by the system and utterances that are computer-generated by means of speech synthesizing software like Mary

                           5
                        . While it is certainly intuitive for software developers to aspire toward increasingly natural-sounding levels of speech synthesis, it is not at all clear whether—beyond long settled initial issues of intelligibility—there is an actual advantage of natural-sounding speech over synthetic-sounding speech, e.g., in the form of user performance benefits.

In a previous experiment by Nass, Foehr, and Somoza (2001), happy and sad stories that were presented in synthesized speech were rated as more likeable and more credible than the same stories presented in pre-recorded natural speech. However, from these results it is not possible to derive how the usage of synthesized vs. natural speech may affect the user’s performance in a learning task. Furthermore, Nass et al. (2001) used (natural and synthesized) sad and happy voices that were matched or mismatched with the sad and happy stories, and the authors acknowledge that the synthesized speech may have been perceived as less emotional, so the differences observed between synthesized and recorded speech might in fact rather be based on differences in emotionality/neutrality than on the speech modality per se. To investigate the effects of speech generation type in isolation, a comparison of prosodically neutral, non-emotional utterances in natural vs. synthesized speech would therefore constitute a valuable addition to the data available so far.

While the predictions regarding the direction of a potential effect of motivational prosody are based on a vast literature on reinforcement learning and are therefore rather straightforward (i.e., if there are any prosodic influences, we expect a better learning performance with motivational than with neutral prosody, see Section 1.1), forming a directed hypothesis for the effects of pre-recorded vs. synthesized feedback on a user’s learning performance is more difficult. Important experimental differences notwithstanding, the results reported by Nass et al. (2001; see above) may suggest an advantage for computer-supported learning employing synthesized feedback. On the other hand, the CASA paradigm (Reeves & Nass, 1996; Nass & Moon, 2000; see Section 1.1) tells us that computers are perceived as social actors and are attributed with human properties by their users. As a consequence, users tend to prefer in computers what they prefer in human interaction partners. One such preference that has been shown to occur in the interaction with machines as well as with humans is the preference for similarity (social identification; Tajfel & Turner, 1979). For instance, users tend to prefer working with systems using same-gender voices (Lee, Nass, & Brave, 2000) and with systems displaying a similar “personality” to their own (Nass & Lee, 2001). Should this preference for more user-like machines translate into a better learning performance when interacting with a tutoring system, one could assume a beneficial effect of system feedback if it sounds more human (and therefore user-like), i.e., if it is pre-recorded instead of computer-synthesized. Then again—though this seems rather unlikely considering the abundance of natural speech-based appliances in today’s environment—one should not neglect the possibility of contrary effects comparable to the ‘uncanny valley’ effects in robotics and 3D computer animations, which refer to results showing that robots and avatars resembling humans are only accepted up to a certain degree of humanness and are rejected should they appear too human—until they are not at all recognizable as technical systems anymore and therefore accepted as humans (Mori, 1970; MacDorman & Ishiguro, 2006; Moore, 2012; for an equivalent rejection of “partially human” auditory computer interfaces, see Huang, Lee, Nass, Paik, & Swartz, 2000). In sum, the comparison of naturally spoken vs. synthesized machine feedback is at this point best characterized as an exploratory endeavor not warranting one-sided predictions in either direction.

To examine the effects of feedback generation mode (pre-recorded vs. synthesized) and prosody (neutral vs. motivational), a simple computer-controlled experiment was conducted in which participants were required to learn the categorization of sounds according to certain acoustic features. More precisely, participants were presented with frequency modulated tones of varying duration, intensity, frequency range, modulation direction, and modulation speed, and were asked to indicate after listening to each sound whether it constituted a “target” or a “non-target” sound. In the beginning of the experiment, the relevant stimulus properties for this categorization (in this experiment, duration and modulation direction; e.g., short/rising sounds as targets) were not known to the participants and therefore had to be inferred from the system feedback. To this avail, contingent positive or negative feedback was presented auditorily following each participant response. One of the experimental groups received this feedback as computer-synthesized speech with a neutral prosody (Group SYNTH), one as pre-recorded natural speech with a neutral prosody (Group NEUT), and one as pre-recorded natural speech with a motivational (i.e., praising or blaming) prosody (Group MOTI).

                        Note that, while several types of emotional prosody have been implemented by current speech synthesizing software (see Section 1.1), these are to date mostly limited to major emotional categories like joy, anger or sadness, and do not include such specific prosodies as praise or blame. Due to this present lack of synthesized speech with motivational prosodies, it is currently not possible to examine the questions at hand in a 2

We analyzed data collected from 46 participants (23 female) aged 19–35years (mean age 25.9years) with normal hearing. The data from a further eleven participants (five SYNTH, two NEUT, four MOTI) were excluded from the statistical analysis based on the results of a post-experimental questionnaire which showed that they had failed to learn the required categorization correctly.

The experimental stimuli consisted of 240 different frequency-modulated (FM) tones. The relevant stimulus properties for the discrimination task were duration (400 vs. 800ms) and direction of frequency modulation (rising vs. falling), resulting in four basic categories of tones: short/rising, short/falling, long/rising, and long/falling. For each participant one of these categories was the target category, while the other three categories were non-targets (counter-balanced across participants). In addition, the tones also differed in intensity (low intensity tones ranging from 76 to 81dB vs. high intensity tones ranging from 86 to 91dB), speed of modulation (0.25 vs. 0.5 octaves per second), and frequency range (low frequency tones ranging from 500 to 831Hz vs. high frequency tones ranging from 1630 to 2639Hz).

The feedback stimuli consisted of four positive and four negative feedbacks as well as one time-out feedback, all spoken in standard German (positive: ja, “yes”; richtig, “right”; ja, richtig, “yes, right”; stimmt, “correct”; negative: nein, “no”; falsch, “wrong”; nein, falsch, “no, wrong”; stimmt nicht, “not correct”; time-out: zu spät, “too late”).

Each participant received these feedbacks in one of three different types of prosody, depending on experimental group. Group NEUT 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                         received neutrally spoken natural feedback, Group MOTI 
                           
                              (

                              =
                              16
                              )
                           
                         received motivationally spoken natural feedback (with a praising prosody for positive feedback and a blaming prosody for negative feedback), and Group SYNTH 
                           
                              (
                              n
                              =
                              14
                              )
                           
                         received neutrally spoken computer-synthesized feedback.

Both types of naturally spoken feedback (Groups NEUT and MOTI) were digitally recorded from a female German professional speaker. The recordings were taken from the evaluated motivational feedback corpus MOTI (Wolff & Brechmann, 2012) which includes neutral, praising, blaming, and sympathetic prosodies for the evaluative feedback utterances employed here (i.e., ja, richtig, etc.; see above) as well as for six pseudowords (words without semantic content) and was evaluated by 24 German native speakers (12 female) aged 20–35years. For the feedback stimuli employed here, recognition rates were 78%, 97%, and 94% for the neutral, praising, and blaming prosody, respectively.

The synthetic feedback was computer-generated with the Mary text-to-speech synthesizing system (version 3.6.0; German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Saarbrücken, Germany; see Footnote 4), employing the neutral female voice profile mbrola-de-5. It needs to be mentioned that, due to an error in the stimulus construction process, the experimental timing was not identical in all three conditions: While all audio files of naturally spoken feedbacks contained the respective recording preceded and followed by 20ms of silence, the files of synthesized feedbacks contained an average silence of 307ms (SE 26ms) before and 327ms (SE 36ms) after the core of the utterance. While a replication of the experiment with equally timed stimulus presentation is certainly warranted, the data obtained with the utilized stimulus materials were still considered viable for analysis for several reasons. First, although such a difference is above the threshold for just noticeable computer feedback delays when subjects are instructed to attend to seldom delays in feedback (Miller, 1968; Kohrs, Angenstein, Scheich, & Brechmann, 2010), the human–computer dialogue is only disturbed if such a delay is unexpected (Shneiderman & Plaisant, 2005). This was clearly not the case here since the timing was consistent throughout the run of the experiment for each of the experimental groups. Second, the divergent timing in Group SYNTH does not affect any of the conceivable effects of motivational prosody (Group MOTI vs. Group NEUT), thus rendering the respective comparison fully interpretable.


                        Table 1
                         shows the acoustic properties of the synthesized and recorded feedback stimuli (fundamental frequency mean and range, intensity, and duration of the core utterances).

The experimental tones were presented in a pseudo-randomized order via headphones, while participants were seated comfortably in a sound-attenuated chamber. After listening to each tone, participants were asked to press one of two buttons, with one button indicating that the tone they had just heard was a target tone, and the other button indicating that it was a non-target tone (assignment to left and right button counter-balanced across participants). Fifty milliseconds after the button-press (or after a period of 2000ms had elapsed), the feedback about the correctness of the response (or about the time-out) was presented. Since participants were not informed about the relevant stimulus properties prior to the experiment, they were required to make use of the feedback to learn which types of tones constituted target stimuli and which did not. Following an inter-trial interval of 2500ms, the next tone was presented.

Performance and reaction times in the discrimination task were each analyzed by crossing the 3-level between-subjects factor FEEDBACK (NEUT vs. MOTI vs. SYNTH) and the 6-level within-subjects factor TIME (Blocks 1–6, each block containing 40 experimental trials). Due to its robustness to violations of sphericity (see the results of the Mauchly test statistics in Section 3), a multivariate approach was chosen for analysis (MANOVA; cf. O’Brien & Kaiser, 1985; see also Maxwell & Delaney, 2004, chap. 14; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013, chap. 8).

Significant FEEDBACK×TIME interactions were resolved by conducting univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the 3-level factor FEEDBACK for each level of TIME. In case of significant effects of FEEDBACK, two planned contrasts were calculated: First, to elucidate whether in naturally spoken feedback, motivational prosody elicits a performance benefit in comparison to neutral prosody (directional hypothesis), these two prosodies were compared with each other (NEUT vs. MOTI; one-tailed t-test). Second, to examine a possible difference between naturally spoken feedback and computer-synthesized feedback (non-directional hypothesis), the two neutral feedback types were compared (NEUT vs. SYNTH; two-tailed t-test).

In the following, only significant effects, i.e., effects with a p-value smaller than

                        , will be reported. Statistical analyses were carried out hierarchically, i.e., only significant interactions were resolved. No adjustment of the α value was applied for the evaluation of the planned contrasts, since their number did not exceed the number of FEEDBACK df (i.e., two; cf. Keppel, 1991, chap. 8).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The analyses described above show two significant effects: first, a learning advantage for participants receiving pre-recorded neutral feedback over those who received computer-synthesized neutral feedback, and second, a learning benefit for participants receiving prosodically motivational instead of neutrally spoken pre-recorded feedback.

The absence of significant group differences in reaction times ensures that there was no speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT; Fitts, 1966; Schouten & Bekker, 1967; Wickelgren, 1977; Bogacz, Wagenmakers, Forstmann, & Nieuwenhuis, 2010), i.e., the performance advantages for natural and motivating system feedback were not traded off for longer reaction times in those conditions.

The fact that significant differences between the experimental groups were only observable in Blocks 2 and 3 of the experiment can be attributed to the following two restrictions: First, in the beginning of the experiment, all participants were equally naïve and had to acquire the correct categorization strategy by testing different strategies in a trial-and-error approach. Naturally, some participants immediately started out with a compatible strategy by chance while others were initially on a wrong track. The resulting high variance in the participants’ performance in the first block of the experiment accounts for the non-significant results in this block even though Fig. 1 seems to point to a slightly earlier onset of group differences.

Second, in the course of the experiment all participants entering the analysis learned the correct categorization strategy to a comparable high degree within the first half of the experiment. The resulting high performance of all groups in the second half of the experiment (∼90–95%) left little room for significant inter-group differences in Blocks 4–6. So, at least in basic category learning tasks such as the one employed here, the type of auditory feedback does not appear to influence the level of performance attained eventually, but rather the speed with which the learning objective is met.

This result is in line with the interpretation that the increase in learning speed is motivationally mediated. In this case, differential feedback should not affect the maximum capacity of a learner (which would depend more strongly on cognitive factors such as general intelligence and task-specific skills), but rather the motivation and effort put into accomplishing a performance to full capacity. Future work should consider implementing harder tasks to confirm whether task difficulty has significant effects on the duration of the observed differences. It is conceivable that in tasks that are more difficult than the basic category learning task employed here, participants will take longer to reach their individual maximum level of performance, in which case the performance differences observed here should remain discernible over a longer period of time.

The speed of the participants’ learning progress differed depending on the feedback properties: First, and in accordance with our hypothesis, participants who received naturally spoken feedback with a motivating prosody learned faster than participants receiving naturally spoken feedback with a neutral prosody. This result empirically confirms that motivational prosody employed by a tutorial technical system can affect users’ learning performance positively, presumably by boosting their motivation just as praise and blame from a human teacher would (O’Leary & O’Leary, 1977; Brophy, 1981; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002; Pintrich, 2003). Notably, while human teachers naturally apply an inextricable combination of semantic, prosodic, mimic and gestural aspects of praise and blame, rendering a focused examination of those aspects in the classroom highly problematic, the study reported here effectively manipulated a single feature of evaluative feedback—in this case its prosody—in isolation, thereby providing a well-controlled empirical framework for the systematic examination of diverse aspects of spoken tutorial feedback.

Before discussing the theoretical implications of this finding in more detail, we would first like to consider a possible alternative explanation for the advantage of motivationally spoken over neutrally spoken feedback. In principle, one could argue that the observed effect can also be reduced to a greater variation in sensory stimulation for participants receiving prosodically motivational feedback (cf. Laird, 1985), since the average pitch difference between positive and negative feedback utterances as well as the pitch range within—albeit only the positive—feedback utterances are greater than they are in their prosodically neutral counterparts (see Table 1). However, considering that the second performance effect (i.e., the disadvantage of synthesized speech, see below) occurred without a similar concurrent difference in pitch variation, a unified interpretation along the lines of both observed effects being mediated by differences in user acceptance and motivation appears to be more straightforward.

The observation that praise and blame were able to increase the learners’ performance in this way may at first glance appear to contradict repeated findings showing that praise (and in some cases blame) can undermine learners’ motivation and in turn decrease their effort and performance (e.g., Lepper & Greene, 1978; Mueller & Dweck, 1998; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999). Adverse effects of praise (and reward in general) have often been explained via a shift in the perceived locus of control (cf. DeCharms, 1968) resulting in a failure to satisfy the basic psychological need for autonomy and a reduction of intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000b), while negative effects of both praise and blame have been attributed to a shift in the learner’s mindset, achievement attributions, and resulting goal-orientation (Ames, 1992; Mueller & Dweck, 1998; Kamins & Dweck, 1999; Dweck, 2006; see also Ames, 1984; Nicholls, 1984; Dweck, 1986).

The ostensible conflict between these findings and the current observation of effective praise and blame can be resolved if differences regarding the task and feedback properties are considered more closely. For one, Ryan and Deci (2000a) state explicitly that the harmful effect an external reward (like praise) may have on an individual’s motivation to perform a specific task is clearly restricted to intrinsic motivation and therefore exclusively applies to tasks that are intrinsically motivating, i.e., inherently interesting and enjoyable, to begin with. The task chosen for the current experiment, by contrast, was highly repetitive to account for a maximum in standardization and temporal control, and rather low in complexity, thus probably not qualifying as a highly interesting, intrinsically motivating task in the sense of Deci and Ryan (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a). As a consequence, it comes as no surprise that external rewards act as effective reinforcers in a task like the one employed here.

                           Note that some ways of making the task more difficult (as was suggested as a prospect for future research in Section 4) may also render it more interesting and intrinsically motivating. Following Ryan and Deci’s line of argumentation, the effects of prosodic praise as an extrinsic reinforcer should be alleviated or even reversed in this case, necessitating careful experimental control of intrinsic motivation in future experiments employing variations of task difficulty.

                        Dweck (2006, 2007) further argues that praise and blame are only detrimental to a learner’s achievement if they affect his or her beliefs about ability and intelligence in a specific way. Studies showed that praise as well as criticism aimed at a learner’s person or intelligence foster a fixed mindset (believing in ability/intelligence as a stable trait), while praise and criticism directed at a learner’s effort and strategies support a growth mindset (perceiving ability/intelligence as malleable; Mueller & Dweck, 1998; Kamins & Dweck, 1999). Crucially, only a growth mindset brings forth a goal-orientation that leads to increased effort, persistence and confidence, and as a consequence, better learning achievements (Dweck, 1986; Mangels, Butterfield, Lamb, Good, & Dweck, 2006; Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007). Similarly, evaluative feedback has been demonstrated to negatively affect learners’ goal orientation and motivation when it imposes social comparisons (e.g., with classmates) but not when it focuses on individual progress and mastery of the task (Ames, 1984, 1992; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Since praise and blame in the current study were presented on a trial-to-trial basis, did not have any semantic content directed at the learner’s intelligence or person, and were not administered in a social environment, it can be concluded that the motivational feedback employed here was highly attributable to the learner’s individual, trial-based learning process and therefore did not affect the learners’ mindset, goal orientation and motivation negatively.

In addition to the content and contingency of the employed praise and blame, the focus of the current study on feedback provided by a technical system (instead of a human teacher) may have further enhanced the motivating effect of the praising and blaming prosody we employed. Kluger and DeNisi (1996) report that computerized evaluative feedback leads to better performance since it directs the learner’s attention to task-learning processes while evaluative feedback given by a human supervisor directs the learner’s attention to self-related meta-task processes (e.g., considerations about the supervisor’s intentions and their implications for the learner’s goals), consequently reducing task-involvement and performance.

After having established the beneficial effect of (contingent and task-related) computer-generated prosodic praise and blame in the current experiment, it would be highly instructive—especially for developers of educational technology—to identify variables increasing the strength of the observed effect. One candidate for such a variable is the gender of the system’s speaking voice. In the experiment reported here, we were able to observe the described effects of motivational prosody in a comparison of recorded female utterances. The natural speech stimuli we employed stemmed from a corpus recorded from three female and three male speakers (Wolff & Brechmann, 2012), and recordings from one of the female speakers were chosen based on high recognition rates in the manipulation check (see Section 2.2). However, a previous study by Nass, Moon, and Green (1997) shows that praise given (to another computer) by a pre-recorded male voice is more convincing for an observer than praise given by a female voice, and research on human praise suggests that praise perceived as more sincere and credible is more effective (Brophy, 1981; Henderlong & Lepper, 2002). In a future experiment utilizing the same empirical approach, it would therefore be interesting to compare pre-recorded motivational feedback given by male and female voices, to test whether male-voiced (and thus presumably more convincing) feedback from a technical system will also translate into an increase in learning performance, and whether the effect will hold for computer-given blame as well as praise. Alternatively, when including participant gender as a factor, such an experiment may reveal an increased performance with feedback given by same-gender voices (i.e., a learning advantage with male voices in male participants, and with female voices in female participants), based on the preference for working with systems using same-gender voices observed by Lee et al. (2000, cf. Section 1.2).

Another aspect likely to have an influence on the effectivity of motivational prosody is the contingency schedule of praise and blame. In the current experiment, the motivational prosody accompanied the informative feedback on each trial (Group MOTI) or on no trial (Group NEUT). However, research on operant conditioning suggests that reinforcement plans are more effective when (positive) reinforcement is administered intermittently at a variable ratio rather than continuously on each trial (Ferster & Skinner, 1957; Gallistel & Gibbon, 2000)—but see diverging effects for punishment schedules (Azrin & Holz, 1966; Lerman, Iwata, Shore, & DeLeon, 1997). Also, as mentioned above, evaluative feedback has been shown to be most effective when it is tuned specifically to the student’s progress or improvement in performance (Ames, 1992; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996). Based on these findings, the prosodic modulation employed in the current experiment may prove even more effective if participants received neutral sounding informative feedback on most of the trials, and were presented with motivational prosody only in case of changes in their performance (for example, with a praising prosody when they avoid a certain type of previous error for the first time). Future systematic research will show whether this is the case, and whether the beneficial effect of progress adaptivity also holds for blaming feedback after decreases in learning performance.

The second effect, i.e., the observation that participants who received naturally spoken neutral feedback learned faster than participants receiving computer-synthesized neutral feedback is in line with the CASA paradigm and previous findings showing that users treat computers similar to human interaction partners and that they are more likely to enjoy interacting with a technical system the more similar it is to them (social identification; Lee et al., 2000; Nass & Lee, 2001). Since the pre-recorded feedback doubtlessly adds a human property (a human-sounding voice) to the system, users consequently prefer interacting with it to interacting with a system using synthesized speech. Results from a questionnaire completed in a different experiment which included all three types of computer feedback support this notion (Wolff and Brechmann, unpublished results): When participants (

                        . The performance effects observed in the current experiment indicate that this preference for naturally sounding feedback furthermore translates into an improved learning rate when receiving said feedback, most likely again mediated by an increase in task-related motivation.

While the results reported here thus identify a clear advantage for pre-recorded over computer-synthesized speech in auditory feedback, using pre-recorded natural speech is not always an option. Consider for example applications where a lot of different utterances need to be produced by the system: In such a case, pre-recording all utterances with the help of a human speaker may simply not be feasible. Once the praising/blaming prosody can be implemented by text-to-speech synthesis software (cf. Footnote 6), it therefore remains to be investigated whether the beneficial effect of motivational prosody observed here also holds in computer-synthesized feedback. If this turned out to be the case, the implementation of praising and blaming prosodies should be targeted even when the application at hand requires synthesized feedback. If on the other hand the beneficial effect of motivational prosody turns out to be restricted to naturally spoken feedback (cf. for example the positive effect of the usage of the personal pronoun “I” in pre-recorded speech, but not in synthesized speech; Huang et al., 2000), future developers of intelligent tutoring systems will need to weigh the motivational power of natural speech with praising and blaming prosody against the convenience of automatic speech generation.

Even with prosody issues aside, though, the empirical data provided here support the continuous pursuit of increasingly human-sounding speech synthesis, showing that natural-sounding speech is not only perceived as more pleasant but can actually affect users’ performance in cognitive tasks.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In a well-controlled computer-assisted learning experiment, the effects of the system feedback’s prosody and naturalness of speech on users’ learning performance were examined. The observed performance differences provide a first empirical confirmation that users of tutorial systems benefit from naturally spoken feedback with motivational prosodic modulations contingent on performance. Both the naturalness and the prosody effects can be explained via an increase in user motivation and emphasize the importance of taking factors like speech-generation method and prosodic modulations into account when implementing spoken feedback into educational technology.

The paradigm employed in the presented study provides a valuable empirical test for investigating the impact of spoken system feedback on users’ learning success. Future research will be able to use this controlled approach in the examination of further feedback modulations regarding their capacity to enhance learning. For example, it remains to be investigated whether the beneficial effect of motivating prosody also holds for equivalent variations in synthesized speech, whether the system voice’s gender interacts with the reported effects, or whether learning can be further enhanced when systematic motivational feedback is employed in a progress-adaptive fashion.
