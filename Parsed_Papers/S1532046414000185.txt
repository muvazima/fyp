                  Background
                  The popularity of social networks has triggered a number of research efforts on network analyses of research collaborations in the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) community. Those studies mainly focus on the general understanding of collaboration networks by measuring common network metrics. More fundamental questions about collaborations still remain unanswered such as recognizing “influential” nodes and identifying potential new collaborations that are most rewarding.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We analyzed biomedical research collaboration networks (RCNs) constructed from a dataset of research grants collected at a CTSA institution (i.e., University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS)) in a comprehensive and systematic manner. First, our analysis covers the full spectrum of a RCN study: from network modeling to network characteristics measurement, from key nodes recognition to potential links (collaborations) suggestion. Second, our analysis employs non-conventional model and techniques including a weighted network model for representing collaboration strength, rank aggregation for detecting important nodes, and Random Walk with Restart (RWR) for suggesting new research collaborations.
               
               
                  Results
                  By applying our models and techniques to RCNs at UAMS prior to and after the CTSA, we have gained valuable insights that not only reveal the temporal evolution of the network dynamics but also assess the effectiveness of the CTSA and its impact on a research institution. We find that collaboration networks at UAMS are not scale-free but small-world. Quantitative measures have been obtained to evident that the RCNs at UAMS are moving towards favoring multidisciplinary research. Moreover, our link prediction model creates the basis of collaboration recommendations with an impressive accuracy (AUC: 0.990, MAP@3: 1.48 and MAP@5: 1.522). Last but not least, an open-source visual analytical tool for RCNs is being developed and released through Github.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Through this study, we have developed a set of techniques and tools for analyzing research collaboration networks and conducted a comprehensive case study focusing on a CTSA institution. Our findings demonstrate the promising future of these techniques and tools in understanding the generative mechanisms of research collaborations and helping identify beneficial collaborations to members in the research community.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS, NIH) (formerly through the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR, NIH)), was launched in 2006 and has expanded to 60 academic institutions aiming to accelerate the process of translating biomedical research discoveries into clinical applications. One key function of the CTSA is to promote collaborative research efforts especially across different disciplines. For example, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) – a CTSA institution since 2009 – created the Translational Research Institute (TRI) to support translational and collaborative activities such as helping basic and clinician scientists to develop and manage their studies, fostering collaborative partnerships among stakeholder communities, and providing infrastructures (e.g., clinical data warehouse) to affiliated researchers.

It is crucial to quantitatively assess the effectiveness and quality of research collaborations in a CTSA institution. Social network analysis (SNA) methods have been deemed as an effective tool to assess intra-institution research collaborations in the CTSA community [1]. Previous studies on RCN [2–7], however, mainly focus on improving general understanding of collaboration networks by measuring common network metrics.

                      More fundamental questions about collaboration still remain unanswered such as recognizing “influential” nodes and identifying potential collaborations that are most rewarding. In this paper, we aim at finding answers to those questions by analyzing biomedical research collaboration networks at a CTSA institution (i.e., UAMS) in a comprehensive and systematic manner. To achieve this goal, we have developed new models and techniques for research collaboration network by leveraging readily available network analysis methods, results, and tools.

The research collaboration networks we studied are distinctive in their data source and model. Those collaboration networks were constructed from collaborative research grants instead of conventional publication co-authorships [3–5] as we believe collaborative grants provide additional and earlier evidence of possible collaborations. Principle investigator and co-investigator(s) of a collaborative grant often work together in a number of aspects throughout the supported research project, from grant proposal writing to research conduct and findings dissemination. We studied the RCN before (

                     ) UAMS being awarded CTSA aiming to understand the temporal evolution of the RCN. Through comparing various network characteristics across different time frames, we were able to examine the effectiveness of CTSA and evaluate its impact on collaborative research activities at UAMS.

In our network model, links between investigators are weighted to reflect the degree of collaboration. Previous studies on collaboration networks [3–8] model research collaborations as unweighted or binary networks where edges only indicate the existence of collaborations. However, collaborative research relationships may vary between investigators. It is intuitive that certain connections are “stronger” than others in an RCN, as we are often inclined to work with existing collaborators than finding new peers. Our network model reflects such a natural distinction through assigning the number of collaborative grants between two investigators as the edge weight.

To understand network dynamics and generative mechanisms of research collaborations in a CTSA institution, more specifically, to answer questions such as: “Is the RCN at UAMS a small-world? Is the CTSA effective in fostering interdisciplinary collaborations? How to identify potential new collaborations that are more likely to succeed?,” we have developed new network analysis methods and obtained interesting and valuable findings from our unique dataset. The methods and findings are aimed to assist administration and leaderships in making such organizational policies and strategic plans that are inclined to cause positive and substantial impacts on research collaborations and their outcomes. For example, key nodes in a collaboration network can be identified on the basis of centrality measures, and promising new collaborations can be recommended by applying the link prediction techniques. Leveraging our network analysis and link prediction techniques, necessary resources can be provisioned to spawn new collaborations and attract new investigators.

Our first finding of the collaboration networks at UAMS is that those networks are indeed small-world but not scale-free. Small-world and scale-free properties, manifesting in many real-world complex networks, have important implications in network robustness and efficiency. We quantitatively measured the “small-world-ness” [9] and revealed that the RCNs at UAMS indeed exhibit the small-world property. Moreover, the statistical measures [10] show that the degree distributions of both

                      and

                      do not follow the power law. Therefore, the RCNs at UAMS are not scale-free.

Our results also testified the effectiveness of the CTSA and its important role in promoting collaborative research within an institution. In addition to studying temporal evolution of network measures pertaining to RCNs, we also devised a quantitative“diversity” measure to model the trend of cross-disciplinary collaborations. The diversity measures how easy it is for an investigator from one discipline to reach another investigator in a different research field. The bigger the diversity value, the easier the cross-disciplinary collaboration will be. The diversity measure increases from 0.37 in

                     , indicating that the RCN at UAMS is moving towards favoring cross-disciplinary research after the CTSA.

We leveraged centrality measures [2] and rank aggregation techniques [11,12] to derive a single consented ranking of important (or “influential”) nodes in a collaboration network. Moreover, Our collaboration recommendation technique employs the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm [13] to construct a recommendation model for suggesting new research collaborations. The benchmarks of the our recommendation method on the RCNs of UAMS show promising results (AUC: 
                        
                           0.838

                      and MAP@3:

                     ).

Last but not least, we have developed an open source software package – the research collaboration network analysis (RCNA) tool kit (available at https://github.com/bianjiang/rcna under MIT license) – to help catalyze research in this area, especially to facilitate CTSA institutions to effectively evaluate the CTSA in promoting collaborative research activities. A unique and valuable component of the kit is a set of interactive visualization tools, which help us better explore and understand complex RCNs. A visualization of the UAMS’s RCNs can be accessed at http://bianjiang.github.com/rcna/.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe the source data retrieved from an in-house developed research grant management system. We then introduce our weighted network model of research collaborations, the concept of network characteristics and measures pertaining to this study. After that, we describe our methods of using network centrality measures and rank aggregation to identify centrality “leaders”.
                        2
                        The centrality “leaders” are not necessarily the actual leaderships in an organization. It merely expresses the importance of these nodes in the network. For example, removing highly connected nodes – centrality “leaders” – will certainly reduce the overall efficiency of the network, and cause the network to be more prone to random failures.

                      Furthermore, we present a link prediction based model for suggesting new research collaborations. Finally, we present the experiment results and our interpretations which indicate that the CTSA award has a positive impact on the collaborative research environment at UAMS.

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

In this paper, we study research collaboration networks constructed from collaborative research grants. The Office for Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP) at UAMS uses an in-house developed software system to track detailed information of research grants such as the requested budget amount, the budget start/end date, the funding agencies, as well as all the investigators and their roles on each grant. Besides the ORSP, the Translational Research Institute (TRI, UAMS) supports all CTSA activities at UAMS since July 2009. As the TRI tracks all CTSA related activities such as publications, pilot awards and so on, we use the TRI’s CTSA reports to obtain the information of whether an investigator is supported by the CTSA or using TRI services.


                        Table 1
                         shows the statistics of the research grant data we have obtained from the ORSP. We use these meta-data of grants to construct RCN for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2012. Each fiscal year at UAMS starts on July 1st till June 30th of the next year. Therefore, we collected data for grant applications whose budget start date is in the range between July 1st, 2006 and June 30th, 2013. The CTSA at UAMS started on July 14th, 2009. Therefore, in this analysis, the “number of CTSA Investigators” (i.e., investigators who are listed on the original CTSA grant) and “number of CTSA supported investigators” (i.e., investigators who received support from the CTSA) columns in Table 1 are not applicable to budget years from 2006 to 2009. Moreover, we only consider the researchers with the“Principle Investigator”, “Co-Investigator”, and “Sub-Investigator” roles on the grants, and exclude other personnel such as “Support Staff” and “Laboratory Staff”. In addition, we only take into account the grants that have been “Awarded” for two main reasons: (1) an awarded collaborative grant indicates successful executions of team science; and (2) a grant might have to go through a few review and revision cycles to get funded. By considering only the final awarded version, we can effectively eliminate some of the noises in the constructed networks. For a multi-year project, the grant is counted individually for each fiscal year.

Existing studies [3–8] on scientific collaboration networks, to our best knowledge, abstract the networks as undirected and unweighted (binary) graphs, which only consider the existence of collaboration relationship between two investigators. However, it is common that collaborative relationships among investigators vary. Intuitively, the association and partnership between two frequent collaborators should be much stronger than those who have collaborated only once in the past.

Therefore, we formalize a research collaboration network (RCN) as an undirected weighted graph,

                        ). The collaborative relationship between two investigators is evident by an edge or link between the two nodes, and the weight (

                        ). For visualization purpose, we only pick out the largest strongly connected components of the two RCNs. We note that both of the original RCNs contain isolated small clusters (i.e., groups that have strong collaborations internally but no connections to other parts of the RCN) and isolated individual nodes (i.e., investigators carried out the research independently).

This weighting schema, however, is inappropriate to the situations where a smaller weight is preferred. For example, when calculating the characteristic path length of a network (i.e., the average (shortest) distance between all pairs of vertices), algorithms for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph favor smaller edge weight as the weight of an edge is considered as the cost to travel between two nodes. Hence, under the original weighting schema, shortest path algorithms will select the paths where the two investigators have less collaborations. Such results contradict the common sense that it is “shorter” and easier to reach a frequent collaborator than a one-time collaborator. Therefore, we use the reciprocal of the original edge weight (

Small-world networks [14] and scale-free networks [15] are two important types of networks that are resilient to link failures. Watts and Strogatz coined the term “small-world” networks to categorize complex sparse real-life networks that have significantly high clustering coefficients than sparse random graphs yet have small degrees of separation between nodes. Small-world networks have been extensively studied in many domains [14,16–18]. Within the context of research collaboration networks, a small-world network indicates the overall robustness of the collaborative relationships. Random deletion of a node in the RCN, e.g., an investigator leaving the institution, is unlikely to cause dramatic decreases in the overall collaborative research efforts.

In this study, we adopt a quantitative measure of the network’s “small-world-ness” S 
                        [9]. A network G is a small-world network [14] if it has greater clustering of nodes than an equivalent Erdős–Rényi graph [2] that has a similar small path length as G. The “small-world-ness” S measures the trade-off between high local clustering and short path length. Let G be the network of interest.

                        A network is deemed as a “small-world” network if 
                           
                              S
                              >
                              1
                           
                         
                        [14].

There are two common ways of defining network clustering. In this study, we adopted the Watts and Strogatz definition [14] (see detail in the next section). For a graph with disconnected components, we compute the “small-world-ness” on the largest connected component (i.e., the subgraph with the most connected vertices). Moreover, we do not consider edge weights when calculating S, since there is not a meaningful way to generate comparable corresponding weighted E–R networks.

Another noteworthy model of complex networks is the scale-free network, where the network degree distribution follows a heavy-tailed power-law [15]. A power-law degree distribution suggests the relative commonness of nodes with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. Similar to the small-world property, the scale-free property strongly correlates with the network’s robustness. In this study, we tested the power-law degree distribution of our research collaboration networks according to the methods described in [10]. The goodness-of-fit between the data and the power-law can be computed and we can conclude that the power-law is a plausible hypothesis for the data if the resulting p-value is greater than 0.1. The p-value is used as a measure of the hypothesis that we are trying to verify, and high p-values are “good,” as noted in [10]. A good discussion of this interpretation of p-values can be found in [19].

Topological features of a network can be quantitatively measured as network characteristics such as the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. These structural network characteristics are often used to benchmark or infer the functional aspects of the network. For example, the mean path length (characteristic path length) L of a network is often employed to measure the efficiency of information flow on a network.

The following are the network characteristics of our interest in analyzing research collaboration networks. Note that our RCNs are weighted undirected graph; therefore, we shall respect the edge weights if possible.

If we define each group as a discipline in the RCNs, the diversity can be interpreted as how easy an investigator from one discipline can reach another investigator of a different research field. Therefore, the higher the diversity value, the more diversified the collaborations are in the RCNs, as the average distance is shorter for an investigator to travel from one group to another.

In social network analysis, the centrality measures of a vertex are often used to determine the relative importance of the node in the network. Within the context of research collaboration network, an investigator’s centrality measure can be interpreted as how influential or important the person is in the RCN of interest. There are various network centrality measures, where each measure defines the meaning of importance from a different perspective [2]. To identify influential nodes in a comprehensive manner, we investigate four widely-used network centrality measures: degree centrality, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality [21]. We briefly describe them below:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Degree centrality is simply the degree of a vertex. Since RCNs are weighted graphs, we shall use the weighted degree (strength) when calculating degree centrality.


                                 Betweenness centrality of a vertex is defined as the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through that vertex. Betweenness centrality on a weighted graph is defined similarly, given the shortest path length is the weighted shortest path length where the resistance factor based weighting schema is used, i.e.,

                                 . Betweenness centrality measures a node’s control of the communication between other nodes in the network [22]. Conceptually, in the RCNs, a node with a high betweenness centrality value can be interpreted as the investigator often acts as a bridge for other investigators in the research community.


                                 Closeness centrality of a vertex (i.e., local closeness centrality) is the inverse of the local characteristic path length of the vertex [22]. Closeness centrality on a weighted graph can be computed similarly, considering that the path lengths are calculated using the weighted definition (with resistance factor based weight schema). The closeness centrality value measures how fast information can flow from a node to all other nodes [23]; a node is more “central” if its closeness centrality value is higher.


                                 Eigenvector centrality measures the influence score of a vertex in the graph [24]. The Random Walk with Restart (RWR) process that will be described in the next subsection essentially calculates the personalized pagerank score of each vertex, which is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure. Calculating eigenvector centrality of a vertex in a weighted graph is straightforward and the original weighting schema 
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             w
                                          
                                          
                                             ij
                                          
                                       
                                       =
                                       
                                          
                                             w
                                          
                                          
                                             ij
                                          
                                          
                                             o
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                  is used.

Using these centrality measures, we can rank an investigator’s relative influence (or importance, contribution) in the research community. However, the centrality measures can rarely make a consensus regarding the ranking orders of the nodes in the same network. Therefore, we propose to use rank aggregation techniques [11,25,12] that can combine multiple rankings of nodes (investigators) to generate a more convenient and concise ranking. There are basically two classes of rank aggregation methods: (1) score-based rank aggregation, where each object in the input ranking is associated with a score and the goal is to combine different scoring systems to produce one set of scores; and (2) order-based rank aggregation, where only the orders of objects produced by individual ranking methods are considered. Since the scores given by different centrality measures are diverse and it is difficult to choose a meaningful normalization process, we decide to use Borda count [25] system, which is an order-based voting system. The Borda count system gives each candidate certain points based on her position on each ballot, and the candidate with the most points is the winner. If we consider each centrality measure as a voter that gives a preference ranking of all investigators in the RCNs, the final ranking can be easily computed using the Borda count of each investigator.

Social networks including research collaboration networks are highly dynamic. They can grow and evolve rather quickly through edge additions and deletions, which evidences new interactions among social entities in the networks. The link prediction problem in social network analysis has drawn a considerable amount of attentions as it helps to understand how a complex social network evolves over time [26]. Recent surveys on this topic can be found in [27,28]. In this study, we employ link prediction to discover missing links (overlooked collaborations) and the links that could appear in the future (new collaborations). Despite the conceptual differences, the same prediction model can fulfill both tasks.

We consider the link prediction problem in a weighted undirected graph 
                           
                              G
                              (
                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              )
                           
                         in which no duplicate edges or self loops are allowed. One general approach to link prediction is to treat it as a recommendation (and ranking) problem. In this setting, the task is to find an algorithm that can rank a set of nodes with respect to a querying node (
                           
                              
                                 
                                    q
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                        ), where the nodes that should have edges incident to 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    q
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         will have higher scores. Then the system would “recommend” a list of nodes to 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    q
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                         as potentials to have new links according to the ranking. Such a system has a direct application in recommending new collaborations in research collaboration networks.

PageRank [29] and its variants such as Personalized PageRank [30] and Random Walks with Restarts (RWRs) [13] are effective methods for link prediction based on finding structure similarities between nodes in a network. Conceptually, the PageRank score of a node is the long-term probability that a random web surfer is at that node at a particular time step. For sufficiently long time, the probability distribution of the random walks on the graph is unique, that is, minor changes to the graph make the random walk transition matrix aperiodic and irreducible [31].

The Markov model represents the graph with a square transition matrix P whose element 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                    →
                                    j
                                 
                              
                           
                         is the probability of moving from state (node) i to state (node) j in one time step. The PageRank algorithm assumes that it is equally likely to follow any of the outgoing links from a node. In other words, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                    →
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                              /
                              deg

                         where 
                           
                              deg
                              (
                              i
                              )
                           
                         is the out-degree of node 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    v

                        . However, the PageRank algorithm was originally defined on directed unweighted graphs. For an RCN, which is a weighted undirected graph, we make two necessary modifications to the construction of the transition matrix. First, we turn each undirected edge (

                                    ij
                                 
                              
                           
                        ) into two directed edges (

We constructed a number of RCNs with varying time periods of interest to study the structure of an RCN from the short-term, medium-term, and long-term perspectives. Each RCN is composed based on the grants

                           The CTSA itself is counted in when constructing an RCN after the CTSA.

                         that were awarded during a specific time period. We instantiated seven snapshot RCNs where each RCN covers one budget year from 2006 to 2012. We also created three aggregate RCNs: The first and second networks represent the RCN at UAMS prior to the CTSA from 2006 to 2009 (

                         lists the network metrics we measured for the RCNs at UAMS. We included a few extra measures that are important but not formally defined in the previous section. We introduce these measures briefly as follows. The density d of a network is defined as the ratio of the number of edges over the maximum possible number of edges. It measures how “busy” the network is. For an undirected graph,

                         is the number of vertices. An isolated component is a small subgraph that has no links to any nodes outside of that subgraph, and its count in a network is an important measure of connectedness (or segregation) of that network. The average number of new edges is measured as follows. We first compare each year’s RCN with the RCN in the previous year to identify all the nodes in both RCNs (i.e., investigators who had collaborative grants in both years). We then count the number of newly created edges for each of the identified nodes and take the average over all the nodes.

Nagarajan et al. presented a baseline study [6] on research collaboration networks (RCNs) prior to the UAMS’ CTSA (from 2006 to 2009). Their study suggests that the RCNs at UAMS have “unique characteristics different from those of the established real-world networks.” For example, the networks were disconnected with mutually exclusive groups and few weakly connected clusters of staff within the same department.

In our study, as shown in Table 2, significant changes can be observed in UAMS’s RCN since the introduction of CTSA. By comparing

Our measured network metrics indicate that the RCN at UAMS is moving towards a positive direction, that is, not only more collaborations but also more trans-disciplinary teamworks were generated between 2010 and 2012.

                           ) suggests that the research community at UAMS is evolving towards more interdisciplinary collaborations. As the goal of CTSA is to incubate new multidisciplinary collaborations and high impact research across the spectrum of translational science, the revealed shifting suggests that the impact of CTSA is positive.

As the clustering coefficient (C) measures the degree of herding effect in a network (or network component), a large coefficient value implies that nodes tend to create more tightly knit groups, as shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic path length (L) measures the average degree of separation between nodes in a network (or network component). Therefore, the shorter the length, the “easier” (or more likely) it becomes for an investigator to reach another researcher and form new collaborative research projects. The increase of C and decrease of L in the results are aligned with the finding in [6] that UAMS RCN is evolving towards a more robust small-world topology. Besides the observations of C and L, we also measured the “small-world-ness” of the three aggregate RCNs (

We measured the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length in both conventional model (unweighted edges) and our model (weighted edges), as presented in Table 2. Clearly, the clustering coefficient becomes larger and the characteristic path length is shorter in our weighted network model, which are consistent with the intuitions that the clustering effect shall be more evident with investigators who are already actively collaborating; and that more existing collaborations will create more opportunities (thus make it easier) for two separate researchers to establish new collaborations. In other words, the effects of collaboration in our weighted model can be recognized more easily and accurate.

The average number of new edges can be seen as a growth rate of newly secured collaborative grants. Its value is fairly stable across years with an interesting oscillation occurred in 2009–2011. There was a surge of new collaborative grants in 2010, that is, 10.803 new collaborations on average compared to the 2009 dataset. We believe it is a mixed effect of the CTSA award and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which resulted in a large number of new grants funded that year. However, a significant drop immediately followed (i.e.,

                            in 2010–2011), possibly due to the economic recession. Without network analysis of the RCNs, these novel observations would not be uncovered.

Following the methods described by Clauset et al. [10], we tested whether the degree distribution of the RCN at UAMS follows the power-law, and therefore is scale-free. We tested the power-law fitting for both unweighted and weighted (i.e., strength) degree distribution of the three aggregate RCNs. The p-values of all the power-law fitting experiments are not significant. Therefore, the RCN at UAMS is not scale-free.

                            shows the fitting of the degree distributions for the three aggregate RCNs. The top row of Fig. 2 shows the fitting of the tails of the degree distributions. The best fitted power-law parameters can only cover a portion of the distribution’s tail, where the dotted green line shows the power-law fit starting at

                           . The bottom row of Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the fitting between the power-law distribution and the exponential distribution, where the dashed green line is the power-law fit and the dashed red curve is the exponential fit. As shown in Fig. 2, it is not clear which hypothesis (power-law vs. exponential) can fit the degree distribution better.

We use the proposed method to identify centrality leaders (i.e., influential nodes) in the three aggregate RCNs. Fig. 3
                         visualizes the networks where the size of a node is set proportional to its ranking (i.e., the larger the node in size, the higher the investigator’s ranking) to depict the leader nodes. The networks shown in Fig. 3 are plotted using a force-directed graph drawing algorithm – the Kamada–Kawai algorithm [33], where the positions of nodes are determined based on the spring forces proportional to the nodes’ graph theoretic distances. As shown in Fig. 3, the identified centrality “leaders” are positioned in the center of the graphs, indicating that our method is consistent with the Kamada–Kawai algorithm.

The discovered centrality “leaders” are rather different from what we normally perceive in the context of organizational structure. For example, we found that some of the top ranked centrality “leaders” are neither the actual leaders of the university nor the leading investigators. A few top ranked investigators instead are biomedical informatics researchers or bio-statisticians, who appear on many different grants as “Co-Investigator.” In the context of collaboration network, researchers from these domains are the “leader” nodes as they do contribute more to the structure and efficiency of the network based on their network centrality scores. The ability to identify influential nodes in a RCN is important as these centrality “leaders” are often the bridges in the network as presented in Fig. 3. Although a small-world network such as the RCN is robust to random failures, losing highly influential nodes could cause significant declines in terms of network efficiency. Thus, it is important for an organization to identify and protect the bridging nodes. For example, based on identified centrality “leaders”, the administration is considering different resource allocation strategies to maximize the possible outcomes of collaborative researches.

We performed two different types of prediction tasks: (1) per-user recommendations, where we recommend new collaborators to a specific investigator in the RCN; and (2) per-network recommendations, where a set of new collaborations are “prompt” to the overall collaboration network. The general procedures of benchmarking the two recommendation tasks are the same except that the

                         measure is only applicable to the per-user recommendation task as we want to measure how the model performs for all candidates on average. In either case, we first randomly select a set of edges as our target datasets. More specifically, in the per-user recommendation task, we first pick a pool of random nodes and then choose all the edges that incident to these nodes; while in the per-network task, we randomly select the set of edges from the network directly. For each dataset, we perform a 10-fold cross-validation. In each iteration we first choose 
                           
                              1

                              10
                           
                         of the dataset as the test set, then remove all the edges in the network that exist in the test set, train the recommendation algorithm (i.e., calculate the RWR scores related to the test set) on the rest of the graph, and finally evaluate the method on the test set.

                         and Fig. 4

                        . The two testing approaches, per-user and per-network recommendations, provide us two complementary conceptual models for assessing collaboration recommendations and each has its own unique merit. The per-user model provides a more microscopic view of the recommendation problem, where it focuses on suggesting new collaborations to each investigator. On the contrary, the per-network model offers an eagle eye’s view over the entire collaboration network, and allows us to strategically allocate resources to catalyze important new edges in the network, therefore improving the overall network efficiency.

In this paper, we presented a set of network analysis methods that covers the full spectrum of a collaboration network study. We applied those methods to the research collaboration network at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, a research institution with a Clinical and Translational Service Award (CTSA), to investigate the effectiveness of CTSA. Our analyses and quantitative measures suggest that the CTSA program has a positive effect in promoting research collaboration across disciplines inside the institution. Our analysis methods and findings can help not only researchers to improve the understanding of structural patterns and underlying generative force of collaboration networks, but also administration and leaderships of research institutions to strategically allocate resources and shape policies to attain an effective, trans-disciplinary collaboration environment.

Our study has spawned a few possible directions for future research on collaboration networks. One immediate study we would like to explore is to assess the effects of research environment changes on a collaboration network. For example, to foresee the impact of funding reduction, we can purposely remove certain edges from the network through simulation and measure the overall effects of such changes both qualitatively and quantitatively. Another direction we are interested in pursuing is the development of a hybrid network model that can combine collaborative relationships from multiple data sources (e.g., both collaborative grants and co-publications). We expect to use different sources to correlate collaborative activities and identify the roles of participants in the collaboration. We believe that such a hybrid model will be able to capture both short-term and long-term network dynamics and provide a more accurate and comprehensive abstraction of research collaborations.
