                  Based on the concept of sparse connection, three start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are introduced which are called CSTF with sparse d
                     1, TSCF with sparse d
                     2 and CSCF with sparse d

                     4. The traditional start-up demonstration tests such as CSTF, TSCF and CSCF are special cases of these new tests. Furthermore, the new tests exhibit obvious improvement in test efficiency. In this paper, by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, several probabilistic indexes are given for these new start-up demonstration tests based on the assumption that the tests are i.i.d. case. The analyses are also extended to independent and non-identical and Markov dependent cases. In addition, procedures are provided in order to determine the optimal parameters needed in a demonstration test for selecting the products to meet the reliability requirement. Three comparison analyses are finally presented in order to illustrate the high efficiency of these new start-up demonstration tests and the effectiveness of this method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Start-up demonstration tests are very important to spacecraft propulsion systems, emergency lighting systems, and other various engineering systems, because if these systems fail to start up, it will result in serious consequences such as large economic losses and casualties. Hence, a start-up demonstration test is very important as a method for selecting equipment with high start-up reliability during adoption process. By this method, a customer should judge whether the start-up reliability of the equipment meets the reliability requirement before purchasing it by observing the outcomes of a set of tests on the equipment.

In a start-up demonstration test, the judging criterion of start-up reliability levels is related to the numbers of successes and failures in several trials which form the acceptance and rejection criteria. In general, the acceptance criterion can be divided into two criteria: consecutive successes and total successes. The rejection criterion can also be fallen into two categories: consecutive failures and total failures. Based on the combinations of different acceptance and rejection criteria, start-up demonstration tests can be divided into several categories such as CS, CSTF, TSCF, CSCF, TSTF, CSDF, TSCSTFCF, etc. The simplest and original start-up demonstration test is called CS (consecutive successes) which has been presented by Hahn and Gage (1983), and Viveros and Balakrishnan (1993). By adding a rejection criterion to CS models, Balakrishnan and Chan (2000) proposed a new start-up demonstration test called CSTF (consecutive successes total failures). In terms of the assumption that the start-ups are i.i.d. cases, they also derived the probability generating function of the length of the start-up demonstration test. After that, Smith and Griffith (2005, 2008) easily obtained the probabilities of acceptance and rejection, the probability mass function, distribution function, mean and variance of the test length by using the Markov chain approach which is also adapted to non i.i.d. cases. They also studied procedures to find the appropriate parameters of start-up demonstration tests and methods to estimate the start-up reliability of the equipment. Besides, they analyzed and compared the advantages of different tests in certain situations by introducing two new start-up demonstration tests: TSTF (total successes total failures) and CSCF (consecutive successes consecutive failures). By conditioning on the time of the first failure, Martin (2004) derived several results for demonstration tests of the start-up reliability of equipment. He also gave recursive formulas for computing the probability distribution of the number of start-ups and the probability of acceptance or rejection of the equipment in a specified number of trials. The auxiliary Markov chains were used by Martin (2008), who derived probabilistic results for five types of start-up demonstration tests, with start-ups that are Markovian of a general order. Antzoulakos, Koutras, and Rakitzis (2009) introduced the CSDF (consecutive successes distant failures) model and studied a new acceptance/rejection rule which is suitable to use in start-up demonstration tests. As extended models of CSTF, TSCSTF (total successes consecutive successes total failures) and R1-CS/TS/R2-CF/TF (R1 runs of consecutive successes, total successes, R2 runs of consecutive failures, total failures) were proposed by Gera (2010) and Zhao (2014) respectively. Gera (2011) also improved the CSTF test to TSCSTFCF test (total successes consecutive successes total failures consecutive failures) and then he generalized this model to include dependent tests according to the previous-sum dependent model (Gera, 2013). As a generalization of CSDF model, Gera (2013) introduced TSCSTFDF test which has significant reduction in the expected number of required tests together with improved second-order statistics (standard deviation). Zhao (2013) extended the application of start-up demonstration tests to the case of products with start-up delay, and he also presented the method for evaluating the indexes related to the test length by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach. Yalcin and Eryilmaz (2012) studied the TSTF test under previous-sum dependent model and derived the main characteristics for the TSTF test in such condition.

The naming of a start-up demonstration test model is very straightforward, for example, if k
                     C consecutive successes are observed prior to a total of f
                     T failures, then the equipment will be accepted; inversely, if f
                     T total failures are observed prior to k
                     C consecutive successes, it will be rejected (Smith & Griffith, 2005). We call this CSTF test. The start-up demonstration test will be terminated if the equipment is either accepted or rejected. The definitions of other start-up demonstration tests are similar to that of CSTF test only by replacing “consecutive” and “total” appropriately.

In this paper, the previous start-up demonstration tests are further generalized by considering the concept of sparse connection, and three new start-up demonstration tests are proposed which are called CSTF with sparse d
                     1, TSCF with sparse d
                     2 and CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4. In Section 2, the models of different start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are presented. In Section 3, by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, it is possible to obtain the probability mass function, the distribution function, the mean of the test length, the acceptance and rejection probabilities of these three new models. Besides, the analyses are generalized to non i.i.d. cases. Procedures to find the optimal parameter values of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are proposed in Section 4. Section 5 presents two comparison analyses between new and traditional models with numerical examples showing that the new models are always more efficient than the traditional models. The summary and some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

Based on the CSTF, TSCF, CSCF and the concept of sparse connection proposed by Zhao, Cui, and Kuo (2007), we present three start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection: CSTF with sparse d
                     1, TSCF with sparse d
                     2 and CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4. As to the start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection in this paper, we only consider the cases of that there are two states in each single trial, success and failure. The difference between these new start-up demonstration tests and ordinary start-up demonstration tests is the redefinition of “consecutive”. The concept of sparse connection is introduced as follows.

                        Definition 1
                        The start-up results are outputted in turn, forming a sequence of outcomes. If there are no successful start-ups between two adjacent successful start-ups and the number of failed start-ups between the two successful start-ups is di
                            or less, then the two successful start-ups are called two consecutive successes with sparsedi
                           . Likewise, if there are no failed start-ups between two adjacent failed start-ups and the number of successful start-ups between them is di
                            or less, these are two consecutive failures with sparse di
                           .

For example, an outcome sequence of twenty trials is {SFFFSSSFSFSFFSFFFFSS}, based on Definition 1, consecutive successes or failures with different di
                      are shown in Fig. 1
                     .

                        Definition 2
                        In a start-up demonstration test, the equipment under test will be accepted if k
                           C consecutive successes with sparse d
                           1 are observed prior to a total of f
                           T failures; it will be rejected, if f
                           T total failures are observed prior to k
                           C consecutive successes with sparse d
                           1. We call this model CSTF with sparse d
                           1.

Analogously, there is also a start-up demonstration test called TSCF with sparse d
                     2. The difference between TSCF with sparse d
                     2 and CSTF with sparse d
                     1 lies in sparse connection and the value of di
                     . The former is consecutive failures with sparse d
                     2 and the latter is consecutive successes with sparse d
                     1. The acceptance and rejection criteria of TSCF with sparse d
                     2 are similar to that of CSTF with sparse d
                     1 only with interchanging the “successes” with “failures” properly.

                        Definition 3
                        In a start-up demonstration test, the test will be terminated either k
                           C consecutive successes with sparse d
                           3 are observed prior to f
                           C consecutive failures with sparse d
                           4, leading to acceptance of the equipment; or f
                           C consecutive failures with sparse d
                           4 are observed prior to k
                           C consecutive successes with sparse d
                           3, leading to rejection of the equipment. We call this model CSCF with sparse d
                           3 and d
                           4.

In terms of definitions of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection, it is not hard for us to find that there are certain relationships between the new start-up demonstration models and the ordinary start-up demonstration models. When the parameters of these new start-up models satisfy some rules, the new models will degenerate to original models. The relationships between different models are shown in Fig. 2
                     .

In Fig. 2, the conditions (1)–(9) are as follows: (1) d
                     1 = 0, (2) d
                     3 = 0 and d
                     4 = 0, (3) d
                     3 = 0, fc
                      = 2 and d
                     4 = r − 2, (4) d
                     2 = 0 (5) d
                     3 = d
                     1 and d
                     4 = k
                     T, (6) d
                     3 = f
                     T and d
                     4 = d
                     2, (7) d
                     1 = f
                     T, (8) d
                     3 = f
                     T and d
                     4 = k
                     T, (9) d
                     2 = kT
                     .

In conclusion, the ordinary start-up demonstration tests are special cases of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection, that is to say, the new start-up demonstration tests are generalizations of the original models.

In this section, the statistical properties will be examined by using a finite Markov chain imbedding approach (Bersimis, Koutras, & Maravelakis, 2014; Cui, Xu, & Zhao, 2010; Fu, 1986; Fu & Koutras, 1994; Zhao & Cui, 2009). First, the tests are assumed to be i.i.d. with constant probability of successful start-up p and q = 1 − p, then probability analyses based on the assumption of i.i.d. are extended to non i.i.d. situations.

Much similar to CSTF with sparse d

                         of TSCF with sparse d
                        2 can be constructed. Additionally, the transition rules of TSCF with sparse d
                        2 are also analogous to that of CSTF with sparse d
                        1 only with replacing “consecutive” and “total” appropriately, so we omit them here.

As to CSCF with sparse d
                        3 and d
                        4, we define a Markov chain {Yl, l ≥ 0} on the state space as following:

Finite Markov chain imbedding approach is a very effective method to derive the probabilistic indexes of all kinds of start-up demonstration tests. Before we apply the Markov chain method, we should first partition the one-step transition probability matrix Λ into four blocks:

Based on the above partitions, by employing the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, we can use the sub-matrixes of 
                           Λ
                         to derive the acceptance and rejection probabilities and other indexes related to the test length. Eqs. (1)–(4) are applied to the original start-up demonstration tests as well as the start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection. For different tests, we just need to substitute the different sub-matrixes into the following equations.

                         is a column vector of ones with length a.


                        Eq. (1) gives the probabilities of rejection and acceptance; Eq. (2) is the distribution function of test length L; Eq. (3) is the probability mass function of test length and Eq. (4) is the expected value of test length L. All the above equations were proved by Viveros and Balakrishnan (1993).

In the previous sections, it is assumed that the successful and failed start-up probabilities are previously known. In this section, we will give the statistical inference of the probabilities of successful and failed start-ups by using the maximum likelihood methods. A total of n demonstration tests are performed on a bunch of identical units for the same parameter values. Once the acceptance or rejection criterion is satisfied, the set of tests will be terminated. For the ith test, let si, fi
                         denote the number of successes and failures respectively. In this way, a set of (si, fi
                        ) vectors is obtained. The joint likelihood function L(p, q) is then derived. It is easy to see that

The maximum likelihood estimators of p, q are then derived via the log-likelihood function.

The analyses on start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection in the above sections are based on the assumption that the tests are i.i.d. In this section, the studies will be extended to non i.i.d. cases.

When the start-up tests are independent and non-identically distributed, that is to say, the successful probability of the hth trial is ph
                        , and the failed probability is qh
                         = 1 − ph
                        . The analyses based on this assumption are similar as the analyses for i.i.d. tests only with replacing the p with ph
                         and q with qh
                         in both transition rules and the one-step transition probability matrix. For the illustration of CSTF with sparse d
                        1 in Section 3.1, the one-step transition probability matrix should be written as follows for the case of independent and non-identically distributed units. Besides, for the case of independent and non-identically distributed units, the probability of the rejection and acceptance, the distribution function of test length L, probability mass function of test length L and the expected value of test length L are shown as Eqs. (1′)–(4′).

                        T × 1 vectors, in which the elements corresponding to the absorbing states Ea
                         and Er
                         are 1s respectively and other elements are all 0s; U(Ea
                        ) + U(Er

                        max is the upper bound of the start-up demonstration test lengths and this upper bound can be obtained. For example, for a CSTF with sparse d
                        1 (d
                        1 = 1, k
                        C = 3, f
                        T = 5) and the upper bound of its test length is 11; that is to say, after 11 trials at most, the test must be terminated.

When the start-up demonstration tests are higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent, the analyses are different from that of i.i.d. cases. According to the analyses for the higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent start-ups proposed by Zhao (2014), we can study the higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection as below.

Using CSTF with sparse d
                        1 as an example, m-order Markov dependent start-up tests mean that the outcome of the hth trial has something to do with the last m test results. In other words, the results of the (h − m)th, (h − m + 1)th, (h − m + 2)th, …, (h − 1)th tests have an effect on the hth trial. The Markov chain {Yh
                        } is initialized at time m. A new element is introduced to the state space of CSTF with sparse d
                        1, that is to say, (s, t, r) is changed to (sh, th, rh
                        , y
                        
                           h
                        ) to illustrate the state of the first h tests, where y
                        
                           h
                         = (y
                        
                           h − m + 1, y
                        
                           h − m + 2, …, yh
                        ) is a m-dimension vector which represents the combinations of all possible results of last m tests.

To illustrate the initial probability under this situation, we introduce another m-dimension vector x
                        
                           m
                         = (x
                        1, x
                        2, …, xm
                        ) to represent the first m test results; and xi
                         can take on only two values: 0 (successful start-up) and 1 (failed start-up), so there are 2
                           m
                         possible results for X
                        
                           m
                         = (X
                        1, X
                        2, …, Xm
                        ). Besides, when h = 1, 2, …, m, the current state (sh, th, rh
                        ) is determined by (x
                        1, x
                        2, …, xm
                        ). If h = 1, we set s
                        1 = 1 − x
                        1, t

A detailed flow is shown in Fig. 5
                         for determining the transition rules of CSTF with sparse d
                        1 on the m-order Markov dependent assumption.

Obviously, the test length L of each trial is determined by the values of kC, kT, fC, fT, di
                      and the probability of success or failure. It is possible for us to choose the optimal parameters in order to shorten the test length. The optimal parameters should satisfy the following objective function and constraint conditions:

                     , we should accept the equipment with a lower probability. Here we call α the producer's risk and β the customer's risk. Otherwise, P(Accepted) is an increasing function in p, and P(Rejected) is a decreasing function in p, so (8) and (9) can be rewritten as (8’) and (9’) (Smith & Griffith, 2008):

Once the values of α and β are specified, there may be many combinations of parameters that satisfy (8′) and (9′). For each combination (k
                     C, f
                     T, d
                     1), (k
                     T, f
                     C, d
                     2) or (k
                     C, f
                     C, d
                     3, d
                     4), we can get an expected value of test length L, and we could choose the optimal set of parameters as the one that results in the shortest expected test length L. Processes of determining parameters for CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 are shown in Fig. 6.

Procedures to select optimal parameters of CSTF with sparse d
                     1 and TSCF with sparse d
                     2 can be derived from procedures of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 when the values of d
                     3 and d
                     4 satisfy the rules (5) and (6) provided in Section 2, so we omit them here.

In this section, according to the above detailed processes, we wrote programs which implement the equations in Section 4 in order to illustrate that the CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 and CSTF with sparse d
                     1 are more effective and efficient than CSCF and CSTF by comparing the expected test lengths and the values of standard deviation. The optimal parameters of each model can be achieved easily by applying these programs.

Suppose an experimenter carries out a demonstration test to select the equipment which satisfies the acceptance criteria. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the quantities related to the determination of a good CSCF and a good CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 start-up demonstration test for various choices of pa
                      and pr
                      given α = 0.10, β = 0.10
, α = 0.05, β = 0.15
 and α = 0.15, β = 0.15 respectively.

Compared to CSCF model, the expected test lengths of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 are always smaller than that of CSCF. Also, a large reduction in the value of the standard deviation is always achieved, sometimes nearly a 50 percent reduction compared to the value using the CSCF procedure.

For CSTF and CSTF with sparse d
                     1, the quantities related to the determination of a good CSTF and a good CSTF with sparse d
                     1 start-up demonstration test are indicated in Table 4
                     .

No matter what models the tests based on, the expected test length decreases with the increase of pa
                      and decrease of pr
                     . From Table 4, the expected test lengths and the standard deviations of CSTF with sparse d
                     1 are often smaller than that of CSTF test which shows that CSTF with sparse d
                     1 is more efficient and effective than CSTF test.

To illustrate the efficiency of these new models more clearly, we can compute

For example, when p = pa
                      = 0.99, pr
                      = 0.90, α = 0.10, β = 0.10, and the optimal parameters values of CSCF, CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 can be obtained easily from Table 1. Based on this, we can get the probabilities as below:

                                          d

                                       −

                                 ≤
                                 
                                    L
                                    CSCF
                                 
                                 )
                                 =
                                 0.9976
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  

Obviously, the probability that the test length of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 is less than that of CSCF and the probability is 0.9976 which is very high. That is to say, most of the time, the test length of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 is lower than that of CSCF. In conclusion, CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 outweighs the CSCF model from this comparison.

In addition, we also compare the test length distributions for CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4, CSCF and TSTF model when p = pa
                      = 0.95, pr
                      = 0.75, α = 0.05, β = 0.15 and for CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4, d
                     3 = 0, d
                     4 = 3, kC
                      = 11, f
                     C = 3; for CSCF test, k
                     C = 12, f
                     C = 2; for TSTF test, k
                     T = 20, f
                     T = 4.

From Fig. 7

                     , which means that the probability that CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 will be terminated with 19 or less test length is greater than that of CSCF and TSTF. That is to say, the probability that CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 will be terminated with a lower test length is always greater than that of other tests. It is manifest to see that start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are good choices when the experimenters pursue a lower test length.

Furthermore, we also compare the test lengths of new start-up demonstration tests with that of traditional ones. Table 5
                      shows 18 cases and Table 6
                      presents 4 cases which are different combinations of pa, pr, α and β. Based on Table 5, Fig. 8
                      can be achieved to compare the test lengths of CSCF, TSTF and CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4. Similarly, we can obtain Fig. 9 to give a comparison of CSTF, TSTF and CSTF with sparse d
                     1 based on Table 6.

From Fig. 8, it is clear that the test lengths of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 are always less than that of CSCF and TSTF model in these 18 cases. In conclusion, CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 is more efficient and effective than CSCF and TSTF model.

From Fig. 9, we can still see that the test lengths of CSTF with sparse d
                     1 are often smaller than that of CSTF and TSTF models although the advantage of CSTF with sparse d
                     1 is not as obvious as that of CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4 when they compare with corresponding traditional models.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this paper, based on the previous models, we consider the concept of sparse connection and present three new start-up demonstration tests which are generalizations of traditional tests. The original start-up demonstration tests are special cases of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection. The new models will degenerate to original models when di
                      satisfy some rules. Then, we illustrate the use of finite Markov chain imbedding approach to evaluate the indexes related to the expected test length based on i.i.d. case and non i.i.d. situations. The detailed procedures are given to select the optimal parameter values for CSCF with sparse d
                     3 and d
                     4. An obvious advantage of these new start-up demonstration tests is the improvement in test efficiency. Numerical examples of comparing different start-up demonstration tests show that the efficiency in the reduction of test length and standard deviation of these new start-up demonstration tests are distinct and the method of analyses used in this paper is effective. All the analyses not only can be applied to these three new start-up demonstration test we have proposed, but also other start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection such as TSCSCF with sparse d
                     5 and d
                     6, CSTFCF with sparse d
                     7 and d
                     8, R1-CS/TS/R2-CF/TF with sparse d
                     9 and d
                     10, TSCSTFCF with sparse d
                     11 and d
                     12, TSCSTF with sparse d
                     13 and TSTFCF with sparse d
                     14.
