                  In this work we consider dynamic pricing for the case of continuous replenishment. An essential ingredient in such a formulation is the use of time normalized revenue or profit function, in other words revenue or profit per unit time. This provides the incentive to sell many items in the shortest time (and of course at a high price). Moreover, for most firms what matters most is how much revenue or profit is achieved in a certain time frame, for example per year. This changes the problem qualitatively and methodologically. We develop a new dynamic pricing model for this formulation. We derive an analytical solution to the pricing problem in the form of a simple-to-solve ordinary differential equation (ODE) equation. The trajectory of this ODE gives the optimal pricing curve. Unlike many of the models existing in the literature that rely on computationally demanding dynamic programming type solutions, our model is relatively simple to solve. Also, we apply the derived equation to two commonly used price-demand functions (the exponential and the power functions), and derive closed-form pricing curves for these functions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dynamic pricing is the theory of adjusting the price of a merchandise dynamically with time in an attempt to maximize revenue (Elmaghraby & Keskinocak, 2003; Talluri & Ryzin, 2005 and den Boer, 2014). It has gained significant worldwide adoption in many industries in the last two decades. It is appealing that such an advanced science has found true application in many markets. The gains in the companies’ revenues may also ultimately pass through to the customer, because pricing would more genuinely reflect supply and demand, leading to better economic efficiency (Phillips, 2005). What helped the spread of dynamic pricing is the rapid growth of internet retail. Its online nature makes the periodic updating of the price quite manageable. Moreover, dynamic pricing is expected to catch up soon in a big way for brick and mortar stores, due to the advent of electronic price labeling devices, whose cost became economic enough for possible wide-scale deployment (Stross, 2013).

Most research on dynamic pricing focuses on optimizing revenue, and sometimes profit. However, corporations consider not just these aspects. They focus on achieving the most amount of revenue or profit in the shortest time, for example achieving high annualized revenue or profit. In that sense turn-around is an important factor. In this work we propose a new dynamic pricing model that optimizes the revenue or profit per time period. This is more relevant to corporations, which typically target a specific amount of revenue by the end of their fiscal year or quarter (see Bouwens & Kroos, 2011). All numbers are either annualized, or else interpreted in an annualized way. So, the amount of revenue per year or per unit time is the relevant quantity. Moreover, having a time-normalized revenue as the objective function will likely encourage more sales in a fixed interval, thus achieving higher overall revenue in the interval.

The typical set up in the literature is to consider a perishable product with a particular stock that has to be sold by a certain time horizon (see for example Gallego & van Ryzin, 1994). In this work we allow continuous restocking. Thus, when an item is sold, it can be replenished immediately or with a certain lead time. This is the essential difference between our work and many of the other works that consider a fixed inventory. In our set-up of continuous replenishment it is the use of time normalized revenue (instead of pure revenue) which creates the urgency to sell many items. This is in contrast with the typical fixed inventory formulations, whereby the existence of the fixed inventory and a fixed time horizon provides the urgency to sell many items before times is up. The continuous replenishment set-up is also suitable for just-in-time inventory systems, and service-based businesses. But, as we will show, our model is also applicable to nonperishable goods with existing inventory, and in some situations to perishable items. In previous work in the literature on pricing of nonperishable items the time element is not considered a pressing consideration, and therefore the item could even be sold at a fixed price. However, when turn-around is considered as part of the objective, then a time varying price could control both the revenue and the timing of the sale in a way to achieve optimal revenue per unit time. This basically changes the problem qualitatively.

In this work we consider a continuous time formulation with stochastic demand. We assume that demand follows a Poisson process with a varying arrival rate. This is a sensible assumption, because of the random times of arrivals of the selling events. The instantaneous arrival rate varies according to the price-demand function, due to the continuous adjustment of the price. Moreover, we allow the case where the demand function varies explicitly with time (in addition to price). This is a useful case to consider, because for many products, even if nonperishable, interest wanes with time due for instance to the introduction of newer models. Most other work that considers stochastic demand led to computationally demanding solutions often involving complicated recursive relations for the value function (see Bitran & Caldentey, 2003). In contrast, our work leads to a solution for the general case in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which can be solved in a straightforward way using standard solvers such as Euler’s method or Runge Kutta’s method. Moreover, for two of the typical demand price functions, the exponential function and the power function, we derive closed form solutions for the optimal price curve (for example for the exponential demand function, the optimal price is of the form

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss related work, and review the literature. Section 3 provides a statement of the problem and defines all relevant quantities. Section 4 provides our proposed solution, including the derived ODE. In Section 5 we apply the proposed model to two candidate price elasticity functions, and derive closed form solutions. Moreover, in this section we consider examples of time demand functions with explicit time variation. We also compare the proposed methods with existing benchmarks. Last section is the conclusion of the work.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

The early work on dynamic pricing for perishable products considers deterministic demand models. This means that the seller has perfect knowledge about the demand process (Talluri & Ryzin, 2005). Since demand is inherently random, recent research considers stochastic models. Some researchers consider simple additive or multiplicative random terms on a multi-period demand function. More recently, researchers assume that demand follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process, where the arrival rate (or intensity function) is a function of the price. Embedded in this relation is the so-called reservation price, which is the maximum price the customer is willing to pay for the product. The pioneer for such an approach is Kincaid and Darling (1963), and it is further developed by Gallego and van Ryzin (1994). The solution for this formulation gives rise to an ordinary differential equation expressing the time evolution of the value function for different inventory levels. It is numerically very hard to solve this equation, except for some special cases, such as exponential reservation price (see Bitran & Caldentey, 2003).

Extensions of this modeling approach are proposed by Zhao and Zheng (2000) and by Anjos (2005) for the case where the arrival process of customers is a time-dependent Poisson process. This is typically encountered in airline reservations, where price-sensitive customers arrive earlier than high-paying customers, and in fashion retail where the opposite is true. Lazear (1986) considers a situation where the selling horizon consists of two periods with distinct prices, and obtains the break point value and the two prices that optimize revenue. Feng and Gallego (1995) consider a two-price model, where the seller optimally switches from one price to the other. Bitran and Mondschein (1997) consider the case where the price curve is piecewise constant, while Netessine (2006) tackles the situation where it is required to minimize the frequency of price changes. Recognizing that the demand characteristics are typically not accurately known beforehand, recent work focuses on learning the demand parameters online, hand in hand while applying dynamic pricing using the hitherto learned information (Araman & Caldentey, 2006; den Boer & Zwart, 2014; Petruzzi & Dada, 2002, and Farias & Roy, 2010). A more general direction is to consider dynamic pricing of multi-products. The difficulty of this approach is having to deal with a “vector” of prices, and at the same time having to take into account the cross-product influences (see Gallego & van Ryzin, 1997 and Rusmevichientong, Roy, & Glynn, 2006).

Some work considers dynamic pricing coupled with replenishment decisions. This basically integrates the fields of dynamic pricing and supply chain analysis. Chen and Simchi-Levi (2004a,b), and Federgruen and Heching (1999) propose a solution for this problem for the deterministic case, where continuous replenishment (every period) takes place. Li and Zheng (2006) consider the stochastic case. Specifically, they propose a joint dynamic pricing/replenishment model, where in addition to stochastic demand the production yield is stochastic too. Smith and Achabal (1998) consider the situation where demand is both seasonal and is dependent on the initial inventory. A comprehensive review of models that consider the interplay between dynamic pricing and replenishment can be found in (Chan, Shen, Simchi-Levi, & Swann, 2004).

There is little research that considers other objective functions than revenue or profit. Arcelus and Srinivasan (1987) consider three different kinds of target functions: profits, return on investment, and residual income (i.e. income net of interest payments). They use a derivative based solution method using a deterministic demand assumption. In a follow-up article Arcelus and Srinivasan (1988) analyze the sensitivity and the analytical properties of the solutions pertaining to these novel objective functions. Optimality conditions for the proposed solutions are proven, and an extensive graphical analysis for the effects of parameter changes is presented. Besbes and Maglaras (2012) consider dynamic pricing in the presence of intermediate sales targets at certain milestones. These are prevalent for real estate sales, as they are closely tied to the ability to obtain financing. They propose a model that is of a feedback form, where the price is continually updated so that it tracks the most stringent among all upcoming milestones. Bayoumi, Saleh, Atiya, and Aziz (2013) and Zakhary, Atiya, El-Shishiny, and El Gayar (2011) recognize the need for multi-objective formulations, so they suggest a flexible simulation-based approach. Most of the models in the literature assume that the seller is risk neutral. However, many product managers in charge possess some degree of risk aversion. To address this issue, Feng and Xiao (1999) consider risk as an additional measure that has to be taken into account. Their model is based on maximizing the revenue, while minimizing the variability in the revenue stream. Other studies that consider risk include the work of Choi, Chow, and Xiao (2012) and Sun and Abbas (2013). From the aforementioned review one can observe that most work considers optimizing revenue. There is little work on optimizing other performance measures. As far as we know there is no work on optimizing the amount of revenue of profit per unit time, or annualized revenue or profit, even though this is a major performance yardstick for firms. We therefore hope this contribution will stimulate other work in this needed research direction.

Consider a firm that sells a product where the demand is stochastic, and is influenced by the asked price. Assume that the demand follows a Poisson process with time varying rate, in other words a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). (The NHPP is a Poisson process where the instantaneous arrival rate, or the hazard rate λ is time varying, rather than constant.) The arrival rate is given by λ(t, r), where r is the price, and t is the time. Therefore, in addition to price dependency, time could influence demand, possibly due to initial ramp-up of demand, and subsequent gradual loss of purchasing interest (see Kalish, 1983 for an analysis of demand-time dependency). Consider a specific time horizon [0, T], representing the targeted period of sale. Assume that for a fixed t, λ(t, r) is continuous and invertible in r. This is consistent with the typical monotonically decreasing shape observed in practice. Beyond T the product would be sold at a salvage price S, whose mean is s. Assume that whenever an item is sold, it will be replenished with a certain lead time, with mean l ≥ 0. It is required to find the optimal time varying price r(t) that optimizes the revenue or profit per sale time. Whether revenue or profit, the objective function to be maximized “J” can be expressed in the following general form:

Also the constant c denotes the mean cost of procuring the item, and it is used in case of focusing on profit. If we consider revenue instead of profit, then we set

                        . Furthermore, τ represents the first arrival of a selling event, the term E(S) is the expected salvage proceeds if the item is not sold in the given interval [0, T]. The denominator corresponds to the expected time of selling the item E(τ) plus the mean time l to replenish the stock and add another item. Note that the salvage price, the replenishment time, and the cost of the item could be random variables, and all what we need is their mean values s, l, and c respectively. For an NHPP the probability density of the first arrival is given as:

The first term represents the expectation of the time of selling the product (up to time T). The term in brackets [] represents the probability that it is not sold during the considered interval [0, T]. In this case, it is considered sold at the salvage price at time T, if it fails to sell in the interval [0, T]. Combining the previous formulas, we obtain the final normalized revenue as

The first domain of applicability is for just-in-time inventory systems, for example firms that sell customized products or luxury items, sell by drop-shipping, or service-based businesses. Another example is intangible items, for example online sales of a software product or an online book, where inventory does not play any particular role. The proposed model applies also to durable goods, and in some cases to perishable goods too. For example, an auto sale showroom sells cars where there is a time element (however long it is, as it is measured in months), and is therefore a perishable product where our model applies. For nonperishable goods, we still have to impose a time horizon T for business reasons. Firms usually set such horizon for the purpose of modernizing the offered merchandise, and for the very same reason we develop this model: to increase the turn-over. For example, a jewelry item has to be preferably sold in 6 months for the purpose of ordering the next one, or for ordering a newer model. For these products there is a graceful time-decay in demand till the release of newer products, a condition that is readily considered in the proposed model. The proposed approach does not apply to situations where spurts of perishable products are released. Examples are fashion products, where a certain inventory is released once at the beginning of the season, and it has to be sold by the end of the season. Other examples are airline reservations and hotel reservations. However, the developed model is not restricted to big ticket items. It applies to perishable products where continuous replenishment takes place, such as food items, and some household consumables. Even though we do not consider optimizing replenishment decisions like in some of the other works, the advantage of our formulation is its simplicity in that it obtains analytical solutions in the form of a pricing curve. This will make the model much more transparent to the user than a sophisticated algorithm that depends on inventory level, recent price, and recent demand.

Now the question, how could we use the model in situations where several items of the product exist in an inventory. The answer is that we simply consider one item only, and ignore the rest for the time being. When this item gets sold, then the next one in the inventory moves to the forefront, and the item starts being priced anew. Of course this approach will not be strictly optimal in this situation, but will only be an approximation of the optimal. One observation in such a case is that the price of the product exhibits a discontinuity at the periods when the item gets sold. This behavior is typically also encountered in many of the proposed dynamic pricing models (see for example Fig. 4 in Bitran and Caldentey (2003), and Fig. 5.3 p. 204 in Talluri and Ryzin (2005); these figures show the price as a function of time, and one can see that after each sale there is a jump in price). Concerning the following issue; when the product is replenished using a batch of k items, then the mean lead time l used should be approximated as the actual one divided by k, because l signifies the average lead time per replenished item. We would also like to mention that existing approaches that optimize the selling of an inventory of k items in a specific interval face significant challenges in determining the best k. It is a critical parameter, as a wrong choice could lead to oversupply or undersupply. Our model relieves us from the burden of specifying k, and instead uses the time-normalization as a tool to hasten the sales and dispose of the inventory.

The goal is to find the optimal continuous pricing function r(t) in [0, T], i.e. the function r(t) that maximizes the proposed objective function (Eq. (9)). Define the variable R(t) as the cumulative function of λ(t, r(t)), i.e.

                           is selected so that J
                           * 
                           is maximum.
                        


                     Appendix A
 presents the proof for the developed formula. This is the final ODE that determines the pricing curve. Once we solve for the arrival rate λ as a function of time, we can easily invert it to obtain the optimal price function r(t), since by assumption λ(r, t) is invertible in r.

In the previous ODE the term J
                     * denotes the optimal value of our objective function, given by Eq. (11), while R
                     * is a free parameter that defines the boundary condition. Thus, we have a family of ODE’s, parametrized by J
                     * and R
                     *. The parameter J
                     * has to be selected such that it is consistent with its definition in Eq. (14), while the parameter R
                     * has to be selected (through a one-dimensional search) such that the ODE yields maximum J
                     * (as given by Eq. (14)). The occurrence of the parameter J
                     *, the optimum that we set out to obtain, in the ODE leads to a circular argument. To resolve this issue we perform a simple one-dimensional search. This means that we need to consider a grid of possible values of J, and solve the ODE when each of these possible values of J are substituted in the ODE as Eq. (13). Subsequently, we examine the obtained solution λ(t), and evaluate the resulting objective function J from Eq. (14). We pick the solution λ(t) that gives a value of such objective function J that matches the one we have plugged in into the ODE.

The previous ODE gives the optimal solution, given some fixed value of R
                     * (in the boundary condition equation). To obtain the overall optimum, we should have an outer layer where we optimize the resulting objective function J with respect to R
                     *. This is accomplished by considering a grid of possible values of R
                     *, repeating the solution of the ODE as detailed last paragraph, and picking the R
                     * run that produces highest objective function. In this search infeasible candidates, that have part of the price curve negative, are eliminated. These iterations will not lead to a slow computation, because the solution of the ODE is obtained in a straightforward way by just running it forward, for example using the simple Euler’s method. One can also optimize w. r. t. the initial condition r(0) instead of R
                     *, because for every initial condition, there is a corresponding R
                     * (we could also use the final condition instead). In practice we have found no major numerical issues concerning how small a grid size is needed for converging onto the true solution. For example, in a typical run a move from a grid size for J
                     * of 0.01 to 0.001 impacts the final obtained value of J
                     * by only 
                        −
                     0.04 percent, indicating a stabilizing solution. To be on the safe-side, we suggest a grid size of 0.0001. For R
                     * we similarly observe numerically stable behavior. Concerning the minimum and maximum that bracket the search range, the minimum is zero for both J
                     * and R
                     *, while the maximum could be chosen as a few multiples of ballpark estimates of the quantities (for example a ballpark estimate of J
                     * could be the typical expected sale price, divided by expected selling time, all obtained as rough estimates or from previous experience, and a similar argument applies to R
                     *).

For some specific demand functions, the above ODE has closed-form solutions. There are three commonly used price-demand functions: linear, exponential, and power functions. For the linear demand function λ can possibly be negative, and this leads to a non-valid solution, so we will not consider it here. For the other two cases closed form solutions are possible, when there is no explicit time-dependency, i.e. 
                        
                           λ
                           (
                           t
                           ,
                           r
                           )
                           =
                           λ
                           (
                           r
                           )
                           ,
                        
                      and these are discussed below. On the other hand, if we have a time-varying demand function, then some simplifications of the ODE can be obtained for the case of exponential and power demand functions. These are also explained below.

The exponential demand function has the form:

                           
                              (16)
                              
                                 
                                    λ
                                    
                                       (
                                       t
                                       ,
                                       r
                                       )
                                    
                                    =
                                    y
                                    
                                       e

                                          α
                                          r
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where y ≥ 0 is a constant that determines the general level of the price, and α ≥ 0 represents the price elasticity slope parameter. The price r here is still a function of t, but such dependence is skipped in the formulas for brevity. Obtaining all related variables, and substituting into the ODE (Eq. (12)), we get a simpler first-order ODE:

                        Appendix B
 gives the derivation of this formula. Similar to the case of the general demand function case in Lemma 1, the parameters J
                        * and R
                        * are obtained using one-dimensional searches. The outer search is for R
                        * that seeks to find the value that yields maximum J
                        *, as given by Eq. (9), via evaluating Eq. (18). The inner search seeks to find the value of J
                        * that makes Eq. (18) consistent with the objective function Eq. (9).

Demand functions that have an explicit dependency on time are the more realistic functions in true selling environment. Many products experience a graceful decay in demand, rather than a constant demand followed by an abrupt perishing time instant. For example a car will have a gradually decreasing demand function over the course of the yearlong window during which it is offered for sale. The gradual change in demand with time leads to changing conditions, and hence price should vary to reflect these varying conditions. This makes a varying price (for example in the form of a price curve) an effective tool for increasing revenue. We perform here experiments using time-dependent demand functions, in order to understand its effect on the optimal price curve. We wish to note that the demand function is not reset upon selling an item. It continues its previous path, irrespective of the selling event. In other words, whenever we simulate the ODE, and we have a sale (at time t
                        1), we do not reset the time origin of the demand function as if we start anew. We continue from where we stopped, i.e. λ(t, r) will continue its path starting from t
                        1, not from 
                           
                              t

                        .

                               (i.e. demand decreases to a quarter of its starting value by the end of the duration). Fig. 3 shows the optimal price curve for such example. One can observe that the price starts high. The seller has ample time at this point, and the threat of having the product unsold is low, allowing him to charge a higher price. As time goes by this opportunity declines, and there is more urgency to sell the product, leading to lower price. At the end of the period the price increases again by a little, as a last chance to earn extra amount before having to contend with a salvage value.

To examine the benefit of using dynamic pricing, we compare the normalized profit when using the optimal price curve with that when using a constant pricing, where the constant price is set at the optimal level. The optimal price curve achieved a normalized profit is 155.5, while the constant price achieved 151.1. We can see a 2.9 percent improvement due to using an optimized dynamic price.

To further understand the effect of time-dependent demand function on the optimal price curve, we consider the following power demand function, possessing an exponential time decay:

                               shows the optimal price curve for this time-dependent demand function example. One can observe a shape of decreasing price, followed by an uptick at the end, similar to the case of the time-varying exponential demand. To examine the benefit of using dynamic pricing for this example, we also compare the normalized profit when using the optimal price curve with that when using an optimal constant pricing, The optimal price curve obtained a normalized profit is 194.2, while the constant price achieved 186.5. One can see that there is an improvement of (4.1 percent), indicating the value of using an optimized dynamic price.

Here we attempt to develop a better understanding of the benefits of applying the proposed time-normalized revenue pricing policy versus revenue maximization pricing policies. Most of the literature consider the latter approach, such as the work of Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) (henceforth abbreviated GVR) and others. As discussed, our method does not take explicitly into account the existence of inventory (of k items), and it relies on repeated application of the algorithm on the items existing in the inventory. So, as a first step, in the first experiment we compare between the two approaches for the case of one item only (i.e. 
                           
                              k

                        ). The revenue-only approach is based on simply optimizing

                         shows the shape of the optimal price that maximizes the revenue versus the optimal price curve that maximize the time-normalized revenue.

For the previous example the expected revenue from selling an asset using the revenue optimizing policy (or the GVR algorithm) is 131.6 and the expected time for selling this asset is 0.546. On the other hand, for our approach, that maximizes the time-normalized revenue, the expected revenue from selling the asset is 47.9 and the expected time for selling this asset is 0.067. One can observe that in the time used to sell one asset using the maximum revenue pricing policy we can sell many assets using the maximum normalized revenue pricing policy, more than compensating the lower revenue achieved per sale. In other words, using the optimal normalized revenue policy achieves a much larger overall revenue in a given interval, and it is a sensible choice for a one-inventory case. Table 1
                         shows a similar comparison for all other the examples presented in this section, and we observe similar findings. Of course the proposed algorithm and the approach by Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) have different settings, and so the comparison is not for highlighting which strategy is better. This is just to showcase the difference in applicability. Our proposed approach is suitable when we have continuous replenishment, applied after each sale. Gallego and Van Ryzin’s approach (Gallego & van Ryzin, 1994) focuses on the situation when we have an inventory that has to be disposed of for the best price.

In this experiment we consider the general case of an inventory of k items. As mentioned, in this case we repeat the application of the proposed algorithm on the k items existing in the inventory, selling one item after the other. After each sale, the next item is considered, priced anew using a new price curve (if we have a time-dependence or a demand function with time-decay, we make sure to keep the decay already experienced, rather than resetting the whole function). As a benchmark, we also apply the GVR pricing policy (by Gallego & van Ryzin, 1994). Consider an exponential price demand function given by

To have the GVR benchmark reflect similar conditions, we run our algorithm first, and observe the number of selling events (say m) achieved in the considered interval. Then, we specify the given inventory value as m for the GVR algorithm. The reason for doing so is to avoid a mismatch in inventory between the two algorithms. However, we emphasize that this is still not a formal comparison between the two algorithms, because the conditions are somewhat different. The goal is just to have a reference. The proposed experiment is implemented in a Monte Carlo fashion, by simulating sales arrivals according to the computed and time-varying demand rate λ. We apply 1000 Monte Carlo runs for our approach. For each run we determine the value of m (the number of selling events). Then we use this number m as an inventory for the GVR algorithm, and run both GVR and our method for 250 Monte Carlo runs. We compute the average achieved revenue for each approach, and compare between them. As mentioned, this is repeated 1000 times, and statistics are computed. Based on the Monte Carlo runs, our method produces a mean average improvement in revenue over GVR by 11.84 percent, a minimum improvement of 9.17 percent and a maximum average improvement of 14.64 percent. These runs show that repeated application of the proposed algorithm for the case of an inventory of k items still gives superior and competitive results, even though the analysis has not been specifically designed to take into account the existence of an inventory.

In these experiments we perform a more detailed analysis of the effect of the time-dependent demand functions on the optimal price curve. We apply sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the exponential and the power time-varying functions. Figs. 6
                         and 7
                         show the effects of changing the parameters of the exponential function; while Figs. 8
                         and 9
                         show the effects of changing the parameters of the power function. The basic observation from the parameter variations of the exponential and the power functions is that the change in variables mostly affects both functions in similar ways. The following are the general observations (for the shown examples and for other tested numeric values as well):

                           
                              •
                              Cost c: Especially in the initial time period, a higher cost leads to higher pricing. This is anticipated because the profit margin gets squeezed. However, that premium disappears as we near the selling horizon: there is more urgency to sell and avoid a salvaged item.

Salvage s: When getting near the end of the selling horizon, i.e. when the chance that the product goes unsold becomes higher, the price increases if the salvage price increases. This is because one stands to lose less by it going unsold.

Lead time l: This has a small effect on the pricing curve. It becomes a little higher when l increases.

The time decay factor β: As β increases, the pricing curve drops. The reason is that the time decay becomes faster, and hence the higher urgency to sell.

The price elasticity slope α: As α increases, the price sensitivity increases, and therefore the whole pricing curve becomes lower. The reason is that price will be a more effective control tool when price sensitivity is higher. So lowering the price would have more impact in increasing sales, and also improving profit. For the power demand function the lowering of the price curve is concentrated at the beginning part and at the ending part of the period.

The price level parameter y: As y increases, the effect is mixed: a higher price occurs especially at the beginning, and this increase decays or reverses towards the middle or the end.

Selling horizon T: As T increases, the whole pricing curve gets elongated and the bottom shifts, as we have a longer time to sell. The effect on the price is more pronounced as we approach the end of the horizon, because this is when the probabilities of the item going unsold differ markedly between the two cases.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we have considered an alternative revenue formulation for the dynamic pricing problem, namely the maximization of time-normalized revenue or profit. This is more relevant to corporations, which typically monitor the amount of sales in a fiscal year. Considering a replenishable product, we have derived an analytical solution to the problem in the form of an ODE. The derived solution is then applied to the two well-known exponential and power function price-demand functions, and we have obtained closed-form solutions. There are several advantages of the proposed model. First, it is closer to the real revenue targets for firms. Also, for several of the commonly used demand functions, such as the exponential and the power function, it obtains a well-defined and a well-specified pricing curve, thus rendering the solution transparent to the user, who can easily see the pricing curve and observe the effects of different parameters on it. Third, the solution is relatively computationally cheap to obtain (especially for the exponential and the power demand functions), in contrast to some of the models in the literature that rely on computationally expensive algorithms. We hope the proposed model will be considered as a possible effective candidate model when considering applicable dynamic pricing problems.

                     Euler Lagrange theory is a procedure that has been developed for the case of optimizing a single integral (see Gelfand & Fomin, 2000). For the case of a ratio of integrals, this theory can be extended easily, as follows. Consider infinitesimal changes in the R function and its time-derivative, given by δR(t) and δR′(t) respectively. We get:
