                  Objectives
                  The first objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of integrating a single-source system into the routine patient care documentation workflow with respect to process modifications, data quality and execution times in patient care as well as research documentation. The second one is to evaluate whether it is cost-efficient using a single-source system in terms of achieved savings in documentation expenditures.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We analyzed the documentation workflow of routine patient care and research documentation in the medical field of pruritus to identify redundant and error-prone process steps. Based on this, we established a novel documentation workflow including the x4T (exchange for Trials) system to connect hospital information systems with electronic data capture systems for the exchange of study data. To evaluate the workflow modifications, we performed a before/after analysis as well as a time–motion study. Data quality was assessed by measuring completeness, correctness and concordance of previously and newly collected data. A cost–benefit analysis was conducted to estimate the savings using x4T per collected data element and the additional costs for introducing x4T.
               
               
                  Results
                  The documentation workflow of patient care as well as clinical research was modified due to the introduction of the x4T system. After x4T implementation and workflow modifications, half of the redundant and error-prone process steps were eliminated. The generic x4T system allows direct transfer of routinely collected health care data into the x4T research database and avoids manual transcription steps. Since x4T has been introduced in March 2012, the number of included patients has increased by about 1000 per year. The average entire documentation time per patient visit has been significantly decreased by 70.1% (from 1116±185 to 334±83s). After the introduction of the x4T system and associated workflow changes, the completeness of mandatory data elements raised from 82.2% to 100%. In case of the pruritus research study, the additional costs for introducing the x4T system are €434.01 and the savings are 0.48ct per collected data element. So, with the assumption of a 5-year runtime and 82 collected data elements per patient, the amount of documented patients has to be higher than 1102 to create a benefit.
               
               
                  Conclusion
                  Introduction of the x4T system into the clinical and research documentation workflow can optimize the data collection workflow in both areas. Redundant and cumbersome process steps can be eliminated in the research documentation, with the result of reduced documentation times as well as increased data quality. The usage of the x4T system is especially worthwhile in a study with a large amount of collected data or a high number of included patients.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Routine patient care as well as clinical research often requires documentation of large amounts of data for each patient. The medical documentation usually occurs in electronic health record (EHR) systems, whereas research documentation is entered in electronic data capture (EDC) systems. EHR systems contain a comprehensive data basis and the number of patients having a basic electronic medical record is consistently increasing [1]. However, the fact that physicians already spend 25–30% of their daily working time on electronic documentation [2,3] creates the demand of less, especially redundant documentation work. In this regard, the so-called single-source approach attempts to capture data once and reuses it again for different purposes. Theoretical frameworks [4,5] have been developed for the secondary use as well as concrete implementations within EHR systems [6–10] and data warehouses [11–13]. However, the secondary use is not unrestrictedly possible, because EHR data is not always available in a structured manner as needed to facilitate the research process [14]. Furthermore, the fact that data is present does not mean that it is necessarily trustworthy [15]. Therefore, a key challenge for the secondary use is the quality of data to attain research objectives.

In the context of adapting new Health IT systems, such as EHR or computerized provider order entry systems, changes are often introduced in the common workflow [16]. Apart from time-savings through the implementation of a single-source system, reported by Köpcke et al. [9], workflow processes might be changed, which often remains unconsidered.

A faster documentation workflow and increased data quality thanks to a revised process can be obtained through a careful introduction of a single-source system. Nevertheless, costs should be taken into account for operating a single-source system. A comparison between time and associated cost savings and the efforts for setting up and running such a system is essential for its profitability.

With the aim of supporting the secondary use of EHR data, a generic single-source architecture was jointly developed by the authors at the Institute of Medical Informatics and the Department of Information Systems at the University of Münster. Based on this architecture, the x4T (exchange for Trials) system was developed to enable efficient study documentation with routinely collected patient care data from EHR systems [5].

The technical feasibility of the x4T system has already been demonstrated in three different use cases: an observational study in the department of dermatology since March 2012, a biobank in the department of angiology since September 2012, and an investigator initiated trial in the department of psychosomatic medicine since March 2013. However, to what extent the usage of the single-source system implies modifications on the routine patient care and clinical research documentation workflow remains unknown. Implementing healthcare IT often results in a change of work execution and to the authors’ knowledge an integration of a secondary use system into the routine patient care documentation process has not been evaluated before. Apart from this, the effort for setting up such a system in comparison to likely benefits has also not yet been evaluated.

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the x4T system for the secondary use of EHR data. Particularly, this paper aims to address the following research questions:
                           
                              •
                              What workflow effects are associated with integrating a single-source system into the routine patient care documentation process?

How is the data quality, in particular completeness, correctness and concordance affected by the integration of x4T?

Are the savings that are achievable with x4T greater than the expenditures of its introduction in a clinical study documentation workflow?

The subject of this evaluation was the data collection workflow in the Competence Centre Chronic Pruritus (KCP), a part of the department of dermatology at the University Hospital Münster, Germany, employing three physicians and 10 healthcare professionals in total. With approximately 2,500 patients per year (as of 2012), it is specialized in the treatment of all kinds of pruritic dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. The pruritus research study in the KCP was chosen as they have a large patient collective of retrospectively and prospectively collected data.

In the former process, physician-based documentation was performed on paper forms, whereas a part of patient questionnaires were completed on paper and another part on electronic devices [17]. Data from these electronic questionnaires was automatically imported into the EHR system ORBIS (Agfa Healthcare) [18]. Clinicians as well as patients are highly satisfied using this digital method [19]. Physicians collected data regarding diagnoses, localization, trigger and quality of pruritus on the initial as well as follow-up medical history paper form. The local paper-based itch questionnaire (NeuroDerm) collects data about pruritus like quality, score of the intensity, trigger factors, etc. and is completed by the patient at home before the appointment.

For archive and research purposes, a documentation assistant transcribed data from the medical history and the patient questionnaires onto a paper-based database preparation form (DPF). From there the data is again transferred manually into the Excel research database by a documentation assistant. This database consisted of a large Microsoft Excel spreadsheet comprising 2,075 study subjects with 139 data elements per patient, which have been collected since 2009. Simple functions for descriptive analyses were also included. To give physicians a brief overview of the entire data in the patient record, a summary sheet was prepared for each patient encounter. This sheet was created out of the Excel database and contained relevant data elements from the medical history and patient questionnaires.

To facilitate secondary use of routinely collected EHR data, the x4T system was used. In contrast to typical commercial or open-source EDC systems (e.g. OpenClinica [20], REDCap [21] or DADOS [22]), x4T-EDC – as part of the x4T architecture – provides the opportunity to communicate with EHR systems. The architecture is based on the “Extraction and Investigator Verification”-scenario of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Electronic Source Data Interchange (eSDI) [23] group. This group has identified five possible scenarios for the clinical trial documentation between sites and sponsors using eSource (electronic source data) collection instruments. Three of them propose a strategy in which data is entered once in the EHR or separate system and used for multiple purposes. For all scenarios the CDISC eSDI group has analyzed and assessed the regulatory requirements found in ICH-GCP [24] and FDA 21 CRF Part 11 [25] predicate rules. The Extraction and Investigator Verification-scenario comprises a validation step at the local site before the eSource data is transferred to the sponsors system. The x4T architecture was developed according to the requirements stated from the eSDI group; e.g. that data should be captured as specified within the protocol or the location of source documents and data shall be clearly identified.

As shown in Fig. 1
                        , x4T consists of two major components: The x4T-EDC [26] research database and the Clinical Interface that serves as mediator between EHR and EDC.

x4T-EDC is based on a native XML database (eXist-db [27]) with XQuery and XForms capabilities. The XML-based Operational Data Model [28] from CDISC is used for communicating and processing eCRFs (electronic Case Report Forms) on which research documentation occurs. The research database contains the functionality of requesting, receiving, and integrating EHR data as well as audit logging for entered data. Furthermore, the x4T architecture offers the ability to directly register eligible patients for the study within the EHR system. Currently, it is used for observational studies and patient registries.

EHR communication is established by the second component: the Clinical Interface, which is located at each hospital. This interface is connected to the EHR database and provides secured web services for the x4T-EDC interaction. Research databases usually contain de-identified data, thus to allow re-identification a mapping table at each site links patient IDs and subject IDs for each study. The Clinical Interface includes a semantic component. For the identification of eligible EHR data, research and clinical data are annotated with concept codes of common terminologies such as NCI Thesaurus, SNOMED-CT, etc. A request is sent from x4T-EDC to the Clinical Interface containing these semantic annotations. To query the corresponding EHR values, a local mapping is defined that links concept codes to local hospital codes including database query templates. In case of matching codes the real patient is re-identified in the Clinical Interface, data values are extracted from the EHR and transferred to x4T-EDC. In addition to clinical values, meta-information concerning the EHR source is provided such as timestamps of the record and user IDs to facilitate traceability. Plausibility and completeness of data is validated by the clinical user.

The observational study of pruritus was approved by the local ethics committee and the x4T architecture was approved by the local data protection officer. In the pruritus study an informed consent is obtained from each patient.

@&#METHODS@&#

To evaluate the documentation process and execution times as well as data quality in the pruritus documentation workflow, we have performed a before-after study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify the process before and after x4T implementation. A time–motion study was conducted to measure process execution times. To evaluate x4T's economic efficiency, a cost–benefit analysis was conducted.

In this evaluation study, three physicians, two study nurses, and three documentation assistants of the KCP were involved. For the cost–benefit analysis a medical informatics professional constructed EHR forms and mappings between EHR and EDC data elements.

In 2009 the former pruritus documentation workflow was established. In March 2012 it was replaced by the new x4T process. The entire evaluation period – shown in Fig. 2
                         – took place from December 2011 until December 2012 and was divided into a before- and after-phase:
                           
                              1.
                              In the before-phase, the paper-based documentation workflow was analyzed before x4T introduction. The workflow was modeled at the end of 2011 and after that, process execution times were measured for particular tasks. Legacy data was analyzed and corrected before the x4T system went live at the end of March 2012.

The post-phase concerns the evaluation of the new documentation process. x4T had been running for five months – from the end of March 2012 to the end of August 2012 – before the measurements of the new process were conducted from mid- until the end of September 2012. The data quality analysis took place from October until the beginning of December 2012. After that the cost–benefit analysis was conducted.

For the evaluation study the following aspects were focused on:
                           
                              1.
                              The impact on the documentation workflow of x4T's integration was identified in terms of the number of process steps, execution times and participating clinicians.

In terms of data quality, completeness, syntactical correctness and concordance between data of the former and novel workflow were measured and compared.

Additional costs for setting up a study using the x4T system were calculated, as well as the cost savings for the documentation with the system. This comparison led to the break-even point for the amount of data elements and patients that had to be documented in a study to make the use of x4T cost-efficient.

We selected a time–motion study to measure the impact of the x4T introduction on the documentation workflow. To analyze the former documentation workflow, face-to-face interviews were carried out. Results were documented manually on paper sheets. Process diagrams were depicted using event-driven process chains (EPC) to illustrate the processes as well as the involved documentation media. Measured activities in the time–motion study were obtained from the workflow analysis. Zheng et al. developed the “Suggested Time and Motion Procedures” that we considered for reporting in our study [29]. The data collection was performed by a neutral evaluator using a stopwatch and results were documented on a paper chart.

Data quality was measured by following the methods for completeness, correctness and concordance reported by Weiskopf and Weng [15]:
                              
                                 •
                                 To calculate completeness, we applied the method of “Element presence”. Therefore, we determined desired data elements such as administrative patient data and diagnostic data in collaboration with the research investigator. We counted missing mandatory values in the former Excel and the novel x4T-EDC database using database queries.

“Data element agreement” and “Validity checks” were applied to measure correctness. In case of data values that can be derived from other values within the former research database, these values were compared to see whether they report the same information. We also performed a format check of the respective element types like zip-codes and also compared elements with their expected values like scores that are defined in a special range. This measurement was performed using queries for both databases.

The “Data source agreement” method was used to investigate whether the concordance of research data differed after x4T introduction. The agreement of data from the DPF and data in the Excel database was assessed for the pruritus workflow before x4T introduction. To identify the difference after x4T introduction the agreement of EHR data and data within the x4T-EDC system was evaluated.

The investigation of agreement was performed by two documentation assistants to avoid bias.

To assess whether the introduction of a single-source system will be cost-efficient, we calculated additional costs C
                           
                              ADD_SS
                            for the operation of x4T and compared them with the savings Save
                           
                              SS
                            achieved through the reduced documentation workload. To obtain a cost–benefit, the savings have to be higher than the additional costs. All costs were reported in Euro.

Additional costs comprise the following: x4T server rental fee C

The break-even point for the cost-efficiency can mainly be obtained by the number of patients and their captured data elements. To calculate the break-even point for the amount of patients that should be documented, we determined the amount of data elements that are actually filled out per patient in the Excel and x4T database:

                            (€45.45 per hour) and for documentation assistants the tariff for student and scientific assistants [30,31] was averaged, which is €13.00 per hour.

Microsoft Visio was used to draw the former and novel process as an EPC. Statistical analyses were performed in R [32] to calculate the average time and standard deviation of process steps. The one-sided Mann–Whitney-U-test was selected to analyze the significance between the former and the novel x4T data collection time.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The former Excel database contained 2075 study subjects, which were transferred into the new pruritus research database (x4T-EDC). With the novel workflow 967 patients were added to the x4T-EDC within the operational phase of five months. These patients were automatically documented with data from the EHR system and from manual data entries.

In total, the patient population in the pruritus x4T-EDC has steadily increased from the go-live date in March 2012 until now for about 1000 per year from 2075 to 3785 until September 2013; see Fig. 3
                        . For all patients, who were processed with the x4T system, an amount of 16,684 forms – 4165 physician-based and 12,519 patient questionnaires – were automatically transferred from the EHR into the x4T-EDC. This increase shows the keen usage of the novel workflow and system respectively.

The former Excel database contained 139 data elements. Through reorganization, the novel x4T database comprises 213 elements. With the novel system, 135 (63.4%) data elements can be pre-populated and the remaining 78 (36.6%) are manually recorded, because those elements are captured by the patient at home and are therefore not available in the EHR. For the time-motion study 25 research documentation workflows were observed both before and after x4T implementation. All patient records in the Excel as well as x4T-EDC database were considered in the data quality assessment. For a comparable value of the concordance 40 randomly selected patients were evaluated.

The former paper-based pruritus documentation workflow in the KCP is shown in Fig. 4
                           . The workflow differentiates between first- and follow-up-visits, as well as in- and outpatients. Due to the claim of obtaining a long-term patient data collection, outpatients were treated differently in the way of research documentation, because it was uncertain whether they show up again after their first-visit. Whether or not patients appear to their first or follow-up encounter, they enter the questionnaires on a mobile device and data is directly transferred into the EHR. After that the process is divided into the first- and follow-up-visit. Regarding the first encounter, physicians entered information in the initial medical history. On this form, physicians entered a preliminary and – after further examination – a definitive diagnosis. Back at the registration desk, the study nurse completed the DPF with scores of the NeuroDerm patient questionnaire. Both, the DPF and the NeuroDerm questionnaire are paper-based forms. The research documentation for outpatients was then (temporarily) finished. It would only be continued if the patient had a follow-up visit. A documentation assistant then continued the research documentation for outpatients, as well as inpatients, by retrieving the paper-based patient record before the appointment. Patient questionnaires and the medical history were then transcribed onto the DPF. From there the documentation assistant manually transferred the data values into the Excel database. A summary sheet was printed from the Excel database and filed into the patient record. The summary sheet gave physicians an overview of the patients’ pruritus history and provided the basis for further documentation. During the patient encounter, new data was written onto this summary sheet. The Excel database was updated on the basis of this sheet by a documentation assistant. In addition to that, a new version of the summary sheet was again printed and included in the patient record for the next follow-up visit.


                           Fig. 5
                            illustrates the novel documentation workflow after x4T implementation, which was established in a consensus process during the integration of x4T.

The novel workflow does not differentiate any more between research documentation for in- and outpatients. The NeuroDerm questionnaire is completed at home by the patient and is still manually transferred into the x4T-EDC by a documentation assistant. Equally to the former workflow, patients complete a package of patient questionnaires on a mobile device while waiting. From the mobile device the entered data is directly transferred into the respective patient record. Physicians enter their intervention data directly into the EHR-based initial medical history form and determine a preliminary diagnosis. For a follow-up visit the data is collected on the follow-up medical history form within the EHR. Usually, an electronic report is generated daily in the EHR with all patients who have a preliminary, but no definitive diagnosis. With the aid of this report list the research investigator discusses those patients with participating physicians, validates the data, and determines a definitive diagnosis. After this process step the saving of the medical history form triggers the automated electronic transfer of pruritus related data into the x4T-EDC.

In this regard, a shift of work occurred for the validation of the clinical data. Before x4T introduction a documentation assistant has checked the data and transcribed it into the research database, whereas now the research investigator performs this step in collaboration with the physicians. The amount of different workflow tasks, in which the hospital staff is involved, was decreased from seven to four unique processes. Some process activities appear several times in the EPC diagram due to the initial and follow-up process. No additional processes were added to the novel workflow. Due to the capabilities of the EHR, the DPF and the summary sheet are no longer necessary in the novel process.

Based on the evaluated activities and categories in the workflow, the observed tasks for the time–motion study were defined. Fig. 6
                            shows the result of 25 time–motion measurements.

Categories are allocated to the responsible actors: Physicians, documentation assistants and others for the automatic transfer into the x4T-EDC. First of all, the physician's time, spent on the documentation of the medical history, remains quite equal between paper-based and electronic data entry (before: 198±12 vs. after: 202±16s). The same applies to the time transcribing the NeuroDerm questionnaire into the Excel database 73±28 and the x4T-EDC 74±27s. The green-colored task of “Retrieving patient record” disappeared just as “Printing the summary sheet” and “Including it into the patient record”. Before x4T introduction a documentation assistant has validated the data and transcribed it onto the DPF, which took 493±93s. Now the manual transfer steps are no longer required. However, the validation remains and the collaborative determination of definitive diagnoses is performed instead, which takes 53±54s. The time for the entire workflow significantly decreased from 1116±185 to 334±83s (p
                           <0.001).

For the completeness of legacy data in the former documentation workflow, the mandatory elements “administrative data” and “diagnosis” were analyzed in the Excel database. Administrative data was available in all 2075 (100%) patient records. On consideration of the former clinical workflow, outpatients who came once, but never again (542 patients) did not obtain a definitive diagnosis. Hence, the entirety of the included patient records amounted to 1533. In the assessment of incomplete records, 273 patients had missing values. Thus, the completeness resulted in 82.2% of the patient records.

In the novel workflow new patient records, which need to be processed before being transferred into the research database, are displayed in a report list within the EHR. For the automatic transfer into the x4T-EDC system the data needs to be validated and a definitive diagnosis assigned by the physicians. Due to this implemented trigger, a completeness of data (100%) is achieved. The completeness of patient care as well as research documentation is now supported through two mechanisms: The first one is obtained through the implementation in the clinical workflow and integration of x4T. The second one is realized within x4T-EDC, where physicians can directly see which study patients have incomplete records, especially for manually captured data.

The correctness in the former Excel database, in terms of “data element agreement”, resulted in 54 (2.6%) values, which did not report compatible information. Equally, the validity check showed discrepancies mainly in date fields and in the zip code. Due to the relatively low amount of 17 (0.8%) date format and 19 (0.9%) zip code violations, the correction was done rapidly. In the x4T-EDC system the analysis showed no discrepancies in the automatically transferred data. A possible source of errors was reduced by the implementation of plausibility checks within the EHR and EDC forms.

In 40 records between the DPF and data in the Excel database the concordance measurement showed 100% agreement of the compared patient data. The validation of data, which was exported from the EHR and pre-populated within the eCRFs in x4T, also resulted in 100% concordance.

Concerning the parameters for the cost-benefit calculation, we used the values from the pruritus documentation.

The runtime of the pruritus study is not limited but we assumed a time of 5 years so C

                            is €240. The step of installing the x4T system took 35min (€17.21). Implementing an empty EHR form consumed 17min (€8.36). We have measured an average time for creating a single data element C

                            of 30s (€0.25). The time for the average mapping C

                            was 92s (€0.75). With five implemented EHR forms and a total of 135 data elements the additional x4T cost were calculated as followed:

The savings that can be obtained with the x4T system is composed of the difference in documentation expenditures per data element between the former and novel documentation process. In the former data collection process, the actually captured data elements are on average 74 out of 139, which resulted in 5.3s and staff costs of €0.02 per data elements.

Whereas in the novel system, an average of 43 data values are actually captured and transferred into x4T-EDC and 82 out of in total 213 data values are actually entered in the EHR forms. In total, 2.4s with costs of €0.015 are spent for documentation per entered value. Savings in documentation are calculated in €0.005ct per entered data value:

For the pruritus research database, the cost-efficiency of x4T is estimated for an entire study runtime of five years and resulted in an amount of documented patients that has to be greater than 1102.

Definitive diagnoses were previously determined by each physician seeing the pruritus-patients. Due to rotation of physicians and thus a limited view on the patient history, the research investigator could not ensure the quality of entered diagnoses. To improve the quality of diagnoses all physicians now enter a preliminary diagnosis in the medical history form (first encounter and/or follow-up). In a daily meeting the research investigator discusses all patients with a preliminary diagnosis together with the physicians and determines the definitive one. This process leads to a deeper understanding of the patients’ cases. Beyond that, the discussion of patients results in a teaching effect of, e.g. assistant doctors.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The x4T system was integrated into the clinical workflow so that patients can directly be included into the x4T-EDC as study subjects. Due to this EHR integration, the pre-population of study eCRFs with EHR data was enabled. EHR data is now automatically transferred into the x4T-EDC after a validation step. In case of the pruritus documentation, the determination of the definitive diagnosis and the validation of entered data within the medical history trigger this transfer.

Due to the introduction of the x4T system, the documentation workflow of patient care and clinical research in the KCP was modified. First of all it led to a simplified and tidier workflow with less process steps. The amount of process steps was reduced from seven to four and the process of “data transfer” from the EHR into the research database is now performed automatically. The removal of redundant tasks as “Transcribing data from paper into Excel” and “Printing a paper-sheet out of Excel” resulted in a decrease of media discontinuity and reduces the risk of transcription errors substantially. Because of the fewer process steps the study staff might be more likely to feel comfortable with the new workflow. In addition, physicians are more concerned with the pruritus cases due to the novel collaborative task of determining definitive diagnoses. By removing redundant documentation steps, the associated fragmentation of work was also decreased. Especially, work fragmentation is said to be the reason for frequent task switching, which leads to emotional stress on physicians [33,34].

The time for the entire documentation process was significantly reduced from 1116±185 to 334±83s. Regarding the time physicians spend on electronic documentation, a reduction of additional research documentation provides motivation for the secondary usage of EHR data.

The steadily increasing number of patients in the pruritus research database of about 1000 per year with 16,684 transferred forms in total shows the keen usage of the x4T-EDC system in the novel workflow.

Data quality was assessed regarding completeness, correctness and concordance. In addition to faster documentation times, completeness was increased from 82.2% to 100% due to workflow modifications as part of the x4T introduction. Completeness on clinical routine, as well as research data, is reached through the new task of determining a definitive diagnosis based on an EHR report list. The correctness of the former database was quite high with 97.4% so that erroneous data values could be amended before import into x4T-EDC. Particularly media discontinuity is a source of errors when data is transcribed from one medium to another. Fortunately, no discrepancies were identified neither in the former nor in the novel research database.

This analysis showed that the secondary use of EHR data is not simply possible without any effort. However, the savings that can be achieved with a single-source system need to be weighed against the costs for the implementation, to determine the likely benefit. Setting up the system, creating EHR documentation forms and mapping corresponding research data elements is a labor-intensive process. If additional expenditures of the x4T setup are lower than the savings, the use of the x4T system will be cost-efficient. By varying the parameters of entered data elements, documented patients and months of runtime the savings for particular studies and the cost-efficiency of using the x4T system can easily be estimated.

In case of the pruritus research database, we estimated a runtime of 5 years and an average amount of 82 collected data elements per patient. Considering the additional setup costs of €434.01, using x4T will be worth the efforts if more than 1102 patients were documented. It was assumed that x4T setup is performed by a trained, experienced professional.

The single-source approach using the x4T system is generally attractive for large-scale studies, which comprise a high amount of patients with a large number of pre-populated data elements. In case of long term or register studies, the single-source approach with the application of x4T can be beneficial and worth the efforts.

In the pruritus study a large number of patients and data were involved. For this reason this study was chosen for evaluation of the x4T system. The results presented in this research work are representative for a single-site study and ought to be evaluated in a multi-center setting. In addition, the scope of x4T-EDC is currently focused on observational studies and patient registries.

The x4T system facilitates the “Extraction and Investigator Verification”-scenario of the CDISC eSDI group and regards the regulatory requirements for this strategy. The focus of the x4T system was on academic research questions such as observational studies and patient registries, so requirements for a system validation were not applied during the development process. The system validation of x4T is certainly very resource-intensive – given the complexity of current EHR systems – but should be feasible in principle. Therefore the topic of EHR–EDC-integration will become more and more important in the future.

The usability of this novel process and the x4T system was not evaluated due to a lack of users in this study. However, the x4T system is in routine use in the KCP from March 2012 until now. In addition, the evaluation was performed after a period of five months to accustom the users to the novel documentation process and avoid possible bias during the introduction. Due to the reliance on continuously high data quality of clinical documentation in the long-term patient care process, the KCP has a great interest in using the documentation system, which might have been influential on the system usage.

Furthermore, the original paper-based documentation forms of the pruritus study have already been well structured so that no major alternations in the way of electronic data capture within the EHR were accomplished.

Well established instruments were used: Procedures for reporting of the time-motion study [29], categories for the data quality assessment [15] and STARE-HI for reporting the results of this study [35]. Data quality was assessed by the application of established categories and methods. Nevertheless, we only assessed “element agreement” and performed “validity checks” for the correctness and did not review the data regarding its trueness.

We were able to make a statement with respect to the relationship of time and cost savings of the x4T documentation workflow and its implementation. Nevertheless, in our cost–benefit analysis development and maintenance expenditures for x4T had been neglected. We also assumed that x4T will be available as open source software. In terms of process times, we only compared research documentation expenditures and not the costs for the entire routine patient care data collection. In addition, the cost–benefit analysis was only based on pruritus research study and its specific documentation workflow.

From a data quality perspective we assumed that EHR data is entered into a specific form and was not retrieved from somewhere out of the electronic patient record. Therefore, possible search and quality rating efforts were not considered. In addition, we could not make a statement on the relationship of cost–benefit and potentially increased data quality, which might save post-processing costs.

We have revised the paper-based pruritus documentation process toward an electronic workflow, which results in increased data quality for patient care as well as research data. These results comply with a study of Bergrath et al., who analyzed whether paper-based data collection satisfies scientific requirements [36]. They found out that paper-based collected data resulted in incomplete documentation, making further research objectives impossible.

EHR systems provide huge amounts of data and therefore represent potential data sources for different purposes. However, data should not inconsiderately be reused without any knowledge of accuracy and purpose of its collection [37]. Analyzing and revising the clinical documentation workflow is one of the most essential prerequisites in understanding the purpose of source data and to ensure its quality for secondary use, which is shown in this evaluation study.

The issue of revising the clinical documentation workflow is also discussed in literature [38,39] but has not yet been evaluated in a study setting. Not only changes in the clinical documentation process but also in the work practice itself should be carried out to make EHR data useful for secondary use [40]. Callen et al. assumed that insufficient integration of electronic summaries into the routine work process may be a reason for higher error rates in the documentation [41]. This assumption is confirmed by our results of the integration and adaptation of x4T in the clinical data collection process, which led to enhanced data quality and decreased documentation time.

Modifications on the patient care and clinical research documentation process have been carried out in collaboration with the KCP working staff, which results in a considerable decrease of process steps. This effect has led to a reduction in working time for the entire documentation process. However, time savings for a secondary use process can widely differ between studies.

The pruritus documentation time in this study was improved by an average of 83.2% (787–132s). Köpcke et al. also report a decrease in the documentation time of 88.2% (255–30s) [9]. Köpcke et al. pre-populated Microsoft Word documents, which were printed out for further paper-based completion. In addition, those printed documents had to be manually entered into the study database. This kind of manual error-prone process of data transcription is completely being removed by using the integrated x4T system. The source from where data is transcribed did not really affect the time for performing this task, which is also shown by Apkon and Singhaviranon [42].

The data quality of research as well as routinely collected patient care data was increased from 82.2% to 100% in the completeness of documentation. Similar results are shown by Eminaga et al. who also reported an increase in completeness to 100%, after the system was introduced, but a rate of 2 errors per 3450 fields still remains [43]. In a further study, Botsis et al. reported an incompleteness rate in disease documentation in pathology reports of 48.2% (1479 missing of 3068 patients) [44]. Completeness of the patient record is particularly important in clinical studies to analyze and answer research questions.

From an economic point of view it is necessary that costs of an IT system need to be weighed against the benefits to determine whether a project should proceed by means of cost-efficiency. In the field of reusing EHR data for secondary purposes, such a cost–benefit analysis has not yet been performed to the authors’ knowledge.

The secondary use of routinely collected patient data is desirable for multiple purposes, e.g. clinical research or quality assurance. Due to the x4T integration into the EHR system, the x4T architecture can create a benefit concerning physicians’ documentation time, elimination of transcription errors, and increase of data completeness, which was emphasized by this evaluation study.

The subject of our evaluation was a clinical observational study concerning pruritus research. Clinical studies like this are especially common in collecting large amounts of data to deal with, for instance patient registries. The improvements in documentation time and data quality in this study can be assigned to other similar scenarios and by successive analyzing and adapting their clinical workflow, beneficial effects for patient care as well as clinical research are expected. Through the generic x4T system architecture, a scenario for secondary use can easily be expanded to other studies.

The results of the cost–benefit analysis allow the estimation of whether the introduction of a single-source system is worth the efforts in a specific study setting.

During the interviews with the team in the KCP after x4T evaluation, physicians reported a satisfactory documentation workflow and a relief for the daily work. Nevertheless, a subsequent research question is concerned with the usability of the x4T-EDC system.

We have shown that the data quality was improved through modifications of the former documentation workflow and integration of the x4T. An important question in patient care is how the data quality improvements affect the quality of care. A further point which is still controversially discussed in literature [15,37] is the reuse of routinely collected patient care data the purpose of which is unknown. In this case, an evaluation regarding its eligibility for secondary use would be of great benefit.

Apart from the expenditures to introduce a single-source system and the savings that can be achieved, it is questionable what cost impact the increased data quality will have on the entire savings, e.g. post processed data, which might be corrected in a non-single-source approach.

Finally, the usage of the pruritus research database should be nationally expanded [45] and in this context the system should be evaluated in a multi-site environment.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The introduction of the x4T system and integration into the clinical and research documentation workflow can optimize the workflow of data collection in both areas. A reduced time span for gathering data, as well as increased data quality, is achievable. Implementing the x4T single-source system can create a benefit on the documentation costs if the respective amount of data elements, which should be collected, is considered.
