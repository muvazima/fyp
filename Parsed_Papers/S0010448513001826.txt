                  We describe a method for a reconstructing piecewise helix curve from its 2D sketch. The system takes as input a hand-drawn polygonal curve and generates a piecewise helix curve such that its orthogonal projection matches the input curve. The first step is an algorithm to generate a set of helices such that their orthogonal projection approximates the input curve. This step is followed by a global optimization to minimize the tangent discontinuity of the junctions of the helices while keeping the fitting error small.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Helices are curves whose curvature and torsion are constant. These curves are very common in nature and among man-made objects: hair curls, coiled phone cords, spring coils, tendrils of climbing plants, etc. In this paper, we present a method to fit a curve which is the orthogonal projection of a piecewise helix curve to a 2D polygonal curve provided by the user. The main difficulty resides in the fact that the helix and the curve that is the projection of the helix have different curvature.

One of the most common approaches  [1,2] of sketch-based modeling is to let the user draw the 3D shape using straight line segments. The main disadvantage of these approaches is that they are limited to the reconstruction of rectilinear shapes; they cannot be applied to free-form curves. Several researchers have worked on the modeling of 3D surfaces  [3,4] and 3D curves using sketches. In the method proposed by Cohen et al.  [5], the user generates a 3D curve by drawing the curve and its shadow on the floor plane. Other researchers have proposed a 3D reconstruction method by assuming that the reconstructed curves are mirror-symmetric  [6].

Several researchers have worked on the problem of fitting a piecewise helix curve, a so-called super-helix, to a 3D polygonal curve. Piuze et al.  [7] proposed an optimization method to fit piecewise generalized helicoids to 3D curves. Goriely et al.  [8] have shown a method to compute the polyhelices that pass through an arbitrary set of points. A polyhelix is a curve consisting of a sequence of connected helical segments. Ghosh  [9] introduced the bi-helices, a

The closest work to ours is a sketch-based interface for modeling virtual hair for 3D characters  [11,12]. In this paper, the authors describe a method to create 3D helices from a 2D sketch. Their method only works under the assumption that the main axis of the reconstructed helix is parallel to the sketching plane. In contrast, our method is able to reconstruct piecewise helix curves with any orientation.

In this paper, we address a different problem, which is the fitting of a curve which is the orthogonal projection of a helix to a 2D polygonal curve. In contrast to the problem of fitting a helix to a 3D polygonal curve, the curvature of the 2D polygonal curve cannot be directly used for generating the helix. This is because the helix curve and its projection have different curvature. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem has never been addressed until now.

@&#OVERVIEW@&#

A key element of our approach is a method to compute a helix curve such that its orthogonal projection matches the entire or a portion of a 2D polygonal curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                     . In Section  5, we describe some properties of the projected helix curve. Based on these properties, we present a method to compute the fitting of a projected helix curve to the input curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                      (Section  6).

In most cases, the reconstructed helix curve does not fit the entire input curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                     ; it is rare that the user draws a curve which is the exact projection of a helix curve. Thus, the matching is done in a recursive manner with several helices. After fitting the first helix 
                        
                           
                              H
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      to 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                     , we identify the parts of 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                      for which the matching is not good and compute the fitting on those parts with the next helix 
                        
                           
                              H
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . This process is repeated recursively until all parts of the input curve have been fitted with a helix. The result is a piecewise helix curve that approximates the entire curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                     . This process is explained in Section  6.

Once the coefficients of the piecewise helix curve have been generated, we compute its 3D position. The resulting curve is 
                        
                           
                              G
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      discontinuous since it does not guarantee the tangent continuity at the junctions between adjacent helices. Thus, we modify the helix coefficients such as to minimize the tangent discontinuity at the helix junctions while maintaining a small matching error. This last step is explained in Section  7.

                     ) (Fig. 1
                     (a)). This implies that the

                      and 
                        y
                      coordinates of the 3D vertices of the curves are known. The

                      coordinates have to be computed.

                         are respectively the radius and the pitch of the helix. Now, we consider a helix curve with an arbitrary orientation and its orthogonal projection onto a plane (

                           =
                           0
                        ). Among the three possible rotations (about the 
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                         and 
                           z
                        -axes), only the one about the 
                           x
                        -axis changes the curvature of the projected helix. The 
                           y
                        -rotation is reversible by substituting

                           z
                        -rotation is reversible by applying a rotation in the plane

                        . Without loss of generality, we only take into account the rotation about the 
                           x
                        -axis. Let

                         be the rotation angle about the

In order to compute how well the projected helix curve fits to the polygonal curve

                        , we must compute the distance between the points of

                         and the corresponding points of the projected helix curve. Thus, a preliminary step is to align the two curves so that the point coordinates of the two curves can be compared. To do so, we define a local coordinate frame at the point 
                           t
                           =

                         and the 
                           x
                        -axis is normal to the 
                           y
                        -axis such that

The input of the algorithm is a polygonal curve

                        p
                      vertices

                      connected with line segments of roughly equal length.

First, we compute the curvature for all vertices of 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                      using the method described in Section  5 and identify the vertex 
                        
                           
                              v

                      whose curvature is maximal. This vertex is the seed vertex from which we start the fitting of the projected helix. The goal is to fit a projected helix curve to the part of the polygonal curve in the neighborhood of

                                 I
                              
                           
                        . After this transformation, vertices of 
                           
                              
                                 C

                         and points of the projected helix curve are now defined in the same coordinate system.

The next step is to estimate the unknown coefficients 
                           a
                           ,

                         and 
                           c
                         of the projected helix so that it best approximates the curve 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                         in the neighborhood of

                        . Note that 
                           t
                         is also unknown except at 
                           
                              
                                 v

                         and its value changes along the projected helix curve. This is done with two steps. First, we choose a vertex 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         in the neighborhood of 
                           
                              
                                 v

                         and compute the unknown coefficients 
                           a
                           ,
                           b
                         and

                                 s
                              
                           
                         and

                        . Second, we estimate the overall matching error of the projected helix to the polygonal curve

                        . This number of vertices indicates the portion of the curve

                         which is well fitted with the projected helix curve whose coefficients have been calculated.

The overall fitting process requires using the two algorithms described in Sections  6.2 and 6.3 alternately. We choose a vertex 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                         among the 2 by NMAX neighbors of 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                         and compute the helix coefficients using 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                           
                        . Then we compute how well the projected helix curve with the computed coefficients can fit the rest of the curve. We choose the coefficients 
                           a
                           ,
                           b
                         and 
                           c
                         for which the helix curve covers the largest portion of the polygonal curve  
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                        .

A single helix curve is usually not sufficient to approximate the entire curve 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                        . In such a case, we build a piecewise helix curve to approximate 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                        .

The process is done iteratively. After fitting a helix to 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                        , we identify the part of 
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 I
                              
                           
                         whose vertices have not been fitted yet. The fitting of the next helix is done on those vertices. As mentioned in Section  6, the fitting of a new projected helix start by finding 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 s
                              
                           
                        , the vertex of highest curvature among the vertices which have not been fitted yet.

The output is a set of projected helices: 
                           
                              {

As one may see, the curvature of the generated piecewise helices is discontinuous at the points located at the junction between adjacent helices. This is because the coefficients of the helices have been computed independently for each helix. To overcome this problem, we modify the coefficients of the helices in such a way to make the tangents of the helices at the junction vertices as equal as possible while keeping the distance between the projected piecewise helix and the polygonal curve

We formulate this problem as an optimization problem for which the objective function measures (1) the tangent difference at the junction vertices of the piecewise helix and (2) the overall matching error which is the distance between the projected piecewise helix and the vertices of

                     . We use the simplex search method proposed by Lagarias et al.  [14] for computing the unknown variables such that it is minimum.

@&#RESULTS@&#

We have implemented our algorithm as Matlab scripts and have tested our reconstruction method on different curves. The results are shown in Fig. 3
                     . The computation time is about 1 min for curves composed of 500 vertices. Most of the computation time is spent for the fine fitting (Section  7).

The result of our algorithm is invariant up to translation, rotation and uniform scale; that is, the reconstruction of two 2D curves which are the same up to a rigid transformation and uniform scale will give the same 3D piecewise helix curve. This is because a fundamental step of our algorithm is to align the projected helix curves with the input curve 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              I
                           
                        
                      using the tangent vectors (Section  6.1).

The piecewise helix curves generated with our algorithm are not

                      continuous. In practice, the distance between the endpoints of two neighboring helices is small enough so that they can be regarded as having the same position.

Our algorithm also does not produce a 
                        
                           
                              G

                      continuous curve although it tries to find the piecewise helix such that the tangent discontinuity is the smallest possible at the junction vertices. Most of the time, these tangent discontinuities are small enough so that they are not noticeable. There are some cases where high tangent discontinuity occurs in the reconstructed piecewise helix curve (Fig. 4
                     ).
