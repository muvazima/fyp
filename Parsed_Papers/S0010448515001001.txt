                  Contact area is an important geometric measurement in many physical systems. It is also difficult to compute due to its extreme sensitivity to infinitesimal perturbations. In this paper, we propose a new concept called an effective contact measure, which acts as a smooth version of contact area. Effective contact measures incorporate a notion of scale into the definition of contact area, allowing one to consider the degree of contact at different sizes. We show how effective contact measures can yield useful statistics for a number of applications, including analysis of multiphase materials and docking/alignment problems.

                      The goal of this paper is to study some approximations of contact area and their computations. In these approximations, we will consider both perturbation of the shapes and the situation where the shapes are nearly in contact (i.e. they may be slightly separated or interpenetrating, violating the strict contact condition).

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

There are a number of reasons that one might be interested in contact area. As a motivating example, consider the problem of analyzing a sample of some multiphase material. In general, some of the phases may be insulated from one another, while others may be directly touching. The extent to which any two phases are in contact has a direct physical significance in heat transfer  [1], electrical resistance  [2], material strength  [3], mechanical wear  [4] and microscopic friction  [5]. Another application of contact area is the solution of docking problems. Suppose we are given two solids–for example, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle–and say that we want to figure out how to align them such that they fit together while touching as much as possible. Finding such alignments could be used as a subproblem for higher level assembly and planning operations, like box packing  [6] or recovering assembly constraints  [7], for example.

The main issue with the direct definition of contact area is that it is unstable with respect to small perturbations of the shapes involved. This seems to have been first noticed by Bowden  [8], and is similar to the behavior of the surface area or curvature  [9,10] of a solid. From a practical standpoint, this instability causes problems when using numerical optimization to find docking configurations. It also means the calculation of the contact area becomes highly dependent on the scale at which the objects involved are measured and represented, where results at finer scales may diverge greatly from those which are sampled more coarsely.

Our proposed solution to these problems is to introduce a new concept which we call an “effective contact measure”. Effective contact measures allow us to consider contact area at different scales and in situations where objects are nearly touching or even slightly penetrating. This avoids the use of highly sensitive calculations like surface area. The bulk of this paper is devoted to studying various formulations of effective contact measure. We also show that many of these quantities can be computed efficiently using the Fourier transform which makes them attractive for problems like alignment or nesting. In the final portion of the paper, we discuss some of these applications in more detail and experimentally compare the behavior of our various constructions on several examples in 2D and 3D.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

In physics and mechanical engineering there has been a great deal of work in relating various physical quantities to contact area, as discussed in Section  1.1. But outside the applied sciences, the concept of contact area does not appear to have received much attention in its own right. Perhaps the most closely related set of ideas to our approach is the concept of a curvature measure  [11,9], as defined in the field of geometric measure theory and integral geometry. However, a key difference is that curvature measures consider only the change of a single body within a fixed localizing region, while in a contact area measure we consider simultaneous perturbations of both sets.

To the best of our knowledge, the direct application of contact area to alignment or docking problems does not appear to have been investigated in either a theoretical or computational context. In spirit, the most closely related research to this work is cross correlation based alignment for protein docking  [12,13]. These techniques model the alignment problem as one of maximizing the overlap of pseudo electric charge potentials defined over the surface of some molecule, with complex weights added to the interiors to penalize interference and reward docking. Variations of this idea are currently used in state of the art systems of finding probably docking configurations in drug discovery  [14,15]. This same sort of operation is at the heart of our approach to contact area, though we do not use the same approach to defining the “electric fields” and give the operation a very different interpretation. Finally, it bears mentioning that Kazhdan used spherical harmonics to align pairs of 3D models up to a rotation  [16] by cross correlating their surface normals. This technique can be interpreted as a special case of the Laplacian contact area we propose in the later section.

We choose to cast our theory of effective contact measures in the language of bimeasures. The motivation for bimeasures comes from a desire to extend measures from one to many sets. At minimum, a bimeasure satisfies the following definition: 
                           Definition 1

We want to define bimeasures which capture some notion of contact size between a pair of solids. But a bimeasure is a very general type of structure, and so for our goals it is reasonable to impose some additional constraints upon the bimeasures and the class of solids that we will be investigating. Inspired by the ideas of Edalat and Lieutier  [17], we would like to ensure that our functions are computable by convergent sequences of solids, for example in the Hausdorff topology. Hence the following two definitions.

Continuity is a necessary requirement for a bimeasure to be robustly computable  [17]. Without this property, small perturbations in the input shapes can have arbitrarily large effects on the result. The desire for continuity is also the reason why we must look beyond the most naive measures of contact area. In fact one can see that the Hausdorff area of the intersection fails to be continuous from the following simple example. Given two plates which are separated by some finite distance 
                           t
                        , they determine a sequence of solids which converge to a pair of plates that are exactly in contact. For any

                        , the two plates are not in contact and so

                         jumps to the area of the intersection, and so the measure is obviously not continuous.

The fact that the Hausdorff measure of the intersection of two solids is discontinuous is the main technical necessity for pursuing this research. Our proposed solution to this problem is to first replace the measure of the intersection with an integral of indicator functions, and then to apply smoothing that the resulting function is continuous. This smoothing introduces a concept of scale, where coarser scales correspond to more smoothing, while fine values give a sharper measure which in the limit converges to the exact contact area. A side effect of this smoothing is that we recover finite effective contact area in the case where the solids involved are not in strictly contact, that is they might not intersect or their interiors may be slightly overlapping. Formalizing this concept is the basis for our new definition of an effective contact measure,

The parameter 
                           h
                         acts as a scaling variable, which controls the precision to which we are measuring contact area. The main advantage to this definition is that for all positive 
                           h
                        , 
                           
                              
                                 K
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                         is continuous and so in principle we could find efficient algorithms for measuring/computing this quantity. But, it is important to note this definition does not fully constrain the specific type of contact measure, and so there are many valid choices for 
                           
                              
                                 K
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                        . Each of these choices corresponds to a different notion of scale, and thus leads to distinct concepts of effective contact area. In the subsequent sections we will study a few possible constructions, and compare their results.

In addition to continuity, another fairly basic requirement is postulating that our contact measure is preserved under some kind of symmetry:

                        , we can treat the contact measure as purely a function of the relative configuration between the two bodies. That is, we imagine leaving one body fixed and moving the other one by some motion. This motivates us to define the concept of kinematic (effective) contact area:

In practical terms, we would like to calculate this quantity at varying configurations as 
                           S
                         and 
                           T
                         move around. Finding configurations which maximize the contact area intuitively correspond to “good” alignments or tight fits. As a result, in parallel to the analysis of the continuity of our proposed effective measures, we will consider the additional problem of computing 
                           
                              
                                 C

                        .

In summary, we want to find families of continuous 
                        
                           SE
                        
                        
                           (
                           n
                           )
                        
                     -invariant bimeasures which have simple kinematic effective contact areas and converge to the area of the intersection in the limit. As we discussed earlier, these effective contact measures can be interpreted as defining contact area at various scales. Before starting this section, it is advised that the reader skim Appendices A and B to review some of the basic concepts that we will use in the following sections. Appendix A explains that group-invariant volumetric intersection is a continuous bimeasure that may be computed efficiently as a convolution. Appendix B is a standard definition of Minkowski content 
                        M
                      that is commonly used to measure fractal boundaries  [18].

We call the first effective contact measure that we shall consider the parallel intersection. The main idea behind this definition is a modification of the Minkowski content 
                           M
                         as defined in see Appendix B. For solids 
                           S
                         and 
                           T
                         which are in contact, it is true that

This expression is not continuous in 
                           S
                         and 
                           T
                        , but writing the contact area in terms of the Minkowski content is revealing. The underlying problem is that the numerator on the right hand side contains both an intersection and a dilation operator, and that these operations do not distribute. Practically speaking, this means that computing the intersection area is very difficult since we cannot write it as a convolution as we could in the case of intersection volume. However, it does motivate the following definition:

                         In practical terms, this means that we can directly compute the parallel intersection at any finite scale 
                           h
                         by sampling in

                         time, where 
                           n
                         is the number of samples. While parallel intersection volume does represent a practical improvement over the exact contact area, it is by no means a perfect solution. In particular, it has the somewhat undesirable property that, as the penetration depth between the two solids increases, so does the effective contact area. If our goal is to optimize the contact area, this increasing property will push the solids closer together, rather than rolling them along the boundary as we would desire. The reason for this behavior is that parallel intersection considers not only the intersection of the boundaries with themselves, but also the intersection of the boundary with the interior of each set.

One direct way to improve on the previous result is to simply remove the interiors from the measure, which is the basis for our idea of the

                        -boundary measure and is defined as follows:

                         is a normalization constant. In the case of shapes which are in contact, the 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary behaves similarly to the parallel contact area, however it is better behaved for interpenetrating solids.

The 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary is nice in that it does not become arbitrarily large as the solids interpenetrate; however it does not take into account the relative orientations of the surfaces. For example, alignment of interior faces counts equally as the alignment of the boundary when the solids are interpenetrating. A more minor issue is that calculating the dilation with a ball requires an extra

                         denotes the Laplace operator. The motivation for this definition is that we can imagine integrating the point-wise dot product of the surface normals of the two sets over their boundary. This is conceptually similar to the technique in  [16] for aligning meshes via spherical harmonics except we operate in the ambient space instead of on the Gauss map. Eq. (11) arises from smoothing the surface normals by a Gaussian, so that the surface normal can be properly defined

                           ϵ
                        -boundary contact measure, with the additional property that when the surfaces are misaligned it returns a negative value. But the greatest advantage of the Laplacian contact is that its kinematic representation is much simpler,

                         We can simplify this even further by taking a Fourier transform, reducing the Laplacian contact area to a simple Fourier multiplier of the correlation of the shapes.

In summary, we have given three effective contact measures: (i) Parallel intersection, (ii) 
                        ϵ
                     -boundary, and (iii) Laplacian content. It may be instructive to compare these measures in terms of their formal properties to Hausdorff measure of the intersection,

In the rest of this section, we will compare the three effective contact measures empirically, by observing their behavior in typical application scenarios.

To communicate a more intuitive picture of the behavior of the three effective contact measures, consider the following situation. Suppose that we have two unit disks in 
                           
                              
                                 R
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         with centers 
                           t
                         units apart. Then we can consider their effective contact area as a function of this distance 
                           t
                        :

                         where 
                           e
                         is some arbitrary unit vector. Taking various choices for 
                           K
                         then let us compare the contact measures visually at some scale in Fig. 1
                        .

There are several interesting things to note about these plots. At the point 
                           t
                           =
                           0
                         the two balls completely overlap. In the parallel boundary and epsilon contact, the result is that they are completely aligned and so the contact area is proportional to the perimeter of a unit disk, or 
                           2
                           π
                         units, while in the Laplacian contact area we get a negatively oriented result. In general, when 
                           t
                           <
                           1
                         the two spheres are overlapping and at 
                           t
                           >
                           1
                         they are separated. At 
                           t
                           =
                           1
                         the two disks are exactly tangent to one another. While their exact contact area is 0, for finite 
                           h
                         we get an effective contact area that is roughly proportional to 
                           h
                         in all cases, though the exact constant of proportionality varies somewhat.

Finally, it is interesting to observe the effect of 
                           h
                         on the computation. At large 
                           h
                         the contact area is much smoother as a function of distance, while at smaller 
                           h
                         the contact area becomes sharper but also accumulates more noise. This is most obvious in the Laplacian contact measure where integration artifacts appear even at 
                           h
                           =
                           0.0625
                        . The 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary and parallel contact measures fare somewhat better, though they are more expensive to compute. One useful feature of the Laplacian contact is that the important features are generally more localized. As a result, it tends to give better information at larger scales. On the other hand, it is less robust than the other measurements for very fine contacts.

For computing exact contact area at small scales, it seems that the 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary is the best option. Not only does it have reasonably well localized features, but it also gives somewhat stable results in the case of partial interference. The only drawback is that it is slightly more expensive to calculate than the parallel boundary. In the situation where neither shape is interfering, the parallel and 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary measures give identical results, and so the choice of which measure to use is completely arbitrary.

The visual interpretation of the effective contact measures as a function of configuration parameters extends to higher dimensions. For example, in 2D, the plot of field

                           ,

                         coordinate in the image the intensity is proportional to the effective contact area. One main difference is that the parallel boundary grows arbitrarily large when the solids penetrate, while the main difference between the Laplacian and 
                           ϵ
                        -boundary measures is that the Laplacian contact becomes negative when the solids are oriented in an opposite direction.

To compare the role of scale in our proposed measures of contact area, we apply them to a simplified illustration of a multiphase material, Fig. 3
                        . Though this example is synthetic, similar multiphase structures do appear in nature, in systems like trabecular bone or geological specimens.

As shown in Fig. 4
                        , the parallel contact and epsilon boundary give identical results since the interiors of the phases are all disjoint in these examples. For both of these measures, the peak of the contact area between any two phases corresponds roughly to the distance between them. For phases which are initially in contact with smooth boundaries, such as phases 1 and 3, the effective contact area is relatively flat for some time, and begins to taper off after the effective contact area surpasses the reach of the sets. It is also interesting to examine the effective contact area for phases with many small features, such as phase 2. At small scales the effective contact area is very large, while it eventually decreases over time.

The Laplacian contact on the other hand has somewhat different behavior. While on the whole the location of the peaks in the Laplacian contact area are similar to the parallel and epsilon boundaries, they tend to fall off sooner. One interesting feature is that the effective contact area between phases 2 and 3 becomes negative at large scales. This is because phase 2 is more or less homogeneously distributed through phase 3, and so at larger scales it is effectively contained within the outside material. Checking for a similarly shaped peak might be a useful technique to detect a particle phase which is distributed within a material matrix. Another interesting feature is the interaction between phases 3 and 4. At intermediate scales the tiny holes cut out by phase 2 cause it to have a larger effective contact area, while at larger scales these average out and the area eventually stabilizes before ultimately decaying. This spike is not present in the effective contact area between phases 1 and 3 since there is a small gap which is in the order of the hole size and between phases 2 and 1.

Finally, we apply our effective contact measures to the problem of aligning two solids. Following Section  3.3, we consider alignment as finding a configuration which locally maximizes some kinematic effective contact measure. The intuition for this is that if the surface of two solids are aligned, then any small perturbation of their configuration should move them farther apart and thus decrease the contact area. Of course the surfaces themselves may not precisely fit, especially if they are obtained from sampled data and so we must select some value for the scale parameter. The precise choice of this parameter depends on the feature size of the object which is being docked.

Finding an alignment requires a search over the relative configuration space of the pair of bodies. For each of the contact measures proposed, we showed that the kinematic contact area can be computed under translational motion using a Fourier transform. Doing this requires first voxelizing the shapes and then applying the FFT/convolution theorem. Finding the maximum configuration then amounts to a scan over the output signal. In the worst case, the complexity of this operation is 
                        O
                        
                           (
                           n
                           log
                           
                              (
                              n
                              )
                           
                           )
                        
                     , where 
                        n
                      is the number of samples.

To illustrate this method, several different problems were considered. Fig. 5
                      shows the Laplacian contact area between a pair of jigsaw puzzle pieces as a function of their relative translation. Higher values represent greater contact area. As can be seen from the plot, the spike on the right hand side is the greatest contact area value, which also happens to be the configuration corresponding to exactly docking the two pieces together.

However, there are also situations where maximizing contact area does not always give intuitive alignments. For example, in Fig. 6
                     , the maximum contact area configuration is to place the two Lego bricks side by side instead of the snap fit corresponding to placing one on top of the other. The reason for this is that the bottom of the Lego brick is hollow, and so the relative contact area of the snap fit configuration is much lower.

Finally, to illustrate the importance of scale, we take a natural example. The dolphin cranium and mandible  [19] in Fig. 7
                      are first aligned at finer scale, which produces incorrect results. Increasing the scale parameter though allows for the imprecise fit between the teeth of cranium and mandible to become more apparent, and leads to a more accurate fit.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In conclusion, we have introduced the concept of an effective contact measure and shown three different implementations of this idea. Effective contact area represents a novel statistical measurement with an intuitive geometric meaning. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate the relationship between effective contact area and material properties of composites or heterogeneous structures. It seems very probable that the contact area between different microscopic phases could be important in determining the macroscopic physical properties of a complex microstructure. We also showed an application of effective contact area to docking problems and gave a simple FFT based algorithm for solving it. A logical extension of this idea would be to investigate using effective contact area in bin packing or nesting problems.
