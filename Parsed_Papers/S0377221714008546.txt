                  The wheels are one of the most worn components on a train. When the wear is unacceptable, the re-profiling can restore the shape of the wheel flange with the cost of decreasing the wheel diameter. The decision of re-profiling has serious implications for the life span of wheels. In this paper, based on the analysis of the wear and re-profiling characteristics of metro wheels, a data-driven model of the relationship between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain is built for the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. A (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) re-profiling strategy is proposed, where S
                     dP is the wheel flange thickness threshold to trigger a preventive re-profiling and S
                     dR is the wheel flange thickness after the preventive re-profiling. Then the Monte Carlo simulation model of the re-profiling strategy is described in this paper. To find out when a re-profiling should be performed in terms of the flange wear-out level and what values of the flange thickness should be brought to by re-profiling, the simulation results for optimizing the decision variables (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) of the re-profiling strategy are given in this paper. Those having longer life spans are listed as the preferred re-profiling strategies. The study in this paper reveals that the wear rate of the flange thickness is correlated with the flange thickness, while the diameter wear rate could be considered independent of the flange thickness in terms of the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. On the other hand, based on the observation and analysis of an available sample set from Guangzhou Metro Line One, the re-profiling gain is dependent on the flange thickness before or after re-profiling. The preferred re-profiling strategies suggested by this study can increase the life span comparing with the existing re-profiling strategies based on the simulation. The models and methods presented in this paper could benefit both city metro companies and inter-city rail companies by prolonging the life span of rolling stock wheels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

From the very beginning of the 21st century, the railway construction of China has entered a new stage of rapid development. According to the Mid-and-long Term Plan of Railway Network given by the State Council of China in 2008, the mileage of railways in operation will reach over 120,000 kilometers in 2020. Additionally, the urban railways of more than 40 cities in China are being or are yet to be built with a total investment of over RMB 600 billion Yuan (about 96.3 billion dollars). Such rapid growth of rail transportation will require more maintenance optimization techniques of railway systems.

The wheels are one of the most worn components on a train in metro companies (Lu, 2001). The flange and tread deterioration of wheels has serious implications for the safety and comfort of train operation, as well as the life span of rail (Enblom and Berg, 2005; Jendel, 2002). The failure modes of metro wheels include flange wear, tread wear, tread peeling, and tread flats, etc. The maintenance activities of wheels include re-profiling and replacement. Re-profiling can restore the wheel flange thickness when the flange wear is unacceptable with the cost of decreasing the diameter of wheels. Due to the continuous wear, maintenance managers have to inspect wheels frequently and re-profile or replace them if necessary. Thus, the acceptable profiles and diameters of the wheels could be ensured. The maintenance cost of wheels plays a key role in the maintenance expenditure of rail transport (De Arizon et al., 2007). However, a large part of the expenditure in terms of rail wheel maintenance could be avoided. Jiang (2006) concluded that about RMB 319 million Yuan (about 51.2 million dollars) had been wasted due to over re-profiling activities of rail wheels in China in 2006. Therefore, selecting optimal wheel maintenance strategies will not only improve the safety levels of the rail transportation, but also reduce the maintenance cost.

However, little attention has been paid to maintenance strategies of rail wheels in the literature. A few related papers focus on qualitative discussion of optimizing wheel maintenance strategies based on maintenance engineers’ experience. Zhang et al. (2013) presented a new approach in order to optimize re-profiling decisions of worn wheels with the consideration of the relationship between the features of vehicle dynamics and the wheel profile parameters. By simulating the wear of R8T wheels of an ETR500 high speed train with ORES 1002 profiles in Italy, Braghin et al. (2006) found that the useful life of the considered wheels can be doubled if they are re-profiled when the operational mileage reaches 200,000 kilometers. Yuan et al. (2006) proposed the method called Class Lathing for both economical and technical purposes associated with metro wheel maintenance. After analyzing over 1000 wheels of 67 cars in the Northwest corridor of USA, Pascual and Macros (2004) concluded that Talgo wheels should be brought up to 30.5 millimeters when the flange thickness is worn down to 27.5 millimeters in order to minimize the total wheel maintenance cost. These papers mentioned above discussed the optimization problem of wheel maintenance strategies. However, few quantitative modeling and optimization methods have been developed to address this optimization problem. In recent years, the authors made two studies for optimizing re-profiling strategies of the rail wheels based on the wear data-driven models (Wang et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2010). Unfortunately, the diameter difference rules among the different wheels when making re-profiling decisions are neglected in these two studies, which are important considerations in maintenance of rail wheels.

There has been increasing interest in the area of optimizing maintenance strategies over the past decades, e.g. Mercier and Pham (2012),Taghipour and Banjevic (2012). However, although hundreds of papers on maintenance strategies have been published, few application cases have been reported (Frangopol et al., 2004; Pham and Wang, 1996; Scarf, 1997; Wang, 2007a). The main shortcomings of existing maintenance strategies in the literature include two aspects. One is that most existing maintenance strategies focus on single-unit deteriorating systems and time-based preventive maintenance (Wang, 2007a). In practice, the vast majority of manufacturing or transportation systems consist of multiple components that have different deterioration processes. On the other hand, a large proportion of developed optimal maintenance strategies given by operation or statistics researchers are often based on oversimplified assumptions (Dekker, 1996; Dekker and Scarf, 1998; Scarf, 1997). As a result, the application scope of these maintenance strategies is limited.

The aim of this paper is threefold:

                        
                           (1)
                           Based on the wheel wear data provided by Guangzhou Metro Line One in China, develop a data-driven model to formulate the relationship between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain. The data-driven model presented in this paper is an improved version based on the study results of the authors published before in Chinese (see the references of Wang et al. (2011) and Xu et al. (2010)).

Considering eight wheels of one rolling stock, propose a control limit policy for the wheel re-profiling decision, i.e. the (S
                              dP, S
                              dR) strategy, where S
                              dP is the wheel flange thickness threshold of a preventive re-profiling, and S
                              dR is the wheel flange thickness after the preventive re-profiling. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed re-profiling strategy of metro wheels is optimized and the preferred re-profiling strategies are listed.

Illustrate the applicability and necessity of maintenance strategies developed under a case-oriented scheme.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The measured data of wheel wear and the wheel re-profiling are analyzed in Section 2. In Section 3, the data-driven model of the relation between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain is developed. Section 4 describes the re-profiling strategy of metro wheels and its optimization by using Monte Carlo simulation. In Section 5, the simulation results are given. Conclusions are made finally.

The wear of flange and tread is the most important failure mode of metro wheels due to wheel-rail contact. The usage of brake shoes against the tread is another cause that influences the wear of rail wheels, especially the metro wheels that suffer from frequent stops. Usually, the wear of flange and tread is gradual. For example, the average wear rate of the wheel flange thickness on Shanghai Metro Line Three is 0.211 millimeters/10,000 kilometers (Wang, 2007b). As shown in Fig. 1
                     , the diameter of wheels is usually denoted as D, and the flange thickness is denoted as S
                     d 
                     (Ansari and Ashtiyani, 2006). The parameters L1, L2, and L3 are given by the standard of wheel profiles. In normal conditions of rail wheels in most metro or railway companies, the wear rate of the flange thickness is higher than that of the diameter. Both the flange thickness and the diameter decrease in theory during normal use if re-profiling is not implemented. If D is less than a certain threshold, the corresponding wheel has to be replaced. If S
                     d is less than its minimum allowable value, the wheel should be re-profiled as soon as possible. After re-profiling, the wheel profile should be kept standard. Therefore, the wheel diameter is decreased while the flange thickness is increased by re-profiling, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . Other parameters of rail wheel profile are the flange height S
                     h and the flange gradient Q
                     r besides D and S
                     d 
                     (Ansari and Ashtiyani, 2006), as given in Fig. 1. As described in the study of Zeng (2005), the decrease of the flange thickness S
                     d and the diameter D due to wear, as well as the decrease of diameter D due to re-profiling, is critical for the life span of a metro wheel. For the sake of safety and comfort, railway or metro companies have strict rules to limit the parameters of wheel profiles. For example, the rules of the Guangzhou Metro Line One include the followings:

where:

▵D
                     2 is the diameter difference between two wheels on the same axle;

▵D
                     4 is the diameter difference among four wheels on the same bogie;

▵D
                     8 is the diameter difference among eight wheels belonging to the same rolling stock.


Wheel wear is affected by several factors, such as operation lines, speed, load, environment, lubrication, and rail condition. Consequently, although the measured data sequences of S
                     d and D show a decreasing trend generally, they are non-monotonic with random fluctuations, shown in Figs. 3
                      and 4 as examples. Based on the maintenance workers’ experiences of Guangzhou Metro Line One, wheel diameters and flange thicknesses are measured at irregular intervals using the wheel wear measuring gauges. As shown in these two figures, it could be found that the flange thickness S
                     d and the diameter D of wheels generally decrease during use in the case that re-profiling is not implemented. In theory, S
                     d and D should decrease continuously because of continuous wear during wheel use if no replacement or re-profiling is implemented. However, the measured diameter D or the flange thickness S
                     d may increase between two consecutive inspections without re-profiling and replacements of wheels, as shown in Figs. 3
                      and 4. The reason for this phenomenon is that the measured diameter D and the flange thickness S
                     d are not real dimension values, which could be explained as follows:

The “wear rate” of metro wheels, which is calculated from the measured data described in the following paragraphs, is not the real wear rate exactly. It could be called the pseudo wear rate, which may be positive or negative (see Figs. 3 and 4) . For convenience, the pseudo wear rate is directly simplified as the wear rate in the following.

                     d increases, but with the loss of the diameter D. After the replacement, the diameter D increases. In this paper, the re-profiling gain k, also called the turning gain (Pascual and Macros, 2004), is defined as follows:

                     ) could be called the flange thickness gain by re-profiling.

Consequently, there always exists k > 0.

The decisions of wheel re-profiling should balance the recovery of the flange thickness against the loss of the diameter. The thicker the flange after re-profiling, the deeper the tread will need to be cut, and the earlier the wheel will have to be replaced due to the rule of the minimum diameter. On the other hand, the thinner the flange after re-profiling, the earlier the next re-profiling should be conducted. As a result, the number and the cost of re-profiling will increase. Thus, it is demanded to find the optimal decisions to minimize the related maintenance cost or to maximize the wheel life.


As concluded in some literature, the wear rate of rail wheels may be related to their flange thickness. After analyzing the wear rates of over 1000 rail wheels of passenger trains in USA, Pascual and Macros (2004) concluded that the wear of flange is faster when the flange is thicker. On the contrary, based on the numerical simulation and the analysis of the measured data from Tehran Metro, it is reported that the wheel wear rate is increased with the reduction of the flange thickness in the study of Ansari and Ashtiyani (2006). The latter conclusion is in agreement with the empirical observation of Guangzhou Metro maintenance engineers, i.e. the flange wear is faster when the flange is thinner. Thus, it could be found that the relation between the wheel wear rate and the flange thickness is different for different rolling stocks of rail transit. This result is due to the different factors affecting wheel wear including wheel types, load, operation lines, and environment, etc.

As stated above, a standard profile should be kept after a re-profiling for metro wheels. This means that the wheel profiles are independent of diameters D. Therefore, we could consider that wear rates of diameters and flange thicknesses are uncorrelated with diameters D. On the other hand, in the research regarding relationships between wheel wear rates and wheel dimensions, Ansari and Ashtiyani (2006) and Pascual and Macros (2004) did not conclude the dependence of wear rates on wheel diameters. As a result, only the relationship between flange thicknesses and wear rates of wheels is modeled in this paper.

The wheel diameter and the flange thickness are not measured periodically in Guangzhou Metro Line One. Most inspection intervals are from one month to three months. Therefore, 30 days are defined as one time unit in this paper. To calculate the wear rates, the followings could be derived:

To analyze the relationship between the flange thickness S
                        d and the wear rate of wheels,

                                 d
                              
                           
                         and v
                        D in Eqs. (4) and (5) are considered as the wear rates corresponding to the flange thickness (S
                        d, i
                         + S
                        d, i + 1)/2. Consequently, over 2100 wear rates of flange thicknesses or diameters could be calculated. Meanwhile, their corresponding flange thickness values are also obtained. Fig. 6
                         (resp. Fig. 7
                        ) is the scatter plot of v
                        D vs. S
                        d (resp. 
                           
                              v
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                         vs. S
                        d). As shown in these two figures, most of the wear rates v
                        D or 
                           
                              v
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                         are negative. It indicates that the wheel diameters or the flange thicknesses generally decrease when the wheels are in use.


Based on these over 2100 wear rates, the computation results show that the correlation coefficient between v
                        D and S
                        d (resp. 
                           
                              v
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                         and S
                        d) is − 0.05 (resp. 0.1108). Thus, the wear rate of the flange thickness 
                           
                              v
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                         is correlated with the flange thickness S
                        d. The correlation between v
                        D and S
                        d is relatively small. Based on the critical value table of significance levels, the critical correlation coefficient is 0.050763 when the significance level is 0.02. Therefore, it is considered that 
                           
                              v
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                         is correlated with S
                        d, and v
                        D is independent of S

Additionally, the diameter wear rates v
                        D and the flange thickness wear rates 
                           
                              v

                         for the same wheel in the same time period are calculated in order to analyze their correlation, as shown in Fig. 8
                        . Based on more than 600 samples of v
                        D with the corresponding results of

                         the correlation coefficient between v

                         is 0.0067, which is very small. Thus, we consider that v
                        D is independent of

                        Fig. 9
                         is the histogram of the diameter wear rate v
                        D. Being independent of S
                        d, v
                        D could be considered a random variable. Based on this histogram, the normal distribution could be used to describe the distribution of v
                        D. Furthermore, the assumption is verified after testing the normality with the application of the matlab function “lillietest ()”. That is to mean, we could assume that the increments of wheel diameters during one unit time (i.e. 30 days) follow the normal distribution. The PDF of the normal distribution is:

By using the method called Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE), the parameters of the normal distribution could be calculated as μ = −0.1777, σ = 0.4828. Thus, the mean wear rate of wheel diameter is − 0.177 millimeters/30 days.

The wear rate of the flange thickness

                        d according to the above analysis of their correlation. From Fig. 7, it is difficult to find the correlation trend between

                         and S
                        d directly. Because the flange thickness and the diameter are measured with an accuracy of 0.1 millimeters, the interval 26 millimeters ≤ S
                        d ≤ 32 millimeters is divided into the 60 smaller intervals with the equal length 0.1 millimeters, such as 25.95millimeters ≤ S

                        . In Fig. 10, the counts of

                         samples are also accumulated in each smaller interval. From Fig. 10, it could be found that the wear rates of the flange thickness 
                           
                              v

                         are smaller relatively when the flange thickness values S
                        d are near 29 millimeters. Furthermore, the flange thickness wear is faster when the flange thickness S
                        d is less than 28 millimeters or larger than 31 millimeters. On the other hand, a higher count means more confidence of the mean 
                           
                              v

                         value for each smaller interval. Consequently, the quadratic curve fitting method based on weighted least square is utilized for modeling the relation between the mean flange thickness wear rates of each smaller interval and the corresponding flange thicknesses. As shown in Fig. 10, the fitting curve obtained by the Matlab toolbox ‘cftool’ is as follows:

Based on the wear and maintenance data of metro wheels, the 51 samples of the re-profiling gain k are derived, along with their corresponding flange thicknesses before or after re-profiling. It is computed that the correlation coefficient between k and

Additionally, the matlab function “lillietest()” is used to implement the normality test for the random ratio β. The result shows that the hypothesis of its normal distribution cannot be rejected at the 5 percent significance level.


It should be kept in mind that the proposed data-driven model is different from the analytic wheel wear models in the studies of Ansari et al. (2008),Braghin et al. (2002),Braghin et al. (2006),Chang et al. (2008),De Arizon et al. (2007),Enblom and Berg (2005),Ignesti et al. (2012),Magel et al. (2005), and Rovira et al. (2011), which addressed the deterministic and analytic relationship among load, speed, material and wear rates of wheels. Furthermore, as stated in Section 2, the data-driven model is not the modeling of real wear processes for metro wheels. It is only the description of the measured data of wheel diameters and flange thicknesses, which include out-of-roundness errors and artificial measurement errors. On the other hand, it is well known that the rail wheel wear is strongly dependent on the tracks and more especially on their curvatures. Consequently, the calculated model parameters, the derived relationship model between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain above are possibly applied only to Guangzhou Metro Line One. However, the proposed modeling and analyzing method in this section is useful for wheels of other metro lines.

As described previously, the optimal decisions need to be made when wheels should be re-profiled and what values of the flange thickness should be brought up to by re-profiling. On the other hand, the limit rule of diameter differences also need to be considered for metro wheel maintenance, as given in Section 2.

The proposed re-profiling strategy, which is called the (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) re-profiling strategy, is a control limit policy. Additionally, S
                     dP is the flange thickness threshold of preventive re-profiling; and S
                     dR is the flange thickness value after the preventive re-profiling, as shown in Fig. 5. They satisfy 26 millimeters ≤ S
                     dP < S
                     dR ≤ 32 millimeters, which need to be optimized in the re-profiling strategy.

The related assumptions and the possible decisions of the proposed re-profiling strategy for eight wheels of a rolling stock are given as follows:

                        
                           (1)
                           Each wheel is only subject to two deteriorating processes: the flange wear and the diameter wear. Moreover, the eight wheels are identical and s-independent.

The eight wheels are inspected periodically at the discrete time tj

The items are considered as the constraints when optimizing Eq. (14). The Genetic Algorithm with penalty functions is selected for this optimization problem. If a re-profiling is decided, then the

As described previously, in order to balance the gain of flange thicknesses against the loss of diameters and maximize the life span of metro wheels, maintenance engineers in metro companies have to choose appropriate values of S
                     dP and S
                     dR. If the average life cycle EL
                     ∞ is represented as a function of S
                     dP and S
                     dR, i.e. fEL

                     dP, S

Considering the complexity of the re-profiling strategy, it is difficult to deduce the analytical formulation of fEL
                     (S
                     dP, S
                     dR). Consequently, the Monte Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the average life cycle length of wheels, which could be represented as:

For the further description of the Monte Carlo simulation, the flow diagram for the simulation program of the wheel re-profiling strategy is given in Fig. 15
                     . The first step “Initialize the parameters” is to input the parameters j = 0, S
                     d, j, i
                      = 32 millimeters, D
                     
                        j, k

                     Rep = 0, N
                     LC = 0, and we set N
                     CLtotal = 50, which is large enough for evaluating the approximative value of the expected wheel life length. Furthermore, when optimizing the decision of one re-profiling for the eight wheels based on Eq. (14) in the simulation, 
                        
                           
                              w
                              
                                 S
                                 d
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                      and wD
                      = 0 are selected for considering the importance of the flange thickness. The simulation time step is one unit time as shown in Fig. 15, i.e. 30 days.

The re-profiling strategy above is proposed for the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One, the flange thickness and the diameter of which decrease generally if the re-profiling is not implemented. However, the trend of wheel wear could be very different in some other rail lines. For example, a wheel wear study of vehicles operating on the commuter rail network in Stockholm (Jendel, 2002) shows that the flange thickness seems to be constant after 100 thousand kilometers. In such a case, the proposed re-profiling strategy is not suitable.

Based on the data-driven model, the (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) re-profiling strategy with the different decision variables could be simulated by using the Monte Carlo method. The results are shown in Fig. 16
                     . In Fig. 16, the expected life lengths and the expected re-profiling numbers are given for the 78 different (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) re-profiling strategies. The expected re-profiling numbers in Fig. 16(c) may be not integral, indicating the mean number of re-profiling for each re-profiling strategy in a statistically significant way.


In Fig. 16(a), the decision variables S
                     dP and S
                     dR satisfy 26 millimeters ≤ S
                     dP < S
                     dR ≤ 32 millimeters and S
                     dP, S
                     dR ∈ {26, 26.5, 27, 27.5, 28, 28.5, 29, 29.5, 30, 30.5, 31, 31.5, 32 millimeters}. Considering the requirement of analyzing different re-profiling strategies with different combinations of S
                     dP and S
                     dR, these discrete alternatives are enough. Meanwhile, the computational complexity of the MC simulation is acceptable. In Table 1
                     , the preferred re-profiling strategies of metro wheels are also described. Their expected life length are larger comparatively. Zeng (2005) concluded that the real total life length of wheels in Guangzhou Metro Line One would be 67 time units (15,000 kilometers per unit time) approximately if the existing strategy is used always. Therefore, we also calculate the increasing of life length when comparing the preferred re-profiling strategies with the existing strategy, shown as the last column in Table 1.

As seen in Table 1, the preferred re-profiling strategies suggested by this study can increase the life length at least 9 percent. From Fig. 16 and Table 1, it could be found that the best re-profiling strategy is the (S
                     dP = 26 millimeters, S
                     dR = 30 millimeters) strategy with the longest expected life length of 85.46 time units. When S
                     dP ≥ 28.5 millimeters, the corresponding expected life length decreases.

Although the flange wear rates are smaller when 28 millimeters ≤ S
                     d ≤ 31 millimeters as seen in Fig. 10, the preferred re-profiling strategies do not include the (S
                     dP = 28 millimeters, S
                     dR = 31 millimeters) strategy. The reason of this phenomenon lies in the fact that the re-profiling gains are larger if 28 millimeters ≤ S
                     d ≤ 31 millimeters according to the analytical model of the wheel re-profiling gain as Eqs. (10) and (11). It could be concluded that both the wear rates and the re-profiling gain can affect the optimal re-profiling strategy. This finding indicates that the control of re-profiling gains plays a key role in prolonging life length of metro wheels in maintenance activities of rolling stocks.

On the other hand, the result in Fig. 16 shows that the re-profiling numbers are smaller when the flange thickness gains (S
                     dR − S
                     dP) of the corresponding strategies are larger, keeping with the intuition. A bigger re-profiling number decreases the availability of rolling stocks and increases maintenance costs, which may be unacceptable in a busy metro line. The re-profiling numbers of the preferred re-profiling strategies listed in Table 1 are not large. This is good for applying these strategies by maintenance engineers.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this study, the wear and the re-profiling of metro wheels are introduced. Then, the data-driven model of the relation between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain is built after analyzing the correlation among them for Guangzhou Metro Line One. The (S
                     dP, S
                     dR) re-profiling strategy is proposed, and then its Monte Carlo simulation model is described in detail. The simulation results for the different re-profiling strategies are analyzed. Those with longer life lengths are listed as the preferred re-profiling strategies, addressing when a re-profiling should be performed in terms of the flange wear-out level and what values of the flange thickness should be brought to by re-profiling. This study shows the applicability and necessity of maintenance strategies developed under a case-oriented scheme.

Based on the study presented in this paper, the following conclusions could be made:

                        
                           •
                           Considering the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One, the wear rate of the flange thickness is correlated with the flange thickness, and the diameter wear rate could be considered independent of the flange thickness. The flange thickness wear rate is smaller when the corresponding flange thickness is near 29 millimeters. On the other hand, the flange wear is faster when the flange thickness is less than 28 millimeters or larger than 31 millimeters.

The re-profiling gain is dependent on the flange thickness before or after re-profiling based on the analysis of a small number of re-profiling gain samples. The re-profiling gain increases with the increasing of the flange thickness before re-profiling generally, and it decreases with the increasing of the flange thickness gain by re-profiling. The re-profiling gains are not constant in real re-profiling activities, and keeping a small re-profiling gain is very important for prolonging the wheel life.

The best re-profiling strategy is the (S
                              dP = 26 millimeters, S
                              dR = 30 millimeters) strategy with the longest expected life length 85.46 time units (one unit time is 30 days) for the concerned metro rolling stocks. The preferred re-profiling strategies suggested by this study can increase the life length comparing with the existing re-profiling strategy of Guangzhou Metro Line One.

It is possible that the derived data-driven model, the optimized re-profiling strategy and the given relationship between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain in terms of Guangzhou Metro Line One are not suitable for rail wheels of some other metro companies. However, the study in this paper shows a method for optimizing re-profiling strategies of metro wheels with the application of maintenance modeling and optimization methods. We believe that the modeling method and the optimizing procedure presented in this paper are also applicable to both rolling stock wheels of many other city metro companies and inter-city rail companies.

The recommendations for further work include: focusing on re-profiling strategies of wheels for a metro train with six rolling stocks; developing Computerized Re-profiling Management System for rail wheels based on the proposed models and methods; Minimizing maintenance cost of rail wheels by re-profiling modeling and optimization.
