The developed numerical experiments have shown that two of these interpolants are simple curves and that these (at least) have stable shape, in the sense that their topologies persist when the direction of the velocity at each end-point changes. Our curves are fair, but have different shapes to those of other interpolants. Unlike existing methods, our technique allows regular PH interpolants to be found for special collinear

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves introduced by Farouki and Sakkalis (1990) are a special class of polynomial/rational curves with polynomial/rational speed functions. They have polynomial/rational arc-lengths, with rational curvature functions and offsets, which provide a number of advantages in CAGD and CAD/CAM applications such as interpolation of discrete data and control of motion along curved paths (Farouki, 1992; Farouki et al., 1998; Farouki and Neff, 1995).

There has been a great deal of study of PH curves by many researchers, not only of their formal representation (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Choi et al., 2001; Farouki, 1994) but also of practical aspects (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Choi et al., 2001; Farouki, 1994; Farouki and Neff, 1995; Jüttler, 2001; Moon, 1999). In particular, there has been a lot of work on the use of PH curves for interpolating several types of data-sets; planar data-sets (Albrecht and Farouki, 1996; Farouki and Neff, 1995; Jüttler, 2001; Kim et al., 2007; Walton and Meek, 1997) and spatial data-sets (Farouki et al., 2002; Pelosi et al., 2005; Sestini et al., 2013), computational and geometric methods, with particular emphasis on the flexibility and algebraic computability of PH curves (Habib and Sakai, 2007; Kong et al., 2008, 2012).

                      data-set with planar PH curves was first studied by Farouki and Neff (1995). Subsequently, diverse interpolation schemes have been proposed, including: Hermite interpolation using rational PH curves (Pottmann, 1995a, 1995b); Hermite interpolation using the speed reparametrization method (Kong et al., 2008); and Hermite interpolation using Möbius transformations of planar PH cubics (Lee et al., 2012).

                      Hermite data-set, we can obtain four generic simple interpolants, of which two are short and two are long. We can empirically show that the two short simple interpolants, at least, have stable shapes, in the sense that their topologies persist when the direction of the velocity at each end-point is reversed. Further, comparing these interpolants with those obtained by existing methods, we see that they provide different but useful shapes. In addition, we show that, we can obtain regular interpolants for special collinear

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we characterize polynomial PH curves, in the complex representation introduced by Farouki (1994), by the roots of their hodographs. Then we explain some properties of PH curves which we require. In Section 3, we introduce a new class of planar curves in the complex representation, which are cuts of degree 
                        (
                        1

                      of Laurent series; and we state and prove theorems which determine when these curves are Pythagorean hodographs. In Section 4, we solve some

                      Hermite interpolation problems and analyze and discuss the interpolants obtained, comparing them with interpolants produced by other methods. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results and propose some directions for further study.

In this paper, we do not express a planar PH curve as

                        )
                     , but in the complex representation 
                        ϕ
                        (
                        t
                        )
                        =
                        x
                        (

                     . This has many algebraic advantages in computation and allows us to characterize a curve in terms of the roots of its hodograph (Kim et al., 2007) as follows:

                            must have at least one pair of non-real complex roots which are mutually complex-conjugate. This means that

                            has a real factor polynomial. This characteristic is not required to achieve the Pythagorean property, and can increase computational complexity. Hence, in the following sections, we will only use primitive polynomial PH curves to solve interpolation problems and so our interpolants will be regular. Note that all the vectors in our data-sets are expressed as the corresponding complex numbers, i.e., 
                              a
                              +

                              i
                            instead of 
                              (
                              a

                              )

                            is simply a sum of two elementary cuts. Each of there elementary cuts can be completely characterized, whether it is a PH curve or not, by algebraic inspection of its hodograph (Choi et al., 2001). More general cases are not so simple, but some further computation allows us to determine reliably whether a cut is a PH curve or not, as shown in the following theorem.

However, in this case, a PH skew cut interpolant may be obtainable after speed reparametrization (Kong et al., 2008). In the following examples, we solve some interpolation problems for interesting singular

What happens when boundary velocities are parallel but unequal? This situation is similar to that of Example 15, and there may be four regular PH skew cut interpolants, as shown in Fig. 3
                        : two short simple curves and two long simple curves. By comparing Figs. 2 and 3 and Eqs. (19) and (20), we can guess that, as the speeds of parallel boundary velocities converge, while the two long interpolants change to two singular straight-line interpolants, the two short simple interpolants might persist stably. Fig. 4
                         provides empirical support for this conjecture: as the speeds of the parallel boundary velocities converge, the two long simple interpolants expand (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 4), finally appearing to become four straight-lines (Fig. 4(b)), corresponding to the root 
                           c
                           =

                              2
                           
                         of Eq. (20); meanwhile, the two short simple interpolants retain their topologies.

                                       α

                              , PH skew cuts provide alternative interpolants to PH quintic interpolants with shapes that are as good or better. In Fig. 8(a) and (c), we observe that PH quintic interpolants have quite shorter arc-length than PH skew cuts. However we also observe that the direction of the velocity vector of each PH quintic interpolant changes rapidly near the boundary points. This implies large curvatures near the boundary points as shown in Fig. 9
                              (a) and (c), which give high bending energies. Table 1
                               confirms that the PH skew interpolants of

                               have lower bending energies than the PH quintic interpolants.

In Fig. 8(b) and (d), we observe that PH skew cut interpolants resemble the short simple interpolants produced by the Möbius transformation of PH cubics. Their shapes appear to have the same stability as the PH skew cut interpolants, which we attribute to the first term

                                       c
                                    
                                 
                               of a PH skew cut. We surmise that this term creates stability because it produces an inversion in 
                                 C
                              . Table 1 shows that the PH skew cut interpolants have lower bending energies than all the interpolants obtained by the Möbius transformations of PH cubics, except

                              , which is very long, making it unsuitable for many application. Fig. 9(b) and (d) shows that the higher bending energies of Möbius cubics

                               and

                               are also mainly caused by their large curvatures near the boundary points. Thus we contend that PH skew cut interpolants produce well-shaped alternatives to Möbius transformations of PH cubics.

We have introduced a new method of solving

                      Hermite interpolation problems with a class of PH curves in the complex representation, which are called skew cuts of degree 
                        (
                        1
                        ,

                      Hermite data-set: two short simple curves and two long simple curves. We showed that this method allows us to obtain PH skew cuts interpolants for collinear 
                        
                           
                              C

                      Hermite data-sets, unlike other methods based on primitive PH curves. We also demonstrated empirically that the two short simple interpolants, at least, have stable shapes.

We propose two goals for further study. One is to be able to predict what regions in the phase-space of parameters will allow two short simple PH skew cut interpolants to be obtained for a 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                      Hermite data-set, including the complete analysis of the algebraic and topological characteristics of the interpolants. The other is to provide a usable criterion to compare the fairness of the interpolants obtained by different PH methods.
