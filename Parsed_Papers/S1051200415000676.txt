@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Digital circuits and systems take place of analog circuits and systems depending on the development technologies of semiconductor and integrated circuit (IC) techniques. Therefore the significance of digital signals increases compared to analog signals. Also, signals are mostly stored, processed and transmitted digitally due to the advantage of digital methods. As a result of this, applications of digital signals have become an important area of research. The studies which are intended for digital filter design are quite important because the digital filter design is one of the most common applications of digital signal processing. In literature, a digital filter is commonly described as a system that can be used in specified procedure such as modifying, reshaping, or manipulating the frequency spectrum of a signal according to some desired specifications [10]. Depending on the latest developments in computer technology, two dimensional (2D) digital signal processing has become more important. Digital image processing is a special name of the 2D digital signal processing and the one of the most studied topics in the digital image processing is 2D filtering. Consequently, the design approaches of 2D digital filters have attracted quite much attention from practitioners and researchers. The 2D digital filters have found a wide range application in the area of denoising of digital images, image enhancement, seismic and radar signal processing and biomedical image processing. 2D digital filters, like their 1D counterpart, are grouped into two main categories, 2D FIR and 2D IIR digital filters [38,37,30]. The 2D FIR and IIR digital filters are referred to as non-recursive and recursive digital filters, respectively. The 2D FIR digital filter is more stable than the 2D IIR filter and has linear phase response, which is important in applications of image processing and also it is much easier to implement. However, a 2D IIR filter can achieve a sharper frequency response than 2D FIR digital filter with the same order and this advantage makes it more efficient than the 2D FIR filter.

To date, many studies related to adaptive filters have been proposed in research areas, such as biomedical signal and image processing, noise cancellation, antenna array processing, control engineering [41,27,24,22,23,5]. In the last two decades, like 1D adaptive filters, 2D adaptive filters have become a great deal of attention by researchers in literature [39,4]. The 2D adaptive filters have been successively applied in digital image processing area, such as image enhancement, adaptive line enhancer, adaptive noise cancellation and system identification [12,7]. The least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter was firstly modified in order to apply for 2D adaptive filtering [14]. The new two dimensional LMS (TDLMS) algorithm has a simple structure and it is especially useful in image enhancement. But their convergence speed is very slow for filter coefficient matrix optimization. Hence, to overcome the low convergence speed and weakness of the LMS algorithm, the 2D normalized LMS (NLMS) was introduced. Later, in order to improve the performance of the 2D LMS algorithms, the 2D affine projection algorithms (2D APA) was also firstly proposed by Muneyasu and Hinamoto [36]. On the other hand, this improvement is an important trade-off between the computational complexity and the performance. An improved version of the 2D APA algorithm was described by Glentis [13]. This new version reduced the computational complexity compared with the previous version and has a fast convergence speed with good observation capability. The 2D recursive least square (2D RLS) algorithm which is very efficient in many applications was described [39,7]. However, in the 2D RLS algorithm, the computational complexity is quite high. In conventional adaptive filter algorithms, like LMS algorithm, the filter coefficients are fully optimized at each iteration using optimization algorithms. To reduce the computational complexity and improve the convergence speed, the set membership (SM) and selective partial update (SPU) adaptive algorithms have been proposed [11,2]. The NLMS and APA algorithms were modified using the set membership (SM) and the filter coefficients were not updated at each iteration to reduce the computational complexity [45]. The selective partial update (SPU) was combined with the LMS and APA algorithms and the filter coefficients were partially optimized during the adaptation [44,1,35].

In recent years, the evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algorithms have been widely used in the design approaches of non-adaptive 2D FIR digital filters [42,43,46,9,33,34,29,40]. For instance, Tzeng [43] introduced an effective genetic algorithm as the design approach of 2D FIR digital filter with specified magnitude and group delay responses. Boudjelaba et al. [9] described a comparative study of evolutionary algorithms for the design approach of 2D FIR digital filter. Manuel et al. [34] developed an approach based on the gravitational search algorithm for the design of 2D FIR digital filter. Latifoglu [29] proposed a novel filtering approach based on artificial bee colony algorithm and used it to remove speckle noise on noisy medical images. Sarangi et al. [40] designed 1D and 2D recursive filters using crossover bacterial foraging and Cuckoo search techniques. However, in the last three decades, one dimensional (1D) adaptive filter algorithms were adapted to 2D signal processing applications, such as system identification and image enhancement [14,36,3,7,4]. The proposed adaptive filter algorithms extended the 1D structure forms to 2D structure forms and so, the filter coefficients were easily updated horizontally and vertically on 2D plane directions. In literature, LMS, NLMS, RI, RLS and APA algorithms are the most studied and compared 2D adaptive filter algorithms. In this paper, a novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was suggested and to the best of our knowledge, there is no study describing 2D adaptive filter algorithm based on metaheuristic algorithms in the literature.

The artificial bee colony (ABC), which is a new and simple swarm intelligence based algorithm, can be easily implemented to solve optimization problems. ABC has efficient global optimization and quick local convergence abilities. Therefore, it seems to be a convenient tool to optimize digital filters. ABC simulates the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bees [15]. In order to solve various problems in different areas from the noise elimination to the parameter determination, the ABC algorithm has been used [20,19,21–23,31,28,6]. Also, lately, the ABC algorithm has been used to optimize the addressed problems in image enhancement and image segmentation [32,26,29,25,8].

The paper described in Kockanat et al. [26] presents an image denoising approach with designed 2D FIR filter using ABC algorithm. In that work, the test images were corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean and 0.025 variance. It is said that the images were a little contaminated and the Gaussian noise can be easily filtering. The order of the 2D FIR filter was set to 
                        3
                        ×
                        3
                     . The proposed approach has not an adaptive structure and it cannot work for the non-stationary conditions. Moreover, it was not compared with another algorithm or method. In the present work, at the first stage, it is aimed to describe a novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm to optimize the 2D adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) setup as suggested in literature and to analyze its performance and computational efficiency in detail by comparing with the well-known and accepted 2D adaptive filtering techniques such as the 2D-VSS-APA, 2D-APA, 2D-SPU-APA, 2D-SM-NLMS, 2D-SM-APA, 2D-VSS-NLMS, 2D-SPU-NLMS, 2D-NLMS and 2D-LMS adaptive filter algorithms [4]. Moreover, in order to make a fairly comparison, the novel 2D-ABC and all competitor 2D adaptive filter algorithms were implemented to the same and suggested 2D ANC setup under same conditions. The 2D ANC setup was suggested and used by Hadhoud and Thomas [14], Abadi and Nikbakth [3] and Abadi and Nikbakth Aali [4], respectively. In this 2D ANC setup, the reference noise signal is generated by passing the white Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance through the 2D lowpass filter and the coefficients of the 2D lowpass filter were determined as recommend in [4]. So, the reference signal is very different from the Gaussian noise, but they are correlated with each other. However, for the 2D ANC setup, there is a conflict. In real application, the 2D-ANC setup may be not work because of the unavailability of the reference noise signal. On the other hand, the 2D ANC setup can be a good testing application for the performance evaluation of 2D adaptive filter algorithms and in this paper, it was only used for a fairly comparison of the 2D-ABC and competitor adaptive filter algorithms under the same conditions as suggested in [4]. Furthermore, in this work, the test images were corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance and the PSNR values of them were set to 0 dB. It can be say that the Gaussian noise is plenty of dominant on the test images and the denoising process is not easy under this worst condition. Also, the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm has an adaptive structure and its robustness is very strong under both the stationary and non-stationary conditions. And, to examine the effect of the 2D FIR filter orders on the performance, the orders were determined as

                        ×
                        3
                     , 
                        5
                        ×
                        5
                     , 
                        7
                        ×
                        7
                     , 
                        9
                        ×
                        9
                      and 
                        11
                        ×
                        11
                     . At the second stage, the 2D ANC setup at the first stage was developed and an improved adaptive denoising approach was suggested. In this approach, different from the suggested 2D ANC setup in literature, there is no need a reference noise signal and only the noisy signal was used. So, the improved adaptive denoising approach can be used in real application. The novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was employed in this improved adaptive denoising approach and it was tested for speckle noise filtering on clinical ultrasound test images. Finally, the results of the improved adaptive denoising approach using the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm were compared with the other adaptive filter algorithms, methods and other well-known noise reduction filter types such as wiener and median filters. The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the preliminaries. In Section 3, the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is described. The results of the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 gives the conclusions.

A 2D digital filter is designed with regard to linearity of phase response because the human eye is very sensitive to the phase distortion. Therefore, linear systems and their phase responses have a great importance in digital image processing applications. 2D FIR digital filter is a kind of linear systems and has linear phase response. Also, 2D FIR digital filter is realized efficiently by software or hardware and it is always stable. Computational complexity and coefficient quantization errors are reduced by using 2D FIR digital filter [3,7,29,4]. The 2D FIR digital filter is defined by

Gaussian noise is the most widely known noise model in literature. It is a statistical noise which has Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian noise is additive and an idealized form of white noise that is caused by random fluctuations in the signal. An original signal is corrupted by Gaussian noise and the generated noisy signal is defined as

The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a new swarm intelligence algorithm which is based on the foraging behavior of honey bee swarms. In the ABC algorithm, the foraging honey bees are grouped into three categories; employed bees, onlookers and scout bees. The employed bees exploit their food sources and interact with onlooker bees. Onlooker bees wait in the hive and decide which food source to exploit depending on the information gathered from the employed bees. Scout bees carry out random searches for new food sources around the hive. The number of the employed bees or the onlooker bees is equal to the number of solutions. The position of a food source represents a possible solution to the optimization problem and the nectar amount of a food source corresponds to the fitness of a solution [17]. The employed bees interact about the food sources with onlookers by dancing in the dance area inside the hive. The nature of the dance that is called waggle dance is proportional to the nectar amount of the food source. Onlooker bees watch the dances performed by the employed bees and choose a food source according to the probability which is proportional to the profitability of that food source. Thus, rich food sources draw more attention of onlooker bees as compared to other food sources. When a food source is exploited fully, by its employed bee associated with it and onlooker bees then, the food source is abandoned and its employed bee becomes scout. Scout bees can be visualized as performing the job of exploration, whereas employed and onlooker bees can be visualized as performing the job of exploitation.

The ABC algorithm was introduced by Karaboga and it simulates the intelligent foraging behavior of real honey bees [15]. The performance of the ABC algorithm has been compared with that of some other well-known population based optimization algorithms by Basturk and Karaboga [16,17]. In our approach, the ABC algorithm is combined with 2D adaptive filtering algorithm and the proposed 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm optimizes the weight matrix of 2D FIR digital filter. In Eqs. (2) and (3), the weight matrix and 2D input signal can be converted into their 1D form by lexicographic ordering [14]. The lexicographic forms of the weight matrix and 2D input signal are represented as

                      where E is the expected error value. The 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm iteratively minimizes the value of objective function and the weight matrix, which is represented in Eq. (10), is optimized as much as possible. So, the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm estimates the signal, or eliminates noise, by iteratively minimizing the objective function defined based on the difference between the desired and output signals.

The pseudo-code of the 2D-ABC adaptive algorithm is given below:
                        
                           
                              Step 1: Convert the weight matrix and input signal into their 1D lexicographic form.

The 2D adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the most studied problems in image enhancement applications. The 2D ANC is a process of removing noise from a noisy signal and a key problem of filter design. Fig. 1
                         shows the block diagram of the 2D ANC setup. The block diagram of the 2D ANC setup has been frequently used in literature [14,3,4]. As shown in Fig. 1, the original image

                        . In the simulation of the 2D ANC setup, four test images were used and they are known in literature as Pot, Simpson, Part and Cameraman, respectively. In Fig. 2
                        , the test images are shown. The test images were corrupted by Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit variance and they are

                           ×
                           256
                         pixels. Also, the order of the 2D adaptive FIR filter was determined as 
                           M
                           =
                           N

                         shows the corrupted test images and the PSNR values of them were set to 0 dB.

At the first stage, the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was applied to the 2D ANC setup for Gaussian noise elimination on all corrupted test images. The colony size (CS) and limit are the basic control parameters of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm. The control parameter values of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm have a major effect on its performance. Therefore, the control parameter values recommend in the literature were employed for 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm [17,18]. The values of colony size (CS) and limit were determined experimentally to be 50 and 625

                         is the number of parameters of the problem to be optimized. The stopping criteria is equivalent to the maximum cycle number and it was taken as 5000. The initial values of the parameters have been generated randomly from the interval 
                           (
                           −

                           )
                         and the algorithm was run 20 times with different random seeds. The simulation was processed in a personal computer with the following specification using MATLAB: Intel Pentium Core2 Duo T7500 2.2 G CPU, 2048 MB RAM.


                        Table 1
                         shows the values of the performance indicator parameters after 20 independent runs by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm. As seen in Table 1, mean values and standard deviations of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is very low and inversely PSNR and SSIM values are significantly high for all test images. It is also shown that the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is stable for independent runs and PSNR and SSIM values are assessable.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the convergence characteristics of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm for the Pot, Part, Simpson and Cameraman images. For all test images, the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm convergences quickly and the MSE values approach to zero at the 200th iteration. So, rapid convergence skill brings a valuable computational efficiency to 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the restored test images obtained by the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm. The PSNR values of the Cameraman, Simpson, Part and Pot images are 24.88, 28.12, 28.90 and 24.80 dB and the MSE values of them are 0.0033, 0.0015, 0.0013 and 0.0033, respectively. Also, the SSIM values are 0.5191, 0.5519, 0.5304 and 0.6011, respectively. As seen in restored test images, the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm could successfully remove the Gaussian noise from the noisy images and they seem smoothly and free from noise.

In Table 2
                        , the output PSNR performance of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was compared with those of the 2D-VSS-APA, 2D-APA, 2D-SPU-APA, 2D-SM-NLMS, 2D-SM-APA, 2D-VSS-NLMS, 2D-SPU-NLMS, 2D-NLMS, 2D-LMS adaptive and 2D-nonadaptive ABC filter algorithms using 2D-ANC setup for the all noisy test images. The best PSNR values are shown in bold. As seen in Table 2, the output PSNR values of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm are higher than those of the other algorithms. The worst output PSNR values were achieved by 2D-nonadaptive ABC algorithm because of its nonadaptive algorithm structure.


                        Fig. 6
                         shows the restored Simpson images obtained by 2D-ABC, 2D-LMS, 2D-NLMS, 2D-APA and 2D-VSS-APA adaptive filter algorithm. The results show that the restored output image of 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm has better performance than the other algorithms. Also, it is shown smoother than the others and is not much blurred in the presence of high Gaussian noise variance in terms of visibility. On the other hand, the high PSNR value of its proved the image quality.

Moreover, in order to analyze the performance effect of the 2D FIR filter order on the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm, the orders were taken as 
                           3
                           ×
                           3
                        , 
                           5
                           ×
                           5
                        , 
                           7
                           ×
                           7
                        , 
                           9
                           ×
                           9
                         and 
                           11
                           ×
                           11
                        . In Table 3
                        , the output PSNR values of the test images are shown for varying filter orders. The best results were achieved for the 
                           3
                           ×
                           3
                         filter order in all test images. As seen these results, by decreasing the order of the 2D FIR filter, the output PSNR values of the test images increase.

In Table 4
                        , the executing time of all competitor algorithms are shown for the 2D ANC setup using Simpson test image [3]. The 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm has a longer executing time compared with the other algorithms. But, this disadvantage in the computational efficiency is balanced with the high output image quality for all test images.

The PSNR and SSIM values play an important role in the measuring of the image quality index between original and restored images and they are significant criteria to compare the similarity and quality of two images. The higher output PSNR and SSIM values present the robustness and quality of any proposed system or method. By increasing the PSNR values, the image quality increases and by increasing the SSIM values, the similarity increases between two images.

In order to justify the performance and robustness of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm, it is performed in different input PSNR values. So, the noisy images with different PSNR values were used and the output performance of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was analyzed. Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         show the output PSNR and SSIM values for different input PSNR values using 2D-ABC, 2D-LMS and 2D-NLMS adaptive filter algorithm for Cameraman and Part images, respectively. From these two figures, by increasing the input PSNR values, the output PSNR and SSIM values increase. Also, the performance of 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is better than that of the other classical algorithms and its robustness is well according to varying input PSNR values. So, the efficiency of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was demonstrated for different test images or changing noise conditions.

In Table 5
                        , the comparison of the output PSNR and SSIM values before and after denoising process obtained by the 2D-ABC, 2D-LMS and 2D-NLMS adaptive filter algorithms is shown. From this table, the results of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm present a good performance in terms of achieving the best PSNR and SSIM values for all test images. The highest output PSNR values show a good image quality for all test images and the highest SSIM values demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm with respect to the structural similarity between denoised and original test images.

The results show that the novel 2D-ABC adaptive algorithm has a good performance and its efficiency and accuracy is quite well compared with the other algorithms for changing circumstances. On the other hand, the execution time of the 2D-ABC adaptive algorithm is longer than those of the others but it is a trade-off between good denoising results and computational efficiency within acceptable limits.

Briefly, at the first step, the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was used to remove Gaussian noise on noisy test images using the 2D ANC setup in literature. Then, the performance of it was compared with those of the well-known classical adaptive filter algorithms. But, there is a main problem. For the 2D ANC setup in literature, it cannot work in real application because of the unavailability of the reference noise signal. So, there is a lack of practical implementation. At the second step, in order to address the lack of the practical implementation of the 2D ANC setup in literature, an improved adaptive denoising approach was suggested. In this approach, only noisy image was used different from the 2D ANC setup and the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was modified to this improved approach.

                        , the improved adaptive denoising approach is presented. Here, in order to remove noise from noisy image, only

                         noisy image is firstly passed through mean filter, then the obtained signal is applied to the 2D FIR filter input. 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm minimizes the filter coefficients and the output image is achieved by filtering input image. At last, the filter output is subtracted from noisy image and denoised image is achieved.

Ultrasound imaging is a popular diagnosis method for imaging human organs in medical treatment. The medical devices, which is easily and cheaply achieved the ultrasound images of the patients, can be affected by Speckle noise and Speckle noise is a nuisance problem that should be overcome for ultrasound imaging.

In this simulation, clinical ultrasound test images were used and corrupted by Speckle noise with unit variance and the efficiency of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was examined for speckle noise filtering using different test images. Fig. 10
                         shows the original clinical ultrasound test images. They are degraded by Speckle noise with unit variance and can be expressed by Eq. (9). In Fig. 11
                        , the noisy clinical ultrasound images are presented. They are 
                           256
                           ×
                           256
                         pixels and the PSNR values of them were set to 12.82 and 14.14 dB, respectively. The basic control parameters of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm are determined as previous section.

The 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithms was adapted to improved adaptive denoising approach and its performance was compared with those of the 2D-LMS and 2D-NLMS adaptive filter algorithms, Wiener filter, Median filter and ABC method [29]. Tables 6 and 7
                        
                         show the output PNSR and SSIM values of the competitor algorithm before and after denoising process. As seen in Table 6, before denoising process, the PSNR values of fetal and testicle images are 12.82 and 14.11 dB, respectively. After denoising process, the best output PSNR values of denoised images are obtained by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm and they are 27.25 and 28.81 dB for fetal and testicle images, respectively. So, they are more preferable than those of the others. From Table 7, the SSIM values of the test images are rise by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm from 0.08 up to 0.63 for fetal image and from 0.17 up to 0.80 for testicle image. So, the similarity increases between the original and denoised images after denoising.


                        Figs. 12 and 13
                        
                         show the denoised clinical ultrasound images obtained by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm, ABC method [29], 2D-LMS, 2D-NLMS, Wiener filter and Median filter. As seen in Figs. 12 and 13, the restored images obtained by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithms have more preserved edges and are not much blurred even in the worst condition in terms of visibility. The worst condition denotes the clinical ultrasound images are corrupted by Speckle noise with unit variance and even under this condition, the output PSNR and SSIM values of the denoised images obtained by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is highly satisfactory for the improved adaptive denoising approach. Also, the highest output PSNR and SSIM values demonstrate the well image quality before and after denoising process.

Finally, according to Tables 6 and 7, the obtained output PSNR and SSIM values by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm are higher than those of the others methods in literature. For example, the output PSNR and SSIM values obtained by 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm are 27.25 dB and 0.63 for fetal image. These metrics are obtained from the ABC method [29] as 22.51 dB and 0.60, from 2D-LMS as 21.23 dB and 0.43, from 2D-LMS as 22.20 dB and 0.47, from Wiener filter as 17.56 dB and 0.35 and finally from Median filter 16.94 dB and 0.21. From these results, the improved adaptive denoising approach and novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm is very effective in Speckle noise cancellation.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was adapted to the 2D adaptive filtering and a novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was firstly proposed in literature. The novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm has a unique place in terms of describing 2D adaptive filter algorithm based on metaheuristic algorithms. In order to demonstrate the efficiency and the performance of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm, it was firstly applied to the 2D-ANC setup for image noise filtering. To make a fairly comparison, all conditions were determined as recommend in literature. The performance of the 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithms was compared with those of the other classical algorithms. The input and output PSNR and SSIM values were calculated to measure the image quality between the denoised and original test images. The results show that the best output PSNR and SSIM values were obtained by using 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm. Also, the effect of the 2D FIR filter order was analyzed for varying filter orders. Then, 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was employed for Speckle noise reduction using the improved adaptive denoising approach and its denoising ability was compared with those of the 2D-LMS and 2D-NLMS adaptive filter algorithms, Wiener filter, Median filter and ABC method [29]. So, the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm was tested for different noise reduction applications and it gives good results compared with the other competitor algorithms. Also, the improved adaptive denoising approach was successfully worked for Speckle noise filtering using the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm and its greatest advantage is that there is no need a complex transform or method, such as wavelet or Fourier domain transform, adaptive or non-adaptive thresholding methods or fuzzy based algorithms. As a result, both the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm and improved adaptive denoising approach bring a valuable innovation to 2D signal processing applications.

As a future study, we intend to combine the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm with set-membership (SM) and selective partial update (SPU) approaches for achieving low computational complexity and short execution time. Also, not only will be used the novel 2D-ABC adaptive filter algorithm for image denoising applications but also for widespread applications in 2D signal processing, such as adaptive line enhancement or channel estimation.
