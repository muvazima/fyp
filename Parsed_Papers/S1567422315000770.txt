               Abstract
               
                  Mobile health (mHealth) services have gained increasing attention in recent years; however, few studies have focused on the manner in which customers’ attributes affect acceptance behavior, for instance, personal privacy concerns and personalization concerns; with even fewer studies on the effects on different age groups. To fill this research gap, our research has developed an attribute–perception–intention model, using the privacy–personalization paradox factors as independent variables that affect mHealth acceptance intention, with trust as a mediator. The age differences of participants were then examined. A survey of 650 subjects in China was conducted to test the proposed research model and hypotheses. The results show the following key findings: (1) perceived personalization and privacy concerns are positively and negatively associated with behavior intention; (2) trust mediates the relationships between perceived personalization, privacy concerns and behavior intention; and (3) age differences are examined in the model, which in this respect differ from previous technology acceptance research. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.
