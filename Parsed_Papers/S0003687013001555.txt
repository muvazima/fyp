                  Huge areas of work are still done manually and require the usages of different powered and non-powered hand tools. In order to increase the user performance, satisfaction, and lower the risk of acute and cumulative trauma disorders, several researchers have investigated the sizes and shapes of tool-handles. However, only a few authors have investigated tool-handles' materials for further optimising them. Therefore, as presented in this paper, we have utilised a finite-element method for simulating human fingertip whilst grasping tool-handles. We modelled and simulated steel and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber as homogeneous tool-handle materials and two composites consisting of EPDM rubber and EPDM foam, and also EPDM rubber and PU foam. The simulated finger force was set to obtain characteristic contact pressures of 20 kPa, 40 kPa, 80 kPa, and 100 kPa. Numerical tests have shown that EPDM rubber lowers the contact pressure just slightly. On the other hand, both composites showed significant reduction in contact pressure that could lower the risks of acute and cumulative trauma disorders which are pressure-dependent. Based on the results, it is also evident that a composite containing PU foam with a more evident and flat plateau deformed less at lower strain rates and deformed more when the plateau was reached, in comparison to the composite with EPDM foam. It was shown that hyper-elastic foam materials, which take into account the non-linear behaviour of fingertip soft tissue, can lower the contact pressure whilst maintaining low deformation rate of the tool-handle material for maintaining sufficient rate of stability of the hand tool in the hands. Lower contact pressure also lowers the risk of acute and cumulative trauma disorders, and increases comfort whilst maintaining performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A significant part of manual work is still done using hand-tools, therefore a correct design is crucial for preventing upper extremity acute trauma disorders (ATD) and cumulative trauma disorders (CTD), such as blisters, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand-arm vibration syndrome, tendonitis, etc (Moore et al., 1991). When considering the ergonomics of the hand-tool, besides its main functionality, the most important aspect is the tool's handle. It has been shown, that a correctly designed handle can provide safety, comfort, and increased performance (Eksioglu, 2004). The broad variety of powered and non-powered hand-tools seems to have blunted the desires of many authors to research the topic of tool-handle design. They have provided guidelines and mathematical models for determining the sizes and shapes of the handles in order to maximize finger-force exertion, comfort, contact area, thus minimizing the chanced of ATD and CTD (Garneau and Parkinson, 2011; Kong and Lowe, 2005; Oh and Radwin, 1993; Seo and Armstrong, 2008). It has been shown that ATD and CTD, which are caused by badly designed hand-tools, account for about one third of workers' sick leaves, resulting in workers' compensations claims (Punnett and Wegman, 2004; Tanaka et al., 1997, 1995).

Several researchers have paid a lot of attention to hand-tools in terms of perceived discomfort/comfort, since it is strongly correlated with user performance (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). Comfort is affected by physical, physiological, and psychological factors, and is subjectively defined by feelings, which differs from subject to subject (De Looze et al., 2003). Therefore designers have to optimize the human/product interaction in order to reduce the discomfort (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). The feeling of discomfort whilst using a hand-tool can reduce the efficiency of the task, and user's satisfaction. The reduction of discomfort is mainly possible by optimising the functionality of the hand-tool, and the physical interaction between the hand and the handle. It has been also shown that great correlation exists between physical and psychophysical properties of the materials which are in touch by the users (Wongsriruksa et al., 2012).

Most authors have focused on the sizes and the shapes of the tool-handles, but neglected those materials of the handles that are in direct contact with the user's hand. It has been shown that successful choice of product material is critical for success of the whole product on the market (Ljungberg and Edwards, 2003). Authors provided basic guidelines regarding the material choice, but did not investigate and consider the mechanical behaviour of the skin and soft tissue whilst grasping handles of different materials.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue are highly complex structures, therefore their material properties are hard to measure and define. The mechanical properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue have been extensively investigated by many researchers (Clark et al., 1996; Edwards and Marks, 1995; Pan et al., 1998; Wan Abas, 1994; Wilhelmi et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2007a; Zheng and Mak, 1996). It has been shown, that skin and subcutaneous tissue have non-linear viscoelastic properties, where the skin is stiffer than the subcutaneous tissue. Both have low stiffness regions at small strains followed by a substantial increase in the stiffness when the strain increases. Brand and Hollisters' (1999) rough guidelines are provided for the maximum suggested pressure versus time application over bony prominences. The recommended guidelines are for designing medical splints, but can also be used for designing and analysing hand-tools. It has been shown that higher contact pressures than allowed for a specific time can result in discomfort, pain, and ischemia which can lead to ATD and CTD. A power grasp can yield a contact pressure of the fingertip of 80 kPa or over, which is excessive loading for skin and subcutaneous tissue (Gurram et al., 1995). It has been shown that hand-tools which require high grip, push, pull or torque exertion on the handle produce high contact pressures, which is known to be one of the primary factors for the development of ATD and also CTD (Eksioglu, 2004; Radwin et al., 1987; Rempel et al., 1992; Riedel, 1995). However some authors have argued that higher contact area can lower the subjective comfort rating, since higher contact area triggers more pressure sensors in the soft tissue (Goonetilleke and Eng, 1994; Xiong et al., 2011). Therefore the designer has to find the optimal contact area which can increase the subjective comfort rating and lower the risk of ATD and CTD which are contact pressure induced. Aldien et al. (2005) provided rough guidelines of pressure discomfort (PDT) and also pressure-pain threshold (PPT), where PPT is higher than PDT and values differ by the area of the hand. Also different subjects reported different values due to subjective perception of the load on the hand. The PDT limit of 188 kPa has been reported by Aldien et al. (2005), however Fransson-Hall and Kilbom (1993) estimated the value as 104 kPa. In order to maintain the desired user performance, the designer has to design tool-handles, which distributes contact pressure more evenly and do not exceed the PDT limits (Aldien et al., 2005). According to finite element simulations performed in by Wu and Dong (2005), it has been shown, that the surface curvature has a big influence on the resulting contact pressure on the fingertip when in contact with an object. Those objects that follow the shape of the hand and the skin's surface result in much lower contact pressures and local deformations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, which can prevent discomfort and several disorders.

A power grasp-produces a very uneven distribution of forces and, therefore, also pressure on the hand and fingers. Fellows and Freivalds (1991) showed that foam rubber grip can be used to provide more uniform distribution of forces and pressures. Due to the deformations of the foam rubber, the test subject applied higher grip forces to the foam rubber grips than those grips of stiff materials. This can be attributed to the fact that the excessive deformation of the foam whilst gripping the handle can produce a “loss of control feeling”. This effect can be attributed to the used thick foam of 4 mm in this study, which most likely allowed excessive deformation whilst gripping the tool handle. The authors also do not provide any material properties of the foam tool handle material. Despite the finger forces were higher, the subjects preferred the foam rubber grips.

Finite element (FE) method is computationally intensive and in terms of decision-making a very challenging method that is used to predict the behaviour of observed structure (continuum) considering particular load and boundary conditions (Dolšak and Novak, 2011). It can be used for a wide range of simulations from common structural problems to more specific problems, such as for example the analysis of a tool wear in manufacturing process, simulating additive manufacturing technology, welding, etc. (Deng et al., 2013; Edwin Raja Dhas and Somasundaram, 2013; Tamizharasan and Kumar, 2012). FE method has also been used many times to successfully model, compare and evaluate material choice in the design phase of a product (Novak, 2012). Deformations and stresses that represent basic results of the structural analysis using FE method are also an important aspect in the field of ergonomics. Many authors have shown that composites can be successfully simulated in order to define appropriate material and product design especially in the safety industry (Coelho et al., 2013).

Therefore due to the lack of investigation into the choices of materials regarding tool-handles and their potential to increase comfort rating, user performance, and lower the risk of pressure dependent ATD and CTD, we investigated the mechanical contact interaction between a fingertip and composites of rubber and hyper-elastic foam materials using the FE method, and compared them to the traditional materials used in tool-handle design. We modelled the cross-section of a male human fingertip and simulated a contact using various hyper-elastic foams and rubber materials. Based on the findings from FE analysis, material parameters for tool-handle grips are proposed in this paper. Therefore tool-handles with material properties defined based on fingertip grip simulation can lower the contact pressure and thereby also the risk of pressure dependant ATD and CTD. Additionally, the methods allow the designer to set the material parameters to reach the desired rate of the stability while grasping the tool-handle.

@&#METHODS@&#

In our study a modern finite element simulation software Abaqus/CAE 6.10 from Dassault Systems (France) was used, which has proven to be a reliable FEA software for simulating human tissue behaviour under mechanical stresses (Wu and Dong, 2005; Wu et al., 2002, 2007b). We modelled a two dimensional fingertip section with material parameters defined by previous authors. Tool-handle is modelled as a two dimensional section of a tool-handle and is represented by a rectangle with corresponding material parameters. A concentrated force on the centre of the bone was applied to simulate the finger force while grasping a tool-handle. Numerical tests using predefined forces were performed to produce characteristic contact pressures. For each numerical test we observed the contact pressure distribution at the contact line and also the fingertip and tool handle deformation. Used geometrical and boundary conditions, material parameters and performed numerical tests are further discussed in following sub-sections.

The FE model was constructed based on existing fingertip FE models (Wu and Dong, 2005; Wu et al., 2002, 2006, 2007b). The dimensions were used of an average male's index fingertip (Brand and Hollister, 1999). Anthropometric dimensions can vary from person to person, therefore an elliptical cross-section of the fingertip and the bone was assumed. For simulations using steel and EPDM rubber as homogeneous tool-handle material, a flat rectangle was modelled. For simulations using both composites the rectangle was modelled as a flat rectangle with two sections using the EPDM rubber and corresponding foam (Fig. 1
                        ).

The displacements and rotations of the rectangle representing the tool-handle were fixed on the lower contour. The displacement and rotations of the fingertip were fixed, except for the displacement along the vertical axis. The load was applied on the vertical top point of the finger bone and is directed normal to the tool handle material surface. We simulated a quasi-static FE problem and concentrated on the contact pressures reduction, therefore we account only for normal stress.

The fingertip and the tool-handle material are meshed using 5149 and 1920 CPE8 elements, respectively. CPE8 elements are eight node plane strain element for general purpose where displacement in z-axis is zero. These elements allow reasonable simplification of simulation cases where the sections in z axis do not vary too much.

Fingertip bone and nail were assumed to be linear elastic with isotropic material parameters with Young's modulus of 17 GPa and 170 MPa respectively, and with a Poisson ratio of 0.3 (Wu et al., 2002).

Skin and subcutaneous tissue are more complex and have non-linear viscoelastic properties. The material parameters were extracted from a uniaxial tensile test, and were fitted to the Ogden hyper-elastic material model and are provided in Appendix in Tables A1 and A2 (Ali et al., 2010; Pan et al., 1998). Since skin and subcutaneous tissue are almost incompressible, the Poisson ratio was determined to be 0.4 (Wu et al., 2002).

For the tool-handle material we used ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM). The material parameters were extracted from an uniaxial tensile test, and were fitted to the Ogden hyper-elastic material model an can be seen in Appendix (Table A3) (Ali et al., 2010; Song et al., 2004). The Poisson ratio was set to 0.45, which represents almost incompressible material. In order to compare the results with an almost rigid material, we also used steel as a tool-handle material using Young's modulus of 210 Gpa and a Poisson ratio of 0.3. Since steel is vastly more rigid than soft tissue, we assume steel as a rigid material in our simulations.

In order to simulate the mechanical behaviour of a finger, we used and modelled two composites using EPDM rubber as outer material and EPDM Foam and Poly-urethane (PU) Foam as the inner material. Based on the mechanical behaviour of skin and subcutaneous tissue, we chose two foam materials with different elastic cellular behaviour. The EPDM Foam has a lower plateau with a steeper stress strain curve, whilst PU foam has a higher plateau and a flatter stress strain curve. Based on the behaviour of skin and subcutaneous tissue, we used foam materials with plateau of about 10–20 kPa. The uniaxial test data for the EPDM foam were derived from authors Wang et al. (2007) and for PU Foam from Zhang et al. (1998) (Fig. 2
                        ).

In our simulations we considered four different material combinations for the tool-handle. In the first simulation we used steel as a homogeneous material, in the second we used EPDM rubber as a homogeneous material, in the third we used a composite consisting of 1 mm of EPDM Rubber and 3 mm of EPDM Foam, and in the fourth a composite of 1 mm of EPDM Rubber and 3 mm of PU Foam. The 1 mm EPDM rubber section for both composites represented a protective layer of the tool-handle. It was intended to prevent damage to the foam section whilst using the tool-handle.

For each combination of tool handle material, we considered four different loads to obtain characteristic contact pressures of 20 kPa, 40 kPa, 80 kPa, and 100 kPa in the centre line of the fingertip (Aldien et al., 2005; Gurram et al., 1995). The vertical force for producing these contact pressures was obtained by simulation with steel as a rigid tool-handle material. The resulting contact pressures represent four different strengths of a hand when grasping a tool-handle.

Since contact pressure distribution only provides data at the predefined load-case, we additionally provided continuous contact pressure data at the fingertip centre line in comparison to the deformation of the fingertip and tool-handle material combined. In these simulations we continuously applied a force that finally produced 100 kPa of contact pressure using a rigid material. The obtained maximum force was then applied to all simulations with different material combinations. We also simulated continuous relation between applied vertical finger force in comparison to resulting contact pressure to assess the behaviour of the simulation system of fingertip and tool-handle material.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Since we modelled a cross-section of a fingertip, the dimension of the fingertip in the direction of the fingertip should be infinitesimal small. However to be able to simulate the mechanical behaviour, the FE software assumes that applied forces are given in units of force/thickness (F/t), where the thickness is set to 1 mm. Therefore the units for the applied forces are in N/mm form.

We validated our FE model in regard to existing FE models, and to experimental data. According to the simulations performed by Wu and Dong (2005), our FE model showed almost the same contact pressure distribution for all three load cases load cases of 0.2 N/mm, 0.4 N/mm and 0.8 N/mm. The obtained peak contact pressures for these load cases were 41.8 kPa, 81.0 kPa and 155.0 kPa respectively.

We also compared the normalised finger force with the maximal vertical finger displacement at the centre line. The results showed good degree of correspondence (Pawluk and Howe, 1999). The material models of the simulated tool handle materials have been validated according to the stress strain data from experiments.

For each material combination and load-case we plotted a contact pressure distribution diagram, which showed the distribution of the contact pressure of the fingertip according to its distance from the centre line. Thereby direct comparisons and evaluations between different materials and load-cases were possible (Figs. 3, 5, 7 and 9
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     ).

Firstly we observed the load-case where a contact pressure of 20 kPa was obtained during the contact of a fingertip with a rigid material (Fig. 3), which simulates softly holding a tool in the hands (Aldien et al., 2005). The finger force which needed to reach this contact pressure was then applied to simulations using all the material combinations. The highest contact pressure was obtained with the steel as a tool-handle material. Contact pressure peak value and distribution obtained with EPDM rubber was almost the same as with steel. Both composite materials showed different contact pressure distributions as well lower peak values. The highest deformation regarding tool-handle material of about 0.32 mm is attributed to simulation with the composite tool-handle material of EPDM Rubber and EPDM Foam (Fig. 4).

The next load-case was a simulation of contact pressure occurring using normal flexion hand-force to hold a tool-handle. The normal flexion hand-force was assumed to be 30 N, which produces around 40 kPa of contact pressure at the centre line of the fingertip (Fig. 5) (Aldien et al., 2005). According to the results, steel and EPDM rubber tool-handle material produced almost the same contact pressure and distribution. The contact pressure peak values for both foam composites show that contact pressure can be lowered from 40 kPa to about 31 kPa for both materials. Both foam composites also show almost the same contact pressure distribution. The vertical deformations of the steel and EPDM rubber were negligibly small in comparison with composite materials of EPDM rubber and PU foam (0.75 mm), and EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam (0.62 mm) (Fig. 6).

The next load-case was set to obtain 80 kPa contact pressure at the centre line of the fingertip. Based on deformation distribution of tool-handle material it is evident that deformations with EPDM rubber as the tool-handle material (Fig. 8) were negligibly small. The contact pressure at the centre line was just slightly lower than with steel as a tool-handle material. EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam composite lowered the contact pressure from 80 kPa to 59 kPa. The maximum deformation of the EPDM rubber and EPDM foam composite as tool-handle material, in this load-case, was 1.2 mm and 1.9 mm for EPDM rubber and PU foam composite in comparison to rigid material at the centre line of the fingertip (Fig. 8).

The next load-case was set to obtain 100 kPa contact pressure at the centre line of the fingertip. EPDM rubber showed just slightly lower peak contact pressure. Simulations using the composite material EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam lowered the contact pressure from 100 kPa to 74 kPa and with the use of EPDM rubber and PU foam composite lowered the contact pressure from 100 kPa to 64 kPa. The maximum vertical deformation of a tool-handle material of EPDM rubber and EPDM foam at the centre line of the fingertip within this load-case was 1.4 mm and 2.2 mm using the EPDM rubber and PU Foam (Fig. 10
                     ).

We also investigate the continuous peak contact pressure versus vertical deformation of fingertip and tool-handle material combined, since this allows the observation and discussion of mechanical response of the whole simulated system (Fig. 11
                     ). Steel and EPDM rubber as tool-handle materials produce almost the same curve, where the peak contact pressure with EPDM rubber is just below the 100 kPa. The combined deformation with both materials is around 3.1 mm. Both foam composites show different curves compared to rigid steel. Combined deformation for the highest applied force when using composite with EPDM foam is 4.3 mm and 5 mm when using the PU foam composite.

The data on the vertical finger force and the resulting contact pressure and their correlation on the centre line of the fingertip was obtained from the numerical tests and is plotted in Fig. 12
                     . The resulting curve when using steel as tool-handle material almost corresponds to the curve when using EPDM rubber as tool-handle material. The resulting contact pressure for both composites is different to the rigid steel from a vertical finger force of around 0.1 N/mm. After this value both composites produce lower peak contact pressures at a given vertical finger force.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It has been shown that a power grasp of badly sized and shaped tool-handles can yield in high contact pressures for over 80 kPa, which can induce many ATD and CTD. Therefore, we investigated the contact pressure distribution of a fingertip in contact with a tool-handle using different materials and different loads. Most recommendations provide the highest allowable contact pressure and additionally the highest contact pressure over a specific time for the fingertip region (Fig. 13
                        ). The chart presents an assessment criterion for designing medical splints, but it can be adapted for tool-handle use. The criterion for the maximum allowable pressure for specific time is based on the occurrence of ischemia, which can induce many ATDs and CTDs (Brand and Hollister, 1999).

This diagram provides contact pressure data on the contact line with the tool-handle, but does not provide any data on behaviour and recommendations regarding the stress-strain behaviour on the inside of the fingertip. Despite extensive research into this topic, there are still no recommendations on maximum load regarding skin and subcutaneous tissue. However the contact pressure has been investigated in the past and proved to deliver satisfactory results.

The highest contact pressure in first load case was obtained with steel as tool-handle material. This was expected since steel is the stiffest material in comparison to all simulated materials. Steel is also much stiffer than skin and subcutaneous tissue therefore the deformations of the steel as tool-handle material are negligibly small. EPDM rubber as a tool-handle material showed almost the same contact pressure distribution. Rubber has characteristically non-linear stress strain behaviour. Under compression especially, the stress rises very rapidly with the strain, therefore almost no reduction in contact pressure is observed. It has been shown, that surfaces which follow the hand surface result in lower contact pressure, therefore simulations using composite of EPDM Rubber and EPDM Foam as well EPDM Rubber and PU Foam showed lower peak contact pressure. This can be addressed to the deformation of the tool-handle material, which provides different contact pressure distribution and higher contact area due to the material deformation, and therefore lowers the contact pressure. From the diagram regarding the contact pressure of the fingertip at the centre line versus the vertical deformations of the fingertip and tool-handle material combined, it was apparent that PU Foam is stiffer than EPDM Foam at that load-case (Fig. 11). According to the diagram of maximum contact pressure for specific time, 20 kPa contact pressure in the centre line can be applied for about 2 h, before ischemia becomes evident (Fig. 13). Since users do not use tools continuously for 2 h, therefore there is low probability of ischemia and thereby dependent ATD and CTD. The value regarding the tool-handle material deformation for both foam composites in comparison to the deformation of the fingertip and tool-handle material combined (Fig. 11) is much lower, therefore this deformation cannot affect the feeling of the tool-handle stability loss when in the hand.

The next load-case set to produce 40 kPa peak contact pressure with steel according to the diagram of maximum contact pressure for specific time showed that such a load-case can be applied to hand soft tissue for about half an hour. Many hand-tools and products can be handheld for this time, so therefore this load-case with its contact pressure could induce ATD and also CTD. EPDM rubber did not deform enough to have an impact on contact pressure distribution and provide higher contact area in order to lower the contact pressure. This was also evident from the diagram of distribution regarding vertical deformation of the material where the vertical deformations of the rubber were negligibly small in comparison with composite materials of EPDM rubber and PU foam (0.75 mm), and EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam (0.62 mm) (Fig. 6). Therefore also both composites produced lower contact pressures. The contact pressure using EPDM rubber and EPDM foam was slightly higher than with the EPDM rubber and PU foam. This behaviour also showed that there was an intersection of the stress strain curve of both hyper-elastic cell materials, and that it had been reached with the strain rate within this load-case. EPDM foam had a lower plateau (cell walls buckling) than the PU foam, which can be observed in the stress strain diagram for uniaxial compression (Fig. 2). With use of composite tool-handle materials EPDM rubber and EPDM foam as well EPDM rubber and PU Foam contact pressure can be lowered from 40 kPa to about 31 kPa for both materials. According to the diagram of maximum contact pressure for specific time, the half an hour allowance for grasping the tool-handle is increased to about an hour. This basically doubles the maximum allowing time of the usage. With lower contact pressure there are also fewer chances of developing ATD and CTD, whilst maintaining low deformation rate of the tool-handle material for maintaining the desired stability of the tool when in the hand. Stability is very important when using hand-tools, since safe and effective manipulation of the hand-tools is also stability-dependent. Therefore soft and thick foam materials as tool-handle materials are inappropriate, since they allow large deformations of the tool-handle material and, therefore, the feeling of losing control (Fellows and Freivalds, 1991).

The load-case set to produce 80 kPa contact pressure at the centre line of the fingertip showed that deformations with EPDM rubber as the tool-handle material (Fig. 8) were negligibly small therefore the contact pressure at the centre line was just slightly lower than with steel as a tool-handle material. On the other hand, both composites lowered the contact pressure significantly. Based on the diagram for maximum allowance regarding contact pressure for a specific time (Fig. 13), the time for safe usage of the tool-handle increased from almost zero to about 20 min before the ischemia starts to occur. The pressure distribution curve using EPDM rubber and EPDM foam was broader than with steel or EPDM rubber as tool-handle materials. This can be explained by the larger deformations of the composites and the deformation energy absorption with the tool-handle material. The greater width of the curve using the composite material of EPDM rubber and EPDM foam showed that a wider section of the finger was in contact with the tool-handle material than with the more rigid tool handle materials such as steel and EPDM rubber. The deformation energy has to stay the same in a given load case regardless of the choice of tool-handle material, therefore softer materials produce lower contact pressure with broader contact pressure distribution. Even lower maximum contact pressure was achieved with the use of a EPDM rubber and PU foam composite. The maximum contact pressure at the fingertip centre line was lowered from 80 kPa to just 49 kPa, which is almost 39% reduction in contact pressure. The time of safe usage is increased from almost zero to about half an hour or even more. Since contact pressure and tool-handle material deformations are dependent, lower contact pressure was accompanied by higher deformation of the simulated tool-handle material.

In order to show the effectiveness of the rubber and hyper-elastic foam composite materials, we investigated an even higher maximum contact pressure of 100 kPa (Fig. 9), which can be produced on fingertips when power-grasping a badly designed tool handle (Aldien et al., 2005). The simulation confirmed the trend that EPDM rubber as tool handle material decreases the contact pressure just slightly, which does not present any benefits regarding the safety producing ATD and CTD, which are contact pressure dependant. However, on the other hand, simulations using the composite material EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam lowered the contact pressure from 100 kPa to 74 kPa, which is still a safe contact pressure. With the use of EPDM rubber and PU foam composite, the contact pressure was even lower at 64 kPa. Potentially hazardous contact pressure was lowered to a value where it could be applied for about 20 min or even more.

From the diagram (Fig. 11), it is evident that the least deformation of the fingertip and tool-handle material at any simulated contact pressure was achieved with steel as a rigid material. This was to be expected, since the stress strain curve of the steel is much steeper and higher than the soft tissue, therefore almost all the deformations on the vertical axis could be addressed to the deformations of the fingertip. The deformations using EPDM rubber as the tool-handle material were just slightly higher in comparison with the steel material. The slightly lower contact pressure could be accredited to the deformations of the rubber tool-handle material. However, the differences in contact pressures were negligible small therefore rubber could not effectively lower the contact pressure at any simulated load-case. According to the trend, it can be expected that the differences in deformations and contact pressure will become higher at even higher contact pressures, but these contact pressures cannot be achieved with a normal power-grasp and are therefore irrelevant. Therefore it has been shown, that EPDM rubber as a tool-handle material cannot lower those risks of ATD and CTD that are pressure-dependent.

Both composites tool-handle materials showed almost the same contact pressure versus vertical deformation behaviour to a deformation of about 1.7 mm. This deformation can be accredited to the deformation of the fingertip, since the curve corresponds, to great extent, to the curve of steel and EPDM rubber, where almost no deformation of the tool-handle material was observed. After 1.7 mm of deformation both the EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam, and the EPDM rubber and PU foam composites started to deform. Due to the different stress strain behaviour and different plateau levels of both composites, the diagrams had different characteristic curves. The lower and not as prominent plateau of the EPDM Foam accounted for the evenly shaped curve. The plateau of the EPDM Foam was steeper than the plateau of the PU foam. The lower stress level of the plateau for the EPDM foam was accredited to the lower contact pressure values from 1.7 mm to about 3.1 mm of vertical deformations. However the steep stress strain behaviour within the plateau region and the rapid densification of the EPDM foam showed that after vertical deformation of the fingertip and tool-handle material of 3.1 mm, the curves of the EPDM and PU foams intersected. After this point, the contact pressure using EPDM rubber and PU foam composite at a given deformation was lower than using the EPDM rubber and EPDM foam composite, otherwise higher deformation was obtained using the EPDM rubber and PU foam composite than the EPDM rubber and EPDM foam composite at a specific contact pressure. This can be accredited to the higher plateau of the PU foam and the flatter and wider curve before the densification of the material began.

According to the results, it can be concluded that elastic foams with more distinct, flat and wide plateaus are more suitable as a tool-handle materials, since they do not deform at lower contact pressures, but deform when high contact pressure is achieved, thus causing lower risks of ATD and CTD. Thereby, the least additional deformation is also achieved, which thus maintains a high level of stability of the tool-handle when in the hand. The thickness of the material when using elastic foams has a significant influence on the results therefore we limited our study and simulation to just one combination of 1 mm EPDM rubber as a protective layer and 3 mm of elastic foam layer for deformation. This combination allowed for enough tool-handle material deformation to produce wider and lower contact pressure distribution, whilst maintaining desired stability due to the limited deformations based on the low thickness of the material.

Steel and EPDM rubber as tool-handle materials produced almost linear correlation between the vertical finger-force and the maximum contact pressure on the centre line of the fingertip. The curve using EPDM rubber as a tool-handle material showed slightly lower contact pressure at the maximum vertical finger-force. This can be accredited to slight deformation of the material and therefore slightly different contact pressure distribution and a slightly higher contact area. In addition, at about 15 kPa of contact pressure both composites also showed almost the same behaviour. After that point, each composite show its own characteristic behaviour. EPDM rubber and EPDM Foam produce an almost linear curve. This can be accredited to a less-evident plateau and its low value. The composite material EPDM rubber and PU foam showed a nonlinear curve in the diagram regarding vertical finger force versus maximum contact pressure on the fingertip centre line. The “S” like curve after the quasi linear behaviour shows that the plateau was higher and flatter, since the vertical finger force increased faster than the contact pressure. This was due to deformation of the material, which resulted in lower and wider contact pressure distribution and higher contact area. After the plateau the densification began that led to a faster increase in contact pressure whilst increasing the vertical finger force. This diagram shows a direct correlation between the applied finger force and the contact pressure therefore it is important regarding tool-handle material choice. The correlation between the vertical finger force and the resulting contact pressure on the centre line of the fingertip can be directly used to compare and evaluate tool-handle materials. Based on the results, the plateau level and its width can be proposed for obtaining a tool-handle material with improved mechanical behaviour, according to the desired application of the hand-tool. With correctly chosen material, the contact pressure can be lowered, whilst maintaining low deformation rate of the tool-handle material for maintaining sufficient rate of stability of the hand tool in the hands.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

FE simulations of mechanical behaviour regarding the fingertip grasping of a tool-handle showed that EPDM rubber as s tool-handle material produces almost the same contact pressures as rigid steel. Therefore EPDM rubber as tool-handle material does not lower the contact pressure, which in turn does not lower the risk of pressure-dependent ATD and CTD. The best results were obtained using proposed composites of EPDM rubber and EPDM foam as well EPDM rubber and PU foam. Based on the mechanical behaviour of the fingertip, the composite of EPDM rubber and PU foam proved to be the more suitable, since the material has the greater potential for lowering the contact pressure. With a clearly evident and higher plateau, this material does not deform at lower strain rates, but begins to deform at higher strain rates in order to provide a higher contact area, which can be observed with broader distribution of the contact pressure and also lower peak contact pressure. This mechanical behaviour and limited tool-handle material thickness can maintain low deformation rate of the tool-handle material for maintaining desired rate of stability of the hand tool in the hands. This study provides a foundation regarding tool-handle material design using hyper-elastic foams, and is intended for general applications. However with more accurately provided boundary conditions regarding the usages of the hand-tools, the material parameters could be set more precisely in order to provide desired mechanical behaviour of the tool-handle.

Future work should further investigate the stability of the tool handle whilst using hyper-elastic foam materials. Experiments using test subjects should be conducted to define values for a stable and non-stable grasp. Additionally, combinations of different thicknesses regarding tool-handle material could be simulated and compared. Since one finger gripping flat surface is a simplified model, future simulations should consist of more fingers and curved surfaces when gripping a tool-handle. Dynamic simulations should be carried out to simulate the effect of vibrations and material damping. Lastly, probes of the proposed material should be produced and tested using test-subject in order to evaluate the subjective responses of the users.

The elastic behaviour of the EPDM rubber shows non-linear elastic behaviour under mechanical stress. The behaviour can be described using hyperelastic material models, where one of the most used is the Ogden strain energy potential (Ali et al., 2010):
