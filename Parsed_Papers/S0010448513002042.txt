                  Family Mould Cavity Runner Layout Design (FMCRLD) is the most demanding and critical task in the early Conceptual Mould Layout Design (CMLD) phase. Traditional experience-dependent manual FCMRLD workflow causes long design lead time, non-optimum designs and human errors. However, no previous research can support FMCRLD automation and optimisation. The nature of FMCRLD is non-repetitive and generative. The complexity of FMCRLD optimisation involves solving a complex two-level combinatorial layout design optimisation problem. Inspired by the theory of evolutionary design in nature “Survival of the Fittest” and the biological genotype–phenotype mapping process of the generation of form in living systems, this research first proposes an innovative evolutionary FMCRLD approach using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Mould Layout Design Grammars (MLDG) that can automate and optimise such generative and complex FMCRLD with its explorative and generative design process embodied in a stochastic evolutionary search. Based on this approach, an Intelligent Conceptual Mould Layout Design System (ICMLDS) prototype has been developed. The ICMLDS is a powerful intelligent design system as well as an interactive design-training system that can encourage and accelerate mould designers’ design alternative exploration, exploitation and optimisation for better design in less time. This research innovates the traditional manual FMCRLD workflow to eliminate costly human errors and boost the less-experienced mould designer’s ability and productivity in performing FCMRLD during the CMLD phase.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cold runner family moulds are widely used in some industries, such as toys and domestic products, because family moulds can offer an efficient and economical way to produce dissimilar plastic parts of the same plastic material and colour for small-to-medium production volume. Plastic parts of different shapes and sizes of the same plastic material can be produced in one shot by a “Family Mould”.In family mould design, Family Mould Cavity and Runner Layout Design (FMCRLD) is the most critical task that significantly affects the cost and performance of a family mould because it determines many key design and cost factors such as filling balance performance, runner cost, mould insert cost, mould base cost and so forth  [1]. Each family mould is custom-made and unique. Different family moulds must be newly designed to meet different design requirements and constraints. The complexity of FMCRLD involves a large number of combinations of various cavity layout and associated runner layout design alternatives and design considerations  [1]. In practice, it is virtually impossible for mould designers to try out all possible design alternatives manually to find the best trade-off solution between mould performance and cost. Existing human-dependent manual FMCRLD methods and the shortage of experienced mould designers cause long design lead time, non-optimum designs and costly human errors  [1]. A computer-based design tool to assist less experienced mould designers in performing FMCRLD is urgently needed. This paper focuses on developing a computational approach to automate and optimise FMCRLD which aims to improve mould designers’ ability and productivity during the Conceptual Mould Layout Design (CMLD) phase.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. A literature review focused on FMCRLD-related research is provided in the next section. The evolutionary FMCRLD approach is presented in Section  3. The implementation of the proposed approach is described in Section  4. Finally, discussion and conclusions are given in Sections  5 and 6 respectively.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Traditionally, mould design is demanding and experience-dependent. Over the years, many researchers  [2–7] have attempted to automate a whole mould design process using various Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) approaches, such as Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). However, their research can consider regular and routine cavity layout design in “One Product Mould” regardless of more difficult cavity layout design in family moulds  [1]. Tatsuya and Naohiro  [8] attempted to determine an optimum conceptual cavity layout of three-plate family moulds using the Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach. However, this approach heavily relied on the initial cavity layout determined by mould designers, the efficiency of the search algorithm and the complexity of the problem  [1]. More recently, Lukis et al.  [9] developed a patented system entitled “Automated multi-customer moulding” that can automatically lay out different parts from different customers on one or more multi-customer cold runner family moulds for prototype production of simple parts. However, this patented system cannot generate an optimum FMCRLD of more complicated parts for relatively higher volume production. In fact, no research, commercial software package or patented system can support FMCRLD automation and optimisation  [1]. The nature of FMCRLD is generative and non-repetitive. FMCRLD optimisation should be viewed as a complex multi-level combinatorial optimisation problem with multiple design objectives and constraints. The solution space is so large that traditional design automation and optimisation techniques cannot deal with it efficiently. Therefore, the Evolutionary Design (ED) approach, which can facilitate an explorative and generative design process embodied in a stochastic evolutionary search, has great potential to support FMCRLD automation and optimisation. For example, many researchers have adopted evolution techniques for optimising moulding processes  [10,11], runner diameters  [12,13] and cooling layout systems  [14–16]. However, research on FMCRLD using the ED approach has never been reported before. In fact, the ED approach is problem-specific and computation-intensive. Using the ED approach for FCMRLD automation and optimisation faces three key challenges: (i) Chromosome design, (ii) Genetic operator design and (iii) Fitness function design. Firstly, the efficiency of the GA highly depends on a proper chromosome design for a specific problem  [17]. Designing a special chromosome for evolutionary FMCRLD from scratch is the first major challenge in this research. Secondly, the efficiency of the GA also depends upon genetic operators that fit the properties of the chromosome well  [17]. In this research, simple standard genetic operators cannot be used because of the use of the new and special chromosome design. Designing efficient genetic operators for producing valid offspring that can inherit meaningful “building blocks” from both parents with a new chromosome specially designed for FMCRLD is very challenging. Thirdly, the GA requires a large number of quantitative fitness evaluations to converge to optimum solutions iteratively from generation to generation until the termination conditions are met  [18]. In family mould design, filling balance performance is one of the important design objectives. How to quantify the performance of a large number of FMCRLD alternatives in the population for fitness evaluation in the GA without the use of time-consuming and expensive Moldflow analysis software package  [19] will be one of the major challenges in this research.

This research proposes a GA coupled with MLDG-based chromosomes that aims to allow for the generation of feasible and novel FMCRLD solutions and enable the GA to search for optimum solutions more efficiently. In order to overcome the key challenges mentioned in Section  2, a novel MLDG of FMCRLD incorporated with a mould design knowledge domain provides an encoding/decoding mechanism specially designed for evolving FMCRLD based on a specially designed hybrid MLDG-based chromosome (see Section  3.1 for more details). A specific scoring scheme is used to quantify the fitness value of each individual in the population considering multiple mould design objectives and constraints (see Section  3.2 for more details). Specially designed crossover and mutation operators are presented in Sections  3.3 and 3.4 respectively.

Shape Grammar (SG)  [20] is a set of shape replacement rules that can be applied consecutively to generate infinitely many instances of shape arrangements conforming to the specified rules in a non-deterministic manner. Previous ED research  [21–23] shows that GA coupled with SG-based chromosomes can bring together the SG’s design synthesis capability and the GA’s capabilities of design space navigation and optimisation. In this research, the concept and development of generative MLDG are inspired by the notion of SG. Unlike a pure SG, the MLDG developed here does not need to involve the complexity of implementing a pure SG’s sub-shape recognition  [24] due to the nature of FCMRLD. In current practice, experienced mould designers first group dissimilar cavities into several sub-groups. Then, they determine the locations of each group and design the associated runner layout design accordingly. Therefore, the main concept of the proposed MLDG is to synthesise generative FMCRLD by manipulating three sets of interdependent MLDG—(i) group layout design grammar, (ii) internal group layout design grammar and (iii) runner layout design grammar. Based on the authors’ observation and recognition of implicit common layout design features from a number of practical FMCRLD examples, a group layout design can be decomposed into virtual multi-cavity groups and 12 commonly used regions located around the sprue (see Fig. 1
                        ). The virtual multi-cavity group represents a group of cavities that are filled through the same sub-runner. The virtual multi-cavity group region defines the virtual boundary of different non-overlapping zones allocated around the virtual centre of the mould base (also the sprue location). A virtual multi-cavity group is represented by a rectangular box. Each individual virtual multi-cavity group containing one or more cavities is placed in 12 different virtual multi-cavity group regions (A–L). Each region can contain more than one virtual cavity group. Based on this concept, the 12 shape placement rules for their corresponding 12 different regions have been developed (see Fig. 2
                        ). As illustrated in Example (a) in Fig. 3
                        , if shape placement rule 1 is applied to the initial shape of the centre point of the mould base, the lower right corner of the rectangular box will be aligned to the centre point. Then, if rule 6 is applied to the shape added by rule 1 in the region B in the previous step, the rectangular box will be added on top of the box. Subsequently, the resulting group layout design can be generated by applying rules 7, 8 and 4. Another example of the application of various shape placement rules to various initial shapes is illustrated in Example (b) in Fig. 3. Besides, the proposed group layout design grammar also can avoid any invalid group layout design. For example, the application of rule 4 is allowed in region H only. Rule 8 can only be applied to the centre point of the mould base in region G if there are no groups placed in regions H or F. Rule 9 can only be applied to the shape added in the previous step in region I. Therefore, a valid group layout and associated runner layout connecting the sprue and cavities can be generated accordingly (see Fig. 4
                        (b)). Fig. 4(a) shows an example of an invalid group layout caused by no restriction on the application of shape placement rules to different initial shapes in different regions.

In this research, moulding parts are classified into two convex shape codes: Circular and Rectangular. All circular moulding parts are represented by simple circular cylinders while all irregular moulding parts are represented by rectangular boxes. The cavity internal bounding box equal to the overall size of the moulding part is enclosed by the rectangular virtual cavity external bounding box with an offset distance for sufficient shut-off area and space for runners and cooling channels. The internal group layout design grammar aims to control the orientations (horizontal and vertical) and location arrangements of multiple cavities in a virtual multi-cavity group (see Fig. 5
                        ). The internal group layout grammar integrated with cavity layout design knowledge enables an automatic arrangement of multiple cavities in a virtual multi-cavity group considering the shape code, volumetric size, gate location and slider location of each individual cavity as well as the location of the virtual multi-cavity group.

The runner layout design grammar contains four runner layout grammar rules: R1 “Fishbone” style, R2: “H” style, R3: “X” style and R4: “Radial” style. Based on these four runner layout styles  [25–27], a set of runner layout grammar rules has been developed for automatic generation of feasible runner layout design that can adapt to different cavity layout designs intelligently. As summarised in Fig. 6
                        , the application of the runner layout grammar rules to virtual multi-cavity groups with different numbers of cavities and various internal group layout rules can generate a number of different runner layout designs. There are some general rules to avoid invalid runner layout designs. For example, R2 (‘H’ style) or R3 (‘X’ style) can only be applied to a cavity group containing four or eight cavities with layout rule T2 or T4. R4 (‘Radial’ style) is only valid for cavity groups with three or more identical circular parts.

The configuration of virtual multi-cavity groups must be determined before these three geometrical layout designs. The configuration of virtual multi-cavity groups in itself can be considered a combinatorial grouping design problem because it involves a large numbers of possible combinations of different number of groups and different content of each group. Therefore, the chromosome of FMCRLD involves not only the genetic representation of the geometrical layout designs (virtual multi-cavity group layout design, internal cavity group layout design and runner layout design) but also the genetic representation of the grouping design considering minimum redundancy. Each individual cavity layout design solution should be represented by as few distinct chromosomes (ideally exact one) as possible in order to reduce the size of the search space. To encode a grouping design integrated with interdependent geometrical layout designs in FMCRLD, this research proposes a new hybrid MLDG-based chromosome that consists of three interdependent chromosome sessions—(a) Orientation session, (b) Group session and (c) Group layout shape rules session. Fig. 7
                         shows the mapping of the graphical phenotype representation with its corresponding chromosome session. The orientation session of the chromosome contains orientation information of each individual cavity in a family mould. The locus (position) of the gene represents the part identification number. The allele of the gene is the part’s orientation parameter (0 =  horizontal, 1 =  vertical). The length of this session is fixed because it is equal to the number of moulding parts. For example, in this case, the length of this session is equal to seven because there are seven individual parts in the family mould. The cavity grouping design information is stored in the group session where the locus of the gene represents the part identification number and the allele of the gene is the part’s group identification number. For example, the number of groups is randomly selected (five groups in this case). Parts 1 and 2 are allocated in Group 1 at random. Therefore, the allele of both the first gene and the second gene is equal to 1. The length of this session is also fixed because it is equal to the number of parts. In the group layout shape rules session, the locus of the gene represents the group identification number on a one-gene-for-one-group basis. The length of this session is variable because the number of groups is variable. In each gene, the three rule number labels enclosed in parenthesis represent the group layout grammar rule, internal cavity group layout grammar rule and runner layout grammar rule of their corresponding group, respectively. For example, the first gene contains Group 1’s genetic information of the MLDG rules (1, 3, 1). The group layout grammar rule “1”, the internal cavity group layout grammar rule “3” (vertical series layout) and the runner layout grammar rule “1” (“Fishbone” style) are applied to Group 1 having parts 1 and 2. Using the MLDG of FMCRLD, the genotype can be decoded to form the phenotype as shown in the lower part of Fig. 7. The main advantage of using this new hybrid chromosome is that the “Orientation session” and the “Group session” can represent the part’s orientation and the cavity grouping design while the associated “Group layout shape rules session” can represent the geometrical layout design with minimum redundancy. Moreover, the solution space can be reduced because this new hybrid MLDG-based chromosome design enables all individuals generated in the population to be feasible solutions conforming to the MLDG of FMCRLD. Various grammar rule applied at each step in different regions are stored in a database. Left Hand Side condition (initial shape) of grammar rules can be simply recognised by searching the history of application of grammar rules stored in the system. According to the data (i.e. orientation parameters, group configuration and grammar rules) stored in the chromosome, a hard-coded genotype–phenotype mapping algorithm can (a) compute assembly coordinates of each cavity; (b) create runner layout geometries based on the location and orientation of each cavity and determine the diameter of each runner according to empirical formula  [24,25]; (c) determine the configuration of sliders; and (d) select a suitable mould base.

                        . These critical cost factors are directly driven by FMCRLD. For example, the overall size of a cavity layout design determines the material cost of mould inserts and also the cost of its suitable mould base. The runner layout design directly affects the total volume of runners for production, which can be used to measure the cost of scrap plastic material. If some moulding parts have undercuts, the cost of sliders must be considered. The cost of sliders is estimated based on the required number and overall size of sliders. The maximum allowable mould based size is limited to the space between tie bars on the mould platen of a customer’s available moulding machines. Therefore, different FMCRLD alternatives require different sizes of mould bases that affect the selection of injection moulding machines. The estimated cost of injection moulding depends on the total number of shots, the cycle time per shot and the average operating cost of the required injection moulding machine. In practice, a larger moulding machine requires a higher operating cost because of the higher purchase price, higher maintenance cost, higher energy consumption, more man-hours to set up and so forth. A more detailed description of mould cost estimation can be found in the literature  [26,27].

                         aims to measure the relative performance of an individual compared to the user-defined goal value of the Flow Path Balance Performance (FPBP). FPBP is defined as an average variation of Flow Path (FP)  [25] relative to the minimum FP across all flow groups of a FMCRLD alternative. The Flow Path (FP) of each individual flow group consists of its individual Runner Flow Path (RFP) and its Cavity Flow Path (CFP). RFP is the total length of various runner branches delivered from the sprue to the gate of the cavity. CFP is the estimated longest flow length measured from the selected gating location to the boundary of the cavity. The smaller the FPBP is the better the filling balance performance that can be achieved.

                         is used to measure the relative performance of an individual compared to the user-defined goal value of the Runner Diameter Balance Ratio (RDBR). RDBR is defined to measure the maximum variation of runner diameters at each runner branching node of a FMCRLD alternative. From experience, if the ratio of the maximum runner diameter to the minimum one at a branching node exceeds two, it may result in flow hesitation at this branching node.

                         is used to measure the relative performance of an individual compared to the user-defined goal value of the offset distance between the centres of the resultant clamping force and the family mould. The coordinates of the centre of the resultant clamping force acting on all dissimilar parts located in different locations with respect to the centre of the family mould is calculated using the law of conservation of momentum.

With regard to FMCRLD constraints, FMCRLD needs to consider the cavity layout and runner layout design restrictions to produce feasible FMCRLD. This kind of restriction is called a “Design Constraint”. In this research, through the use of MLDG of FMCRLD in the Genotype–Phenotype mapping process, all FMCRLD solutions in the population can be generated without violation of the “Design Constraint”. On the other hand, FMCRLD needs to consider the maximum allowable mould base size is limited to the space between tie bars on the mould platen of a customer’s available moulding machines. This type of restriction can be regarded as a “Geometric Constraint”. This geometric constraint can be soft or hard. For example, a smaller mould base is usually preferable because it can be fit into a smaller moulding machine for the reduction of operating cost, but a larger one may be allowed if necessary. If the mould base size of an individual FMCRLD solution is larger than the maximum allowable space between tie bars on the mould platen of a customer’s available moulding machine, it will always be regarded as an invalid FMCRLD.

The priority of each sub-objective must be able to be changed individually for different mould specifications and requirements. Therefore, this research uses a simple weighted sum approach to integrate a number of performance goals (

                         must be equal to 1. Mould designers can adjust the weighting ratios according to their desired objectives. In this research, a simple static penalty function is adopted to handle this geometric constraint. If the geometric constraint is set to “soft”, the individual solution violating the soft constraint will be penalised by adding an extra penalty cost

This approach allows mould designers to change the priority of individual performance goal, cost and the penalty function for different mould customers’ specifications and requirements in a simple way. The optimisation objective is to minimise the CP fitness value calculated using the weighted-sum fitness function listed below:

This research first proposes a new group-oriented MLDG-based crossover operator that combines the concept of the group-oriented crossover method of Group Genetic Algorithm (GGA)  [28] and integrates with the MLDG of FMCRLD to reproduce valid offspring during the evolutionary process. As shown in Fig. 8
                        (a) and (b), the first step is to select at random a crossing group in the Group
                        Layout Grammar Rules Session in each of the two parents with a pre-defined crossover rate. As shown in the “Inject genetic contents” in Fig. 8(c) and (d), the second step is to inject the crossing groups of both parents to each other. The allele in the orientation session and the group session associated with the crossing section of the second parent (P9) are copied to the corresponding locus of the first parent (P1), and vice versa. The last step is to eliminate all objects occurring twice and empty cavity groups (see Fig. 8(e) and (f)). Accordingly, the slider will also be automatically changed based on the new location and orientation of the parts in the new FMCRLD. Because of the MLDG of FMCRLD, the group layout design, the internal cavity layout design and the runner layout design of the new offspring can be intelligently regenerated while maintaining the feasibility of FMCRLD after the crossover operation (see Fig. 8(g) and (h)). It is noticed that offspring C1 inherits the single slider design for Parts 2 and 3 from P1. Offspring C2 can inherit not only the single slider design for Parts 2 and 3 from P9 but also the balanced runner layout design from P1. This new group-oriented MLDG-based crossover operator can inherit or combine meaningful “building blocks” from both parents to reproduce a stronger offspring without violation of the design constraints and disruption of the useful parts (schemata) of the chromosome during recombination. In this research, crossover rate is defined to control the proportion of the number of crossing groups to the total number of cavity groups of the individual. For example, if the crossover rate is set to 0.3, the number of crossing groups for P1 and P9 will be equal to 0.3×3=0.9 (corrected to an integer value of 1) and 0.3×4=1.2 (corrected to an integer value of 2) respectively.

A mutation operator aims to introduce new species into the population in the GA to explore the solution space by performing random modification of an individual’s gene value. This research develops three types of mutation operators for the (i) orientation session, (ii) group session, or (iii) group layout shape rules session of the new hybrid MLDG-based chromosome. One of these mutation operators for different sessions is selected at random and is applied to the offspring based on a predetermined mutation probability (mutation rate). The mutation operation occurring in the orientation session. One gene is selected at random. If there is no violation of the design constraints (such as allowable gate locations of parts, existing runner layouts and the space for sliders), the allele of the selected gene will be flipped. If mutation takes place in the group session, there will be two options: modification of an existing group or creation of a new group. The first option aims to change the allele of the randomly selected gene in the group session at random and eliminate the empty group, if any. The second option aims to create a new group. The first step is to create a new group at random in the group layout shape rules session. Then, the next step is to select a gene in the group session at random and change the allele (the group number) to the new group number. If the mutation operation occurs in the group layout shape rules session, then one allele in this session will be selected and modified at random. The phenotype can be changed accordingly. These three mutation operators integrated with the MLDG of FMCRLD can introduce new and feasible solutions into the population without violation of the design constraints.

In this research, an ICMLDS prototype seamlessly integrated with the Pro/Engineer® Wildfire® 4.0 CAD system has been developed. This paper presents selected case studies to verify the evolutionary FMCRLD approach and demonstrate how the ICMLDS prototype can automate and optimise FMCRLD in the supporting company. First of all, an experimental case study and the system output are described in Section  4.1. Subsequently, system verification and analysis of results are given in Section  4.1.1. Finally, another implementation example is discussed in Section  4.2.

In this experimental case study, four parts varying from 0.12 to 23.49 g are required to be moulded in ABS (Polylac PA-757) in one shot with a family mould. Through the use of the graphical user interface, four dissimilar parts are initially added into the ICMLDS. Then users can change the moulding requirements, the parameters of design objectives and GA parameters for different design cases. The setting of GA parameters, design objectives and constraints used in this experimental case study is summarised in Tables B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B. This research focused more on accelerating mould designers’ design alternative exploration, exploitation and optimisation for better design in less time. In an attempt to provide a more diverse gene pool for the GA to explore and exploit more design alternatives to search for global optimum solutions in a limited time, a reasonably large population of about 500 was chosen for this experimental first try. If necessary, the GA parameters may need to be adjusted according to the optimisation results. The program was repeated 5 times using the same setting and the best solution of the 5 runs was selected. Fig. 9
                         shows the list of a number of feasible FMCRLD alternatives associated with their fitness values. Users can browse and visualise different FMCRLD alternatives in the population to select the best solution. Finally, the prototype system automatically generated the 3D mould layout design model based on the selected FCMRLD for downstream detail mould design and manufacturing. Accordingly, the 2D mould layout drawing associated with a table of BOM, mould design configuration and specification were also generated automatically, accurately and quickly.

Due to the complexity of FMCRLD optimisation, it is impossible to prove that the best FCMRLD obtained from the ICMLDS prototype is a true global optimum solution. For testing the prototype, the program is run 5 times repeatedly using a larger population size (800) and longer stall generation (300). The result shows that the same best FMCRLD solution can be obtained. This demonstrates the repeatability in performance of GA as the difference in optimal result for different runs is insignificant. This also proves that this best FMCRLD solution is not a local optimal solution in this case study. As shown in Fig. 10
                           , the best result of the 5 runs obtained from the ICMLDS prototype is illustrated with the graph of Average CP and Best CP Vs. generations. The six different FMCRLD alternatives (starting from

                           ) attached to the Best CP curve represent the best individual obtained in the population in different generations. Their chromosomes and the weighted CP values are listed in Table 2. The result demonstrates that better offspring can be reproduced from parents through the innovative crossover and mutation operations without producing invalid offspring. Using the steady-state population model, the best individuals from a given generation can always be preserved in the next generation. The worst individual is replaced by the better offspring in each generation which drives the whole population to improve from generation to generation with high selection pressure. Because of the higher weights on

                           , individuals with more balanced runner layout system, smaller mould base and mould insert have better fitness values to survive and more chances to pass on their successful traits. All individuals violating the mould base size constraint are penalised and replaced eventually. At 87 generations, Design (e) appears and keeps the top position for a number of generations. Then a new Design (f) is introduced into the population from mutation on Design (e) at 177 generations. Finally, the algorithm started to converge and stopped at 377 generations automatically because there is no change in the best CP value for over 200 generations. The running time was 78 s. The statistics of this experimental case study shows that the average CP value of the population is improved from 182.46 to 102.62 (see the “Average CP” curve in Fig. 10). The best CP value is improved from 123.54 to 74.02 (see the “Best CP” curve in Fig. 10). The best values of Cost

                           ) of different FMCRLD alternatives are validated by experienced senior mould design engineers based on their experience and expertise in the area of family mould design. In practice, the artificial filling balance is performed by manually adjusting the diameters of each individual runner segment and running filling analysis iteratively based on a Moldflow analysis engineer’s experience. The filling analysis results of Designs (d) and (f) after artificial filling balance are shown in Fig. 11
                           (a) and (b) respectively. According to the Moldflow analysis engineer’s suggestion, the diameters of runner segments (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6) of Design (d) need to be adjusted so as to achieve an acceptable filling balance (see dimensions in brackets in Fig. 11(a)). It is noticed that the diameter of runner R5 is smaller than the recommended runner diameter (approximately 1.5 times the normal wall thickness 1.5 mm of Part 2) for sufficient filling and packing of Part 2. Besides, the significant variation of runner diameters (such as R5 to R3 and R2 to R1) may cause possible flow hesitation such that the artificial filling balance achieved based on Design (d) is sensitive to any slight variation in injection moulding process and moulding property of plastic, leading to a narrow process window. If a family mould is actually manufactured based on bad FMCRLD (such as Design (d) in this case), it will require a large amount of money and time to rework the entire mould because the filling imbalance problem cannot be simply resolved by enlarging the runner diameters. On the other hand, only three runner segments (R2 R3, R5) of Design (f) need to be further adjusted for artificial filling balance. The result shows that an acceptable filling balance can be achieved and all runner diameters can meet the requirements of recommended runner diameters for effective filling and packing of the moulding parts and standard milling cutter diameters for easy manufacturing. Besides, no significant variation of runner diameters at branching node can be found in Design (f). Hence, the artificial filling balance based on Design (f) can be achieved with a wider process window compared with Design (d). These mould flow filling analysis results validates that Design (f) having a higher

                            values have proven to be efficient to quantify the comparison of filling balance performance among different FMCRLD for numerous fitness evaluations in the GA.

The performance of the ICMLDS prototype is evaluated and compared with the existing manual design methods in terms of the design lead time and CP values. In this experimental case study, three mould design engineers (Designers A, B and C) are invited to design the same family mould using their traditional manual design method. Both Designer A and B are junior mould design engineers with one year working experience. Designer C has over ten years working experience in mould design. The amount of time spent by each designer on the entire design process is recorded and the CP values of their designs are calculated based on the same evaluation method proposed in this research. The detailed FMCRLD drawings created by Designers A, B and C, and the ICMLDS prototype are shown in Fig. 12
                           (a)–(d) respectively. This experiment shows that different designers with different level of experience produce different FMCRLD solutions.


                           Table 2 shows the CP values of different FMCRLD designed by different mould designers were calculated using Eq. (1). The ICMLDS prototype could score a high CP (74.02) value, which can compete with the best CP (73.52) value achieved by Designer C in this case study. The FMCRLD generated by the prototype system can improve the CP value by 26.3% compared with the worst FMCRLD done by less experienced Designer A.

With regard to the design lead time comparison (see Fig. 13
                           ), the less experienced mould designers (Designers A and B) need more than 50 min to think of the conceptual layout design and spend another 60 min on creating the detail CAD drawing. The experienced mould designer (Designer C) still requires 25 min to finish the conceptual layout design and 40 min to complete the detail CAD drawing. In this case study, the prototype system spends only about 5 min on the data input process and 6.5 min on the computation process (5 runs). The detail CAD drawing can then be automatically generated within one second. This comparison result shows that using the ICMLDS prototype to perform FMCRLD can dramatically reduce the design lead time by over 94% compared to less experienced mould designers (Designers A and B) and over 89% compared to the most experienced one (Designer C).

This case study also shows that even an experienced Moldflow analysis engineer cannot achieve the global optimum artificial filling balance solution unless a good FMCRLD is provided. Taking this case study as an example, it takes about 7 h to perform artificial filling balance on 4 FMCRLD alternatives in order to achieve the best solution while the ICMLDS prototype can already provide the best FMCRLD for Moldflow analysis engineers to perform artificial filling balance at the beginning. The ICMLDS prototype can save a lot of time on performing costly and time-consuming artificial filling balance on numerous different FMCRLD alternatives.

In this implementation case study, the junior mould designer (Designer A) is invited to design family moulds of a real-life toy product using the ICMLDS prototype. The weighting ratios of the five cost factors need to be reallocated because there is no slider in this family mould (see Table B.1 in Appendix B). Similar to the experimental case study (see Section  4.1), the program is run 5 times repeatedly with the same setting of GA parameters first. If necessary, the GA parameters can be adjusted according to the optimisation result. It takes about 15 min to complete the 5 runs for both Case studies I and II. The best solutions of the 5 runs for Case studies I and II are shown in Fig. 14
                        (a) and (b) respectively. In Case study I, Designer A has attempted to achieve a higher

In Case study II, Designer A has tried to achieve a smaller mould insert while maintaining a reasonable filling balance performance by adjusting the optimisation objective weighting ratios as well as the cavity positions. The ICMLDS prototype can update the FMCRLD and recalculate all the performance and cost values automatically. It can provide a rapid design visualisation and design feedback for Designer A to fine-tune the design, accelerating mould designers’ design alternative exploration, exploitation and optimisation for better design in less time. As shown in Fig. 15
                        (a) and (b), the family moulds can produce moulding parts without any major moulding defect, such as filling imbalance. This implementation result shows that, through the use of the ICMLDS prototype, inexperienced Designer A can produce a good FMCRLD solution that can achieve a good filling balance performance with minimum costs of runner, mould base, mould insert and injection moulding.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The results obtained from the previous experiment and the real case study show that, using the ICMLDS prototype, even less experienced mould designers can design error-free and optimised FMCRLD considering critical economic factors, family mould design objectives and constraints within minutes instead of hours. The ICMLDS prototype significantly speed up the design process and streamline the workflow starting from the early CMLD phase to the later detail design phase. Most importantly, using the ICMLDS prototype to perform FMCRLD can avoid the costly design defects (such as serious filling imbalance and violation of mould base size constraint) caused by human design errors, and thereby ensure on-time delivery of error-free family moulds for production. This intelligent automatic design tool can boost mould designers’ ability and productivity in performing FMCRLD during the CMLD phase. Besides, the rapid design visualisation and instant design feedback capabilities of the ICMLDS prototype enable less experienced mould designers to explore more what-if design scenarios in less time and to learn the art of family mould design by digital experimentation in an intelligent and interactive design environment. This research successfully develops a powerful intelligent design system as well as an interactive design-training system capable of encouraging and accelerating mould designers’ design alternative exploration, exploitation and optimisation for better design in less time. In the field of evolutionary design, this research demonstrates the power of the evolutionary design approach using GA combined with MLDG in automating and optimising combinatorial and generative FMCRLD. The innovations of the hybrid MLDG-based chromosome design, genetic operator design and fitness evaluation provides a deeper insight into the art of evolutionary design and explores a new direction for research of complex combinatorial and generative layout design automation and optimisation.

The limitations of this research can be categorised by three main issues: MLDG, fitness evaluation and GA optimisation issues. For the MLDG issues, the existing prototype cannot support multiple pin-point gates on the same moulding part and pin-point gate design because the majority of family moulds produced in the supporting company are single side gate. However, this limitation can be addressed in the future by adding a set of MLDG runner layout rules for supporting multiple pin-point gates on the same moulding part and runner layout design for pin-point gate.

With regard to the fitness evaluation issues, this research has two limitations. Firstly, the Cavity Flow Path (CFP) of a moulding part is approximately estimated and input into the program by mould designers according to its gating location, size and geometry at the beginning. The accuracy of the relative variation of CFP lengths of dissimilar moulded parts of a family mould influences the Flow Path Balance Performance

                                    P
                                 
                                 
                                    f

                         values of different FMCRLD alternatives in the population and therefore affects the optimisation result. Besides, different mould designers may give different CFP estimations for the same part which also affects the optimisation result. If necessary, the CFP of each dissimilar complex moulded part should be verified with the aid of the Moldflow analysis software package beforehand. Further work on automatic estimation of CFP length of a moulding part is needed. Secondly, the simple weighted sum approach for combining a number of scoring components and penalty into a single fitness value may bury the significance of each individual criterion. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to fine-tune the weights of the scoring components and the penalty for different sets of functional requirements of different types of family moulds. Further work is needed to establish a systematic method for determining these weightings. In the future, users can simply select different sets of standard and optimised weights of the scoring components and the penalty for different types of family mould and/or different customers.

For the GA optimisation issues, there are two limitations that need to be addressed in the future. Firstly, due to the limited time frame and the scope of this research, the ICMLDS prototype can only provide a general setting of GA parameters for mould designers to evolve FMCRLD, but it may not work for other cases. Mould designers may need to adjust the parameters and rerun the program repeatedly until satisfactory results are obtained. Over the decades, despite enormous research  [29–35] on the setting of GA parameters, it still largely depends on experience or an ad hoc trial-and-error approach because the optimal setting is usually dependent upon the nature of the problem. In recent years, some innovative nature-inspired approaches  [36,37] for self-adaptive setting of GA parameters have been reported. In the future, it may be possible to apply an artificial ecology on the evolutionary FMCRLD to further improve the efficiency and performance of the GA. Secondly, this research is focused on the upper level optimisation—a combinatorial optimisation problem of cavity grouping and layout design and associated runner layout design (i.e. FMCRLD). In the future, the optimum FMCRLD generated by the ICMLDS prototype can be further optimised by slightly adjusting the lengths of some runner segments associated with the positions of the corresponding cavities. This is a lower level optimisation—a parametric optimisation of the lengths of runner segments.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Inspired by the theory of evolutionary design in nature “Survival of the Fittest” and the biological genotype–phenotype mapping process of the generation of form in living systems, this research first proposes the innovative evolutionary design approach for FMCRLD automation and optimisation using GA and MLDG. This nature-inspired evolutionary FMCRLD approach aims to automate and optimise such generative and complex FMCRLD with its explorative and generative design process embodied in a stochastic evolutionary search. The hybrid MLDG-based chromosome can encode complex and generative FCMRLD with minimum redundancy. The specially designed group-oriented MLDG-based genetic operators enable the GA to reproduce stronger offspring that can inherit meaningful features from both parents and introduce new species into the population without violation of design constraints and disruption of the useful parts of the chromosome.

                      can quantify the filling balance performance of FMCRLD without using computer-intensive Moldflow analysis. Based on this innovative evolutionary FCMRLD approach, the ICMLDS prototype seamlessly embedded within the advanced commercial MCAD system has been successfully developed and implemented in the supporting company. The ICMLDS prototype is validated by a team of the supporting company’s experienced mould designers and Moldflow analysis engineers through case studies. The results show that the ICMLDS prototype can eliminate costly human errors and boost mould designer’s ability and productivity in performing FCMRLD during the CMLD phase. The evolutionary design, rapid design visualisation and instant design feedback capabilities of the ICMLDS prototype enable less-experienced mould designers to learn the art of family mould design by exploring more what-if design scenarios in less time. The ICMLDS prototype has been proven to be a powerful intelligent design system as well as an interactive design-training system that can encourage and accelerate mould designers’ design alternative exploration, exploitation and optimisation for better design in less time. This research innovates the existing old-fashioned manual FMCRLD workflow with the innovative evolutionary FMCRLD approach to streamline the mould development workflow starting from the early CMLD phase to the later detail design phase and downstream manufacturing phase. In the future, the ICMLDS prototype can be further improved and developed to support hot runner pin-point gate design and overcome the fitness evaluation and GA optimisation issues. Most importantly, this research demonstrates the power of the evolutionary design approach using GA combined with SA in automating and optimising combinatorial and generative FMCRLD. This research also provides a deeper insight into the art of evolutionary design and explores a new direction for research of complex combinatorial and generative layout design automation and optimisation.
