                  A physically based approach to model vehicle dynamics, transient engine performance and engine thermal management system is presented. This approach enables modeling dynamic processes in the individual components and is the dynamic interaction of all relevant domains. The modeling framework is based on a common innovative solver, where all processes are solved using tailored numerical techniques suited to account for characteristic time scales of individual domains. This approach enables achieving very short computational times of the overall model. The paper focuses on the integration of cooling and lubrication models into the framework of a vehicle dynamics simulation including transient engine performance demonstrated on a modern passenger car featuring split cooling functionality. A validated model with a mechanically driven coolant pump provides the base for analyzing the impact of introducing an electrically driven coolant pump. Analyses are performed for two drive cycles featuring significantly different velocity profiles to reveal their influences on the operational principles of the powertrain components and their interaction. The results show for both drive cycles fuel saving due to the application of the electric water pump is relatively small and amounts between 0.75% and 1.1%. However, it is important to address that application of the electric coolant pump results in higher turbine outlet temperatures and thus in faster catalyst heat-up. Detailed analyses of the interaction between vehicle dynamics, transient engine performance and engine thermal management system provide insight into the underlying mechanisms. This is made possible by the application of physically based system level model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Global concerns on sustainable energy use and environmental protection call for innovative powertrain technologies. Optimizing the vehicle thermal management is considered as one of the measures to reduce fuel consumption and to lower exhaust emissions. This paper therefore analyzes differences in fuel consumption and in catalyst heat up caused by two different approaches for propelling and controlling the coolant pump, a mechanical belt/gear propulsion and an electric motor propulsion are compared.

Different topologies of electrified cooling system for internal combustion engines are investigated in [1–3], where results indicate that advanced thermal topologies can reduce fuel consumption for 1–3% through lower parasitic losses of the coolant pump and minimized coolant temperature fluctuations. In [4] the authors focus on mechatronic components used in cooling system (i.e. smart thermostat valve, electric coolant pump, variable speed radiator fan), on proper controlling and on synchronized data exchanges between selected components as all these aspects are important to realize fuel economy enhancements under different driving scenarios. Similarly, in [5] the proper controllability of components is exposed as the key element in achieving enhanced fuel economy. It is further reported in [5] that when the electric water pump runs with a higher coolant temperature set point of 110°C, a fuel reduction of 2–5% is achieved compared to the baseline set point of 90°C. This is also in line with results presented in [6], reporting that higher coolant temperatures reduce brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and that the warm-up period can be shortened by maximum 25% through a zero flow strategy of the coolant pump. In [7] the authors present a theoretical analysis of an optimized cooling system applied to an internal combustion engine (ICE) powered passenger car. It was shown that the largest fuel saving potentials, even up to 6–28%, can be achieved in urban driving condition. These very high fuel saving values mainly originate from the fact that study is based on a theoretical assessment of potential improvements, which among others include the assumption of instantaneous engine warm-up. One of the main motivations to integrate an electric coolant pump is a significantly reduced power consumption of the electrically driven over the mechanically driven pump. The study [8] reports that the electrically driven pump reduces the energy consumption by 99% compared to mechanically driven pump. This reduction mainly arises from operation of the coolant pump at much lower speeds being correlated with the actual cooling demand. However, in general it also needs to be considered that a minimum coolant flow should be ensured to avoid potential hot spots in engine as reported in [9].

The assessment of vehicle thermal management requires simultaneous consideration of multiple interacting domains, since its response depends on the driving condition, vehicle parameters, engine operation and overlaying control strategies. System engineering simulations are widely applied to support analyses of complex interactions between components in multi domain models [8,10–13]. Complete vehicle models generally includes the domain of mechanical drive train, electrical circuit, internal combustion engine, exhaust aftertreatment, cooling circuit and corresponding control units. To efficiently support these analyses, system engineering models have to feature fast computational times in off-line (office) applications, as vast numbers of configurations need to be examined during early concept and design phases of the powertrain development. Besides the computational speed, accuracy and predictability also significantly influence the applicability of system engineering simulations. In the context of this paper predictability is the degree to which an adequate prediction can be made by the model without any prior model calibration. A high level of predictability is particularly required when evaluating powertrain performance in different operating regimes, where physically plausible response of individual components and adequate interaction between the components is mandatory.

System level studies on vehicle thermal management systems that include their interaction with the engine performance and emissions parameters generally rely on the data driven models of particular domains, i.e. powertrain subsystems. Similarly, data driven engine models are also widely used in other system level studies, where besides steady state maps, e.g. [8,14,15], surrogate models are used also, e.g. [16]. Such models feature significant limitations when applied to transient conditions that are far from steady-state. This is even more pronounced for turbocharged engines with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as analyzed in [17]. To overcome these deficiencies hybrid engine models are often used combining surrogate approaches like Static Neural Networks [18] or Support Vector Machines [19] with physical based model parts. In addition, there have been several attempts to develop data driven transient emission models [14,15,20]. However, both steady-state and transient data driven models require upfront data for populating maps for training the surrogate models. These data might not yet be fully available at very early stages in the development process. It is therefore advantageous to use physical based models, e.g. [12,13,21–25], as they rely on first order principles and physically motivated correlations. In addition, they also inherently consider changes in engine controls, thermal behavior of the engine, variations in gas state and composition as well as turbocharger lagging via deterministic approaches. This enables more adequate modeling of the engine performance.

In order to comply with the mentioned requirements on computational speed and predictability, this paper presents an advanced modeling approach that is capable of modeling dynamic processes in the individual components and dynamic interaction of all relevant domains using a common numerical solver framework. This brings advantages over the co-simulations of specialized tools for modeling particular domains due to the possibility to optimally couple different domains [12].This is reached by introducing an innovative tailored solver framework suited to account for the characteristic time scales of the individual domains and the domain coupling. All modeled domains do not depend only on current state, i.e. behave quasi-steady, but they also depend on the recent history, whereby each domain features one or more distinct characteristic time scales as presented in [13]. The paper at hand focuses on the integration of an Engine Thermal Management (ETM) model into a vehicle dynamics simulation [26,27] also taking into account transient engine performance [27–29].

The modeling framework, as it includes a very detailed ETM model, is applied to analyze different thermal management approaches of a passenger car under a variety of realistic driving scenarios. The analysis is based on a validated model of a 1.2ton passenger car powered by a 4 cylinder 1.6l turbocharged gasoline direct injection engine (TGDI) that interacts with a split ETM circuit. A baseline cooling topology with a mechanically driven coolant pump is compared to a cooling topology incorporating electrically driven coolant pump. Both cooling topologies are assessed under different driving conditions to reveal drive cycle specific differences of the two cooling concepts.

Modeling of system engineering configurations requires a careful selection of the physical depth of the models used to describe phenomena in particular domains to optimize the computational performance of the overall model. In addition, it is necessary to consider the characteristic time scales of the modeled phenomena to improve computational speed and numerical robustness by avoiding stiffness of the overall system matrix, as discussed in [13,26]. In such an approach, domains that are integrated with the same time steps represent sub-matrices in the overall system matrix. This time domain decoupling goes along with the application of dedicated routines that ensure inter-domain flux conservation. The characteristics of the individual domains are discussed in detail in the following sections.

The vehicle model presented in Fig. 1
                         accounts for aerodynamic drag and longitudinal vehicle dynamics. The mechanical drivetrain comprises library components such as gearboxes, transmissions, clutches, final gears, tires, and brakes [30]. A dedicated driver model steers acceleration and brake pedal, steers the clutch pedal and also selects the gears for the manual transmission gearboxes. Following the forward facing approach, the driver model observes difference between the actual vehicle velocity and the velocity given by a drive-cycle profile and acts appropriately to meet the target velocity.

The vehicle and the driveline can be seen as a mechanical multi-body system represented by rotational degrees of freedom. According to [26] such systems can mathematically be represented by

The presented analysis use an explicit time integration scheme, where time steps the order of one millisecond are commonly used to integrate the mechanical system [26]. Thereby it is ensured that the typical drivetrain dynamics of interest in the energy management studies is appropriately resolved.

On the system level, there is a great demand on establishing an appropriate level of model details and its prediction accuracy. This is particularly challenging for models of internal combustion engines [12]. Physical based modeling is a sound approach for analyzing a wide variety of steady state operation points and also transient operating conditions. This is important in the present study as cold start runs of turbocharged engine with split cooling of engine head and block are analyzed.

The 0D engine model of this study relies on an advanced time domain decoupling approach where physical domains featuring higher and lower frequency effects are splitted. The high frequency in-cylinder and associated heat and mass transfer phenomena are resolved with smaller time steps whereas the 0D gas path models applies a larger time steps able to capture the main flow characteristics. The interaction between the domains is performed in a flux conservative manner. As presented in [27–31] the concept of 0D gas path modeling relies on the coupling of so called storage and transfer components in an alternating manner. Storage elements comprise elements with finite inertia that are described by a state, e.g. the cylinder and plenum state comprises mass, temperature/pressure and species mass fractions. In the solid structure elements, the temperature is the one and only considered state. The transient variation of the state itself is a result of fluxes from adjacent transfer elements. Fluxes of the gas path, comprise mass, enthalpy, species flows, whereas heat transfer elements feature only heat fluxes. This generic framework enables the generation of model equations for arbitrary engine gas path topologies. It is given by

                         is made in order to model sources within transfer elements, e.g. the enthalpy flow through a compressor element is augmented at its downstream side by power coming from the shaft.

This generic framework also enables the coupling between the high frequency engine block and low frequency gas path domain as presented in [12]. It is coupled to a mean value gas path model. These two domains are indicated in Fig. 2
                        , where the cross domain coupling is performed in the transfer elements attached to the cylinder. These elements ensure inter-domain flux conservation. Thus, they feature a twofold functionality. First, they provide cyclic mean fluxes to the mean value gas path model. Second they provide cyclic resolved fluxes to the crank angle resolved cylinder model. Refs. [12,13,27] confirm capability of this modeling approach to adequately model phenomena in the engines that do not exhibit significant enhancements of volumetric efficiency due to wave dynamics. This is the case for the analyzed engine as shown in [27].

The engine block domain is indicated with blue dashed line in Fig. 2. All in-cylinder phenomena comprising heat and mass transfer, combustion and generation of indicated work transferred to the piston are modeled on a crank-angle (CA) basis. The basic modeling ideas on 0D cylinder modeling are presented in [31], whereas a detailed description of the governing equations applied in the model is given in [28,29]. The main equations are only briefly summarized subsequently. The state and flux vectors in the cylinder are represented by

The mass flow rates through the intake and the exhaust ports are calculated by the compressible orifice equation [32]. Direct fuel injection is modeled by connecting an injector element to the cylinder, where operation point specific injection timings and flow rates are applied. In the present model, heat transfer from the combustion chamber to the cylinder walls (connected by so called heat transfer components in Fig. 2) is modeled by correlations taken from literature [33]. The heat transfer in ports is modeled according to the model proposed in [34]. The combustion is approached by Vibe’s functions [35] where the Vibe parameters are given in tables over the entire speed-load engine operation map. The Vibe parameters are determined from rate of heat release data that are evaluated based on the experimental in-cylinder pressure traces. The Vibe combustion model is used, since it well describes the RoHR curves of the analyzed engine and since in the case of the analyzed engine a large experimental data pool is available.

The engine gas path domain is indicated by the red color in Fig. 2. The engine gas path is discretized on the level of components such as plenums representing intake and exhaust manifolds, air cleaner, compressor, inter-cooler, throttle valve, turbine and catalyst. It is modeled by a mean value approach [36].

The gas path is also solved using a generic set of model equations, i.e. Eqs. (2) and (3). The state vector in the plenum is given by

                           where p is pressure. The first law of thermodynamics in the volume components is solved using a reformulated expression where the pressure is explicitly given. This approach is beneficial because all flows between storage elements strongly depend on pressures, which are primarily solved by the numerical integration scheme. Fluxes in transfer elements (Eq. (3)) are evaluated considering component specific characteristics , i.e. air cleaner, compressor, inter-cooler, throttle valve, turbine and catalyst, as given in [27,29], whereas ports exchange mass with the gas path by cyclic averaged values of the fluxes [12].

Transient 1D models are generally used to model either single catalysts or also entire exhaust lines [29,37–39]. In a generic bond-graph approach the exhaust aftertreatment devices are also split to transfer and storage elements. The transfer characteristic describes the flow through the catalyst, while the storage characteristic is considered for the catalyst substrate and the surface reactions. In the present TGDI engine a simplified Three-Way-Catalyst (TWC) model is included to adequately cover only heat transfer phenomena in the exhaust system. Pollutant formation in the cylinders, its transport through the gas path and its subsequent conversion in the catalytic converter are not considered as this study focuses on the thermal behavior of the powertrain.

This advanced modeling approach ensures a high level of predictability and accuracy during transient engine simulations [27]. In-cylinder phenomena and fluxes through the attached transfer components are integrated with integration increments that correspond to 1deg CA and the gas path is integrated with integration time steps of 1ms. Such an approach enables adequate modeling of the interaction between the cylinder and intake at exhaust manifold, since the exchange of mass, enthalpy and species masses is based on physical models for the flow through the valves. Moreover, this modeling approach inherently considers turbo-lagging and all its consequences [27]. Additionally, wall heat losses and fuel injection are modeled on crank-angle basis. This is also beneficial for the adequacy of transient results, where it is important to capture back-influences from the solid structure temperature on the indicated cylinder work. An adequate distribution of cylinder heat losses to the engine block and head is mandatory for the heat-up analysis of the engine featuring split cooling between block and head. This heat distribution varies depending on engine operating conditions and with varying temperature of the combustion chamber walls. Thus a physical based modeling is required to adequately distribute all heat fluxes that further influence the responses of each cooling branch.

Components of the Engine Thermal Management (ETM) domain (Fig. 3
                        ) serve as heat sinks of the heat released during combustion, of the heat generated by frictional losses in the engine and in the turbocharger.

The ETM topology is composed out of a series of base components. These components can be split into three groups. The first group comprises liquid fluid flow and related heat transfer components. The second group comprises solid structure components and the third group comprises convective heat transfer components to the gas path. The liquid flow network group consists of elements for pumps, valves, nodes, junctions, pipes, liquid heat exchangers elements (LHE) and convective liquid heat transfer elements (CvLHT). All components feature generic mass flow functionalities. The last three components additionally feature heat transfer to the solid structure and thus represent the interaction components for the flow to the solid structure group. The solid structure group comprises lumped mass (LM) components that are used to generate various solid structure configuration and conductive heat transfer components (CdHT) that transfer heat between LM components. Components of the solid structure group interact with the engine domain via the third group of components that comprise convective gas heat transfer components (CvGHT). In addition, CvGHT components are also used to model heat transfer to the surrounding including the passenger compartment.

CvGHT components represent the interaction between the ETM and the engine domain as indicated in Figs. 2 and 3. This framework is applied to transport heat from the combustion chamber via the CvGHT and LM components to the coolant and oil circuit and further to the ambient (Fig. 3). The applied modeling depth thus enables adequate description of the heat fluxes from the combustion chamber to the piston, the liner and the head. In addition, this component topology is also used to model the heat flux between coolant and oil circuit. The proposed approach enables adequate modeling of the heat capacity of the block engine structure and of the liquids in the ETM domain. The complex structure of the engine block and head is resolved using LM and CdHT components that are appropriately compiled to represent their geometries (Fig. 3). Thereby heterogeneous temperature fields can be modeled in the larger components. In addition, an appropriate coupling of these engine structure components with components of the liquid circuits allows for modeling heat fluxes in all three spatial dimensions as shown in Fig. 3.

The liquid flow model of the ETM domain assumes incompressible, non-isothermal conditions. The assumption of incompressibility is well justified with the operating conditions of cooling and lubrication circuits focusing on thermal management investigations. The ETM circuits additionally feature two different characteristic time scales. The shorter time scale is related to establishing the mass flow pattern, whereas the longer one is related to the thermal response of the cooling circuits. In addition, the energy equation of incompressible flows is not directly coupled to the continuity and momentum balance equation. Thus, governing equations of the liquid flow can be solved in a decoupled manner, where the flow field equations (mass and momentum) are solved as quasi-steady and the energy flow field equations are solved transiently. Due to the fact that the thermal response of the engine’s liquids is very slow, the energy equation was integrated with time step in the order of 100ms.

The solid structure of the engine connects domains that are integrated with different time steps, the high frequency domain of the cylinder, the medium frequency domain of gas path and the low frequency domain of the cooling circuit. Here, it is necessary to ensure energy conservation in all lumped mass elements. This is made possible by the fact that characteristic time scale of the solid structure components, representing the engine on a system level, is much larger than the integration time steps of the cylinder, the gas path and the energy flow field in the cooling circuits.

The LMs are attached integrated together with energy flow field of the cooling circuit. Therefore it can be assumed that temperature of LM elements does not change significantly within one time step of the energy flow field of the cooling circuit. With this assumption, consistent heat fluxes from engine gas path or from the cylinder to the LM elements can be integrated over the period of one integration step of the coolant energy flow circuit.

The solution of the model equations describing an incompressible flow field can be seen in analogy to electrical networks described by Kirchhoff laws. The mass conservation is given by

The pressure drop in the valve is modeled using the orifice equation [40], which dependents on valve type and on valve opening ratio. The pressure loss Δp
                           loss in pipes and LHE components is calculated as

The friction coefficient is calculated using the Hagen–Poiseuille equation [41] for laminar flow conditions and the Chen equation [42] for turbulent flow. A similar approach can also be used in a CvLHT component. The friction coefficient in LHEs is evaluated depending on Reynolds number [43]. Here, the coefficients of the Reynolds correlation are adjusted to the specific LHE components with the help of the experimental data.

The junction component is aimed for modeling three-way junctions. A generic pressure drop is calculated from [44] based on the flow pattern, which is steered by the pressures in all three attachments, and the junction geometry. This is given by

The fluid temperature changes along the flow direction and, perpendicular to this direction, the heat is transferred to the LM components. Here, in addition to the convection on both surfaces also conduction along the 1D discretized LM elements is considered.

The heat transfer coefficient in pipes is calculated using Sieder and Tate’s correlation [41] for laminar flow conditions and Gnielinski correlation [41] for turbulent flow. In CvLHT components which aim at simulating convection between LM components and the liquids flow, the heat transfer is either explicitly given (Eq. (28)) or modeled by a constant Nusselt number in laminar flow conditions and by the Dittus–Boelter correlation [41] in turbulent flow. In case of LHE component, the heat transfer coefficient follows Hausen’ correlation [41] for laminar flow while for turbulent flow Sieder and Tate’s correlation [41] is taken. As an additional option in heat transfer modeling, the LHE components also include external 3D maps with measurement data to cover different geometrical configurations.

In order to operate the engine, cooling, drivetrain and vehicle during transient conditions several closed and open loop controls are integrated into a simple model of an engine control unit (ECU).The engine operation is controlled by steering position of the throttle in the intake, position of the waste-gate, mass of injected fuel, injection profile, ignition timing and camshaft phasing of the intake valve. The ECU model includes also an idle speed controller that over rules fuel injection control depending on engine operating conditions. In addition, ECU model steers fan operation and pump speed in the case of the electric coolant pump topology. All input data of the ECU, except the ones of the control strategies of the electric coolant pump, are based on experimental values measured for a wide range of parameter variations.

The engine block and the engine gas path equations as well as the liquid circuit energy flow equations follow the above given generic form of first order ODEs. The mechanical system typically features additional linear constraints which can be algebraically substituted into the system.

To optimize the computational performance, tailored solver techniques are applied, that do not integrate the entire system with the time steps dictated by the phenomena featuring the shortest characteristic times. Instead, phenomena with the shortest characteristic times are modeled quasi-steady. This is the liquid circuit mass flows. As a result, the entire equation system is represented by a system matrix, whereas domains that are integrated with the same time steps represent sub-matrices in the overall system matrix. Within such an approach it is of utmost importance to reserve conservation principles, which is done by integrating fluxes of the domains integrated with shorter time steps.

Input parameters of the model include geometrical characteristics of the elements and specific characteristics of the elements, e.g. characteristic maps of compressor, turbine and pumps, heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of the heat transfer elements, losses in driveline components and combustion parameters. These specific component characteristics rely either on manufacturer’s data or are derived from the measured data. Within a particular domain, network of elements exchanges parameters in a domain specific manner as described in previous sections, i.e. Eq. (1) for the vehicle and driveline domain, Eqs. (4) and (5) for the engine domain and Eqs. (16) and (22) for the engine thermal management domain. In addition, Fig. 4
                         schematically shows exchange of parameters between different domains.

The capability of the overall vehicle and powertrain model to adequately simulate transient vehicle operation was presented in [29], where chassis-dynamometer measurements were compared to numerically simulated results of a conventional ICE powered vehicle equipped with a 6-speed manual gear box. Therefore, in-line with the objective of this study, results related to the integration of an engine thermal management model into a vehicle dynamics simulation are addressed in the next section.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In the present study a compact class passenger car with a gross weight of 1.2 tons and a manual 6 speed gear box is investigated (Fig. 1). The vehicle is powered by a four cylinder 1.6 l turbocharged gasoline direct injection (TGDI) engine developing 125kW @ 6400rpm (Fig. 2). The engine is equipped with an intercooler, a waste-gate turbocharger and a three-way catalyst. In the analyses, the coolant circuit uses two pump variants. As the baseline configuration a mechanically driven pump is applied and compared to a configuration with an electrically driven pump. The latter is controlled by a dedicated ECU model.

The lubrication circuit consists of a volumetric type oil pump, which pumps oil from the oil pan through the oil filter and the oil-coolant heat exchanger to the main head gallery (camshaft and crankshaft bearings) and to the turbocharger side. Besides its lubricating functionality, the oil also absorbs heat from the different engine parts. In addition, piston cooling through oil jet directed to the bottom of piston is considered. The oil temperature is regulated by the oil-coolant heat exchanger, which generally acts as oil cooler during warm engine conditions but also as oil heater during the warm-up period. The oil pan represents another important heat sink of the oil. The lubricating circuit is additionally equipped with a pressure valve. It opens when the pressure level is high enough (i.e. oil is heated to a sufficiently high temperature), enabling piston cooling through oil jets directed to the bottom of the piston.

The coolant is driven by a coolant pump, in two optional configurations. In the first configuration the pump is mechanically connected to the engine shaft (mechanical water pump – MWP). In the second configuration the coolant pump is driven by an electric motor (electric water pump – EWP). Unlike the MWP, the speed of the EWP is controlled considering engine power and coolant temperature observed after engine block. The EWP is operated in a way that it always ensures a characteristic minimal volumetric flow of the cooling medium (also for a cold engine). This corresponds in the analyzed case to a pump speed 50rpm. A minimum volumetric flow prevents boiling phenomena and overheating in hot spots (e.g. exhaust port bridge) and thus reduces thermo-mechanical stresses of the components that are exposed to heterogeneous temperature fields. For all simulated pump modifications the total pump efficiencies have been estimated from pump manufacturers’ available data.

The cooling circuit is equipped with two thermostats where the main thermostat regulates the flow through radiator. The second one regulates the temperature of the coolant in the engine block. In the vehicle with the EWP, the characteristics of these two thermostats are modified. The opening/closing hysteresis of the thermostat in the EWP configuration was shifted upwards for 5°C compared to hysteresis used in the MWP configurations. This modification is made possible by the operational principle of the EWP that enables nearly instantaneous increase of the coolant mass flow irrespective of the engine speed. Higher coolant temperatures results in higher temperatures of the combustion chamber walls leading to lower heat fluxes from the working medium to the walls and thus to higher engine efficiency. When the temperature of the coolant is below the target temperature for the main thermostat opening, all mass flow is delivered to the oil-coolant heat exchanger and to the cabin heater. Here, the temperature of the passenger compartment is set to 20°C. As soon as the main thermostat opening temperature is reached, the coolant starts flowing through the radiator, where it is cooled by the external air flow. The air flow through the radiator considers ram effect due to vehicle velocity, which is adequately reduced due to screening of the grill and also due to the fan pressure drop when it is wind-milling. When the fan is actively driven it additionally increases the pressure drop across the radiator and thus it increases the external air mass flow.

To reduce fuel consumption through the application of the EWP it is necessary to reduce the amount of mechanical energy extracted from the crankshaft used to power the coolant pump. Here it is important to address that electric energy is produced with relatively low efficiency in the conventional ICE, which does not feature regenerative braking as given in the presented analysis. The mechanical energy of the shaft is converted to electric energy by the alternator. This electric energy is at least partially stored in the batteries and later converted back to mechanical energy in the electric motor. To ensure a reduced fuel consumption through the application of the EWP, it is thus not sufficient just to reduce the mass flow of the EWP below the one of the MWP. It is necessary to ensure that the lower power consumption of the EWP also compensates for the additional losses due to mechanic-electric-mechanic energy conversion. As the efficiency of the engine is not constant over a transient drive cycle it is not possible to quantify these influences by a simple analytic analysis, which reasons the application of the coupled system engineering simulation.

Engine parameters were measured using AVL measurement and data acquisition equipment. Engine performance was measured on a dynamic engine test bed capable of performing steady-state and transient tests (speed measurement accuracy ±1rpm and torque measurement accuracy ±0.2% full scale). The dynamic engine test bed is equipped with the AVL PUMA OPEN control system. The test bed features several additional acquisition possibilities, whereas only the ones relevant for the presented study are listed below: the fuel flow meter with fuel cooling system (accuracy ±0.1%); intake air quantity measuring device (accuracy ±1% of reading); blowby meterning device (accuracy ±1.5% full scale output); temperature sensor Pt 100 (accuracy ±0.1°C) and Pt 1000 (accuracy ±0.2°C); pressure sensor (accuracy ±0.1% full scale output) and barometric pressure sensor (accuracy ±0.5mbar); and AVL INDICOM indicating and data processing system. On the engine test bed, coolant temperature, lubrication oil and air were conditioned with the AVL conditioning equipment that allows for the following temperature conditioning tolerances for coolant ±1°C, oil ±1°C and air ±0.5°C as well as for the pressure conditioning tolerance of air ±1mbar.

A comprehensive validation of the engine model is presented in [27]. Only selected validations of the basic engine parameters, which are of main interest for this study, are presented. The validation of the SI engine model is performed at eight different speeds from 700rpm to 6400rpm with five load variations. A comparison between experimental and simulation data is performed by injecting the same amount of fuel (Fig. 5
                        c) while considering injection timings provided by the ECU. In addition, the ECU adjusted the throttle position and waste-gate opening. Fig. 5 shows very good agreement between measured and simulated steady state data. The good correlation of measured and simulated air mass flow (Fig. 5b) and intake manifold pressure (Fig. 5d) indicates comparable volumetric efficiency. This agreement is crucial for the accuracy at steady-state and particularly during transient engine simulations.

The good agreement of measured and simulated Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) (Fig. 5a) indicates in combination with the adequate air (Fig. 5b) and fuel (Fig. 5c) flows also adequate values of effective engine efficiency. This further confirms the adequacy of the cylinder combustion and wall heat loss models. This is also underlined by the agreement in exhaust gas temperature (Fig. 5f). The correlation of boost pressure, exhaust gas temperature and exhaust pressure (Fig. 5e) confirms an adequate modeling of compressor, turbine and of the thermodynamic state in the exhaust manifold.

The NEDC run is performed on a four wheel chassis dynamometer Zöllner 48″ equipped with an air steam blower and acquisition devices for parameters of engine and engine thermal management listed with the engine measurement equipment. The nominal tractive force per axle is 6667N (±0.1% of full scale) at velocity below 108km/h while maximum velocity is 250km/h (±0.02km/h).

The good agreement of engine parameters constitutes the basis for the validation of transient vehicle performances. During validation procedure the performance test for full load vehicle acceleration is considered. However, this is done at hot engine conditions. The first validation aims at validating the time needed for acceleration from stand still to 100km/h and to maximum vehicle velocity. Therefore, this first validation test implies also adequacy of the vehicle and the driveline model. It can be observed in Table 1
                         that the experimental and simulated values agree within 1% for all observed parameters.

This good agreement forms the basis for the comparison of experimental and simulated fuel consumption over the NEDC cold start (Table 1). In addition to all previous validations, this comparison is crucial for confirming adequacy of the cooling model. Therefore, it is first important that the simulated heat-up times of the coolant (Fig. 6
                        a) and of the oil (Fig. 6b) agree well with the measured ones and second that simulated and measured fuel consumption (Table 1) agree well. All validation steps indicate that the overall vehicle model and its sub-models feature a high level of fidelity and thus form a good basis for analyses of modified cooling topologies and operating condition.

The simulation results focus on two drive cycles featuring significantly different velocity profiles aiming to reveal their influences on the operational principles of the powertrain components and their interaction. The Japanese test cycle JC08 is selected as it leads to very low average engine power consumption. The Artemis Motorway 150km/h drive cycle is selected as it features a very high average engine power consumption. The differences due to the application of a mechanical versus an electrical coolant pump are compared for the two drive cycles.

The results of the Japanese test cycle JC08 are analyzed first. Thus these results form the basis for comparative analyses. It is characteristic for the JC08 that the average and maximum power required to power the vehicle over the cycle are relatively low. This is due to the low average velocity (Fig. 7
                           a). As a result, the engine operates at relatively low engine speeds (Fig. 7b) and engine power (Fig. 7c). The average engine speed equals approximately 1300rpm and the average effective power is about 2.85kW. A slightly lower average effective engine power is observed for the EWP configuration due to reduced power needed for powering the coolant pump. During low engine power requirements it is certainly beneficial to operate the engine at relatively low engine speeds (Fig. 7b and c) in order to omit high mechanical losses. However during steady-state cruising at low and moderate vehicle velocities the engine efficiency is relatively low. The average effective efficiency of the engine is lower than 9%, due to a low mechanical engine efficiency at the power outputs of just a few kilowatts.


                           Fig. 7a presents good agreement between target and actual vehicle velocity simulated for the transient drive cycle. This confirms the capability of the forward-facing driver model and the capability of the ECU model to adequately steer the engine. A limited amount of peak values in engine power curve can be seen in Fig. 7c and b for engine speed. This is caused by the fast response of the forward-facing driver model during drive away from stand still. The throttled engine does not respond instantaneously to changed acceleration pedal position due to a finite inertia of the intake manifold, leading to a certain response delay needed between throttle opening and increase of in-cylinder mass and thus engine power. Not being aware of these effects the driver model further presses the acceleration pedal resulting in an overshot of engine power (Fig. 7c) and of engine speed (Fig. 7b) in the first instance of the drive away from stand still. As these periods are very short and the energy produced by the engine during these period is stored as angular momentum in rotating parts, which is later transferred to the energy needed for vehicle propulsion, these power output peaks have negligible influence on the vehicle fuel consumption over the compete drive cycle.


                           Fig. 7d shows a comparison of the coolant flow velocities simulated for the MWP and EWP configuration. It can be seen that the mechanically driven pump runs with the same speed as the engine and thus the volumetric flow corresponds nearly linearly to engine speed. Due to the absence of any speed control of the MWP, the MWP delivers an excessive coolant mass flow during the warm up period. Higher mass flows lead to higher heat fluxes from the engine to the coolant conducted by higher heat transfer coefficients and higher cooling capacity. This heat absorption behavior of the coolant is partially compensated by keeping closed both thermostat valves during the warm up period (Fig. 7e). Despite this fact the engine with the MWP is characterized by a slower heat up of the coolant (Fig. 7f). In contrast the EWP, which is selectively controlled by the engine power output and the coolant temperature, delivers only a minimum coolant mass flow during the warm-up period (Fig. 7d). During that period, EWP mass flow is therefore smaller for approximately an order of magnitude compared to the MWP configuration. As a result, the coolant of the engine with the EWP heats up faster (Fig. 7f) and thus also the head thermostat opens earlier (Fig. 7e). Unlike the head thermostat, the block thermostat of the EWP configuration opens slightly later compared to the one of the engine with the MWP. This is related to the fact that entire engine block features a high thermal capacity and requires longer time to warm up. The faster engine heat up indirectly improves fuel economy by lowering mechanical losses. Smaller mass flow of the coolant also directly enhances fuel economy by lowering the power needed for propulsion of the cooling pump for 99%.

Regardless of the significantly faster warm up of the coolant in the EWP engine, the heat up behavior of the lubricating oil (Fig. 7f) does not follow the same trend. During warm up period, the oil is mainly heated by the hot engine components and by the heat generated through friction. These two contributions are very similar for both pump configurations are relatively small due to the low average engine power and speed. In addition, during the engine warm up- period the oil is also heated through the oil cooler. During this period the oil cooler rather acts like an oil heater as the temperature of the coolant is higher than the temperature of the oil. The temperature of the coolant is significant higher for the EWP engine during the heat up period, which does favor higher heat transfer. But, it is also necessary to consider much smaller coolant mass flows leading to significantly lower heat transfer coefficients on the coolant side, as they strongly depend on velocity. Therefore, the heat flux from the coolant to the oil is smaller for the EWP configuration during the warm up period and thus the oil heats up slower compared to the MWP configuration (Fig. 7f).

For the EWP configuration the water temperature reaches its operating value after 420s, while for the MWP configuration the coolant operating temperature is reached after 470s (Fig. 7f). The higher operating temperature of the coolant in the EWP configuration is dictated by the thermostat settings. The results also show a slightly higher oil temperature after the engine warm-up period. A higher oil temperature reduces frictional losses due to a lower oil viscosity. Therefore, the friction mean effective pressure (FMEP) of the EWP engine is higher during the engine warm-up period (Fig. 7f) and lower afterwards. As a result, the frictional engine losses are similar over the entire cycle for both pump configurations.

The temperature evolution of coolant and oil also influences the heat up behavior of the combustion chamber walls. The head temperature (Fig. 7g) of the MWP configuration is characterized by a slightly faster heat-up trend compared to the EWP configuration as the head is directly cooled only by the coolant. Unlike, the liner (Fig. 7h) and the piston (Fig. 7i) temperature of the MWP configuration are characterized by similar heat up trends as they are also cooled also with oil.


                           Fig. 7j shows the temperature of exhaust gasses after the turbine. The temperature of exhaust gases is influenced by the temperature of the combustion chamber walls, of the exhaust ports and of the exhaust manifold (the mass flow and the intake temperature of the air/fuel charge and the spark advance are very similar for both pump configurations). In addition to the cylinder head, both the exhaust port and the exhaust manifold are also hotter during the heat up period of the EWP configuration as the heat transfer to the coolant is smaller due to its lower volumetric flow. Therefore, the temperature of the exhaust gasses of the EWP configuration features 5–30°C higher values during the warm up period (Fig. 7j), which notably contributes to faster heat up of the catalyst.

In the JC08 drive cycle, the fuel saving of the engine with the EWP compared to the MWP amounts 1.1%. This fuel saving is mainly achieved by reduced energy needed for powering the pump and a marginal improvement of the thermal efficiency due to a slightly lower heat transfer to the combustion chamber walls. Savings due to lower pump energy consumption are observed during the complete driving cycle, whereas they are more pronounced during the heat up period. Here the coolant pump provides only a minimum volumetric flow to prevent an occurrence of hot spots.

The “Artemis” Motorway 150km/h drive cycle represents a significantly more aggressive drive cycle compared to the JC08. It is characterized by high vehicle velocities (Fig. 8
                           a). Therefore the average engine power (Fig. 8c) over the Artemis is more than 18.5kW, with a slightly lower value for the engine with EWP due to its lower power consumption. The value of the average engine speed (Fig. 8b) is in the range of 3600rpm and the effective engine efficiency is slightly higher than 23% for both cooling configurations. The higher effective engine efficiency is to a large extent the consequence of a higher mechanical efficiency.


                           Fig. 8f shows the coolant and oil temperature profiles for the Artemis cycle. It can be seen that the heat up time is much shorter than for JC08 cycle which is certainly related to the higher engine speed and power output. The higher heat rejection rate through the coolant is reflected in a larger volumetric flow of the coolant (Fig. 8d). It ranges at higher levels compared to the JC08 cycle (Fig. 6d) for both pump configurations. Also, the head thermostat features a faster opening (Fig. 8e) then in JC08. Due to the selective control of the EWP, the coolant reaches its operating temperature much faster for the EWP configuration. In the Artemis cycle, and in contrast to the JC08, the oil also reaches its operating temperature faster for the EWP configuration. This is related to the fact that after the initial phase of slightly lower oil temperature (Fig. 8f – up to approx. 150s), which can be reasoned with lower heat transfer due to lower coolant mass flow, the coolant volumetric flow (Fig. 8d) of the EWP configuration increases due to the increased need for heat absorption. Thus, larger volumetric flows of the hotter coolant enhance heat transfer to the oil resulting in its faster heat up. The Artemis cycle is also characterized by the relatively high oil temperature for both pump configurations, which can be related to high engine power output and high engine speed as they represent the two main heat sources of the oil.

The high engine power output also results in a higher average temperature of the cylinder head (Fig. 8g), of the liner (Fig. 8h), of the piston (Fig. 8i) and in a higher average temperature of the exhaust gasses after the turbine. It can be noted for the Artemis drive cycle that there is larger difference between all temperatures of the combustion chamber walls for the EWP and MWP configuration compared to the JC08. For the Artemis cycle, the heat generation in the combustion chamber is very high. Thus, the EWP configuration features lower volumetric flows of the coolant resulting in reduced heat transfer coefficients. This leads to lower heat rejection to the coolant medium and further to higher temperatures of combustion chamber walls. In addition, the engine with EWP also features significantly higher temperatures of the exhaust gases after the turbine compared to the MWP configuration during the warm-up period (temperature difference from 5 to 55°C), which positively influences a faster heat up of the catalyst.

For the Artemis cycle, the fuel saving of the engine with the EWP over the one with the MWP amounts to 0.75%. The Artemis cycle is thus characterized by lower fuel savings of the EWP over the MWP configuration. This is despite a slightly higher thermal efficiency due to hotter combustion chamber walls and a slightly reduced FMEP due to higher oil temperatures of the engine with the EWP. Lower fuel savings of the EWP configuration for the Artemis cycle therefore originate from much smaller difference in the volumetric flows of the EWP and MWP configuration arising from the need to extract much higher heat fluxes via the coolant compared to the JC08.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The paper presents a physically based approach to model vehicle dynamics, transient engine performance and engine thermal management systems. The approach enables modeling dynamic processes in the individual components and the dynamic interaction of all relevant domains. The paper focuses on the integration of a very detailed lubrication and split cooling circuit into a modeling framework for simulating vehicle dynamics and transient engine performance. The applied modeling depth is of particular importance for enabling physically plausible distribution of heat fluxes from the combustion chamber walls to both branches of the split cooling system. It also enables modeling back influences of the ETM circuits to in-cylinder phenomena. In addition, an overall coupled approach also brings benefits is terms of model-setup and model manipulation. To ensure short computational times innovative solver techniques suited to account for characteristic time scales of individual domains are introduced. This allows for very short computational times of the overall vehicle, engine and thermal network model, which amount to approximately 1.7–1.8 real-time, i.e. physical time being simulated, for different drive cycles during office simulation on a single core of a PC.

The simulation framework is used to evaluate the impact of the different approaches for propelling the coolant pump during two driving cycles featuring significantly different velocity profiles. Analyses were performed using a validated system level model of a passenger car. It was shown that for both drive cycles the fuel saving due to application of an EWP is relatively small and amounts between 0.75% and 1.1%. These results correspond to the lower end of the fuel savings figures published by other researches. This can be explained by the fact that a very modern engine with highly optimized cooling network was selected as the baseline engine. It is shown in the paper that the EWP configuration allows for shorter warm up times of the coolant, which results in slightly higher average combustion chamber wall temperatures and thus in marginally higher indicated efficiency. Higher temperatures of the combustion chamber walls, of the exhaust ports and of the exhaust manifold more importantly increase the exhaust gas temperature during the warm up period. This favors faster light-off of the catalyst. In addition, it was shown that the EWP configuration also allows for higher coolant temperatures as it enables nearly instantaneous increase of the coolant mass flow irrespective of the engine speed. This allows for higher oil temperatures, which results in slight reduced frictional losses after the engine warm-up period. One of the main contributions in reducing fuel consumption of the EWP configuration is the reduced energy needed to power the coolant pump. This mechanism is particularly emphasized for drive cycles with very low average engine load as the need for heat rejection is very small for such cycles. Here, it needs to be considered that the fuel economy is enhanced through this mechanism only if lower power consumption of the EWP is able to at least compensate for losses associated with mechanic-electric-mechanic conversion of the energy needed for powering the EWP.
