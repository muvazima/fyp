                  Burn-in is a method of ‘elimination’ of initial failures (infant mortality). In the conventional burn-in procedures, to burn-in an item means to subject it to a fixed time period of simulated use prior to actual operation. Then, the items which failed during burn-in are just scrapped and only those which survived the burn-in procedure are considered to be of satisfactory quality. Thus, when the items are subject to degradation phenomena, those whose degradation levels at the end of burn-in exceed a given failure threshold level are eliminated. In this paper, we consider a new burn-in procedure for items subject to degradation phenomena and belonging to mixed populations composed of a weak and a strong subpopulation. The new procedure is based on the ‘whole history’ of the degradation process of an item periodically observed during the burn-in and utilizes the information contained in the observed degradation process to assess whether the item belongs to the strong or weak subpopulation. The problem of determining the optimal burn-in parameters is considered and the properties of the optimal parameters are derived. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the theoretical results obtained in this paper.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Burn-in is a method of ‘elimination’ of initial failures (infant mortality). Usually, to burn-in a component or a system means to subject it to a fixed time period of simulated use prior to actual operation. That is, before delivery to the customers, the components or systems are operated under operating conditions that approximate at best the working conditions in field operation. Then, the components or systems which fail during the burn-in procedure will be scrapped or repaired and only those which survived the burn-in procedure will be considered to be of satisfactory quality. These will then be shipped to the customers or put into field operation. Under the assumption of decreasing or bathtub-shaped failure rate functions, various problems of determining optimal burn-in have been intensively studied in the literature. Due to the high failure rate at early stages of component life, burn-in has been widely accepted as an effective method of screening out these initial failures. An introduction to this important area of reliability engineering can be found in Jensen and Petersen (1982) and Kuo and Kuo (1983).

Basically, the type of burn-in can be classified into three categories: (i) burn-in based on lifetime (homogeneous and heterogeneous populations) (ii) burn-in based on shocks (iii) burn-in based on degradation model. In category (i), for some examples, Mi (1994) takes into account both burn-in and maintenance policy at the same time and Cha (2001) studied generalized burn-in procedure for systems which can be minimally repaired. Mi (1996) considered cost model which includes the mean residual lifetime and Block, Savits, and Singh (2002) studied optimal burn-in which balances the mean residual lifetime and the mean residual variance. All the above mentioned works dealt with burn-in under homogeneous population setting. However, in many cases, the initial high failure rate stems from the mixture of stochastically ordered lifetimes (see, e.g., Jensen and Petersen (1982)). Recently, burn-in under heterogeneous population setting have been intensively studied. For instance, Cha and Finkelstein, 2011a, 2012b) studied optimal burn-in under the mixed population setting assuming that the performance of the items depend on the corresponding subpopulation. More recently, burn-in procedure based on shocks (category (ii)) have been intensively studied. Cha and Finkelstein, 2011b, 2013) studied a shock-based burn-in procedure for systems working under shock environment. Cha and Finkelstein (2010, 2012a) considered a shock based burn-in for items from the mixture of stochastically ordered subpopulations. In category (iii), a lot of works assume that the degradation process follows a Wiener process. For instance, Tseng and Tang (2001) studied optimal burn-in based on Wiener degradation process. Tseng, Tang, and Ku (2003) proposed a screening procedure for items from a mixed population. Tseng and Peng (2004) used an integrated Wiener process to model the cumulative wear process in optimal burn-in problem. Ye, Shen, and Xie (2012a) studied joint burn-in and maintenance decisions are to minimize the long run average cost per unit time assuming that the degradation process follows a Wiener process.

However, the Wiener process can be inappropriate for modeling monotone degradation process because it does not necessarily monotonically increasing or decreasing (see, e.g., Tsai et al. (2012)). In this regard, recently, the gamma process is employed to model the degradation phenomena in the study of optimal burn-in. For example, Tsai et al. (2011) studied optimal burn-in problem minimizing total misclassification cost based on gamma degradation model. Ye, Xie, Tang, and Shen (2012b) used gamma process with random effect to model the degradation process.

As burn-in is usually costly, one of the major problems is to determine the duration of this procedure. The best (usually in terms of costs involved) time to stop the burn-in process for a given criterion is called the optimal burn-in time. In the literature, in addition to different reliability performance criteria (see, e.g., Kim & Kuo, 2009), various cost structures have been proposed, and the corresponding problem of finding the optimal burn-in time has been considered (see, for example, Clarotti & Spizzichino, 1990; Mi, 1994; Cha, 2000; Cha & Finkelstein, 2011a; Kim, 2011; Sheu & Chien, 2005). An excellent survey of research in this area can be found in Block and Savits (1997).

In conventional burn-in procedures, to burn-in a component or a system means to subject it to a simulated operation for some time prior to its actual operation. Then, the items which failed during the burn-in period are just scraped and discarded. In this conventional case, the information which is used for the burn-in decision is that whether the item has survived the burn-in period or not. On the other hand, suppose that the items are subject to degradation phenomena and that they belong to a heterogeneous population composed of stochastically ordered subpopulations: strong subpopulation with low degradation rate and weak subpopulation with high degradation rate. Suppose further that the degradation levels of items during burn-in are observable periodically. Then, this operational history of the items conveys important information about the subpopulation from which each item under burn-in comes; then this information can be used for establishing an additional reasonable elimination procedure.

As the degradation process can be described by a continuous stochastic process, from a probabilistic point of view, the ‘operational history’ in this case corresponds to the ‘random paths’ of the corresponding stochastic process. Motivated by this reasoning, a history-dependent burn-in procedure will be suggested and relevant discussions will be given in this paper. In the proposed burn-in procedure, not only the degradation level at the end of burn-in, but also all the degradation levels periodically observed during the burn-in procedure are used for the elimination procedure. From a statistical methodological aspect, the proposed burn-in procedure utilizes ‘likelihood ratio statistic’ for the elimination procedure. To the authors’ knowledge, this type of burn-in procedure has not been yet considered in the literature and this is one of the most important differences from the other degradation-based burn-in models from a methodological point of view.

In general, our method has a wide range of applications where the degradation phenomenon is the cause of the item failure. For instance, plasma display panels, vacuum fluorescent displays, liquid crystal displays and digital light processing projectors, the contact image scanner (CIS) of a copy/fax machine, laser diodes and the optical fiber in high-speed computer networks or communication systems, and numerous other dependable systems.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the population structure will be described and the population lifetime distribution will be defined. In Section 3, the history-dependent burn-in procedure will be defined and, based on it, the objective function to be optimized will be obtained. Under the suggested mathematical framework, general discussions on the burn-in procedure will be provided. A numerical example will also be provided for illustration, where a Monte Carlo simulation procedure will be used to obtain the optimal burn-in. In Section 4, determining optimal burn-in procedures will be studied in detail assuming that the degradation processes in the subpopulations follow stochastically ordered non-homogeneous gamma processes. An efficient two-dimensional optimization procedure will be suggested and an illustrative numerical example will be given. Concluding remarks and discussions will be given in Section 5.

A population of manufactured items is often composed of two subpopulations: a subpopulation with “normal” lifetimes (main distribution) and a subpopulation with relatively shorter lifetimes (‘freak’ distribution). Thus, in this paper, we assume that the population is composed of the mixture of two subpopulations: the strong (i.e., the subpopulation with “normal” lifetimes) and weak subpopulations (i.e., the subpopulation with relatively shorter lifetimes). In practice, items belonging to the ‘freak distribution’ can be produced along with the items of the main distribution due to, for example, defective resources and components, human errors and unstable production environment caused by uncontrolled significant quality factors, etc. Note that the infant mortality period of a life cycle that exhibits large failure rate often results from failures in the weak subpopulation of a heterogeneous population. In this case, the ‘elimination’ of these weak items from the population is crucial for improving the reliability of the whole population and this should be the aim of the burn-in procedure.

The items are assumed to be subject to degradation phenomena, and {Wi

                     , denotes the process of the accumulated degradation of an item selected from strong and weak subpopulations, respectively. That is, {Wi
                     (t), t ≥ 0}, 
                        
                           i

                     , are the corresponding conditional degradation processes of the population degradation process {W(t), t ≥ 0}. We assume that items fail when the accumulated degradation exceeds the predetermined threshold level κ > 0.

                      is the proportion of strong items in the (mixed) population at time t, that is, the fraction of strong items still functioning at time t. The readers could refer to, e.g., Finkelstein (2008) and Cha and Finkelstein (2012a) for more general discussions on the mixture populations.

Although the problem in this paper can be stated in a more general setting, for convenience, we assume that the conditional degradation processes {Wi

                     , follow non-homogeneous gamma processes. This choice is due to the fact that the gamma process is intensively used in degradation modeling. For instance, in Wu, Xie, Wu, and Li (2011), a gamma process is employed to model gradual damage monotonically accumulating over time. In Tseng, Balakrishnan, and Tsai (2009) and Tsai et al. (2011), optimal testing plans of gamma degradation models are discussed. In Xu and Wang (2012), an adaptive gamma process is used to describe the deteriorating nature of the observed condition indicator. In Pan and Balakrishnan (2011), gamma processes are used to model degradation of products with multiple performance characteristics. An excellent survey on the application of gamma processes in maintenance modeling can be found in van Noortwijk (2009).

For our further discussions, we briefly summarize some properties of the gamma process. The gamma process (see, e.g., Çinlar, 1980) possesses the property of independent increments and is commonly used to describe degradation phenomena whose growth depends on the system age. The widespread use of the gamma process is due to its mathematical tractability and its flexibility, that makes the gamma process suitable to model the growth of wear, fatigue, corrosion, crack, erosion and degrading health index, et cetera (see, e.g., van Noortwijk, 2009).

As mentioned before, the aim of the burn-in procedure under the above described setting is to eliminate weak items from the population. Suppose that the degradation level of items can be periodically observed during the burn-in procedure. Then, this information contains important information on the subpopulation from which the item under burn-in comes because the items from weak subpopulation would exhibit higher degradation rate than those from strong subpopulation. This allows one to evaluate the probability that the item belong to the weak or strong subpopulation and to eliminate an item supposed to be weak even if it did not fail during the burn-in. Accordingly, the proposed burn-in and the related decision rules should follow the following procedure.

Then, the above elimination procedure implies that an item is eliminated if one of the two (incompatible) events E
                        1 and E
                        2 occurs. In other words, not only the items that fails during the burn-in will be eliminated as soon as the failure is detected, but also the unfailed items whose (conditional) probability that the item under burn-in comes from the strong subpopulation (

We have assumed that the failure of items can be detected only by inspection, i.e., observation of the degradation level (the case when the failures are instantly detected can also be considered without difficulty, see Remark 1 in Section 4).

Now, the relevant probabilities of events which will be necessary in deriving the cost functions in the next subsection are obtained. Under the above setting, define N as the random number of inspections performed before the stopping of the burn-in procedure. Then,

The total expected cost function for ‘one item’ that survives the burn-in process and is put into field operation is the sum of three components: (1) the average total burn-in cost needed for obtaining one component that can be used in field operation, (2) the average penalty for an item which is put into field operation and fails before completing the mission, and (3) the average gain (a negative cost) for an item which is put into field operation and completes successfully the mission.

We assume that the number n of planned observations during the burn-in is prefixed, so that the total expected cost is a function of the burn-in time b and of the probability ρ (also called the “elimination level”).

In order to evaluate the average total burn-in cost, we assume that the burn-in cost is proportional to the total burn-in time, and we denote by c
                        0 the cost per unit burn-in time. Denote by c
                        1 and c
                        2 (c
                        1 > c
                        2) the corresponding cost (or loss) incurred when a strong or a weak item is discarded or eliminated by the burn-in procedure, respectively. Furthermore, let c
                        3 be the cost per one observation of the degradation level during burn-in.

The burn-in cost for ‘one item’ which fails during the burn-in process depends on the random stopping time of the burn-in procedure and on the random nature (strong or weak) of the eliminated item, and its average is given by

The proposed burn-in procedure outperforms the conventional time burn-in in the following sense: min 
                           b ≥ 0, 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1
                        c(b, ρ) ≤ min 
                           b ≥ 0
                        c(b, 0).

For obtaining the optimal solution of the proposed burn-in procedure, a numerical optimization algorithm is required, that in turn generally involves several multivariate integrals of order n and 
                           
                              n
                              +
                              1
                           
                        . This is an almost prohibitive task, also because of the very long run times (note that under some restrictions on the shape functions αi
                        (t), a quite simple calculation of the total expected cost and nice properties on the optimal solution will be derived in Section 4).

However, an attractive alternative to the numerical computation of the cost function (7) and of the involved probabilities, is the use of the Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It consists in simulating a very large sample of pseudo-random degradation paths

                         drawn from the gamma processes of strong or weak subpopulation, once selected values of n and b are given. Of course, a fraction π of the paths are drawn from {W
                        1(t), t ≥ 0}, and the remaining fraction 
                           
                              1
                              −
                              π
                           
                         are drawn from {W
                        2(t), t ≥ 0}. Then, given the elimination level ρ, the (generic) probability that an event E occurs is estimated as the fraction of times that event is observed in the pseudo-random sample of paths. For example, the probability P(E
                        1∪E
                        2) is estimated by the fraction of times the condition (5) hb
                         ∈ Sp
                         is not satisfied or the inequality W(b) > κ is satisfied. Any time the simulated path satisfies the event {W(b) ≤ κ, hb
                         ∈ Sp
                        }, that is, the simulated path allows the item to survives the burn-in, then the degradation level 
                           
                              W
                              (
                              b
                              +
                              M
                              )
                           
                         up to the time 
                           
                              b
                              +
                              M
                           
                         is simulated, where M is the mission length. Then, the survival function of the burned-in items, that is, the probability that an item that survives the burn-in successfully completes its mission of length M, is given by the ratio between the number of times 
                           
                              W
                              (
                              b
                              +
                              M
                              )
                              ≤
                              κ
                           
                         and the number of times the simulated path satisfies {W(b) ≤ κ, hb
                         ∈ Sp
                        }.

Then, once all the probabilities involved in (7) have been estimated, the total expected cost function for ‘one item’ that survives the burn-in process can be estimated by using (7). Alternatively, the total expected cost (7) can be estimated as the ratio between the sum of the total cost of each item and the number of times {W(b) ≤ κ, hb
                         ∈ Sp
                        }, where the total cost of each item is given by:

The simulation procedure is repeated by changing b and ρ until the minimum total expected cost is obtained. In the following subsection, a numerical example that exploits the Monte Carlo simulation procedure to derive the optimal burn-in is illustrated.

Let us now consider the burn-in based on the degradation process of high-power semiconductor lasers, whose degradation paths and data are given in Meeker and Escobar (1998, pages 324, 642). The corresponding data set was more recently analyzed by Tsai et al. (2011). The quality characteristic of a laser device is its operating current and when the current reaches a prefixed threshold level, the laser is considered to be failed. The data set consists of 15 degradation paths observed up to 4000 hours. The operating current is measured at equi-spaced intervals of width 250 hours. The paths appears to be monotonically increasing with time t, and it is possible to classify the paths into two subpopulations: a strong (or typical) subpopulation that has a lower degradation rate, and a weak subpopulation with a higher rate.

The fraction π of strong units is assumed to be equal to 0.945, and the degradation processes are assumed to be homogeneous gamma, whose parameters are set equal to the maximum likelihood estimates (cf. Tsai et al. (2011)). Thus,

The fraction of discarded devices is quite high, say 0.346, because the costs incurred when a device is eliminated by the burn-in procedure are relatively low when compared to the gain K and the penalty C. As the result of burn-in, it is observed that about 75.85% of weak devices are eliminated and only 8.97% of strong devices are eliminated.

As a consequence of the performed burn-in, the fraction of devices shipped to the customers that belong to the strong subpopulation is extremely high, and equal to 0.9848. Thus, also the mission success probability of a burned-in laser is very high:

                        , and only 1.77% of the burned-in lasers fail before completing the mission. It should be noted that the mission success probability without performing the burn-in is much lower, and equal to 0.9525 (that is, the burn-in reduced the failure probability by a factor of 2.7 times).

If the burn-in is not performed, the total expected cost for ‘one item’ is equal to −10.49 $, that is, when the proposed (optimal) burn-in procedure is performed, the expected cost for 1000 items put into field operation decreases by 1432 $ compared to the case of no burn-in.

Of course, all the estimates are affected by the finite, even if very large, simulation size. A graphical analysis on the convergence of the estimated values to the “true” ones is provided by the Fig. 1, where: (a) the probability that a weak item is eliminated during the burn-in (for optimal burn-in), (b) the mission success probability of the burned-in population (for optimal burn-in), and (c) the (minimum) total expected cost, estimated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulation procedure of selected sizes ranging from

As noted by a reviewer, the optimal burn-in time is quite large, even with respect to the mission length. However, this large burn-in time does not compromise the mission success probability of the devices that are shipped to the customers, because the fraction of devices that will fail during the mission is very low, say

The main reason of a large value of the optimal burn-in time in our application, is the fact that the degradation process of the weak devices is only slightly faster than the degradation process of strong devices. Thus, only a large burn-in time can assure that weak devices are correctly detected and eliminated with high probability. Indeed, if we assume that the degradation rate of weak devices is faster than the one in the observed data set, the optimal burn-in time decreases. Table 1
                         compares the results of burn-in procedure under the assumption that the degradation rate of weak devices is: (i) equal to the current rate, (ii) 2 times greater, (iii) 2.5 times greater, and (iii) 3 times greater than the current rate, so that by unchanging

The results given in Table 1 show that as the differences between the degradation processes of the two subpopulations become more pronounced, the optimal burn-in time decreases and the effectiveness of the proposed burn-in procedure increases. Indeed, the mission success probability increases and the characteristics of the device population that is shipped to the customers improve: the fraction of weak (strong) devices that are eliminated during the burn-in increases (decreases) significantly. Note that, if no burn-in is performed, the expected cost and the success mission probability do not change in cases (ii)–(iv) because already when

                         all the weak devices fail during the mission with probability close to 1.

Of course, a longer mission time M also produces a shorter optimal burn-in time, in order to avoid that a large fraction of burned-in devices fail during the mission. For example, if we set

In the previous Section, no restriction was imposed to the shape functions α
                        1(t) and α
                        2(t) of the gamma degradation models of strong and weak subpopulations. In the following, a more specific model, which allows simpler calculation of total expected cost and nice properties on optimal solutions, will be considered and discussed.

In particular, in this section, we will assume that the shape functions αi
                        (t),

                        . This assumption is justified by considering that the distribution of the degradation level at a given time t of the weak subpopulation keeps the same shape of the distribution of the strong subpopulation, and is rescaled by the factor β
                        1/β
                        2. Even in this case, of course, the subpopulation 1 is the stronger than the subpopulation 2 due to β
                        1 > β
                        2.

Thus, we now consider the following two different cases: Case 1: 0 ≤ ρ ≤ ρ
                        0, and Case 2: ρ
                        0 < ρ ≤ 1.

                                 0, then ξ(b, ρ) ≥ ξ(b, ρ
                                 0) ≡ κ. In this case, because the condition hb

                                  is equivalent to “W(b) > ξ(b, ρ)”, we have that E

Case 2: if ρ

                                  is equivalent to “W(b) > ξ(b, ρ)”, and now we have that E

                                 } ≡ {ξ(b, ρ) < W(b) ≤ κ}. Thus, because E
                                 1 ≡ {W(b) > κ}, we have that

Of course, w(kτ) > ξ(b, ρ) implies that W(b) > ξ(b, ρ). Then, we can provide a unique formulation for Case 1 and Case 2 by slightly modifying the burn-in procedure in Case 2 as follows: at equi-spaced times

                        should also be excluded from our consideration, as these time values imply a negative value of ξ(b, ρ) and the impossibility for an item to pass the burn-in. Note that: (i) this can happen especially when ρ is close to 1, and (ii) the left-hand side of the inequality (8) is strictly increasing in b, with its limit ∞. Thus, this can be interpreted as follows: when the elimination criterion is very strict (ρ is close to 1), sufficiently large burn-in time is necessary for our decision. Thus, for a fixed ρ, we will only consider burn-in time values b’s such that

                         and, thus, we always have the finite optimal b*(ρ): b*(ρ) < ∞. In addition to this, if there exists a finite upper bound for b*(ρ), then it would make the search for b*(ρ) substantially efficient. We denoted by bU
                        (ρ) the finite upper bound for b*(ρ). For this purpose, we need to state the following theorem.

                           It was shown that, under the considered setting, the decision of eliminating an unfailed item at the end of the burn-in is based only on the degradation level observed at time b: the condition that hb

                               is equivalent to W(b) ≤ ξ(b, ρ). However, when the failures are detected only by inspection and the unit cost c
                              0 is relatively very high, it may be still advantageous to observe the degradation level at times

                              , just to eliminate the failed component as soon as the failure is detected, thus reducing the burn-in time. In this case, the previous cost function can be applied. On the other hand, if the failures are automatically detected instantly without observing the degradation level and the unit cost c
                              0 is relatively very low but c
                              3 (cost per one observation) is relatively very high, then it would be sufficient to observe the degradation level only at time b and eliminate the items based on W(b). In this case, the expected burn-in cost can be obtained similarly as those in Mi (1994) and Cha (2001).

The total expected cost can also be similarly defined for the case ξ(b, ρ) < κ. Even in this case, by similar arguments, we still have the same results for the upper bound as those in Theorem 1.
                           

Alternatively to the cost function (7), we now assume that, during the field operation, the gain is proportional to the mean time to failure. Therefore, the total expected cost function in this case is

We will now consider the problem of finding the optimal joint burn-in parameters (b*, ρ*) which minimizes the total expected cost c(b, ρ) in (10). Then, in order to find the joint optimal burn-in parameters (b*, ρ*) efficiently, the optimization procedures described in the previous case will be applied. In this case, as before, the existence of a finite upper bound for b*(ρ) for each fixed ρ would make the search for b*(ρ) substantially efficient.

The scale parameters are still equal to the values used in
Section 3.3, say

By using the optimization procedure described in
Section 4.1, the optimal burn-in time and elimination level are equal to, respectively,

                        , and then a laser device must be eliminated during the burn-in if its wear exceeds the value

                              1.3701
                           
                         mm (see Fig. 3
                        ). The optimal total expected cost for ‘one item’ that survives the burn-in process and is put into field operation is equal to −11.87 $.

The fraction of discarded devices is equal to 0.1171, and about 73.0% of weak devices are eliminated and only 8.1% of strong devices are eliminated.

The fraction of the strong subpopulation in the lasers shipped to the customers is very high, and equal to 0.983 and hence also the mission success probability of a burned-in lasers is very high:

                        . Because the mission success probability without performing the burn-in is equal to 0.9536, we have that the burn-in reduced the failure probability by a factor of 2.4 times.

Finally, Fig. 4
                         plots the contour plot of the total expected cost function (7) versus burn-in time and elimination level, together to the optimal solution,

In conventional burn-in procedure, the only information used for the elimination procedure is the corresponding ‘lifetime’ of the item. In this paper, under the assumptions that the items are subject to observable degradation phenomena and that the population of items is heterogeneous and is constituted by a strong and a weak subpopulation, a new burn-in procedure which employs the information contained in the degradation process is proposed and studied. As the degradation process can be described by a continuous stochastic process, from a probabilistic point of view, the new burn-in procedure utilizes the information contained in ‘sample path’ of the corresponding stochastic process. In this way, given the observed degradation process, the burn-in procedure is optimized in terms both of the burn-in time b and the elimination level ρ for the (conditional) probability that the item under the burn-in will be from the strong subpopulation.

General framework for the new burn-in procedure was established assuming the nonhomogeneous gamma processes for the degradation processes. Under the condition that the shape functions for both subpopulations are the same, the sufficient statistic for the burn-in decision was characterized and the detailed properties of the optimal burn-in parameters were obtained. Two-stage optimization procedure for determining the joint optimal burn-in parameters was developed.

The application of the proposed burn-in procedure to a real data set showed the advantages provided by the burn-in even when the degradation rate is constant with time. Larger advantages are obtained when the degradation paths are concave downward, so that the burn-in period covers the time interval with larger degradation rate.

Finally, the new burn-in procedure proposed in this paper assumes that the degradation processes follow the nonhomogeneous gamma process. However, the application of the general approach is not limited to this case. Based on the suggested general framework, other stochastic processes for item degradation could also be employed.
