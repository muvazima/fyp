                  In a recent paper by Li and Cheng [Li,S.K., Cheng, Y.S., 2007. Solving the puzzles of structural efficiency. European Journal of Operational Research 180(2), 713–722], they developed the shadow price model to solve the existing puzzles of structural efficiency theoretically. However, we observe that the optimal shadow price vector in the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007) is not always unique. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency is arbitrarily generated, depending on the shadow price vector we choose. Finally, an example with multiple inputs and outputs is used to illustrate the phenomenon.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In his seminal paper, Farrell (1957) suggested that the “structural efficiency” could be measured by an output-weighted average of the technical efficiencies of its constituent production units. Forsund and Hjalmarsson (1979) criticized that the result of the weighted scheme does not have a straight-forward interpretation. They suggested that the “structural efficiency” of a group should be measured by calculating the technical efficiency of an average unit. However, Ylvinger (2000) pointed out that this approach had led to inconsistent measures and confusing findings. He proposed a new weighted average method, which used DEA to compute weights for the averaging process to measure the “structural efficiency” of a group. Nevertheless, any weighting scheme is difficult to justify by itself, particularly if the weights are endogenous (Leleu and Briec, 2009). Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) developed theoretical justification and the multi-output generalization for Farrell’s efficiency framework.

Recently, Li and Cheng (2007) identified three puzzles in the existing studies of “structural efficiency” and developed the shadow price model to solve these puzzles theoretically. They defined shadow price vector as the gradient vector of the group output set at the structurally efficient aggregate output vector and used the shadow price vector to decompose the structural efficiency into three meaningful components. However, we observe that the shadow price vector in the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007) is not always unique. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency is arbitrarily generated, depending on the shadow price vector, which leads to the confusing interpretation of the economic meaning of its three components.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007). In Section 3, the non-uniqueness of the shadow price vector is presented and tested. A numerical example is provided in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5.

We assume that there are n DMUs in the group. Each DMU consumes m inputs to produce r outputs. For each DMU 
                        j
                      (j
                     =1,…,
                     n), we denote the input and the output vectors as (x
                     
                        j
                     ,
                     y
                     
                        j
                     ), respectively, where x
                     
                        j
                     
                     =(x
                     1j
                     ,…,
                     x
                     
                        mj
                     ) and y
                     
                        j
                     
                     =(y
                     1j
                     ,…,
                     y
                     
                        rj
                     ).

The production technology of DMU j is defined by the production possibility set: T
                     
                        j
                     
                     ={(x,
                     y):x can produce y}. Equivalently, the technology can be characterized by its output set: P
                     
                        j
                     (x)={y:(x,
                     y)∈
                     T
                     
                        j
                     }.

We denote the sum of the input and output vectors of n DMUS in the group as 
                        
                           (

However, we observe that there is no guarantee for the uniqueness of the shadow price vector p by model (1). In order to judge whether the shadow price vector p in model 1 has multiple solutions, the following procedure is executed.

Obviously, the feasible regions of model 2 become smaller than that of model 1. Further, if model 2 is solved, the optimal value is the same as that of model 1, then it follows that another optimal solution to model 1, which satisfies p

Note that the number of variables involved in models 2 and 3 will be decreased by 1 as the index k increases by 1, which makes the cost of computation economical.

We shall illustrate the above phenomenon using a simple data set consisting of eight DMUs, which consume one input to produce two outputs. The input and output data are provided in Table 1
                     .

                     1
                     ∈[0.0101,0.02275] and p

                     ∈[0.007625,0.02025] are the optimal shadow prices.

In the following section, an example in a multiple input and output case shows that the non-uniqueness of the multiple shadow price vector leads to the result that the decomposition of the structural efficiency varies considerably.

In this section, we provide a numerical example with multiple inputs and outputs to illustrate the phenomenon. We assume that the group has 20 DMUs, each consuming two inputs to generate two outputs. Table 2
                      shows the input and output dataset for 20 DMUs.

The multiple decompositions of the structural efficiency lead to the confusing interpretation of the economic meaning of its three components.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In a recent paper, Li and Cheng (2007) developed the shadow price model to interpret the existing puzzles of structural efficiency theoretically. They defined shadow price vector as the gradient vector of the group output set at the structurally efficient aggregate output vector and used the shadow price vector to decompose the structural efficiency into three meaningful components.

However, we observe that the shadow price vector in the shadow price model by Li and Cheng (2007) is not always unique. As a result, the decomposition of the structural efficiency varies considerably, depending on which particular shadow price vector we choose. This phenomenon results in the confusing interpretation of the economic meaning of its three components. How to resolve this problem combined with the analysis in different contexts at both theoretical and empirical level in the case of a non-unique optimum is an interesting topic for future research.
