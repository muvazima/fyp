                  This paper presents a study of the collective knowledge in information technology (IT) and the comparative analyses of innovative trends in the standardisation of the roads of knowledge in the subfields of software engineering (SE).
                  The focus is on the amount of required innovation that will be necessary in the examples database of standardised units in IT and SE for the improvement of the information systems (IS). The goal is to determine how to obtain appropriate knowledge in IT and SE to model the excellence of IS.
                  The contribution to the modelling of IS excellence in PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The paper investigates standardised collective knowledge in information technology (IT), especially in the subfields of software enginerring (SE) and (information systems) IS. IS is “An information processing system, together with associated organisational resources such as human, technical, and financial resources, that provides and distributes information” [1] (terms noted in italics are standardised). The term “collective knowledge” is defined by standardised term “knowledge source” — a source of information from which a knowledge base has been created for a specific kind of problem [2]. Sources of information for collective knowledge are the ISO/IEC standards (International Organization for Standardization (IScxxO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)) [3], SRPS standards (SRPS — designation of standards in Serbia) and sources of information for local knowledge [4]. Knowledge base (or K-base or KB) is abbreviated in the vocabulary [1] (01.06.18) and in [2] (28.04.06) – in IT Vocabulary – part 28th, Section 4, term 6. In the present century in IT, we have witnessed the growing problem of continuous improvement in individual knowledge in relation to evolved and standardised knowledge (partly public and collective). One aspect of the problem is knowledge acquisition, continuous improvement of the quality of the product (education services), a second is based on knowledge representation 
                     [1,5], and a third refers to the quantity and value of the required knowledge engineering. On a more practical level, according to the International Classification of Standards (ICS) from a population of standards in all areas for ICS-1 (from 1 up to 99), they may include sub/fields such as:
                        
                           –
                           The evolutions of IT standardisation to E-learning (ICS-3=35.240.99), that had not been published previously,

The evolution of studies of the SE discipline (ICS-2=35.080), to IS excellence,

The future trends defined in boundaries and subfields of IT, SE to IS, as a product.

Today it is not a “problem” to develop IS. Manipulation of information in some integrated IS and creation of “our own” public opinion (including standardisation of design and implementation [6]) is more important. The research presented in this paper relates to the trend analyses of the innovation intensity of knowledge sources (KSs) [2] and the required individual knowledge.

Decision-making “problems” based on IS and/or expert systems (ESs) is not completely new. An ES, is “a Knowledge-Based System — KBS, that provides solving problems in a particular domain or application area by drawing inferences from a knowledge base developed from human expertise” [2,1] (Domain Knowledge — DK is “knowledge accumulated in a particular domain” [2]). Comparing collective with individual decision making, the first involves expert knowledge kept in store as the knowledge base to solve the “problem” in the domain of the broader collective knowledge. Expanding the applications of SE constantly extends the gap between collective and individual knowledge. The implementation of IS and SE, will make the distance between collective and individual knowledge smaller. The possibilities of applying the excellence model in making management decisions in educational institutions were demonstrated by an implemented information system (in this case, education, as an example).

Historically and evolutionarily, the Japanese interpretation of the “Deming wheel” in Deming’s lectures of 1950 and 1951, led to the Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) cyclic quality. This paper presents particularly important and significant aspects of knowledge and experience acquired by the standardised application of SE on the time dimension “t”: PtDtCtAt or (PDCA)t quality improvement spiral.

The first results presented in this work, refer to top-down (ICS-2=35.080) and the bottom-up (ICS-2=35.060) analysis of collective and local knowledge and knowledge acquisition in the IT and SE sub/fields. The results are primarily based on ISO/IEC standardisation, as well as on SRPS standards for the implementation, promotion and integration of IS, and they were researched and analysed in parallel.

Classification of the sub-areas of SE applications within IT and related knowledge have exceptional importance, not only for learning and knowledge management, but also for the creation of IS and ES for business decisions. According to the ICS, IT is classified in field 35, with 12 segments. The focus in this work is on the development and SE applications, according to the “collective” (international or global) ISO/IEC [3] in parallel with local SRPS standards, [4] of the ICS-2=35.060 and ICS-2=35.080 sub-areas:
                        
                           35.080 — software, Including software development, documentation, Internet applications and use,

35.060 — languages used in information technology etc.

SE (including software development, system documentation and program languages in IT) is important in modelling IS excellence in several dimensions of the software, i.e. strategic, dynamic, temporal, institutional and resource size, as the final product is based on previous design (the product in the form of service).

The possibility of reaching the level of collective knowledge is supposed in the starting hypothesis (by support from IT, SE and IS). The ultimate goals of this paper are the creation and continual improvement of knowledge based on standardised units of the knowledge base in SE, in order to model IS excellence. The goals are presented using important evolutionary trends in SE applications from the key results of IS improvement and with given answers to relevant questions, along with the hypothesis (assumption) that there is constant knowledge and IS acquisition in the PiDiCiAi (explanation i=ICS&ISO±SRPS/t, with time dimension “t”, where “t” represents year, month, week or day).
                           Hypothesis 1
                           Plan(i)-phase


                           H1–P(i) or P(IT/t) In planning the acquisition of knowledge in IT we need significant resources. The resources plan affecting comparative criteria starts from the goals and standardised knowledge, i.e. collective, national, individual or for professional work, to the evolution of the IT profession and then to IS excellence in the improvement of the quality of SE services and solving some practical problems with developed IS. Then, further, with answers to the questions such as, who will (or can they) and how will they plan the resources on the roads of knowledge acquisition in the areas of IT/SE (standardised collective — ISO, as a part of the “social” or civilisation domain for some planned results in the local SRPS) in time dimension “t”.

H2–D(i) or D(SE/t) Paths of knowledge acquisition in SE fields are based on global (ISO) and local (SRPS) KS:
                                 
                                    –
                                    through development activities (from learning, development of standards, knowledge acquisition — in the field of SE and IS development),

to IS modelling excellence using the standardised KB in the time (PtDtCtAt),and

the size of quantity indices (collective/ISO — local/SRPS) of publications (Iqp/i), new projects under development (Iqu/i), innovations (Iqi/i), for professional work, for improving the quality of IS.

H3–C(i) or C(KB/t) Determining the intensity of KS innovation provides new benefits:
                                 
                                    –
                                    the possibilities of innovation intensity checking of the KB in the time dimension — analysis of the results (realised global activities in the Do(i)-phase, with innovation of standardised units of the KB and concrete actions on the continuous improvement of IS and ES), building on the determinants of the critical aspects of knowledge and

the possibility of anticipating the clusters and necessary resources for updating the KB according to the trends of innovations in the subfields or segments of SE according to the obtained results (quantity indices of innovations — Iqi/i, Iqu/i, price indices, innovation value indices — Ivi/i or Ivu/i) in the PiDiCiAi methodology.

H4–A(i) or A(IS±ES/t) The possibility of improving the model IS±ES&PiDiCiAi&QMk exists producting IS excellence, quality and the results of IS applications, starting from the KS, an innovated data base, to a new KB (from standardised IT to operational improvement of the integrated IS and ES used in decision making at the university) towards knowledge quality management (QMk). Index “k” refers to the QM key criteria for knowledge acquisition (where k=1 to 12).

The aim and purpose of this work is to be of use to higher education institutions, students, faculties, management, and teachers. In addition, since user participation in the standardisation process is becoming more important [6]; the article may be useful to participants who want to develop new standards (innovations) and new degree programmes in SE applications for IS and ES excellence.

The significance of this study lies in determining the period necessary for updating the knowledge base in PDCA (for SE), as well as explicitly defining the criteria which show the limiting possibilities of knowledge innovation, that require appropriate solutions — implicitly. In short, the significance of the research and the study is presented in the “highlights”.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

The aim of this section is to identify possible related works and to determine the relation between them and research, modelling, development and continuous improvement in their implementation — as shown in this paper. This is achieved through two thematic aspects: “The standardisation of knowledge acquisition in IT” (Section 2.1) and “Improving the quality of IS” (Section 2.2). Some partially related research, which does not analyse the development of the software product models (IS) and the methodology of quality improvement – PDCA – and the target path to excellence etc., gives only a partial basis for comparing the importance of some of the previously mentioned aspects of excellence (modelling of IS excellence). In practice, the vast number of papers in some way affects this work.

Many surveys have accumulated an enormous amount of information on IT in previous years: over 1012 books per year, which is about one Exabyte of information or about 1.1×1012
                        MB (or 1.15×1018 bytes) [7]. This paper predominantly relies on ISO/IEC and SRPS standardisation as the academic material for reliable and objective analyses of IT innovations in the relevant period, the 21st century.

According to [1], “knowledge (in artificial intelligence) [is] a collection of facts, events, beliefs, and rules, organized for systematic use”. According to [8], knowledge is a mixture of experience, values, contextual information and provides a framework to assess and contain new information and experiences. In [9] it is concluded that knowledge is often identified with the data or the information to be collected, stored and transmitted.

Although boundaries between individual and collective knowledge in IT are clearly separated, it is necessary to bear in mind that, according to [10], the knowledge called “individual” is often obtained by working in groups, through collective work with the research related to standardised collective knowledge acquisition in IT (according to ISO), with reference to the growing problem of continuous improvement in individual knowledge in relation to the before-mentioned collective.

The authors have seen standardisation of knowledge represented 
                        [1] in some previous works: for example in [5,11], in the broadest sense, the term “Standardisation in history”, can be found in some works, and it is defined as a process of systematisation and implementation of technical knowledge [12]. In this paper, research standards in the areas of IT are based on the data taken from the ISO/IEC [3] and SRPS websites [4]. The ISO/IEC and the SRPS aim to create valid and binding standards that can facilitate the international exchange of goods and services to promote technical cooperation between different nations. The importance and necessity of standardisation have been researched by many authors (for example, [13–15]). In this paper, the importance is reflected in the results obtained in prolonged research, as well as in the development and continuous improvement of products in the areas of SE for IS and ES.

Similar research as presented in [16] established the possibility of using information technology in knowledge transfer. Unlike conducted research, where knowledge transfer occurs on a general level, in this study the knowledge relates to the quality of the information system. Simultaneously with the transfer of knowledge, the work includes the management of knowledge, as in [17] where it was determined that “knowledge management is a critical organizational capability through which IT influences firm performance”. According to [18], knowledge management is implemented through different strategies depending on the context of the use of knowledge. In accordance with [19], knowledge is seen as the basis for competitive advantage and analyses the key factors influencing knowledge transfer. In the case study presented in [20] we can see the importance of sharing knowledge and its influence on job satisfaction in the IT industry.

According to [21], only a few works deal with the relationship between software flexibility and standardisation of the software development process. In [22] it is concluded that standardisation of the software development process inevitably leads to the increased quality and flexibility of the software. The importance of their work is thus confirmed.

In the field of IS, the standards provide that individual elements of the system fulfil their tasks: processing, storing and transmitting the information to other elements [23]. In this paper, the standards in the areas of IT, SE and IS are the basis for knowledge acquisition, as well as for the improvements towards IS excellence.

A large number of studies relate to the quality of information systems, of which numerous studies relate to information systems applied in the health, education and industrial sectors, as shown in [24–26]. A quality information system, according to [27] is measured by products and the service, and develops tools and methodologies for measuring effectiveness. The quality of the information system, in addition to the technical characteristics, significantly impacts organisational and human differences, according to [28,29]. The authors of [28] emphasise the importance of the control and measurement of parameters relating to the quality of the information system and propose a tool for measuring quality. According to [30], each of the tools used to measure the quality of the information system requires examination by a professional information system. Bearing in mind that the quality of the information system directly affects the individual’s perceived benefits and user satisfaction, according to [31] continuous quality assurance is defined as “user’s continuance intention to consume and to provide information”.

Given the increasing level of use of IS in organisations in the past two decades [32], it is necessary to continuously improve its quality. In this paper, improvement of IS is presented through an original ICS/PiDiCiAi model (Section 4.4 — modelling of IS excellence). According to [33–37], PDCA is a good technique for continuous improvement, but also for solving problems and obtaining positive results in the long term.

According to the software life cycle evolutionary model (ISO/IEC TR 15271: 2007, [38]), in the time “t” or (PDCA)t (or (PDCA)1, according to Fig. 1
                           , Section 3), the current requirements for quality IS are the relevant standards published before 2010 (in PDCA)2010-before.

In [9] it was concluded that practical knowledge is very important in achieving quality software as a product. Since practical knowledge can be subsumed under the category of individual and collective knowledge, knowledge as a category has been introduced as one of the key factors in achieving IS excellence. As with [9], it can be concluded that the quality of IS, as well as the software, is a complex issue with particular emphasis on knowledge, which is a prerequisite for improvement towards excellence.

The study applied the PDCA methodology, statistical methodology, and deductive–inductive methods of deduction to predict events and resource needs in the future, within IS studies, and inductive reasoning methods were used to predict the future development of and innovation in the pragmatic framework.

Methodologically, statistical indices were formed for the comparison of the ISO and SRPS relations in the field of IT (ICS-1=35) and the subfields of SE (ICS-2=35.080 and ICS-2=35.060) with other fields of human endeavour, including: quantity indices (Iq) and value index (Iv). Quantity indices (Iq), defined and determined for both ISO and SRPS, refer to KS for the whole previous calendar year: samples (Iqs or KS), published standards (Iqp), standards under development (Iqu), standards withdrawn from use (Iqw), deleted projects (Iqd), innovations in various stages of development Iit (Iid, Iiw, Iim, Iiy, where “iy” is related to the quantity year innovation index≈Iqi/year and with index≈Iqu/year 
                        [7]).

Value indices (Iv) follow quantity indices with results that are aggregated by trend for most of the subfields. Graphs consist of two parts, (a) and (b):
                           
                              (a)

Periodic studies have been repeated in previous years of the 21st century: for the beginning/end of the year, and 31st December/1st January. Knowledge acquisition pathways and statistical analyses of the samples (Iqs/ICS/ISO±SRPS/year, [3] and [4]), which were separated in January (during prior years of the century), are presented in the SE subfields:
                           
                              –
                              “Top Down” is the flow of statistical sampling in IT from ISO/IEC and SRPS documents, for IS projects (Fig. 1 — terminology for design), as well as research; the initial statistical sample comprised Iqs/ICS/ISO±SRPS/year documents on 1st January 20xy (xy=01, 02 to 14),

*** “Top” (or the Plan-phase, relationship with Hypothesis 1) the flow of statistical sampling in IT (Iqs for ICS-1=35), from ISO/IEC and SRPS documents, as well as research; the initial statistical sample comprised Iqs/35/ISO±SRPS/year,

*** “Down” (or the Do-phase, relationship with Hypothesis 2) research from Iqs/35.080/ISO±SRPS documents (for ICS-2=35.080), and Iqs/35.060/ISO±SRPS documents (for ICS-2=35.060),

The terms “pathways knowledge acquisition” or KB or KBS show the alternative paths to the process for system innovation and trends of knowledge: ISO (global) or SRPS (local),

“Bottom” (or the C-phase, relationship with Hypothesis 3) part of the IS/ES project realisation.

For modelling, development and implementation of IS (for example higher education institutions — the student services subsystem [109]) the standardised PDCA methodology is applied. This was followed by continuous improvements in the PDCA spiral of quality (ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011), towards the excellence of IS or ES or IES (IS+ES≈Data Base+KB, creating models KBS for IS/ES or informational–expert system).

Standardisation and specific ISO/IEC and SRPS standards were used in all phases of the system life cycle (of IS, [110]), in the areas of design, implementation and maintenance. For example (Fig. 1, in PiDiCiAi) and according to [111]: 1. General concepts, requirements, 2. Study and analysis, 3. System design, 4. Software implementation (SI) process, 5. Quality assurance, 6. System documentation, 7. Project management (PM) process. The start position is standardisation of the terminology [112], which tended to improve the PDCA maintenance and re-engineering phase, Fig. 1.

Based on the standardisation platform of IT terminology ([1], ISO/IEC 2382-1 to ISO/IEC 2382-37 vocabulary, [110]) in the PiDiCiAi methodology (Fig. 1), the original modelling of IS excellence is presented (Section 4.4, relationship with the proof of Hypothesis 4. Act(i)-phase) and this model (Fig. 1) may be displayed through the 12 aspects, in the same way as in [113], where SE tools and methods is one of the 12 parts of the body of knowledge (or SWEBOK — Software Engineering Body of Knowledge): 1) Introduction, 2) Software requirements, 3) Software design, 4) Software construction, 5) Software testing, 6) Software maintenance, 7) Software configuration management, 8) Software engineering management, 9) Software engineering process, 10) Software engineering tools and methods, 11) Software quality, 12) Related disciplines of software engineering.

Our own Java software was used for the research, analysis, processing and presentation of the results [114]. Without this software it would be almost impossible to undertake the research again. With this software, all source data are available on-line, in every area and subfield of creativity. Experience shows that the best time for a comparative study is the end/beginning of the year. Significant results have been singled out by analyses for many years (for IT, every year of the 21st century), as well as in the studies carried out at the beginnings of the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Java software (used for data collection) is a web crawler specifically written to parse the HTML responses with the ISO and SRPS websites [3,4], given in the paper “Innovation and knowledge trends through standardisation of IT applications” for each KS (for ISO and SRPS standardisation platforms) collecting data. These data are available for analysis as well as statistical analysis of KS in one DK. Java software is designed for two subsystems, the global (ISO/IEC) and the local (SRPS). The initial function and software architecture are presented in [114].

Web applications allow the collection of data to verify the above hypothesis. Data are collected according to domain knowledge (DK) or areas of analysis (ICS). Data checks shall be made at the sub-group level appropriate for testing (for example, with a smaller volume of data, usually DK3–ICS-3, rarely DK2–ICS-2, the rarest DK1–ICS-1). In any case, the quantitative indices (each volume of research DKn–ICS-n) and the relation to the sum of all sources of knowledge, Iqs (KS)=Iqp+Iqw+Iqd+Iqu, are checked.

The first web application browses and analyses the ISO standardised unit database or KS (Iqs/1-99/ISO/2012.01/P1
                        ≈42000 and Iqs/1-99/ISO/2013.01/P2
                        ≈44000 collective-global innovations in the standards examples) and a sample of Iqs/35/ISO/2014.01/P3
                        =6445 units (Table 1
                        , the last row). The second web application gathers and analyses data on the local SRPS standardisation or KS (or local “innovation”: Iqs/1-99/SRPS/2012.01/P1
                        ≈34000 and Iqs/1-99/SRPS/2013.01/P2
                        ≈30000) and the sample of Iqs/35/SRPS/2014.01/P3
                        =1463 units (Table 2
                        ).

The results are presented graphically and by summary trends:
                           
                              a)
                              including time and “historical” aspects, for the entire period of the research — according to the year of publication, and

financial trend lines in the first/second decade of the 21st century.

In addition, Iqs/SRPS standards (in Serbia [4]) were analysed at the same time and in the same SE subfields.

At the beginning of every year, the results achieved up to that moment, were enabled and evaluated by multicriteria analyses (phases P1 for dates 01-01-2011 and P4 and 01-01-2014, respectively; Table 1). The methodology enables further comparison with cluster analysis (Ward’s method, [115]), as well as comparison with the results achieved in other areas of human endeavour — according to [7,116].

Based on PDCA and defined values of the quantity indices of projects under development (Iqu), i.e. the quantity indices of innovation (Iqi, phase Do), the index (or degree) of innovation in the time dimension (Iit or ∆KS/t, for example Iiy or Ii/year — per year) was determined. The criterion of clustering is the defined increment of innovation ∆KS/t=Iqu/t+Iqi/t, in time “t”. The period for checking the innovations (Check) in certain fields or subfields is dependent on the time index of innovation Iit. The index Iit was used for defining the groups or classes/clusters of innovation. The values of the periodic checks (Check) of the research for Iit in practice (1 — year, 2 — month, 3 — week or 4 — day) were assigned to this index [7,116].

The innovation checking period (Check) in the fields/subfields depends on a criterion index that indicates the degree/intensity of innovation (Iqu referring to ISO, and Iqp/year in this case Iqp/2012 referring to SRPS). Ii serves as the unique criterion of timeline innovation, i.e. it designates innovation groups or classes/clusters and periodic checks (Check: C1, C2,… C4) of studies important for practice on:
                           
                              –
                              Ii=1 — yearly (Iiy=01, 02,… up to 99),

Ii=2 — monthly (Iim=01, 02,… up to 12),

Ii=3 — weekly (Iiw=01, 02,… up to 52, for 50 working weeks) and

Ii=4 — daily (Iid=01, 02,… up to 365, for 250 working days) bases.

Low innovation levels (for long-term periods in the near past, long-year) introduces another group, so called “zero”’ innovation — (Ii=0).

The results of the presented analyses [5,7,11,116,114] enable the development of an original methodology for the clustering, checking and comparison of innovation trends in all standardised technologies (for example, [117] — ICS-1=25, [118] — ICS-1=77). This is achieved by means of the defined Iit, Iqu and Iqp/year indices that represent the criteria for the clustering of particular subfields and/or the fields of human endeavour by levels of innovation intensity. This clustering methodology in PDCA allows practical checks that complement the theoretical results of software application [115]. Earlier results point to significant issues in terms of the development and comparison of methodologies for clustering in standardised subfields. All of them are grouped into clusters that have their own PDCA spiral innovation cycle. Checking the methodology enables comparisons of planned targets (in phase P3 — Fig. 1 for 2013, or P14 for 2014) with the innovation results in the current year and at the end of 2014 (Doing-Checking or D14–C14). More detailed analyses of individual clusters or subfields include the elaboration of Iit (Iiy, Iiw, Iim and Iid) innovation indices (see Section 5.3) with the elements applied methodology.

@&#RESULTS@&#

More specifically, the results of the analysis of standardisation and knowledge acquisition in the SE subfields are presented in the charts for both IT subfields (“Top down” — deductively, from general to specific and vice versa, the more usual “Bottom up” — induction). Graphic presentations consist of two parts:
                        
                           a)
                           The first part includes summary analyses of all current standards (Std), corrections (Cor), amendments (Amd) and new projects of development (NP), for all previous years (from 1973 to 01-01-2015),

The second part includes the financial trend line diagrams for Std only, excluding any time before the year 2005, due to innovation and rendering older documents obsolete — withdrawn category.

In order to achieve clear graphical displays of the results (in the first part, part a) only the number of characteristic values are shown.

Since corrections (Cor) are free of charge and the prices of amendments (Amd) are considerably lower than the prices of standards (Std), the Cor and Amd numbers have not been presented.

In the 21st century, although studies of the standardisation of IT and SE have been repeated periodically at least once a year, Table 1 presents only the results obtained during the previous period (31-12-2011 or 01-01-2012/ P11D11C11A11, 01-01-2013/ P12D12C12A12, 01-01-2014/ P13D13C13A13 and 01-01-2015/ P14D14C14A14).

                           An index of the amount of local novelty sources of knowledge (KS) declines, but each year is higher than the daily innovation (250 working days a year), Iqi/year=Iqi/35/ISO/2013
                              =251,

Index values of local (annual) KS innovations for Iqi/year, is considerably high, Iqi/35/ISO/2013
                              =29094 CHF, is important for its managerial implications.

In Table 1, ∑Iv refers to the sum of existing Iv values from previous years ∑Iv/yy.mm, were yy=year and mm=month when Iv values existed.

A part of the analysis of the previous years of the 21st century is presented in Table 1. Some of the analyses are given in prior comparative publications [114]). In short, we can distinguish the most characteristic data from the aspects of the quantity indices and index values Iv (given in Section 3). The quantity indices for 2011, 2012 and 2013 are given in Table 1 (columns 3 to 8). From the point of view of research in recent years, the continuation of the trends is obvious. For example, the trend in the annual innovation index values is decreasing (Iv/year — column 10, Table 1). But the trend of total value of documentation on the platform of ISO standardisation is increasing (ΣIv — column 11), as is the trend in the indices of statistical samples (Iqs — column 3), including the analysis of the previous 2010th: Iqs/35.080/2010
                     =235, Iqs/35.060/2010
                     =340, Iqs/35/2010
                     =5516 etc.

The IT (ICS-1=35) field belongs to the cluster with the highest level of innovation (according to the criteria Iqu and Iqi/year, Tables 1 and 2, Ii=4 — daily, for example, criteria ∆KS/t=∆KS/year=Iqu/year+Iqi/year≥250).

Annotations for delineating the abbreviations used in Table 2 (in the field of IT, ICS-1=35 and ICS 2=35.080), on SRPS platforms:

                              An index of the amount of local novelty sources of knowledge (KS), just in 2014, close to the daily innovation, Iqi/year=Iqi/35/SRPS/2014
                                 =239, close to the index of global ISO novelties of KS,

Index values of local (annual) KS innovations for Iqi/2014, Iv/year=Iqi/35/SRPS/2014
                                 =9927 CHF, which is three times lower than the value of global KS, is important for its managerial implications.

IT — statistical sample (from the beginning of 2014) of Iqs/35/ISO/2013
                           =6445 ISO documents, consists of: Iqp/35/ISO/2013

                           =237. Obviously, the maximum prevailing value index, published ISO “innovation”, for the year is Iv/ISO/2008/2014.01

This trend line excludes the previous years’ standards which were rendered obsolete (and does not include any adjustments — Cor), so it represents the minimum quantitative trend of innovation.

For comparative analysis purposes, with regard to the relations of ISO/IEC–SRPS, national-collective knowledge acquisition with SRPS standards in IT, as well as in SE, was researched and evaluated. According to [119] domestic standards are globally successfully introduced and national interests are becoming more significant.

Based on the trends of “local” standardisation and knowledge acquisition in IT (SRPS standards), it is particularly important to mention innovations in the year 2012 where Iqi/SRPS/2012
                           =349. In the last two years, there have been more Std than ISO/IEC.

The results of the research show that standardisation and knowledge acquisition in IT and SE, at the local level (SRPS standards, according to [4]), were not in keeping with ISO/IEC improvements, until 2008. This is especially true for the “Bottom Up” direction (35.060) and for the entire period of research. It is obvious that the percentage of currently valid KB units was very small for the period up to 2007 (≈5%).

The subfield software development, documentation, internet applications (ICS-2=35.080) belongs to the cluster with the higher innovation intensity — per week (according to the criteria Iqu and Iqi/year, Table 1, Ii=3, see Section 5.3).

Unfortunately, there is nothing new in the SRPS standards in the 21st century (2001–2013) in the field of local (or national) standardisation and knowledge acquisition (for ICS-2=35.060). From the subfields of innovation listed above, only the subfield (35.060) “languages used in IT” has a lower level of KS for SRPS.

Several dimensions (four analysed, Fig. 7) are covered by the newly created IS excellence model in phase A(IS±ES/t) on the ISO and SRPS standardisation platforms. The QMk dimension (Quality Management — QM of knowledge), or QM with 12 elements, is based on the EFQM (2011, European Foundation for Quality Management) [120], and EFQM model — adapted for the use of the university, and has been defined by 12 key elements of IS excellence QMk (k=1 to 12): 1) project tasks 2) teamwork, 3) methodology, 4) design, 5) OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing), 6) network aspects, 7) innovation, 8) processes, 9) resources, 10) configuration and interfaces, 11) maintenance and 12) the results of IS application (the labels, QM1 to QM12, Fig. 7).

On the basis of previous work, according to [109] the correlations PDCA&QMk for IS are derived from the intersection of the two states (points) of the PDCA spiral (PtDtCtAt to Pt+1Dt+1Ct+1At+1 were is t=2011…).

IS/ES as products with 12 standardised elements and IT systems, are studied and specifically analysed for two of them (for ICS-2=35.060 and ICS-2=35.080 the label SE) in the global and local relations (ISO — SRPS). The system is modelled in the phase A(IS±ES&ISO±SRPS): IT/SE/IS&ISO±SRPS.

The twelve macro-elements of the system (IT), in accordance with the 12 standardised segments of IT (or ∑IT), according to [3,4] are in the second dimension: 1. Information technology (IT) in general (35.020), 2. Character sets and information coding (including coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information, IT security techniques, encryption, bar coding, electronic signatures, 35.040), 3. Languages used in information technology (35.060), 4. Software (including software development, documentation, internet applications and use, 35.080), 5. Open systems interconnection (OSI, 35.100), 6. Networking (35.110), 7. Computer graphics (35.140), 8. Microprocessor systems (35.160), 9. IT terminal and other peripheral equipment (35.180), 10. Interface and interconnection equipment (35.200), 11. Data storage devices (35.220), 12. Applications of information technology (35.240).

The dimension, quality level (QL) of the quality improvement PDCA spiral IS, includes:
                              
                                 –
                                 “P” — plan, precedence or preferences, the planned objectives, starting with the intersection of state, the benefits, accompanying activities (to remedy the shortcomings),

“D” — do, defect, deficiency, then, with the appropriate test results,

“C” — check, to the continuous improvement of KB and KBS,

“A” — action, advancement, activity, for the next “round” of the spiral etc.

According to the current quality level in the PDCA spiral of IS quality (through: objectives, activities, results and improvement), marking and modelling of IS excellence in PDCA on the standardisation platform (ISO±SRPS) is shown in Fig. 7:
                              
                                 ○
                                 P(IT) or R — planning or requirements is the initial phase, with significant impacts for at least three of the 12 elements (k=1 to 12): leadership (k=1) environment (6) and resources (9) that are planned,

D(SE) — actual (do or design) is the next phase, with significant impacts for at least three of the 12 elements: organisation (k=2) of team support (3) for development of the process (4) towards IT products,

C(KB) or C/T — checking and coding/testing the next phase, with significant impacts for at least three of the 12 elements: process (k=8) results with their performances (12) and knowledge (11) in IT,

A(IS±ES) or I/AS — improvement activities (act) and install and accepting support are the “final” stage of the PDCA, with significant impacts for at least three of the 12 elements: the Internet (k=5), networking, including LAN/MAN/WAN (7) with interface and interconnection equipment (10) in IT, for quality management.

The new dimension includes time or time-phased increments of the realisation KB in P1D1C1A1 to P2D2C2A2, or in general: PtDtCtAt to Pt+1Dt+1Ct+1At+1 to excellence. The user himself defines the terms, the time or time increments, which makes the model open. Some recommendations for the users refer to:
                              
                                 –
                                 frequency, intensity or level of innovation in this area (Iit or ∆KS/ICS/t, for example ∆KS/IT/t and ∆KS/SE/t, see Section 5.3),

calendar year (for standardised data-base units),

school year (when the question is about the education system) referring to learning materials for e-learning,

months/weeks (when it comes to employment, motivation of the employees in the working week),

respect for excellence goals (the smaller the PDCA increments, the closer it is to excellence) etc.

towards the target level of excellence of IS/ES (excellence level — PtDtCtAt to Pt+1Dt+1Ct+1At+1) including the time dimension of the life cycle and increment improvement of ∆KS/ICS/t for KB/t for IS and ES.

The planned objectives have been achieved, and the analysis can be extended to all standardised fields of work (ICS-1=01 to 99). All initial Hypotheses (Hypotheses 1 to Hypotheses 4 in PiDiCiAi) have been proven.

Over the past 20years some previous studies have demonstrated an enormous amount of information on IT [121]. In this paper, in order to get reliable and objective analyses, primarily academic literature and ISO and SRPS standards were used, with the analysis of results until the year 2000 and trend lines since 2000. The basis of the pragmatic side of the development and implementation of IS, with the use of standards and adapted models, is given in [109].

Since 1990, IT has been involved in solving the problems of how scarce resources are used to generate more wealth and capitalist priorities, with the subordination of social interests in favour of the ruthless race for profit [122] or the “The New Economics” [123]. Very few studies have been carried out with the aim of understanding investment in IT [124], and there are also few articles on knowledge acquisition on the standardisation platform. In this regard, this paper is based on previous analyses, for example [125].

The trend of knowledge management was formed in the mid 1990s [126], and modelling with 12 aspects was created recently and first presented in [11].

Based on the results presented above, one can predict future resources and financial needs for each of the subfields as well as the entirety. Hypothesis 1 has been proven. This is ensured by the established originality of the mathematical functions (1)–(6), theoretically represented by the trend lines. Practically, the defined Iv/year value indices, as well as the information on the stages of development of new projects, are criteria (along with Iqu).

These trend lines (1)–(6) exclude the previous years’ standards which were rendered obsolete (representing innovativity quantitatively, and does not include any adjustments – Cor – because Iv/Cor
                        =0 CHF), so it represents a minimal trend of innovations.

The original mathematical relationships (in Figs. 2b to 6b — right), which predict expectations and resource planning in the area of SE, were derived from the previous results and comparative analyses of standardisation and knowledge acquisition, and similarly for the other areas and sub-areas of creativity. We defined the standardisation of collective knowledge acquisition methods according to the presented analyses and the graphical presentations of trends.

The results of the analyses (for ICS-2=35.060 and ICS-2=35.080) show that the trend of average needs of Iqi/SE/2011-2013
                           =37 new ISO documents is decreasing, annually updating the knowledge (for example, Iqi/SE/2010 (27): Std (11)+Amd (4)+Cor (12)). More than Iv/SE/ISO/2012
                           =5876 CHF is needed for the procurement of these new standards, as standardised units of knowledge (Figs. 4b and 6b). However, if we involve all the changes (Amd+Cor) and ongoing development projects according to the qualitative aspectsl (Iqu/SE/ISO/2011-2013
                           =71, Table 1), we will need substantially more innovations, knowledge and money. In contrast to the declining trends of the range innovations index (Iqi) and the index values (Iv/year), total index values (ΣIv) are growing every year. Financial, organisational and other approaches to knowledge acquisition by creating standards are indispensable. Collectively, the indicated ISO/IEC standardised collective knowledge (in the area of SE according to the previous study) was evaluated at ∑Ivp/SE/ISO/2013
                           =48184 CHF.

Obtaining collective-national knowledge in all Serbian standards (SRPS) in the area of SE will cost approximately Ivp/SE/SRPS
                           =Ivp/35.080/SRPS/2014.01
                           =1608 CHF for Iqp/35.080/SRPS/2014.01
                           =46 documents. The total value of all SRPS standards in IT is ∑Iv/IT/SRPS/2014.01
                           ≈44282 CHF.

Comparative analysis and the financially valued knowledge innovations (Iv in IT) according to the Serbian standards (SRPS) with respect to ICS-1=35 are presented for the same period 2007–2013 (Fig. 3 and Eq. (2)).

Although the field of IT has had extensive innovation in SRPS standards in recent years (due to Serbia’s preparations for EU accession), it does not mean that the same trend will continue in future years. On the other hand, the development trend of ISO standards is continuously supported by various technical subcommittees (see Section 5.3).

At the same time, IT in collective relations (national–international), or SRPS–ISO/IEC, are compared, together with quantitative aspects Iq (Iqs/IT/SRPS/2013
                           ≈Iqp/35.080/SRPS/2013

                           =6445 or≈22%) and the financial value ∑Iv (∑Iv/35/SRPS/2013
                           =44282 CHF compared to ∑Iv/35/ISO/2013
                           =378340 CHF, or only 22%). In both cases, the percentage of the roads of local knowledge acquisition or standardised “state obligations” is considerably smaller when compared to the ISO/IEC (see Section 4.1, Tables 1 and 2).

At the same time, the collective relations (national–international), or SRPS–ISO/IEC knowledge sources, are compared, together with the quantitative aspects Iq (Iqp/SE/SRPS/2013

                           =48184 CHF, or only≈3.33%). In both cases, the percentage of the roads of local knowledge acquisition or standardised “state obligations” is considerably smaller when compared to the ISO/IEC.

Many aspects relate to the attractiveness of the local knowledge acquisition of IT and to the strategy of the firms in the country [127]. This paper analyses the local knowledge and the SRPS standards. The paths of knowledge towards international collective knowledge go beyond national knowledge and that of creative individuals or professional individuals in teams and they take part in creating national SRPS standards. According to national/local SRPS standards, the paths are narrowing. For example, in the SE area of standardisation, “local” improvements are reduced to a single digit percentage of collective ISO/IEC “excellence” (Table 1, compare Fig. 2–3 and Fig. 3–4 and relations (1)–(2), (3)–(4) and (5)–(6)).

The correlation of the phases of development is shown as SE as opposed to IT (as well as the ISO/IEC compared to SRPS):
                              
                                 –

                                    =5 innovations per year, Table 2).

The annual pattern of ISO/IEC new projects or innovations in the areas of SE is Iqu/SE/ISO/2011-2013
                           =71, which is about 8% of Iqu/35/ISO
                           =867 new projects in all other areas of IT (12 segments of the IT).

The roads of standardisation and knowledge acquisition, from development to the application of SE, IS and vice versa (in PDCA) lead through technical committees (JTC 1) and their subcommittees (JTC 1/SC 6/7/22/24/32/34/35), as participants in the development of numerous standards and new projects, Fig. 8

                                    ≈4000 CHF, according to the appropriate mathematical relations and the collective trend line of SE for ICS-2=35.080 — Fig. 4 and ICS-2=35.060 — Fig. 6).

The importance of the ongoing SRPS standardisation development projects (Iqu/SE/SRPS
                           =0 current projects in the SE, when compared to Iqu/35/SRPS
                           =5) is relative. According to [128], This is important for both IS activities towards excellence in general and for the excellence of IS subsystems, such as the process of adaptive e-learning (on certain Moodle courses: “Introduction to IS”, “IS analysis”, “IS” etc. IT studies), for the purpose of managing educational projects using the Moodle e-learning system (www.ftn.kg.ac.rs/Moodle/).

Comparative analysis and the financial innovation of knowledge valued (Iv in SE) by Serbian standards (SRPS) with respect to ICS-2=35.080 is presented for the same period 2007–2013 (Fig. 5 and Eq. (3)).

Local standardisation and knowledge acquisition (SRPS standards [4]), defined and innovated the obligations arising from them. Examples of the SRPS ISO/IEC standards software and systems life-cycle process are:

The results show relevant details of the analyses in SE, with the subfields in SE and with the possibility of the comparison of the concept of “the gap between individual and collective knowledge acquisition” 
                        [7], with new concepts of study and learning (according to [128] for IT, [130] for SE, [131] for IS, [132]), and this was carried out together with the appropriate integration of IT into the education system, with learning and knowledge of other systems. In the phase of checking the results, the most authoritative persons to do so are the users: individuals, corporations, society, the State, Unions. Excellence in the base of knowledge (system–expert system, IS–ES), and on KB and KBS, is dependent on experts, the innovated knowledge of professionals and available resources (including the amount of money — since knowledge innovation is based on it).

Based on index values Iit for IT and SE, groups or classes/clusters of innovation (or Check-phase) with values Ii=0 — perennially, Ii=1 — yearly, Ii=2 — monthly, Ii=3 — weekly or Ii=4 — daily (Section 4, Table 1) have been determined. In terms of application in practice, the applied methodology for the clustering of subfields of IT (SE) has the advantage over the same theoretical methods of hierarchical clustering analysis in mathematical taxonomy [118]: centroid linkage method, Ward minimum variance method and others.

The results of the study point to the main IT subfields being within the class of “weekly” innovation checks (Iiw). Iiw is correlated with quantity indices, primarily Iqu, ranging between 50<KBti≤250 (Table 1, column 7 and 8 referring to Iqu/35.080/ISO/2011). The professional work in these subfields requires all-through-the-week monitoring of innovation (weekly checks), which applies to ICS-2=35.080 based on the ISO platform.

Act (Ai), Advancement (Ai) or Improvement (relationship with proof of Hypothesis 4): the correlation among all indices as criteria for product promotions (IS/ES), as well as the need for continuous KB innovation regarding both global (ISO) and local (SRPS) standardisation is obvious (see Section 4.4, model and the related possibilities).

Besides theoretical, practical and research innovation approaches, the financial aspect had great importance in this work. But many other aspects of planning, such as “historical”, futuristic, qualitative, quantitative and spatial (SRPS and ISO), were included: time (PDCA), hardware (less) — software (more), professional (more) — the user (less), the research — pedagogical, deductive — inductive, collective — individual and so on. If the financial, time, professional and qualitative criteria were analysed, planned inclusion in new projects would be found to be the most appropriate.

The financial needs for inclusion in the ISO stages of development are presented and they are minimal, but require significant commitment of well-educated researchers.

The contribution of this work to the academic community is in the practical monitoring of collective knowledge trends in IT SE with the goal of better organisation of the educational system, i.e. schools, universities, individuals (with individual knowledge, the wider community, and all in the standardisation platform. The specific contribution of this study (the author’s location being Serbia) has resulted in the creation of new modules in the study programme “IT — software engineering” (undergraduate and master studies). The newly created module “IT — software engineering” (with 240 ECTS, European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) framework by the European Commission) entered the accreditation procedure in 2013 and will run for five years. The first generation enrolled for these advanced studies in 2014, the fifth will enroll in 2019; therefore, this study will be run until 2023. For the education of IT teachers in the future (ICS-1=35), the study programme module “IT in Education” (300 ECTS) has been created. The expected long-term contribution in this area is reflected in the application of IT and SE, so that the first generation of IT teachers will complete their studies in 2019. After that period of time, they will educate younger generations on the platform of innovation and standardisation of IT and SE trends.

Future work relates to the additional specificity of each of the elements of the model matrix (SE&PiDiCiAi&QMk) x n, where n=Iit (number of stages of innovation increments in time “t”) in the PtnDtnCtnAtn spiral, and is based on the examples of improving the university’s integrated IS (including the system for adaptive e-learning and all universities’ and faculties’ IS subsystems). In correlation with the initial Hypothesis, this would be referred to as “Bottom Up” implementation (H3 & H4) with innovation of the mentioned study programmes over the next 10years at least, for example, advancement of the IS Student Services (ISSS) “road” towards creating excellence in an educational institution [109].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We can draw conclusions in several directions, for example, pragmatically, futuristically or theoretically (the mathematical relationships), or according to originality: KS, KB, KBS, the KB innovation trends in the PiDiCiAi methodology and the ICS&PDCA&QMk model; or on the routes: the pre-planned objectives of the work, the activities that accompany the work, the results and potential improvements. Open models approach the real situation with the possibility of innovation and knowledge acquisition, integrated improvement and the pursuit of IS integrated excellence. The answers to relevant issues (through the presentation of evidence of preliminary Hypotheses H1 to H4 through the PiDiCiAi), can be found in the correlation between different time stages, based on the presented results and the outlined analyses of the examples of SE and IS.

According to the trends in collective ISO/IEC knowledge acquisition, the original mathematical relationships (presented trend lines, theoretically speaking), and individual knowledge of the stages of development of new projects on the practical side, that have already been formed, can be predicted for future resources, the financial needs of each of the segments/sub-areas and the whole resources. The difference between the discontinuous and continuous improvement of the quality and level of individual knowledge is important (valued ratio of 1 to 17.5). For this area of SE in IT, the needs are Iv/35.080/ISO/2013
                        +Iv/35.060/ISO/2013
                        =2760 CHF a year to maintain continuity of knowledge. Cumulatively, without continuous or discontinuous innovation, we need 17.5 times more money (ΣIv/35.080/ISO/2014.01
                        +ΣIv/35.060/ISO/2014.01
                        =48184 CHF) for all the ISO methods of knowledge acquisition on SE in IT.

At the same time, parallel roads of knowledge acquisition on the standardisation platform in IT and isolated areas in SE were analysed (ISO/IEC and SRPS). It is also concluded that continuous innovation and knowledge of individual development projects (ISO) are financially justified.

Based on these results (Sections 4 and 4.1 to 4.4), implicit conclusions can be drawn for IT resource planning (see Section 5.1).

More precise determination of the quantitative (Iq) and financial (Iv) “gap” between the individual and collective – global (ISO) and local (or national SRPS) – through social knowledge of SE was enabled with the presented results of the original analyses (for two of the 12 areas of IT). On the other hand, the development trend of ISO standards is continuously supported by various technical committees (see Section 5.2). The results of the analyses and practices show that the standards of knowledge can be used for the formation of a local/national knowledge base which is more accessible than the present one. Therefore, the results of individual work would have been supported from “social”, public or civilisation and strategy-orientated results and also from the scope of knowledge acquisition, which is obviously the way to improve the quality, the education and the higher level of social (collective) knowledge. The acquisition of local knowledge in the area of software and system design (ICS-2=35.080) is more dominant than the segment of program languages in IT (ICS-2=35.060).

The original mathematical relations (1)–(8) were derived and the trend lines have been presented, according to the trends and dynamic developments. These provide an important theoretical aspect of the solution of practical “problems”. It is undisputed that the “Paths of knowledge acquisition in SE fields are based on ISO/IEC standards” — Hypothesis 2 has been proven. The growing problem is how to access standards in certain areas of IT, according to the future directions in SE. In the present work, it is easier to solve SE problems at a state rather than at an individual level (no matter if it is work with professionals, teachers, designers or programmers etc.).

Some, significant difficulties were shown by the results of the analyses (for ICS-1=35, ICS-2=35.080 and ICS-2=25.060, see Section 5.4), and also the future directions for limiting the summary criterion of value ΣIv/35/ISO/2014.01
                        =378340 CHF.

The solution to the problem is hidden in the access of updated standards for the advancement of knowledge and the new ISO–SRPS documents under development.

In recent years, although the field of IT (for ICS-1=35) has been extensively imbued with SRPS standards (because of Serbia’s preparations for EU accession), this study shows that the same trend of innovation will not be continued in the future.

The results of the original SE analyses were correlated with IT, enabling closer determination of the financial “gap” between individual and collective, national (SRPS) and global (ISO) knowledge acquisition, opening up new possibilities for further research, and innovation of KB of the SE, towards IS excellence.

The creation of an original methodology for checking the KB innovation trend in the time dimension and comparison of the intensity of innovation in all technologies on the standardisation platform were allowed by the results of these analyses (see Section 5.3).

It is necessary to continuously improve standardised knowledge. Improvements in IS (in companies) often depend on management, leadership, and all the capacities of the macro processes designed to achieve better results. This research work (developmental, pragmatic, futuristic) will be followed by a more detailed analysis of IS modelling (IS±ES&PDCA&QMk towards excellence) for decision making in an integrated universities’ IS. Future directions (the product is software), the application of the SE part of the work, deals with modelling excellence and analysing the developed IS for student services, according to aspects of the customised models of excellence as well as continuous improvement of IS in the temporal dimension of the PDCA spiral. The upcoming new degree programmes can be used for other future directions (when products are the services of higher education), see Section 5.4.
