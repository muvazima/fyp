                  Based on previous results on periodic non-uniform sampling (Multi-Coset) and using the well known Non-Uniform Fourier Transform through Bartlett’s method for Power Spectral Density estimation, we propose a new smart sampling scheme named the Dynamic Single Branch Non-uniform Sampler. The idea of our scheme is to reduce the average sampling frequency, the number of samples collected, and consequently the power consumption of the Analog to Digital Converter. In addition to that our proposed method detects the location of the bands in order to adapt the sampling rate. In this paper, through we show simulation results that compared to classical uniform sampler or existing multi-coset based samplers, our proposed sampler, in certain conditions, provides superior performance, in terms of sampling rate or energy consumption. It is not constrained by the inflexibility of hardware circuitry and is easily reconfigurable. We also show the effect of the false detection of active bands on the average sampling rate of our new adaptive non-uniform sub-Nyquist sampler scheme.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Radio Frequency (RF) allows modulation of narrow band signals with a high carrier frequency. The radio signals of human origin are often sparse. In other words, they are composed of a relatively small number of narrow band transmissions spread across a wide spectral region. A practical description of these signals is the multi-band model where the spectrum of the signal is only composed of several continuous intervals in a wide spectrum. In addition, new wireless applications place high demands on the quality of radio resources such as bandwidth and spectrum. Moreover, the current trends in wireless technology have increased the complexity of the receiver, more specifically its Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). According to Shannon–Nyquist theorem, a signal whose spectral support is limited to 
                        
                           −

                      and 
                        
                           
                              f

                      can be perfectly reconstructed by sampling at fnyq
                     . To sample a wide band signal with Nyquist rate will require a high sampling rate ADC which consumes a lot of energy. To reduce the sampling rate, and in turn the energy consumption, several researchers have studied the possibility of sub-Nyquist sampling. In [1], a sub-Nyquist sampling method is proposed for sparse multi-band signals, called Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC). MWC consists of several stages and each stage uses a different mixing function followed by a low pass filter and a low uniform sampling rate. This sampling technique shows that perfect reconstruction is possible when the band locations are known. In [1,2], authors have studied the blind case, where the location of the bands is unknown with an inflexible and sub optimal sampler scheme in term of sampling rate. Over the recent years, multi-coset sampling [3–5] has gained fair popularity and several methods of implementing the multi-coset sampling have been proposed. The most famous architecture is composed of several parallel branches, each with a time shift followed by a uniform sampler operating at a sampling rate lower than the Nyquist rate. Recently, a different approach for implementing multi-coset sampling has been proposed in [6], which uses uniform samplers operating at different rates and is known as the Synchronous Mutlirate Sampling. In [7], a Dual-sampling architecture is presented for multi-coset sampling which is basically a subset of the Synchronous Multi rate Sampling and uses only two uniform samplers. But for optimal reconstruction, all these methods assume that the number of bands and the maximum bandwidth, a band can have, is known. In [1], authors have defined some requirements that need to be fulfilled for a sampling system to be efficient. These requirements are stated as follows: the sampling rate (average) should be as low as possible, the system has no prior knowledge of the band locations, and the system can be designed with existing devices. In this paper, we propose a blind sampler based on multi-coset sampling scheme which respects the above stated definition of an efficient sampler. Our scheme estimates the spectral support, using our non-uniform spectrum sensing model proposed in [8,9], to minimize the average sampling rate, thereby reducing the number of samples as well as energy consumption. We show that our proposed spectrum sensing model provides accurate results using less data samples. Its performance is examined at low rate SNR values with less data samples. In addition, its power consumption is compared with regular ADC when the input signal is very sparse and it is found to produce satisfactory results.

This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the signal model along with an overview of multi-coset sampling. In Section 3, we present our proposed sampling system and explain all its blocks. Then the non-uniform spectrum sensing model is presented and the functionality of each block is explained. Numerical results are presented in Section 4 followed by a conclusion in the end.

Multi-Coset (MC) sampling is a periodic non-uniform sub-Nyquist sampling technique which samples a signal x(t) at a lower rate than the Nyquist rate, thereby capturing only the amount of information required for an accurate reconstruction of the signal [1,2]. In short, the process of MC sampling can be viewed as first sampling the input signal at a uniform rate with period T and then selecting only p non-uniform samples from L equidistant uniform samples. The process is repeated for consecutive segments of L uniform samples such that the p selected samples have a sampling period L. The set

MC sampler is usually implemented by placing p ADCs in parallel as shown in Fig. 1
                        . Each ADC operates uniformly at a period

                         represents the time shifts in sampling instants introduced in each branch. It should be noted that a good choice of the sampling pattern 
                           C
                         reduces the margin of error due to spectral aliasing and sensitivity to noise in the reconstruction process [2]. It is quite evident from Fig. 1 that once the sampling parameters (such as p) are selected, architecture of the MC sampler will remain unchanged irrespective of the input signal characteristics. In other words, once designed, the sampler in Fig. 1 cannot be changed because of hardware limitations. If the input signal changes the MC sampler does not adapt, which results in sub-optimal sampling of the signal, as will be show later. This motivated us to look for an flexible system which conforms with the spectrum of the input signal. In the next section, we explain the functionality of our new sampling scheme with and show that it is more flexible compared to the MC sampler in Fig. 1.

With the exponential growth in the means of communications, modifying radio devices easily and cost-effectively has become business critical. Software-defined radio (SDR) technology brings the flexibility, cost efficiency and power to drive communications forward, with wide-reaching benefits realized by service providers and product developers through to end users [10]. One of the main objectives of SDR is to propose new technologies to design radio terminals and wireless infrastructure able to support hardware-independent, multi-service operations and which are remotely reconfigurable. Furthermore, Cognitive radio continues to gain popularity as it adapts intelligently to the radio environment, there by dynamically managing the spectrum [10]. As a result, the spectrum changes continuously and rarely remains constant. Keeping the aspects of Software radio and Cognitive radio in mind, we present in this paper a new sampler, that not only adapts to the changes of the input signal but is also remotely reconfigurable and is, therefore, not constrained by the inflexibility of hardwired circuitry. Our proposed non-uniform sampler is shown in Fig. 2
                     . We call it the Dynamic Single Branch Non-Uniform Sampler (DSB-NUS) or simply the DSB sampler [8]. DSB sampler is based on the principle of MC sampling except that instead of p input branches in case of MC sampling, the DSB sampler has only one. Furthermore, our DSB sampler has an adaptation loop which allows to measure the spectral support of the input signal periodically, and adapt the sampling rate according to the spectrum of the input signal. The regular MC sampling lacks this adaptive and feedback mechanism and is rather a static, hardwired system. The DSB sampler operates in blind mode, without any knowledge of the input signal’s spectral support 
                        F
                      and the number of bands N, and efficiently reduces the number of samples while ensuring optimal reconstruction with minimum error.

The DSB-NUS operates in two phases:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              Adaptation phase: When the switch is in position 1, the sampler adapts the sampling parameters according to the spectral support of the input signal x(t) through a feedback loop.


                              Reconstruction phase: When the switch is in position 2, the DSB-NUS sampler performs Multi-Coset reconstruction.

As this will be shown shortly, the average sampling rate of our system depends on the signal sparsity in the frequency domain. Next we present the operation of each block of the DSB sampler.

In this paper, we design the NUS of the DSB sampler as a reconfigurable Additive Pseudo-Random Sampler (APRS) [11] in conjunction with MC sampling. Thus, unlike the regular MC sampler with several branches, the input of the DSB-NUS is composed of a single branch non-uniform sampler. The

                        } is a set of i.i.d random variables with probability density p
                        1(τ), mean T and with variance σ
                        2. Although, the input components of the DSB sampler have changed compared to the regular MC sampler but the signal at the output of the NUS remains the same as in the case of MC sampling [2]. As a result, for each L uniformly spaced samples in case of Nyquist sampling, we get p non-uniform samples (see Fig. 3
                        ).

                         is non-uniform and periodic with period L like the regular MC sampler. But unlike the regular MC sampler, the DSB sampler uses a non uniform sampler witch samples only some portions of the received signal. It can be possible to switch off the ADC on a predefined instances to reduce the power consumption. Most of the existing non uniform digitizer use a uniform clock as a reference clock, and have some circuitry which transforms the uniform clock to a non uniform one [11,12].

Following the approach of the MC sampling presented in Fig. 1, we express the non-uniform samples x(tn
                        ) at the output of the NUS in terms of periodic sequences

The reconstruction of x(t) requires to solve (6). Using the fact that x(t) is sparse in the frequency domain and that there is no energy in certain cells, the number of unknowns in (6) can be reduced. The set 
                           K
                         consists of the spectral indexes of the cells that contain signal which are called the active cells. But in order to find 
                           K
                         different methods have been proposed in literature [13,14,1]. But the limitation of the methods proposed is that they require complete knowledge of the matrix 
                           
                              A

                        , the number of bands N and the maximum bandwidth. Since we assume that we do not have any information regarding the spectrum of the signal x(t), therefore, the matrix 
                           
                              A

                        , along with other parameters, cannot be known. In order to overcome this hurdle, we treat this scenario as a missing data problem. In [15] we have proposed to use the Lomb–Scargle’s method [16] to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) of the non-uniformly sampled signal, in spectrum sensing. In this paper, rather than Lomb–Scargle periodogram, we propose to use the well know Non-Uniform Fourier Transform through Bartlett’s method [17].

In our proposed NUSSB, the threshold, η, is the only information assumed to be available on the input signal. It should be noted that these technique can be used only if the power difference between each band is small.

As will be shown later in the paper through simulations, the results obtained using Bartlett’s method for spectral support detection are quite accurate.

                         then τ ≈ 0.078, we select a 14-bits 100 MSPS digitally calibrated pipeline ADC which consumes 250mW per 100 MSPS [18] then,

                         operations. So from (27), we deduce Pcpu

nJ/OP. Furthermore, to maintain a real-time processing, the execution time of the

                         operations must be less than the sampling period. Then the chosen processor in this example must be performs more than 40.8Giga operations per second. It is shown in [19] a processor which processes at 50Giga operations per second with a power efficiency around 57.8
fJ/OP. Then our system could be more power efficiency than regular ADC when the bands locations are unknown with a very sparse signal.

                         is as small as possible, [1,2]. The condition number of a matrix U is defined as

One way of solving (28) is to use greedy search algorithms. Authors in [2] proposed to use the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) to find the set 
                           C
                        . The SFS algorithm used in [2] lacks the capability to remove elements from set

                         that become obsolete after the addition of other elements. For a given set

For simulations, we consider a multi band signal with a variable number of bands

                     , each with a bandwidth B
                     =20MHz, we assume that the N bands have the same power. The wide band of interest is in the range of [0,500] MHz i.e.

                     GHz. 16 QAM modulation symbols are used that are corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise. To evaluate the performance of our Dynamic Non-uniform Sampler, we start by presenting in Section 4.1, the performance of our Non-Uniform Spectrum Sensing block versus to 
                        
                           α

                      (the compression ratio), β (the threshold) and the SNR. In Section 4.2, we illustrate the performance of the proposed DSB sampler by comparing it to regular MC scheme and the drawback of poor detection of the spectral support on its average frequency.

In this sub-section we will evaluate the performance of our NUSSB in terms of good detection of the number of bands N and the set of actives bands 
                           K
                         (see Section 3.2). For simulation, we take

                         and

In order to compute Pd
                         and Pfa
                        , we start by choosing an appropriate β. In Fig. 7, we have performed 1000 iterations at SNR=10dB and for different values of α and β. It can be seen here that whatever

                         also depend on the number of non-uniform samples available to NUSSB for detection.

As the average
                         sampling rate for the DSB sampler is

                        , it can be suspected that a false estimation of 
                           
                              N

                         by NUSSB will directly effect the favg
                         of the DSB sampler. This can happen because at a high Pfa
                        , the NUSSB shows that the estimated spectral support 
                           F
                         of the signal is larger than the actual support, as a result, the DSB sampler is forced to sample at a higher, unoptimized sampling rate. This will be illustrated in the next sub-section.

To start, we assume that the traditional MC sampler is designed not only to have an optimal reconstruction for the signals but also a perfect knowledge of 
                           
                              (

                              K
                              )

                         and N of any kind of signals. In the following, we use the subscripts mc and dsb to differentiate between simulation parameters for MC and DSB samplers, respectively. It should be noted that pmc
                         allows to set the number of branches [2] or number of uniform sampler placed in parallel [6,7] on the MC sampler. For sampling process, we select

In Fig. 9, we have plotted the RMSE as a function of condition number of

                         of signal x(t) without noise. The sampling pattern 
                           C
                         is chosen randomly and by using the SFS algorithm (see Section 3.5). It can be seen that SFS Algorithm make the reconstruction more efficient than a randomly choice of the set 
                           C
                        .

In the rest of the simulation the RMSE is calculated using (30) and is averaged over 1000 iterations. It should be noted that the parameters of the MC sampler remain unchanged due to the hardware rigidity regardless of the input signal characteristics. Since the spectral support is unknown to the DSB sampler, it always starts from the adaptation phase to find 
                           F
                         and N, and then goes ahead to operate in reconstruction phase until needed to recheck the spectrum of the input signal. The sampler can be programmed to periodically check the spectral changes. For simplicity we assume here that the instants of changes in spectrum are known. So, the sampler switches to the adaptation phase each time there is a change in the spectrum of the input signal to detect the new support.


                        Fig. 10
                        , shows that the performance of our proposed blind DSB sampler completely matches with the non-blind MC sampler in terms of RMSE. The results obtained are very promising. We can conclude from Fig. 10 that the Bartlett method used for support detection makes our proposed sampler same as the non-blind one as. However, it is noted that such convincing results are obtained with a very sparse multiband signal.

In order to show the flexibility and adaptivity of the proposed DSB sampler, we consider that the spectrum of the signal x(t) changes with time. In other word the number of bands N varies from 1 to 7. All the results provided in Figs. 11–13, are for the scenario where the number of bands N changes from 6

6. For simplicity we assume that the change in N occurs after every 2 time instants i.e. at time instants 1 and 2, 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              6
                           
                        , for time instants 3 and 4, 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              4
                           
                         and N and so on. The evolution of N with time is indicated at the top of each of Figs. 11–13.

At the start when the time instant is equal to 1, the samplers start with 
                           
                              N

                        . Based on the signal spectrum characteristics, both MC and DSB samplers start sampling at

                                 ¯
                              
                              dsb
                           
                        , as shown in Figs. 11 and 12.

In Fig. 13, we have plotted the variation in RMSE, for the two samplers, corresponding to Figs. 11 and 12, as N changes over time. If we closely analyze Fig. 13, we observe that RMSEmc
                         is slightly better compared to RMSEdsb
                         when N decreases from 6
 →
4
 →
2.

This happens because the MC sampler uses much more samples than the proposed one. The most important variation in RMSEmc
                         to observe is when N changes from 5
 →
7. Fig. 12 shows that as N changes from 5
 →
7, our DSB sampler adjusts pdsb
                         to 56. While for the MC sampler, pmc
                         remains equal to 50 because of the lack of adaptability and lack of availability of 50 branches at the input of the MC sampler. This results in a drastic increase in RMSEmc
                         i.e. of the order of −5dB as shown in Fig. 13. Even if we suppose that there is a feedback mechanism in the MC sampler to set 
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 mc
                              
                              =
                              56
                           
                        , it cannot adjust pmc
                         because of the hardware limitations, i.e. the MC sampler used in our simulation has only p
                        =50 branches. On the other hand, adjust 
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 dsb
                              
                              =
                              56
                           
                         and the RMSEdsb
                         remains low i.e. of the order of −21dB. Therefore, our DSB sampler adapts quickly to avoid any loss of data. The proposed Adaptive non uniform sampler uses a single ADC which can be switched off at predefined instances and can theoretically adapt pdsb
                         to any value up to 128 depending on the signal.

                         of the DSB sampler. This happens because at low SNR the false alarm probability is high. Then the NUSSB shows the estimated spectral’s estimated support 
                           K
                         as larger than the actual support, this make the DSB sampler to sample at a higher, un-optimized sampling rate. This becomes more clear Fig. 15, where Favg
                         is plotted as a function of

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we proposed a new smart sampling system for cognitive radio, called the Dynamic Single Branch non-uniform sampler. To ensure optimal reconstruction with a small number of samples, the DSB adapts its parameters according to the input signal’s sparsity. Its operates in two phases, the adaptation phase and the reconstruction phase. In the adaptation phase, the proposed scheme senses the spectrum and adapts its sampling rate by computing the proposed non-uniform spectrum sensing technique. We have shown that the proposed sensing model works efficiently and shows high detection and low false alarm probabilities. The performance of the spectrum sensing model improves by increasing the number of available non-uniform samples to the sensing method. As the sampling instances of our Non-uniform sampler depends to the position of this one on the Nyquist grid, then the average sampling rate depends on the number of bands contained in the signal. Furthermore, we have shown the effect of false detection on it. The DSB sampler performance has been compared to those of a traditional, non flexible Multi-Coset architecture which contains severals parallel uniform samplers. We have shown that our system is significantly more efficient than the conventional MC sampler when the spectrum of signal changes. The system can be designed with existing ADC and falls in the category of software defined radio system.
