Quantile-based risk measures

Mean-Risk model for portfolio optimization

Utility functions

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  In this paper we propose a quantile-based risk measure which is defined using the modified loss distribution according to the decision maker’s risk and loss aversion. The properties related to different classes of disutility functions are established. A portfolio selection model in the Mean-Risk framework is proposed and equivalent formulations of the model generating the same efficient frontier are given. The advantages of this approach are investigated using real world data from NYSE. The differences between the efficient frontier of the proposed model and the classical Mean-Variance and Mean-CVaR are quantified and interpreted. Extensive experiments show that the efficient portfolios obtained by using the proposed model exhibit lower risk levels and an increased satisfaction compared to the other two Mean-Risk models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Solving the portfolio selection problem relies on models for preference between random variables representing portfolio returns. Choosing a specific model is itself a problem because each type of models assumes a different vision on choice under risk, different theoretical basis with strengths and weaknesses, and different degrees of computational tractability. In this paper, we present a new Mean-Risk model of portfolio selection. Its novelty consists in using of a new risk measure based on the modified loss distribution function according to the decision maker’s risk and loss aversion preferences. These preferences are usually described by increasing, smooth and concave utility functions, but studies in behavioral finance showed that people systematically violate expected utility theory, see for example Camerer, Kagel, and Roth (1995). Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Tversky and Kahneman (1992) have found that decisions are driven especially by loss aversion and the prospect of ending up with less than the initial wealth. There is also the power utility function with loss aversion implemented by Maringer, Kontoghiorghes, Rustem, and Winker (2008) where the returns are adjusted before they are evaluated in the utility function: returns lower than a prescribed threshold are given disproportionate weight. Therefore, the utility changes abruptly resulting in a kinked utility function, see Cremers, Kritzman, and Page (2005); Hagstromer and Binner (2009); Maringer et al. (2008); Sharpe (2007). There is a variety of reasons why decision makers have critical thresholds: some investors might violate loan covenants if their assets fall below a specified value, others face regulatory mandates which require a minimum level of reserves, also in the practice of risk when asset levels fall under the loss threshold fund managers are penalized.

Apart these approaches relying on utility functions, there are the Mean-Risk models. Variance was the first risk measure used in portfolio optimization. The Mean-Variance (MV) methodology proposed by Markowitz (1952) has played a crucial role in portfolio theory and provided the fundamental basis for the development of a large part of the modern financial theory applied to the portfolio optimization problem; moreover, in his recent paper (Markowitz, 2012), a thoroughly research on mean–variance approximations to expected utility can be found. But regulations for finance businesses formulate some of the risk management requirements in terms of quantiles of loss distributions. The most commonly used is the Value at Risk (VaR). VaR can be efficiently estimated and managed when underlying risk factors are normally distributed. However, for non-normal distributions, VaR may have undesirable properties (see Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999) such as the lack of sub-additivity. Also, VaR is difficult to control/optimize for discrete distributions, when it is calculated using scenarios. In this case, VaR is non-convex and non-smooth as a function of positions, and has multiple local extrema. To alleviate these problems, (Artzner et al., 1999) proposed the Conditional VaR (CVaR) which is sub-additive and, consequently, coherent. CVaR continues to be intensively studied and applied in different contexts. For example, in the context of enhanced indexation, the paper of Roman, Mitra, and Zviarovich (2013) provides a unified framework incorporating CVaR and second order stochastic dominance. More detailed discussions on CVaR and new advances on its estimation and asymptotics can be found in Rockafellar and Uryasev (2002) and Chun, Shapiro, and Uryasev (2012), just to name a few.

The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we propose a risk measure defined using the modified loss distribution according to the decision maker’s risk and loss aversion preferences and establish its properties (Section 2). Our motivation is based on the well known fact well acknowledged in the literature that different categories of investors have different modeling needs which are not well met by standard approaches, see (Spronk & Hallerbach, 1997; Cillo & Delquié, 2014; Wächter & Mazzoni, 2013). Investors preferences are often, but not exclusively related to utility functions. Many other different ideas of modeling them were proposed in the literature. For example, investor’s preferences can be captured through various types of constraints such as cardinality constraints in portfolio optimization as in Chang, Meade, Beasley, and Sharaiha (2000) and Woodside-Oriakhi, Lucas, and Beasley (2011), or in energy planning as in Chang (2014), crop planning as in Rădulescu and Rădulescu (2012) and Rădulescu and Rădulescu (2014), socially responsible investments as in Hallerbach, Ning, Soppe, and Spronk (2004), just to name a few. Also, to accommodate the preferences of non-standard investors (expressed as additional stochastic and deterministic objectives such as liquidity, dividends, number of securities in a portfolio, social responsibility,...), portfolio selection models with multiple criteria that ensures portfolio suitability are developed in Steuer, Qi, and Hirschberger (2007). Moreover, the very choice of the risk measure used in the portfolio model is a manifestation of preferences. Apart the classical risk measures, new ones were designed to cover various risk profiles, see for example the Conditional Average (inspired by CVaR but using two confidence levels) introduced by Krzemienowski (2009). The idea of using more than one confidence level is also present in Kalinchenko, Uryasev, and Rockafellar (2012) where risk preferences are calibrated by the coefficients in the mixed CVaR deviation. But usually investors preferences are related to utility functions. Up to now, in conjunction with a Mean-Risk model (most frequently with Mean-Variance), investor’s utility function was used to determine the preferred portfolio out of the investment set represented by the Mean-Risk efficient frontier, see (De Giorgi & Hens, 2009; Hens & Mayer, 2014; Kroll, Levy, & Markowitz, 1984; Levy & Levy, 2004; Pirvu & Schulze, 2012). In this paper, instead of taking into account investor’s preferences only in this second phase, we bring them into the risk measure by using her/his utility function that captures the investor’s risk and loss aversion; consequently, preferences are fully taken into consideration right from the first phase in which the efficient frontier is determined. Thus, this paper addresses one of the main universally acknowledged streams of concerns: the challenge to balance the properties of the risk measure with behavioral and practical considerations. Secondly, we consider a bi-objective portfolio selection model in the Mean-Risk framework using the risk measure previously defined. and give different equivalent representation of the efficient frontier (Section 3). We give three equivalent formulations of the model. They are equivalent in the sense that they produce the same efficient frontier. The equivalence between the three models is proven for the Mean-Variance efficient frontier in Steinbach (2001), for the Mean-Regret efficient frontier in Dembo and Rosen (1999) and for the Reward-CVaR efficient frontier in Krokhmal, Palmquist, and Uryasev (2002). Thirdly, we investigate the practical performances of the model using real data from New York Stock Exchange (Section 4). We present the forecast procedure used and the out-of-sample analysis assessing the reliability of the forecast (Section 4.1). We compare the efficient frontier of the proposed model with the Mean-CVaRand Mean-Variance frontiers quantifying the differences and similarities between them (Section 4.2). Moreover, we assess the investor’s benefits of using the proposed model: out-of-sample experiments show that the efficient portfolios obtained by using it exhibit lower risk levels (at the same return levels).

                      will be the same for all investors whatever their particular profiles of loss aversion. But in real life, an investor has a certain risk profile and also a critical loss level; it is the case of an investor whose lifestyle might change drastically if a certain critical loss level is reached. Therefore, a more realistic approach is to consider that the decision maker is characterized by an increasing convex disutility function D with loss aversion which exhibits a kink at this critical loss level θ. When θ is reached, the perception of losses changes abruptly: the losses higher than this critical threshold are given disproportionate weight in accordance with a loss aversion parameter λ which yields a kink on the disutility function located at the critical loss value. An example of such a disutility function D that captures the investor’s risk and loss aversion can be written based on the utility function U defined in Adler and Kritzman (2007); Cremers et al.

                     . This function is also similar to the piecewise linear loss-averse utility used in Fortin and Hlouskova (2011). More examples of disutility functions with loss aversion, can be found in Maringer et al. (2008) and for the effect of utility functions on the optimal portfolio see also Yu, Pang, Troutt, and Hou (2009) and Çanakoğlu and Özekici (2010).

When making decisions by considering the disutility of the loss as previously described, we define the Conditional Value at Risk of the disutility of the loss at a probability level of α ∈ (0, 1),

Therefore DCVaRα
                         of the monetary loss l(
                           x, p
                        ) is in fact CVaRα
                         of the modified/altered loss D(l(
                           x, p
                        )); the alteration in the decision maker’s perception of the monetary value is caused by his loss aversion which is captured and represented here by the disutility D. Regarded as a function of the random variable D(l(
                           x, p
                        )), due to Proposition 2 from (Pflug & Uryasev, 2000), CVaRα
                        (D(l(
                           x, p
                        ))) is coherent in the sense that it is translation-invariant, convex, positively homogeneous and monotonic with respect to the stochastic dominance of second order, as defined in Artzner et al. (1999). Next, we discuss the properties of DCVaRα
                         regarded as a function of l(
                           x, p
                        ).

(1) Monotonicity. DCVaRα
                         is monotone i.e. for any two portfolios 
                           x
                        
                        1 and 
                           x
                        
                        2, if l(
                           x
                        
                        1, 
                           p
                        ) ⪯ l(
                           x
                        
                        2, 
                           p
                        ), then DCVaRα
                        (l(
                           x
                        
                        1, 
                           p
                        )) ≤ DCVaRα
                        (l(
                           x
                        
                        2, 
                           p
                        )) which is a straightforward consequence of the monotonicity of D and CVaRα
                        . We recall that the previous notation l(
                           x
                        
                        1, 
                           p
                        ) ⪯ l(
                           x
                        
                        2, 
                           p
                        ) represents the sample-path dominance: l(
                           x
                        
                        1, p(ω)) ≤ l(
                           x
                        
                        2, p(ω)) for all ω ∈ Ω.

                        . We recall that the normalization property of a risk measure expresses the fact that zero loss implies no risk. Regarding D, the requirement 
                           
                              D

                                 )

                              0
                           
                         is not restrictive and has the natural interpretation that the dissatisfaction of a zero-loss is null and the disutility function (2 ) satisfies this condition.

(4) Positive homogeneity. We recall that the positive homogeneity axiom ensures that if all realizations of the financial risky position under consideration are multiplied by a positive factor, then the corresponding risk scales with the same factor. Follmer and Schied (2002) and Frittelli and Rosazza Gianin (2002) showed that this requirement is questionable in the context of financial applications where the monetary payoff of a financial position is taken into consideration. The reason is that a risk measure satisfying the positive-homogeneity property may fail to detect liquidity risk. Because, when a position is multiplied by a large factor n, an additional liquidity risk may arise and therefore the risk of this whole new position becomes less liquid than n distinct simple positions. There is another aspect that prevents the positive homogeneity property of DCVaRα
                         from being satisfied: when multiplying l(
                           x, p
                        ) by a positive factor γ, l(
                           x, p
                        ) and γl(
                           x, p
                        ) might result in opposite sides of the threshold θ, therefore it is natural for DCVaRα
                         to be positive sub-, respectively positive supra-homogeneous in the following sense:

(5) The axiom of translation invariance from Artzner et al. (1999) and Follmer and Schied (2002) can be found in different forms: as cash invariance in Follmer and Schied (2004), translation-equivariance in Pflug and Uryasev (2000), cash-additivity in El Karoui and Ravanelli (2009). When assessing the risk of a future payoff, the translation invariance axiom is supported by the following financial interpretation: adding risk-free cash to a risky position reduces its risk by the same amount. But assuming the existence and liquidity of such a risk-free asset is not realistic and any form of uncertainty/stochasticity in interest rates makes the translation invariance assumption too restrictive; the simple consideration of the time value of the money imposes the replacement of translation invariance by a weaker condition called cash-sub-additivity, see El Karoui and Ravanelli (2009).

                        We note that the positivity of the loss is an essential condition here. Indeed, having in mind the graphical representation of the particular disutility function (2), it is easy to find a value l(
                           x, p
                        ) ≤ 0 inferior to θ and c ≥ 0 for which the opposite of (11) is true.

(6) The axiom of subadditivity is a controversial one. Important papers such as Artzner et al. (1999) explain why the subadditivity property is a natural requirement for risk measures and show that this property holds under certain restrictions upon the discounted risks. But there are also significant voices/opinions that argue that the axiom of subadditivity should be replaced with the less restrictive one of convexity, since the cases when merging leads to a riskier situation are not rare, see for example Dhaene, Laeven, Vanduffel, Darkiewicz, and Goovaerts (2008). An obvious example of such a situation is the case when portfolios merge/split; usually this leads to a change in the management-related costs and maybe even more, the entire business strategy might change. Consequently, the decision of merging/splitting could entail a whole new cost structure that changes the losses under consideration and makes the relationship between

Next, we study the effect of adopting Kahnemann and Tversky’s point of view according to which people’s behavior is captured by an S-shaped value function which is concave for gains (implying risk aversion), convex for losses (risk seeking) and steeper for losses than for gains (loss aversion), Kahneman and Tversky (1979), Tversky and Kahneman (1992). We focus on establishing if Theorem 3 remains true in the case of an investor characterized by a S-shaped disutility function. The first part of the theorem relies on Proposition 2.1 of Shapiro and Wardi (1994) applied to the convex function

                        . Properties 1–4 from Theorem 3 are direct consequences of the application of the first order necessary condition to the minimization problem in (12) combined with the convexity and continuously differentiability of 
                           
                              F

                         with respect to y. The lack of convexity of D does not interfere with the proof, therefore properties 1–4 remain true.

The importance of Theorem 3 is due to (14) which allows the replacement of the stochastic problem on the left hand with the more tractable one from the right hand. Both problems are convex and, consequently, they benefit from a plethora of specialized algorithms for stochastic convex optimization. If the decision maker’s attitude towards risk is described through prospect theory, then because of the S-shape of D, the convexity of 
                           
                              F
                              
                                 α

                         with respect to (
                           x
                        , y) is lost, but the equivalence between the two optimization models in (14) is still valid. When compared to the model on the left hand of (14), the one on the right hand, even if it is non-convex, shows the great advantage of having 
                           x
                         and y independent variables. This allows us to minimize over 
                           
                              y

                           x
                         (which is a stochastic convex optimization problem for any fixed 
                           x
                        , regardless the lack of convexity of D) and then minimize over

                     where μ represents the desired level of expected wealth and ν, the acceptable level of risk. Varying the trade-off coefficient w in (18
), μ in (P1), ν in (P2) and repeatedly solving the corresponding optimization problems traces out the efficient frontier as the next theorem shows.

                        Theorem 4
                        
                           Models (18), (P1), (P2) generate the same efficient frontier.
                        

The proof follows the general lines of similar proofs that can be found in classical textbooks concerning multiobjective optimization. The equivalence between the three problems is proven for the Mean-Variance efficient frontier in Steinbach (2001), for the Mean-Regret efficient frontier in Dembo and Rosen (1999) and for the Reward-CVaR efficient frontier in Krokhmal et al. (2002).

The computational study is meant to establish how different are the Mean -DCVaR (MD) efficient portfolios compared to the classical Mean-Variance (MV) and Mean-CVaR (MC) efficient portfolios. For the calculation of DCVaR, we use two classes of disutility functions, with various degrees of loss aversion. We also study the influence of box constraints imposing different degrees of diversification.

The practical performances of the Mean-DCVaR model are measured using real world data considering closing price data of 20 representative securities from the New York Stock Exchange. The list of stocks full names together with descriptive statistics (calculated with logarithmic weekly returns) showing the departure from normality are presented in Tables A1 and A2 from Supplementary Material (SM). The weekly returns were calculated from the daily stocks adjusted closing prices which were downloaded from Yahoo! Finance and checked against errors (missing data, calculation errors, outliers). To estimate the future values of returns, we use the Filtered Historical Simulation method to bootstrap i.i.d. standardized residuals, filtered from residuals of an econometric model, to generate paths of future asset returns. This way, the nonparametric assumption regarding the probability distribution of returns is retained. What makes this method attractive is the possibility of using complex models: for each of the 20 assets, we use a combination of ARMA(1,1) for the conditional mean and GARCH(1,1) for the conditional variance, (Bollerslev, 1986) and (Bollerslev, Engle, & Nelson, 1994).

The available data series of any of the 20 securities is of length

The estimation set is used to extract the filtered model residuals (filtered because, from all residuals, you can retain those having the characteristics relevant for the model - in our simulation we used all the residuals calculated in the estimation period).

                         weeks that allows a variable time horizon (≤ 12 weeks), a variable number of assets,... By developing independently the modules of forecast and optimization, we achieve an increased flexibility and we reduce the resource requirements.

                         and L is the number of periods being forecasted, see Greene (2012). Each performance indicator measures different characteristics of the forecast error: CE measures the total error, MFE measures the average error or bias, MAD measures the absolute size of errors and RMSE is essentially the sample standard deviation of errors. The smaller the MAD or RMSE values, the more accurate the forecasting model.


                        Results and discussions. The values of model parameters were calculated for all 20 stocks, at all t from the out-of-sample period. The forecasts, the forecast errors and CE, MFE, MAD and RMSE for all t from the out-of-sample period with updated “running” values of forecast error were computed. To illustrate our findings, we use AIG (chosen randomly from our list from Table A1 from SM) for which we present the evolution of all four accuracy measures for 1-step to 5-step-ahead forecast in Fig. 1
                         (considering the origin of time at the beginning of the out-of-sample period). Tracking MFE for 1-step to 5-step-ahead forecast shows that there is a small bias of the forecast at the end of the out-of-sample period. We also notice the typical evolution in time of the bias: it decreases with the increase of time in the out-of-sample period. In Fig. 1 we see also that the bias is small: the largest value is smaller than 0.006 (this value corresponds to the 3-step-ahead MFE).

From Fig. 1 we see that the value of MAD is around 0.06 for all steps ahead considered. The value of this performance measure should be considered relative to the values of data, which is 4–5 times higher than MAD. The RMSE is larger than MAD because it is more sensitive to larger values, as it can be seen in Fig. 1; RMSE values are in the interval [0.08; 0.10]. These conclusions are drawn from inspection of only one path. In order to have a better description of the forecast performances, we simulated 1000 alternative paths of evolution of AIG returns. Table 1
                         presents the statistical descriptors of this sample population of 1000 values for the 1-step-ahead forecast. We see that the average values of the two important performance measures, MFE and RMSE are smaller than the values estimated on the path described above: they are actually 0.0049, respectively 0.0488. So, under the usual assumption that the forecast errors follow a normal distribution, for the 1 step ahead forecast, we find, instead of a mean of zero, a MFE mean value of 0.0049 and RMSE mean value of 0.0488. These values are a good starting point for the analysis of the efficient frontiers and in accordance with the values reported in the literature, see for example the values of accuracy measures reported for daily returns in Hansen and Lunde (2005).


                        Implementation. We work with a holding period of four weeks. Every four weeks of the out-of-sample period, a 4-weeks-ahead forecast is calculated, and 10000 alternative paths of future evolution are generated using Monte Carlo simulation.

                              =
                              10000
                           
                         scenarios were used to compute the empirical cdfs of portfolio returns and to determine the MV, MC and MD efficient frontiers. The models were implemented in MATLAB. We have used the existing Object Oriented Classes for MV and MC models. The MD model was implemented in a new class, inherited from CVaR class. Specific routines have been added and old ones were modified so that compatibility with the rest of the method to be preserved.

Constructing the MV efficient frontierrelies on estimating the covariance matrix of stock returns. It is well known that using the standard statistical method consisting of gathering a history of past stock returns followed by computation of their sample covariance matrix leads to instability and unrealistic parameters (extreme values), see Jagannathan and Ma (2003); Jobson and Korkie (1980); Ledoit and Wolf (2004); Michaud (1989) just to name a few. Jagannathan and Ma (2003) show that, by imposing a short sale constraint on the MV portfolio, a form of shrinkage of the elements of the covariance matrix is implicitly applied by the MV optimizers which is also beneficial for improving weights stability, see also DeMiguel, Garlappi, and R. (2009). In this paper, in order to improve the robustness of the MV optimization, we have applied the shrinkage method of Ledoit and Wolf (2004): thus, the estimated coefficients in the sample covariance matrix that are extremely high (and usually contain a high positive error) are brought more closer to central values.


                        Utility functions used in the computational study. Two types of preferences represented by two classes of utility functions with loss aversion are studied.

The first class is defined by (2), see Cremers et al. (2005). We work with nine such utility functions exhibiting different levels of loss aversion according to parameters values:

                           Box constraints. In our study, we consider several types of box constraints (26). They are frequently imposed by practitioners for different reasons such as to rule out the possibility of short sales and/or to increase the diversification. Firstly, we solve the three models by imposing the usual portfolio weight constraints xk

The second set of data was used to test the extent to which the MD efficient portfolios are similar to MC and MV efficient portfolios. This is a work in progress but, up to now the results are promising, the solutions are stable and according to the theoretical expectations. When working with empirical data, solutions are different and in order to assess the similarity between the efficient frontiers, the method of Portfolio Indices defined in Phillips (1993) must be extended to negative weights.

                            because the loss averse investor (whose critical return level becomes higher) will aim higher returns. In Table 3
                            we give E(R)max  values for all box constraints; we note that by imposing an increasingly tighter constraint, the feasible region is getting smaller and consequently E(R)max  decreases.

A typical example of efficient frontiers of all three models is presented in Tables A3, A4 and A5 in SM. In these tables, the columns represent the compositions of efficient portfolios and the rows represent the assets. We remark that MD efficient portfolios exhibit a higher diversification compared to the other two models. We mention that DCVaR

In order to understand the behavior of the similarity indices with respect to λ, θ and the box constraint, we need to follow the way CVaR and DCVaR are related. Let us consider that the optimization solver is at iteration k, the portfolio is

                              . To calculate DCVaR, the disutility of loss is calculated for every loss sample at the current iteration k, a total of NS
                               disutility samples. Since D is a monotone function, the disutility sample values are also in ascending order. The DCVaR value at the kth iteration is calculated as the average of the disutility samples larger than DVaR (see Proposition 1) originating from the loss samples larger than VaR. Let us assume that at the current iteration k, VaR is greater than 
                                 
                                    −

                               In this case DCVaR is calculated using the linear part of the disutility function D because all losses are larger than VaR which is larger than 
                                 
                                    −

                              . At the next iteration, the algorithm will pick a portfolio

                                       k
                                       +

                               which makes VaR smaller than 
                                 
                                    −
                                    θ

                               In this case, there are a number of samples that are smaller than 
                                 
                                    −
                                    θ
                                 
                               but larger than VaR for which the corresponding disutility values are calculated with the logarithmic part of D. This leads to lower values for the disutility samples than those calculated at the previous iteration. So, the DCVaR at the 
                                 
                                    (
                                    k
                                    +
                                    1
                                    )
                                 
                              th iteration has a lower value than the DCVaR calculated at the kth iteration. The solver selects portfolios that increase the contribution of these losses in order to find the smallest positive value for DCVaR, compatible with the scenarios. From here, it follows that increasing the critical loss threshold 
                                 
                                    −

                               (i.e. decreasing critical return threshold θ) at a fixed λ will lead to a decrease in DCVaR, verified experimentally in Table 5. Analogously, the same table shows that increasing λ at a fixed θ leads to an increased DCVaR.

In our analysis we consider the pairs formed with the MD efficient frontier and MV or MC: (MD/MV) and (MD/MC) . To establish whether solving two models produces similar portfolios, we have to answer to two questions: (i) to what extent the optimal portfolios corresponding to the two models to be compared have the same assets in their compositions? and (ii) to what extent the common assets have similar weights?

The analysis relies on the interpretation of three Portfolio Indices defined in Phillips (1993). Firstly, we determine the Average Number of assets (AN)for each efficient frontier, AN(MV), AN(MC), AN(MD). Next, we determine the Average Number of Common Assets (ANCA)in the respective pair as follows: for each pair of efficient portfolios we determine the number of assets with nonzero weights in both portfolios, and then take the average over all pairs considered.

For any pair of efficient frontiers, the Portfolio Indices are the following.

                                 
                                    •
                                    The Portfolio Overlap Index (POI) represents the average percentage of common assets and it is defined as the ratio of the number of assets that overlap between the two models to the average number of assets in the union between the two models.

The Portfolio Weight Index (PWI) is calculated as follows. For each pair of efficient portfolios we compare the weights of overlapping assets and take the minimum. The sum of all these minimum values represents the total minimum weight of this pair of efficient portfolios. The average value over all pairs of portfolios is PWI.

The Portfolio Similarity Index (PSI) is calculated as the product of the respective POI and PWI. This index gives the proportion (percentage) of common assets having similar weights in the efficient frontiers.

We quantify the similarity between two efficient frontiers by the values of the Portfolio Indices POI, PWI, and PSI. and show that the similarity between two models depends on utility function parameters, and on the particular system of box constraints (26) chosen when constructing the efficient frontier. To characterize numerically the difference between the MD efficient frontier and MV or MC, one can construct the images of these latter efficient frontiers into MD space, see for example (Gaivoronski & Pflug, 2005). The comparisons involve the coordinates of two points belonging to two different efficient frontiers, one from MD and the other from the image of MV (or MC); it is expected that each comparison to be made at the same level of expected return (or risk). We mention that the model in whose space were built the images of the other two models is clearly favored. Therefore, we compare directly the compositions of the portfolios, not their mean-risk coordinates. We keep the differences between the levels of expected return of portfolios compared in a range as small as possible as the following procedure shows. For example, for the MD/MV pair, the efficient portfolio

                              values. Firstly, in Table 4 we notice that,. for all box constraints and all θ values, we have PSI(MD/MC) > PSI(MD/MV). In fact, we can say that in all cases PSI(MD/MC) is roughly two times larger than PSI(MD/MV), or at least 1.5 times. This is because both POI and PWI values are with roughly 50 percent higher for MD/MC than for MD/MV, denoting more assets in common and common assets weights having closer values for MD/MC. Therefore, if we consider working with any of the alternatives MV or MC instead of MD, MC is a much better approximation of MD than MV, as expected.

                              values. The previous considerations in 4.2.2.1 help us to better understand the variation of POI values with the variation of θ and λ. When θ increases at a fixed λ value, the “disutility gains” (disutility samples smaller than 
                                 
                                    −

                              ) are reduced and DCVaR increases. But the solver acts in the sense of decreasing DCVaR by increasing the weights of assets contributing with disutility gains until they reach the upper limit of the box constraint. Once the upper limit has been reached, a non-common asset is selected to enter in the portfolio composition and, possibly, a common asset might be dropped. Consequently, the POI either remains the same or decreases as can be seen in Table 4.

Also the dependence of POI on the upper bound of the box constraint and on the θ value (at a fixed λ value) are obvious in Table 4. For

                               (which means a switch to a “worse critical threshold” because even a range of positive returns are now subjectively perceived as losses) is clearly delimitated: we see a drop of 12.42 percent: from the POI(MD/MV) value of 53.38 percent (to 46.74 percent). Analogously, POI(MD/MC) falls 9.31 percent from its value: from 70.57 percent it decreases to 64.00 percent. When we lower the upper bound of the box constraints to 0.30 and 0.25, the drop in POI is much smaller, of only 2.5 percent, because POI has a larger value than for higher values of upper bounds and the percentage decrease of dropping one common asset from the set of overlapping assets in POI has a smaller impact.

                              values. For any fixed θ, imposing tighter constraints increases PWI. The main reason is that imposing lower upper bounds increases diversification in all models. Consequently, two frontiers will have more common assets, therefore a larger number of minimum weights to be added up for obtaining an increased PWI, as seen in Table 4. Moreover, for any given box constraint, PWI decreases with the increase in θ. Indeed, as seen before, an increase in θ leads to a decrease in the number of common assets which leads to a decrease in the minimum weights of the common assets. We notice that the average percentage of overlapping assets POI between the two models MD and MC has a value of 65–70 percent. The remaining 30–35 percent is due to the higher diversification of the MD model. But, as shown in the last but one column of the Table 4, the PWIvalues are around 92–94 percent which means that the 65–70 percent common assets of MD and MC models have highly similar weights.

                               reports the POI, PWI and PSI for the pairs of efficient frontiers MD/MV in the group of columns formed by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th columns, and MD/MC in the last three columns. We note that the POI values are smaller than for the utility class defined in (22), PWI are in the same range and consequently PSI are smaller.


                              Comparisons of two

                              efficient frontiers with respect to two different utility functions. Our study is for the two classes of utility functions defined in (22) and (23). We purposely chose the utility class (23) that is resembling with (22) for the parameter values considered: we wanted to measure small differences and to relate them with the changes in DCVaRs. Both classes of utility functions operate in the same manner: the gains are shrunk and the losses are amplified. The monotonicity preserves the order of the loss samples in the disutility space.

We use a reference efficient frontier that corresponds to (22) with parameters 
                                 
                                    λ

                                    ,
                                 
                               and box constraints [0; 1]. The first three columns of the Table 7
                               gives the characteristics of the MD model to be compared to the reference model. The first seven rows presents comparison within the same class of utility functions (22), whilst the following eight rows refer to (23). We have used the following algorithm: the reference model has the smallest values for the parameters (the smallest in our computational study) and the model to be compared with has the highest values. The first three rows in Table 7 have one parameter changed compared to the reference, the following three rows have two parameters changed, and the seventh row has all three parameters changed. This way we have a representation of the changes in the similarity indices in relation with changes in parameter values. The same notations and rules apply for the following rows, but with (23) utility functions.

Regarding the comparisons between classes of utility functions presented in the first seven rows of Table 7: for the most restrictive box constraint [0; 0.25] the POI value is limited at 96 percent for all λ and θ considered. This shows a high and similar diversification, with a corresponding PSI values of 88–90 percent. Thus, we can estimate that changing the box constraint from [0; 1] in the reference model to [0; 0.25] induces a change in PSI of about 10 percent and the the influence of the other parameters is of only 1–2 percent. For the box constraint [0; 1] the variation of λ from 2 to 10 induces a substantial drop in PSI, of almost 13 percent. Regarding the variation of the PSI with θ, we can estimate that it is small, less than 5 percent.

The comparisons of (23) with the reference show that for a fixed γ and box constraint [0; 1], PSI shows small changes ≃ 1 percent (from 85.40 percent to 86.70 percent, respectively from 91.08 percent to 91.13 percent). The variation of PSI with γ is about 5 percent, for example for θ and [0; 1], from 5.40 percent to 91.08 percent. For the box constraint [0; 0.25], the PSI variation with respect to γ is of 1–2 percent.

                               - the results correspond to the utility function (22) with

                               and box constraints [0; 1]. In the second column, this table shows an average difference between two efficient portfolios of the pair MD/MC, respectively MD/MV and the third column gives the standard deviation. The data in Table 8 confirm the conclusions aleady drawn: the absolute errors are higher for MD/MV than for MD/MC, but we notice that the total error for MD/MC is significant, it is 9–10 percent. We remind that here the units represent percentages from the total wealth.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper proposed the risk measure called DCVaR defined using the modified loss distribution according to the decision maker’s risk and loss aversion preferences and established its properties. We developed a bi-objective portfolio optimization model in the Mean-Risk framework using the DCVaR risk measure and gave equivalent representations of the MD efficient frontier We investigated the practical performances of the proposed model using real data from New York Stock Exchange by comparing it with the classical MV and MC models. Firstly, we established how different are the efficient portfolios produced by the three models by quantifying the differences/similarities between the efficient frontiers for the class of disutility functions defined with various degrees of loss aversion. Our analysis based on three types of similarity indices showed significant differences between MD and any of MV or MC efficient frontiers, the degree of similarity being relatively low. Extensive experiments showed that the MD efficient portfolios exhibit lower risk levels at the same return levels compared to the other two Mean-Risk models. Working with the disutility of the loss and thus with a distribution modified by the loss-averse investor’s perception makes DCVaR an interesting risk measure because apart suitability, also better performances are obtained.
