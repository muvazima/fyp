                  In this study, we aimed to seek for different ways of measuring cardiac stress in terms of heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR) dynamics, and to develop a novel index that can effectively summarize the information reflected by these measures to continuously and quantitatively characterize the cardiac stress status during physical exercise. Standard deviation, spectral measure of HRV as well as a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) based fractal-like behavior measure of HR dynamics were all evaluated on the RR time series derived from windowed electrocardiogram (ECG) data for the subjects undergoing cycling exercise. We recruited eleven young healthy subjects in our tests. Each subject was asked to maintain a fixed speed under a constant load during the pedaling test. We obtained the running estimates of the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN), the high-fidelity power spectral density (PSD) of HRV, and the DFA scaling exponent α, respectively. A trend analysis and a multivariate linear regression analysis of these measures were then performed. Numerical experimental results produced by our analyses showed that a decrease in both SDNN and α was seen during the cycling exercise, while there was no significant correlation between the standard lower frequency to higher frequency (LF-to-HF) spectral power ratio of HRV and the exercise intensity. In addition, while the SDNN and α were both negatively correlated with the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale value, it seemed that the LF-to-HF power ratio might not have substantial impact on the Borg value, suggesting that the SDNN and α may be further used as features to detect the cardiac stress status during the physical exercise. We further approached this detection problem by applying a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to both feature candidates for the task of cardiac stress stratification. As a result, a time-varying parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress measure (CSM), is developed for quantitatively on-line measuring and stratifying cardiac stress status.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is worth noting that we have developed a cycling based ergometer system for real-time fatigue monitoring and analysis [1]. Although using such a system to perform on-line fatigue progression analysis is of importance to many aspects of applications and has been considered unprecedented, people may feel even more interested in exploring the effects of physical exercise training on the progression of cardiac stress status based on the same ergometer we developed, in such a way that this can be used in sports medicine, and may also be of interest to the cardiologists who carry out stress tests for monitoring the heart condition in patients with heart diseases.

In general, heart rate (HR) usually increases when one is undergoing physical exercise. In this aspect, the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale may provide a useful way to reflect how hard one feels about the work while undergoing physical exercise [2]. With ranging from 6 to 20, the Borg RPE scale has been commonly used as a typical and convenient index for monitoring subjective perceived exercise intensity. In fact, the idea of a relationship between HR and exercise in terms of RPE is not original. For example, a previous study in literature reported that the increase in RPE was related to both the cardiovascular status monitored by heart rate (HR), and the local muscle factors monitored by the median frequency of electromyogram (EMG) during fatigue induced by stepping exercise [3]. Another work in literature also indicated that there might exist a linear relationship between RPE and HR during progressively increasing workloads and submaximal constant load, obtaining correlations ranging from 0.71 to 0.91 [4]. Moreover, Borg also suggested that a high correlation exists between ten times of a person׳s RPE value and his actual HR during physical activity and this may provide as a good estimate of actual HR during exercise. However, Chang et al. argued that the estimation of HR (i.e., HR=10×RPE) might be invalid for exercise at constant workload when exhaustion occurred and suggested that weighting of other factors, such as the factors that influence HR dynamics, should be considered [3].

According to the review of previous works as presented as above, we may see that although the RPE scale has been commonly used for exercise study, exercise itself is a more complex activity which involves cardiovascular factors and hence may not be solely related to a subjective RPE value. Therefore, developing a novel index other than RPE and seeking for its applicability for objectively and quantitatively assessing cardiac stress status during physical exercise are essentially needed. With this in mind, the scientific question of this work is “how can we find an effective way to objectively and quantitatively measure the cardiac stress during the physical exercise?” Seeking for the answers to such a question actually motivated this work. Since greater RPE values resulting from exercise should be related to incremented sympathetic tone and reduced parasympathetic tone, it is nature to speculate that heart rate variability (HRV), rather HR, may provide a more effective and reliable way for figuring out the relationship between cardiac stress and physical exercise. In this aspect, some previous researches in literature, for instance, have also reported that HRV may and does show influence of mental and physical stress [5,6].

However, since variation in HR could be also attributed to a variety of factors, different aspects of HRV analysis may be needed for measuring cardiac stress. Among HRV applications, there are a number of measures derived from the beat-to-beat fluctuations having been widely used as indices of cardiac autonomic control [7–9]. These measures were simply developed using the time- and/or frequency-domain analyses, such as the calculation of the standard deviation and the power spectral density (PSD) of the HR fluctuations. In the time-domain analysis, it has been widely accepted that the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) or its related quantities may serve as diagnostically useful HRV indices. As for the frequency-domain analysis, the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) is usually applied for PSD calculation. It should be noted that since a uniformly resampling process on the original RR data is required for FFT-based PSD calculation, a low-pass filtering effect due to resampling might undesirably cause a distortion on the PSD of HRV [10]. In order to avoid such a problem, instead of using FFT a compressed sensing (CS) based algorithm for spectral estimation of HRV incorporating the integral pulse frequency modulation (IPFM) model has been developed in previous works [11,12]. Knowing as a novel sensing/sampling paradigm, the theory of CS asserts certain signals that are considered sparse or compressible can be possibly reconstructed from substantially fewer measurements than those required by traditional methods. Using the IPFM model, an ℓ
                     1-minimization based CS framework was developed for deriving the amplitude spectrum of the modulating signal for HRV assessments in our previous works [11,12]. Since the CS method actually can provide more accurate, robust and high-fidelity spectral estimates of HRV than the conventional approaches, such as the Lomb or FFT methods, in this study we thus used it to estimate the PSD of HRV directly from unevenly sampled RR data.

In addition, HR dynamics were also studied with a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) based fractal measure. In this aspect, some researchers employed the fractal measures to quantitatively characterize the HR dynamics, and concluded that these measures might be well suited for non-stationary situations, such as incremental exercise, as mentioned previously [13,14]. Moreover, it has been also demonstrated that fractal-like characteristics of HR can be considered as an indication of a normal and healthy heart since fractal measure of HR has manifested itself to change towards uncorrelated randomness for those who were suffering from different heart diseases or in the aging population [14–16]. Therefore, we may speculate that using the fractal scaling exponent, it may be possible to seek a way to effectively quantify the cardiac stress status during exercise.

In this study, we started from examining the effects of physical exercise on HR dynamics and then made a possible link between cardiac stress status and a variety of HRV measures. Time-, frequency-domain measures of HRV and DFA based fractal measure of HR dynamics, as stated above, were all considered as candidates in our investigations. In short, our study aimed to seek for different ways of measuring cardiac stress in terms of HR dynamics first and then to devise a novel index, called the cardiac stress measure (CSM), which can effectively summarize the information reflected by these measures to continuously and quantitatively characterize the cardiac stress status during physical exercise. With CSM, both the cardiac stress status and onset of cardiac stress “overload” can be detected, and thus, designing feasible training programs for patients with heart diseases would become more efficient and easier. Furthermore, since an exercise bicycle can provide a convenient, safe, and effective cardiovascular exercise the patients may need, our CSM index can be incorporated into an exercise bicycle-based ergometer system so the system may have possible applications in many areas. For example, such a system can be used in sports medicine, or applied to stress tests conducted by the cardiologists for monitoring the heart condition in patients with heart diseases, which is considered novel and unprecedented, thus representing a significant benefit and value from our study.

In this research, a stationary bicycle based ergometer system equipped with peripheral components (including an optical encoder and a resistor-based load control device), a set of wireless ECG sensors with the sensor interfacing system, and a personal computer (PC) based control and computational unit was used. Eleven young healthy adults were recruited for undergoing the bipedal cycling test. All the participants were free of heart diseases. The procedures of the experiment and the characteristics of the bicycle ergometer system were clearly explained to them before proceeding. At the beginning, each subject was asked to do one-minute low intensity cycling exercise to warm up body to prevent sports injuries. Then, the experiment started and each subject was asked to sit in an upright position and perform cycling exercise at a constant load and maintain a constant cycling speed of 60 RPM, as best as he could, throughout the entire course of experiment.

When cycling started, the wearable sensors synchronously collected and digitized the ECG data from the subjects and then wirelessly transmitted the digital data into the system PC for the subsequent numerical experimental analysis. In addition, with ranging from 6 to 20, the Borg scale value was also synchronously recorded and updated every minute during the test. For each subject, the experiment was terminated immediately once the Borg scale value reached the maximal value of 20.

A time-domain index of HRV measured by analyzing the standard deviation of the normal to normal RR intervals (SDNN) was employed in our study. In general, the SDNN is known as a very simple and basic HRV index which is easy to measure, given the data are of good quality. As for the frequency-domain HRV analysis, first it should be noted that since the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based PSD computation involves a resampling process on the RR data, this would unavoidably cause an undesired low-pass filtering effect on the PSD [10]. Therefore, the spectral estimation method that is capable of accurately and robustly estimating HRV spectra directly from unevenly sampled RR data is thus desired. Since it has been widely accepted that major characteristics of a standard HRV spectrum are determined by the amplitudes of three main lobes only (two are located at the frequency <0.15Hz; while one is at that >0.15Hz) and the side lobes can be ignored, we hypothesized that the HRV spectrum may be viewed as a compressible signal in our previous studies [11,12]. As described in detail previously, the integral pulse frequency modulation (IPFM) model provides a functional description of the mechanism by which the ANS modulates HR. According to the model, we have

By taking the advantage of the sparsity of the HRV spectrum, we have shown that the spectrum of HRV can be solved in the underdetermined case using the ℓ
                        1-minimization under the CS framework in our previous works [11,12]. Such an improved signal estimation method can robustly provide high-fidelity HRV spectral estimates directly from unevenly sampled RR data, even under the situation of a degree of incompleteness in the RR data caused by ectopic or missing beats.

In general, it has been commonly accepted that while the higher frequency (HF) band of the HRV spectrum, ranging from 0.15Hz to 0.4Hz, is used to reflect the vagal activity, the lower frequency (LF), ranging from 0.04Hz to 0.15Hz, is attributed to the modulation of both the sympathetic and vagal activities [8,9]. In our study, we evaluated the relative spectral power ratio, denoted as LHR (i.e., LF/HF ratio), and used it as a feature for stratifying the cardiac stress status in a variety of cycling exercise stages.

In this study, a fractal scaling analysis, referred to as the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), was also used to characterize HR dynamics. First proposed by Peng et al. [13], DFA is an algorithm that has proven useful in measuring the long-term autocorrelation of non-stationary time series. It can quantitatively characterize the complexity of time series using the fractal theory [13,17]. In fact, some previous research in literature indicated that the DFA scaling exponent, denoted as α, can be used for classifying biomedical signals into the healthy and unhealthy classes [18].

In general, DFA analyzes the mean square deviation of a signal from its local trend line on a variety of scales. First, given a time series of interest x(i) with signal length N (here, x(i) is the RR interval time series), an integrated signal y(k) is defined as

In order to characterize the relationship between F(n) and the time scale n (i.e., segmental length), the calculation in (10) is repeated until all possible values of n are applied. In general, a linear relationship is seen on a log–log plot and the fluctuations can be then characterized by the slope of the line relating log F(n) to log n.

In addition, to validate the use of the DFA exponent α as a fractal scaling exponent, here a robustness test was further performed as follows. First, we took an RR interval time series obtained from a subject during the exercise tests and randomly shuffled the RR data for 100 times, thus obtaining 100 realizations of the shuffled time series. Then, the DFA scaling exponent was evaluated for each of these 100 shuffled time series. 
                        Fig. 1 provides a profile of the robustness test as described above, including the original RR data (as depicted in Fig. 1a), an example realization of the shuffled time series (as depicted in Fig. 1b), and the logarithmic graph of log F(n) vs. log n for the realization (as depicted in Fig. 1c). In this case, the DFA scaling exponent α is 0.5004. Furthermore, the average of all the scaling exponent α values derived from the 100 realizations of shuffled time series was 0.5088, which was also perfectly close to 0.5.

In fact, according to [13], the scaling exponent α represents the correlation properties of the signal, and α≈0.5 indicated uncorrelated signal (white noise). It is revealed from our numerical experimental results that α≈0.5 was actually seen in the randomly shuffled time series, thus indicating that the DFA-based fractal scaling exponent should be able to robustly describe the correlation properties of the HR signals.

As mentioned previously, we collected the raw ECG data from eleven subjects during the cycling tests and evaluated the overall performance of all the feature candidates on the task of cardiac stress assessment. Surface ECG signals measured from subjects were digitized and acquired by the system via a wirelessly telemetric procedure. The sampling rate was set to 200Hz and the raw ECG was preprocessed by bandpass filtering. After detecting the time locations of the R waves for an ECG signal using a template-match technique that involves a correlation coefficient based similarity calculation, we may obtain the interbeat interval (i.e., the RR interval) data sequence corresponding to that ECG. Note further that in our study we actually performed a short-time analysis on all the measures in order to keep tracking and updating the HR dynamics during the tests. The SDNN, CS-based PSD of HRV, and DFA scaling exponent α were all evaluated on a 1-minute windowed RR segment. We then obtained the running estimates of SDNN, PSD, and α by shifting the one-minute window, without overlapping, throughout the entire RR time series, and hence all these three measures can be synchronously updated every minute during the tests.

Since each time the HR dynamics were monitored on a 1-minute RR time series data, there were definitely more than one α values obtained for describing the HR dynamics of correlations during the tests. Each α value was calculated within the 1-minute short RR time series by evaluating the slope of the line relating log F(n) to log n, where n ranging from 4 to 64 (4≤n≤64). 
                        Fig. 2 further provides a set of plots of log F(n) vs. log n for an example RR time series (obtained during physical exercise).

First, observing a logarithmic graph of log F(n) vs. log n derived from the entire RR time series as depicted in Fig. 2a, we may see there seems some crossovers, but not apparent, exhibited in this plot. In fact, the appearance of crossovers in the logarithmic graph of log F(n) vs. log n in the DFA method has been noticed and reported in a number of previous researches in the literature [13,19–21]. For example, Chen et al. indicated that such crossovers could be due to the effect of signal nonstationarities [19]. In this aspect, instead of only calculating one α value for the entire several-minute RR time series, a short-time analysis on α should be needed to describe the dynamics of correlations in HR. As a result, evaluating α within the 1-minute short RR time series at the beginning, the middle, and the final stage of the exercise for this case, we obtained α values as 1.3716, 0.8721, and 0.6514, respectively, showing a decrease in the dynamics of correlations in terms of the DFA scaling exponent. Therefore, observations gathered from Fig. 2 actually provide evidence validating that the short-time analysis of the scaling exponent α should be able to describe and track the dynamics of correlations in HR during the tests.

Moreover, 
                        Fig. 3a, b, and c further provide a typical bandpass filtered ECG segment, an RR interval data segmental and its corresponding high-fidelity CS-based PSD estimate of HRV, respectively. Numerical analysis results and discussions presented in this section will be focused on the performance evaluation of all the three features.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Recall that in our study, a constant load was applied for all the eleven subjects. The cycling exercise test stopped at the time when the subject׳s Borg RPE scale value reached 20. First, it should be noted that since there was considerable between-subject variation in the cycling exercise time, in order to conveniently perform the task of the stochastic analysis the entire cycling process of each subject was evenly divided into five separate stages with an equal cycling period. 
                        Fig. 4a, b, and c depict the means and standard deviations of SDNN, LHR, and α, respectively, evaluated at the five stages of cycling exercise over all the eleven subjects. Statistical analysis results in terms of mean and standard deviation are also tabulated in 
                        Table 1. Moreover, a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) further revealed that both the SDNN and α measures produced a significant decrease in the course of the cycling exercise (F(4,40)=47.33, p<0.001, η
                        2=0.826 and F(4,40)=16.28, p<0.001, η
                        2=0.619, respectively), while the LHR measure did not show any significant tendency during the test (F(4,40)=1.76, p=0.155, η
                        2=0.150).

In general, the main purpose of the linear regression analysis is to use mathematical expressions to relate the Borg RPE scale to a number of independent variables and see how they are correlated one another. In order to make the comparison easy, here we standardized each independent variable simply by subtracting its mean value from each of its values and then dividing these new values (i.e., centered by mean) by the standard deviation of the variable itself. Therefore, the scenario of our numerical experiment here is we let the Borg RPE scale value be the dependent variable, and standardized SDNN, LHR and α and let them be the standardized independent variables. That is, we have

                        0 are called the standardized regression coefficients or standardized coefficients and each of these coefficients simply tells us how a 1 standard deviation change in one independent variable produces the change in the dependent variable.

For each subject, SDNN, LHR and α were all evaluated and updated every minute. Also, the Borg RPE scale value was synchronously recorded every minute during the cycling test. As a result, there were eleven regression lines obtained after applying (11) to the datasets produced by the eleven subjects, respectively, so eleven standardized coefficients for each independent variable were considered. Statistical analysis results in terms of mean and standard deviation for all the standardized regression coefficients are also tabulated in 
                        Table 2. It is indicated from Table 2 that the all the mean values of the coefficients except mean C
                        
                           LHR
                         were negative, indicating that the SDNN and α were negatively correlated with the Borg value. On the other hand, it should be also noted that since the mean C
                        
                           LHR
                         was only slightly greater than 0, it might not have substantial impact on the Borg value. Moreover, the averaged coefficient of determination R
                        2 (i.e., computed over all the eleven subjects) was 0.6883, indicating that about 69% of the variation in the Borg RPE scale can be explained by a joint analysis of SDNN, LHR and α in the linear model.

According to the performance evaluation results produced by the trend analysis and the multivariate regression analysis as presented above, we may see that only SDNN and DFA scaling exponent α seemed to be more correlative to the Borg scale value. In general, both measures substantially decreased during the cycling exercise test. In addition, the results of our DFA analysis actually agreed to those reported by a previous research in literature that also employed α to characterize heart rate dynamics on aerobic cycling exercise tests [14]. In fact, a decrease in α was seen during the cycling exercise in both our study and theirs. On the other hand, note that all the data processes as presented in previous subsections (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) were done after all the RR data were collected, i.e. not real-time. That is, the cardiac stress status still cannot be quantitatively assessed nor monitored in a real-time fashion. We may speculate that if using a marker to continuously quantify and track the cardiac stress status during exercise is realizable, then it would represent a significant benefit from this study.

As described previously, the Borg RPE scale value as well as the SDNN, LHR and α were all updated every minute during the cycling test. Since it is revealed from our analysis results that only SDNN and α seemed to be more significantly correlated with the incremental exercise, we here chose both measures as the feature candidates for cardiac stress stratification. In this aspect, it has been widely accepted that the concept of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applicable to the case of M features. It leads to two class clusters in the M-dimensional feature space with an (M-1)-dimensional classifier hyperplane so the optimal linear classification results may be then achieved. In our case, M=2 and we may simply let the two feature variables, denoted as F
                        1 and F
                        2, be α and SDNN, respectively. Therefore, both feature candidates can be combined in a linear form to perform the so called LDA. In general, the LDA applied to our study can be simply expressed by the following equation:

As for the task of classification, since pattern classification is alternatively known as hypothesis testing in statistics, we may consider or track the distribution of feature vectors derived from the ECG data collected throughout the entire exercise training session. Classification is also known the decision-making step in pattern recognition. An appropriate decision rule in the form of discriminant function used for the pattern classification can be then derived from the Borg-labeled training feature dataset. On the other hand, however, note that since the Borg scale is orally rated by the subject, it is subjective and could be misleading in many aspects. Therefore, instead of using a simple dichotomous decision rule, here a modified non-dichotomous decision rule used for detecting the occurrence of cardiac stress overload was devised and formulated as

                        1 and th
                        2 represent two thresholds, respectively. The linear one feature y, as indicated in (12), can be viewed as an alternative indicator used for representing the cardiac stress status. It is seen from (13) that there exists a so-called “gray region” or “region of uncertainty” (i.e., the region between th
                        1 and th
                        2) in the classifier.


                        
                        Fig. 5 provides a schematic diagram illustrating how the task of cardiac stress status stratification was performed. First, according to the Borg RPE scale subjects may rate their perception of the exertion 13 on Borg scale when they feel the exercise intensity is “somewhat hard,” and rate 15 on scale when feeling “hard” about the exercise intensity [2]. Getting this, we may hypothesize that cardiac stress overload would not occur when Borg scale is less than 13, while the cardiac endurance might start to decrease (or the cardiac stress overload likely occurred) when Borg scale is greater than 15. Therefore, using LDA th
                        1 can be then determined by the threshold that optimally separated the y values corresponding to Borg<13 from those corresponding to Borg≥13, respectively. Similarly, th
                        2 can be thus selected as the optimal threshold that separated the y values corresponding to Borg≤15 from those corresponding to Borg>15, respectively. As for the Borg scales ranging from 13 to 15, most of their corresponding y values should be attributed to the feature vectors that fell into the so-called gray region. As a result, the 2×1 linear mapping vector L and both the thresholds (th
                        1 and th
                        2) were all then obtained after training over the full set of the Borg-labeled training feature data. Numerical results of L, th
                        1 and th
                        2 produced by the training dataset of our study were all tabulated in 
                        Table 3.

In order to evaluate the actual performance of the classifier as indicated in Table 3, it is certainly necessary to test the algorithm further. The two-dimensional feature scatter plot, as depicted in 
                        Fig. 6, provides a real example to illustrate how the LDA-based classifier, as indicated in (13), performed for a subject during the cycling exercise. One may see from Fig. 6 that the two-dimensional feature vector derived from ECG data of that subject actually moved from the upper right region towards the lower left one as the Borg value increased during the exercise test, as expected, and such a feature vector displacement tracking would imply an incremental cardiac stress.

We further used y to define a time-varying parameter, dubbed the cardiac stress measure (CSM), for quantitatively, on-line measuring and stratifying cardiac stress status. It takes a few steps, as indicated below, to compute and update CSM iteratively. Here, CSM
                        (k) denotes the CSM estimate at the k
                        th iteration; A
                        (k) denotes the event count, and B
                        (k) denotes the cardiac stress overload count.
                           
                              
                                 Step 0 (initialization): Let CSM
                                 (0)=0, A
                                 (0)=0, B
                                 (0)=0, and k=0.

                                 Step 3: Terminate if the cycling exercise stops; otherwise, set k←k+1 and go to Step 1.

In general, CSM is defined as the occurrence rate of cardiac stress overload during the exercise test. We believe that it can serve as a time-domain parameter to quantitatively and continuously evaluate as well as stratify the cardiac stress status as time evolves. Moreover, it should be also noted that according to (15) once the feature vector fell into the gray region (i.e., th
                        2≤y≤th
                        1), the CSM estimator would stop updating the CSM value at that time instant, that is, at this point the CSM value would remain the same as the one evaluated at the last time instant.


                        
                        Fig. 7a shows the CSM tracings corresponding to the scatter plot as shown in Fig. 6. Another example of CSM plot is as depicted in Fig. 7b. Both CSM tracings were evaluated by successively and repeatedly executing the steps as indicated in (14) and (15). Observing both CSM plots, we may see there was an increase in cardiac stress during the exercise in both cases. Also, we may see from Fig. 7 that the CSM can provide the onset time estimate at which the cardiac endurance starts to decrease, in addition to quantitatively stratifying the cardiac stress status. That is, one may infer from Fig. 7a and b that the onsets of cardiac stress overload in both cases should be at 6.5min and 7.5min, respectively, after the cycling exercise started.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

As described previously, our numerical results as provided in Table 1 (or Fig. 4) indicated that while both the SDNN and the DFA scaling exponent α produced a decrease during the cycling exercise, the LF-to-HF power ratio did not show significant tendency throughout the entire training session. Since the SDNN is mathematically identical to the total spectral power of HRV, we may thus conclude that while the total spectral power of HRV decreased during the exercise, the standard LF-to-HF spectral power ratio (LHR) did not. Also, further observing the standardized regression coefficients as tabulated in Table 2, we may interpret the results by saying that while a decrease of 1 standard deviation in SDNN and in α would respectively result in an increase of 0.4841 and an increase of 1.5463 in Borg RPE scale, an increase of 1 standard deviation in LHR would result in, on average, an increase of only 0.0956 (⪡1) in Borg scale, which might be negligible.

Obviously, numerical experimental results produced by the multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that a greater Borg index value would be generally associated with a decrease in fractal scaling exponent α of HR dynamics. First, it should be noted that a greater Borg index value will be related to incremented cardiac stress due to physical exercise. Secondly, according to the robustness test as presented in Section 2.3, one may also see that a decrease in α might imply becoming uncorrelated randomness. Therefore, a link between both facts as stated above can provide a possible explanation for the negative correlation between the Borg index and fractal scaling exponent α. That is, HR dynamics might change towards uncorrelated randomness for those who were undergoing an increase in cardiac stress due to incremental exercise.

As for the lack of correlation between the Borg index and LHR, we may speculate that this could be partly due to that the meanings and ranges of both the LF and HF bands might change and become different from what has been typically reported when exercising at the different loads [22]. For example, it was indicated from [22] that the HF component was shifting to the higher frequencies at incremental exercise intensity because of increased respiratory activity due to exercise, and thus, the reliability of standard LF-to-HF power ratio as a marker of autonomic interaction during exercise may not be as good as that at rest. In addition, some researchers even suggested that simply attributing LF power to the sympathetic activity was misleading [23]. These could be possible reasons that there was a lack of correlation between the exercise intensity (in terms of Borg index) and LHR observed in the results of our study.

Moreover, it is revealed from the numerical results as shown in Table 2 that the mean intercept C
                        0=12.201 actually implied that the cardiac stress might generally not contribute to Borg scale increment until Borg≥13. That is, the cardiac stress overload should not likely occur when Borg<13. It is worth noting that such an inference also consistently validated our hypothesis made for determining the optimal value of th
                        1 used for the decision rule as indicated in (13). On the other hand, another interesting note is in our study we hypothesized that the cardiac stress would be considered as “overload” since Borg>15. We believe such a choice is appropriate since according to Borg RPE scale subjects may rate their perception of the exertion 15 on Borg scale when they feel the exercise intensity is “hard” and the effort level corresponding to this value is 80% effort [2]. For certain, by definition of Borg RPE scale, such exercise intensity could be thought of as being a possible threshold for substantially and effectively initiating the cardiac stress “overload.” Therefore, being subject to such a hypothesis, the optimal value of the other threshold th
                        2 involved with the CSM evaluation was thus obtained. According to (15), CSM would be increased every time when the linear one feature y value was less than th
                        2. Also, the onset time of cardiac stress overload occurrence can be then determined simply using the CSM curve. We may also consider it as the time at which the cardiac endurance starts to decrease.

Furthermore, CSM can be further incorporated into a cycling-based ergometer training system for quantitatively, synchronously measuring and stratifying the cardiac stress status for subjects undergoing physical exercise. In addition, CSM can be also employed as a profile for assessing and comparing the cardiac stress status before and after the cardiac strength and/or endurance training to see if there is any improvement due to the training program.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, investigations into the effects of physical exercise on HR dynamics were presented. Time-, frequency-domain measures of HRV and a nonlinear DFA based fractal measure of HR were all evaluated during cycling-based exercise training. As a result, numerical experimental results produced by our tests indicated that while the SDNN and α were both negatively correlated with the Borg RPE scale value, the LF-to-HF spectral power ratio of HRV did not show significant change as the exercise went on. In order to effectively, continuously assess and track the cardiac stress status, we further employed the SDNN and α as features to perform an on-line cardiac stress status monitoring and analysis. A new time-varying parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress measure (CSM), was then defined based on a linear combined feature that retains the information as summarized by both SDNN and α. In addition, the CSM can be further incorporated into a cycling-based ergometer system for quantitatively on-line measuring and stratifying the cardiac stress status for subjects undergoing cycling exercise so the system may be either used in sports medicine or applied to stress tests when monitoring the heart condition is needed. This would also represent a significant benefit and value from our study.
