                  This article investigates the role played by both production and market risks on cash crop farmers’ decision to adopt long rotations considered as innovative cropping systems. We build a multi-period recursive farm model with Discrete Stochastic Programming. The model arbitrates each year between conventional and innovative, longer rotations. Yearly farming operations are declined according to a decision tree, so that production risk is an intra-year risk. Market risk is considered as an inter-year risk influencing crop successions. Simulations are performed on a specialized French cash crop farm. They show that when the long rotation is subsidized by an area premium, farmers are encouraged to remain in longer rotations. They also show that a high level of risk aversion tends to slow down the conversion towards longer rotations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Farm level modeling represents a huge share of literature in agricultural economics. Bio-economic farm models have been mainly developed to analyze and assess policy changes or technological innovations for different categories of farms with the aim of supporting policy decisions (Janssen, Ittersum, & K., 2007; Viaggi, Raggi, & Gomez y Paloma, 2010). In mathematical programming farm level models, acreage decisions generally address two types of decisions: tactic and strategic (Dury, Schaller, Garcia, Reynaud, & Bergez, 2012). Acreage decisions refer to the amount of area occupied by each crop every year. The acreage decision is more or less governed by a crop rotation long-term strategy. A crop rotation strategy is a cyclic period of several years over which an order of planting decision is made for each. Strategic decisions are long term decisions (crop rotation, investment decisions) that can be modified all along the year by tactical decisions since farming is exposed to many uncertainties (weather, market). Thus, the acreage choice and the sequence of technical operations (like date of sown, number of treatments, number of mechanical operations), decided during the year might vary according to state variables (weather, market). These decisions are qualified as revisable in response to climatic or sanitary uncertainty (Lien & Hardaker, 2001; Pannell, Malcolm, & Kingwell, 2000) (Kobayashi, Howitt, Jarvis, & Laca, 2007; Mosnier, Agabriel, Lherm, & Reynaud, 2009).

When taking their production decisions, farmers are exposed to non-embedded risks, i.e. risks that are beyond control of the decision maker, and to embedded risks, i.e. risks that can be impacted by farmers’ decisions (Dorward, 1999; Hardaker, Pandey, & Patten, 1991). Under embedded risks, farmers adjust the timing and methods of their technical operations as the season progresses and, for instance, quantity and frequency of pesticide application can be revised. For instance, the number of pesticide operations can be revised according to the pest damage observed. These adjustments may change the yield risk exposure.

In this article, the adoption of a long rotation is studied as an alternative to the wheat-sunflower short rotation in a specialized dryland crop farm. French agronomic research teams, jointly with farm extension services and groups of farmers seek to build up and spread among specialized crop farmers new crop rotation system that is expected to help reduce pollution at farm level (to diminish water, nitrogen and pesticide use). In many areas, farmers feel ready to change their practices because they face more disease-resistant crops and decreasing soil fertility resulting from intensive use of chemical inputs. As a result, crop yields are reaching a ceiling. Innovative Cropping Systems (ICSs) consisting in long rotations (up to seven years) enable to introduce intermediary crops with low level of inputs (legumes or nitrogen-catching crops), while farming practices are slightly rearranged (replacing chemical treatments by mechanical operations or delaying the sowing date for instance)
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Different cropping systems of that sort have been built up inside two research and development projects in the Midi-Pyrénées region, south-western France. These ICSs are tested ‘in the field’ by volunteer farmers.
                     . As a result, the average input usage is decreased over the whole rotation planning horizon. The adoption of ICSs is perceived by farmers as risk increasing because the expected yield of the new practices is more uncertain than for conventional practices. Thus, farmers have not experienced these new practices in their own farm yet. The yield risk can be considered as an embedded risk that can be adapted through tactical decisions. Another type of risk farmers are facing is the grain market risk. At the yearly decision (static) scale, the grain market price instability is a non-embedded risk because the price distribution is given to farmers each year. But on a dynamic point of view and at a multi-year (dynamic) scale, market risk can be considered as an embedded risk. The rotation plan can be modified at the beginning of each year, according to farmer's price anticipation, modifying farmer's exposure to price risk. As a non-embedded static risk, price instability should favor crop diversification when crops’ distributions are not or little correlated. But as a dynamic embedded risk, price instability could discourage the adoption of long rotations in case of high market prices. It is probable that in case of price upward trend, the most lucrative crops (wheat, maize) are preferred to diversification crops that are less lucrative (rapeseed, pea), even if beneficial in the long run in agronomic terms.

The objective of this article is to build a dynamic model of crop rotation choice in order to test, under yield and market risk, farmer's decision to adopt long rotations. In Section 2 of the paper, a literature review on acreage decision models is proposed in order to explain the novelty of the proposed methodology. In Section 3, we expose the Dynamic Stochastic Programming (DSP) model. We detail the modeling assumptions on farmers’ beliefs and preferences. In Section 4, we explain how the farm data and the farmers’ behavioral parameters were obtained and tested in the model. These data come from three kinds of sources: (i) regional reference data on production costs, (ii) experts’ interviews to detail the intra-year farm operations and their possible revisions and (iii) field experiments to assess farmers’ perceptions and preferences

                        The detailed experimental protocol is not presented here as it is out of the scope of this paper that is focused on the presentation of a dynamic mathematical programming model.
                     . In Section 4, we present the results of several simulations performed with the DSP model, testing the adoption of ICSs under a set of incentives, and leading a sensitivity analysis of different parameters.

Many risk programming models have been developed in the agricultural economics literature; some are static, others are dynamic.

Static stochastic mathematical programming models of non-embedded risks incorporate risk in the objective function or in the constraints through a risky-term of variance or semi-variance of income, assuming a quadratic utility function and a normal distribution (see for instance El-Nazer & McCarl, 1986; Hazell, 1971; McCarl & Önal, 1989; Tauer, 1983). Other models of risk programming directly assume a utility function, as an objective function, that is the weighted sum of utilities obtained in different states of nature and label it as utility-efficient-programming (Flaten & Lien, 2007).

Dynamic stochastic mathematical programming models deal with embedded risks. They were initiated by (Cocks, 1968) and (Rae, 1971). They incorporate both risk anticipations and the adjustment behavior due to sequential decisions (Apland & Hauer, 1993). A stochastic sequential decision problem is symbolized by a decision tree, each node representing a decision, revisable or not. The number of branches represents the number of decision combinations and it can increase very quickly, making the model outputs difficult to interpret. The accounting of both embedded and non-embedded risks, and both dimensions of decision (strategic and tactic) seems relevant to address farmers' technical and rotational acreage decision over several years.

The issue of farm acreage decision under risk can be handled with static stochastic models when historical empirical data on risk distributions is accessible (Acs, Berentsen, Huirne, & Van Asseldonk, 2009; Chavas, Posner, & Hedtcke, 2009; Martins & Marques, 2007; Stanger, Lauer, & Chavas, 2008). But the farm rotation choice with the possibility of revising decisions under risks pleads for dynamic approaches. The dynamic modeling of farm rotation choices is still subject to intensive research,
El-Nazer and McCarl (1986) built a MOTAD model to account for the impact of the precedent crop without predetermined rotations. They use regression analysis on historical cropping records and incorporate these data in their model so that it determines freely the optimal long run rotation. While Hennessy (2006) is seeking if rotation choice has effective yield increasing and nitrogen saving effects and simulate price and subsidy levels that support alternation of soybeans on corns, Carpentier and Letort (2012) seek to theoretically and empirically assess the rotational benefit and thus optimize the rotation choice of rapeseed on wheat and barley. Doole and Pannell (2008) propose to test the value of incorporating pasture inside land-use rotations using an integrated bio-economic model. Abadi Ghadim, K., and Pannell (1999) propose a conceptual framework that enables the revision of decisions during the innovation process and that focusses on the role of information in such decisions using Bayesian learning rules.

In this article, we aim at conducting an ex-ante study of the adoption of long rotations that are seen as innovative. Under both production and market risks and with few historical data, we propose to build a Dynamic Stochastic Programming (DSP) model which maximizes the expected utility of actual income over the planning horizon of the crop rotation (Apland & Hauer, 1993; Rae, 1971; Trebeck & Hardaker, 1972). A multiperiod recursive model is built. It accounts for farmer's adjustment behavior when facing both production (intra-year) and market (inter-year) risks during the multiyear crop rotation. The novel aspect of the model developed in this paper doesn't lie in the computational technique employed (Dynamic Stochastic Programming) but in the type of application. The use of a recursive model enables us to take adjustment decisions into account when facing both price and production risk. To overcome the problem of large scale models that are often met when simulating many periods and many decision nodes in DSP, we decided to model a recursive sequence of multi-periodic optimization models.

The cropping system developed is a seven-year crop rotation. In the short rotation, wheat is alternating with sunflower, thus wheat is cropped four times on the same plot over seven years. In the long rotation, wheat is cropped only three times over seven years, with lower chemical inputs since two other precedents are used (sorghum and pea) that naturally bring mineral nitrogen and break pest biological cycle (see Table 1
                     
                     
                     ).

A multi-period model of inter-temporal choice is built up. The planning horizon is assumed to last three years, which is coherent with the formulation of farmer's anticipations. Each year (denoted t hence forth), land use decisions are revisable inside a set of possible rotations, considering (i) the preceding crop and its possible impact on crop yield and (ii) the crop price situation anticipated for the coming three years. Each year, the farmer accounts for both anticipations on yields and prices to take his crop acreage decision for the coming three year planning horizon, and each year his decisions are revisable: the model is recursive and thus dynamic.

The decision variable is the crop area sown in year t decided in year s: Xst
                        . A cropping system refers to the crops, the crop sequences and the management techniques used. The model aims at considering these dimensions, and we need to note two sorts of crops depending on innovative (i.e. crop belonging to a long rotation scheme with adapted farming operations) or conventional technologies (i.e. crop belonging to a two-year-rotation with classical farming operations). Ki
                         and Kc
                         are respectively the set of innovative crops and the set of conventional ones with 
                           
                              K
                              =
                              
                                 K
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 ∪
                                 
                                    K
                                    c
                                 
                              
                           
                        . For example, wheat grown using conventional practices has a set of properties (yield, cost, level of production risk) different from wheat grown under innovative practices. Especially, the level of expected yield is lower under innovative practices. This difference is due to both practices and the preceding crop. In order to represent this property in the decision-making problem, the decision variable in term of crop and preceding crop Xst
                        (k, k′) represents the area of crop k with previous crop k′ (k, k′ ∈ K). The known impacts of precedent k’ on crop k are reported in Table 2

                           This set has been identified based on scientific literature and opinions of experts (scientists, extension services). Rotations that are impossible in agronomical terms, such as sunflower after sunflower, are prohibited.

Each year the farmer revises his/her decisions when the economic or climatic context is changing. In fact, each year t the acreage decision is associated with a set of operations, occurring at different stages, some of them being subject to uncertain events (see Fig. 1: fertilization, fungicide for instance…). The crop chosen in year t is characterized by a technical pattern, i.e., a set of technical operations carried out at different stages of the year. Different outcomes are possible at each stage, depending on the frequency and intensity of pest treatments and nitrogen applications. It is possible to change the frequency and level of pest and nitrogen applications at the different stages, according to the climatic and sanitary situation because these technical operations take place according to a decision rule based on observations and agronomical criteria (climactic forecasts, plant health…). The sequence of intra-year technical operations is depicted, each year, through a probability tree. For each crop, farmers are asked to assign a probability to the different operations. Finally, each branch represents a set of technical operations and a probability is associated to this branch
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           This probability is the product of the probabilities of all operations.
                         (Fig. 1).

Among the set of possible crops some are ‘conventional’ (index c) and others belong to ‘innovative’ cropping systems (index i). As mentioned before, the crop succession is partially controlled in the model: a set of possible preceding crops K′ is associated to each crop K. The crop acreage observed a given year results from the rotation choice of the previous years. Thus, each crop is part of a rotation alternating different crops in previous years and since rotation choice is revisable, the crop acreage is varying from one year to the other. After more than 3 years, the crop acreage converges more or less quickly to a stable acreage. Therefore, in Section 5.2, we will expose the crop acreage after a few years. The convergence rate (number of years) is a result in itself as it depends on incentives, market context, risk aversion, etc.

Discrete Stochastic Programming allows choice of different technical and revisable options. A dynamic version of the model with a finite horizon is proposed. The planning horizon lasts three years, but, through recursive programming, the production plan for the planning horizon can be adjusted each year (System 1). In the equation system, the first constraint concerns the total area available, the second set of constraints corresponds to rotation constraints and the third one is a positivity constraint.

                         is the vector of optimal decisions in year s along the three-year horizon on a given plot of the farm.

The dynamic DSP model determines a three-year rotation considering the (K, K′) sets of crop/ precedent crop. This choice depends on the price context, i.e. on the distribution of the embedded and non-embedded risks. The objective function of the recursive multi-period DSP model is the maximization of the utility of the net present value of total farm wealth (Ws
                        ) over the planning horizon beginning on s. Ws

The Utility function is defined as an Arrow-Pratt Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) function, assuming that a change in initial wealth does not affect decisions and ra
                         being the constant absolute risk aversion coefficient (Eq. (2)). This type of negative exponential Utility function can be used with negative payoffs and can be used when losses occur. Considering CARA is appropriate for a low range of variation of payoffs relative to wealth as it is the case when changing the type of rotation

The yield distribution was directly elicited in the field with farmers already involved in innovative rotations, using the visual impact method developed in (Hardaker, Huirne, Anderson, & Lien, 2004). Direct interviews enabled measurement of the probability judgments of the different crop yields involved in ‘conventional’ and ‘innovative’ rotations. For the modeling exercise, the two first moments of the distribution (which was assumed to be Normal

                        ) were kept from this elicitation. The probability distribution of crop yields was generated through Box-Muller method. In the elicitation of subjective probabilities, it was made sure that each farmer took the impact of the preceding crop in the rotation into account when evaluating the yield.


                        
                           Price anticipations
                         are not directly assessed. It is assumed that farmers perfectly anticipate crop prices at the beginning of each year and for the coming three years. These anticipations are made according to a normal distribution where the mean price and the standard deviation are based on empirical data observed quarterly between 2008 and 2010 (Eq.

                        , is a premium given to each hectare of protein crop. It aims at encouraging farmers to adopt long rotations, including protein crops, like pea

                        . It compensates for the loss in gross margin due to the introduction of this low-input and less-lucrative protein crops.

The model is applied to a regional farm-type specialized in arable crops with wheat and sunflower as major crops, in a non-irrigated land. The data concerning production costs per operation have been collected among a sample of 36 farms. The evaluation of individual risk probability distribution (probability distribution of yield and production cost) and the level of individual risk aversion has also been carried out on this sample

                        We do not provide details on this methodology but the main outputs of these experiments are introduced as parameters in the model.
                     . In the following, we give details on the way the different components of gross margins have been obtained (Sections 4.1–4.4) and on the scenarios we have tested (Section 4.5).

A probability tree was built for each crop. The different branches describe the possible management operations for each crop during a production cycle namely, one year. Each node corresponds to a revisable operation for which several options have been reported by both experts and farmers when they conceived the new cropping system all together. For each crop, a sequence of management operations has been described; some are certain, others are risky because their outcome depends on climatic state of nature (Fig. 1). Interviews enabled to measure the farmers’ probability judgment regarding the probability associated with each operation. The annual crop management is exposed in details to each participant, it is composed of all technical operations. In order to estimate farmers’ subjective probabilities linked to the different revisable operations, farmers are asked to rate, on a decade, the frequency of each operation. They have to choose, on a Likert scale, the frequency, from “never” to “always”, with 5 degrees. Thus, the probability distribution of production costs is obtained.

The production costs consist of machinery costs (including fuel consumption, mending and depreciation costs) and input costs. Input costs are extracted from the French technological network on innovative cropping systems. Machinery costs and labour needs per operation depend on the type of equipment. According to the type of equipment, costs calculations are based on the database of the French Office for Coordination of Agricultural Machinery and to the reference costs documented from the national inventory of farming practices. The remaining data are collected from local extension services and in a specialized technical institute (Table 3
                        
                        ).

Farmer's probability judgments concerning the crop yield variability in the ‘conventional’ and in the ‘innovative’ technology are assessed following the visual impact method proposed in (Hardaker et al., 2004). This elicitation of subjective yield risk distribution is carried out as follows: several intervals of yield variability are proposed to the probability assessor between a minimum value and a maximum value, and he is asked to allocate tokens to each yield interval. At the beginning of the procedure, the assessor is provided with 25 tokens. However, he does not have to use all the tokens and he can also ask for more. The probability of each interval is the ratio of the number of tokens allocated to this interval on the total number of tokens used. To ensure a good understanding of the crop management, it is exposed in details to farmers next to the visual impact table. In addition to this, the assessor is asked to evaluate his own degree of confidence in his prediction. From these discrete distributions we keep the mean and variance and assume they follow a normal continuous distribution law.

Risk preferences are obtained through a direct elicitation method based on lottery games, similar to the one used by (Holt & Laury, 2002), (Tanaka, Camerer, & Nguyen, 2010), (Bocquého, Jacquet, & Reynaud, 2013), namely a multiple price list. Individual coefficients of relative risk aversion are obtained. It derives from our estimations that the relative risk aversion coefficient relative to annual farm income rr
                         ranges from 0.69 to 0.85 in the sample. According to Holt and Laury classification table (Holt & Laury, 2002), this range refers to a very risk averse attitude (Ridier, Chaib, & Roussy, 2012).

In the model, a CARA utility function relative to farm wealth is used. The net present value of total farm wealth (W) is the actual sum of annual incomes Z (Eq. (1)). In the CARA utility function, an absolute risk aversion coefficient ra
                         is used, so that ra
                         = rr / W.

For the modeling exercise a farm-type is chosen where behavioral parameters correspond to one type among those surveyed. From the survey data, individuals were classified according to their position towards the innovative long rotation. Among the 36 farmers, several types of perceptions are identified because all famers do not balance ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ events the same way (some are optimistic, others are pessimistic). For each farmer of the sample, the cumulated distribution function (CDF) of the gross margin of the cropping systems is computed considering the yield, price and cost probability distributions. According to the First Order and the Second Order Stochastic Dominance criteria (FOSD, SOSD), three types of individuals can be distinguished in the sample: (i) those who prefer the short rotation to the long one according to FOSD criteria (n =30); (ii) those who prefer the long rotation to the short one according to FOSD criteria (n = 3) and (iii) those for which neither the FOSD nor the SOSD criteria allow classification of both rotation types in order of preference (n = 3). The type that is used to apply the model is the third one for whom the choice between short and long rotation remains ambiguous (Table 3). For this individual type, the mean level of relative risk aversion is 0.70.

The data in Table 3 show that under long rotation wheat is cropped in alternation with a greater variety of crops (sorghum, pea, rapeseed) than under short rotation., The average cumulated gross margin over seven years is Euro/hectare 4944 for the short rotation while Euro/hectare 5099 for the innovative long rotation The alternative crops of the long rotation include less lucrative crops such as pea which average yearly gross margin is equal to almost half of the gross margin of wheat. The decrease of yearly mean profitability is probably a huge obstacle to the adoption of this long rotation. Besides, the sunflower that is conducted under integrated management has a higher mean gross margin than under conventional management (778 Euro/hectare instead of 600 Euro/hectare). This is due a decrease in chemical treatments that decreases operational costs. This cost decrease overcompensates the mean decrease in yields. In return, the variability of yields is higher under integrated management (standard deviation 0.75) than under conventional management (standard deviation 0.5).

In order to test the role of risk and profitability on the adoption of long rotations, several simulations are performed over 25 years (noted Y) of planning horizon. In the baseline scenario, the value of the protein crop premium is set to zero and the level of relative risk aversion is set to the one assessed during the survey for the farm type chosen (AV=0.70). In the scenario 1, different levels of protein crop premium (noted P) are tested, considering that the current level of protein crop premium in the CAP varies each year and is about 150 Euro/hectare. In the scenario 2, different levels of relative risk aversion (AV) are tested (Table 4).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The farm type on which the simulations are performed is 100 hectare large and specialized in field crops, with no other possible farming activities. The model is run over 25 periods. As explained in Section 2.1, in the dynamic model, the farm acreage stabilizes after a certain period. The length of the stabilizing period is reported. The mean acreage observed after the stabilizing period and calculated over 3 years is also reported (i.e. mean acreage over the current, the former and the following year).

The Fig. 3
                            shows the yearly percentage of acreage change. The stabilization of farm acreage below a level of 10 percent acreage change per year occurs after 8 years of planning horizon. The Fig. 4
                            shows the mean acreage observed each year on the farm. Without specific support to the implementation of long rotations, the crop acreage remains, after year 8, composed of conventional crops (less than 40 percent): Wheat and Sunflower. The remaining area is composed of innovative crops: wheat, sorghum and sunflower, over a three year rotation. This means that the seven yearlong rotation is interrupted before the Pea crop, probably, as expected, because it yields low profit level and makes the mean gross margin decrease (Table 3).

In the scenario, a special premium is introduced to support protein crops. The level is varied between P = 100 Euro and 300 per hectare.

In this situation, it takes a little more time for the crop acreage to stabilize along the horizon, it stabilizes around the 13th year (Fig. 5
                           
                           
                           ). After year 13, the mean acreage change decreases below 20 percent.

With a 100 Euro premium (simulation P1 on Fig. 6), Pea begins to be profitable and thus introduced into the rotation. From 250 Euro premium (i.e. close to the level applied in France between 2011 and 2013), Pea is introduced with a share of more than 10 percent of the total production area, and the following crop is Rapeseed. The Pea and Rapeseed areas increase to the detriment of Sunflower. This means that, in the traditional Soft Wheat on Sunflower rotation, Sunflower is replaced by a succession of Rapeseed on Pea.

The acreage is composed of conventional crops for a part of it (25 percent to 40 percent depending on the scenarios) and, on the rest of the farm area, of the five crops corresponding to the innovative long rotation (Fig. 6). The share of innovative crops increases with the level of protein crop premium. From 60 percent with a 100 Euro premium, it grows to 75 percent with a 300 Euro premium.

Under this scenario, the level of protein premium is set to 150 Euro/hectare. The level of relative risk aversion is varied. Innovative systems are perceived as riskier in terms of production risk than conventional ones (due to climatic and sanitary hazard). But introducing diversification crops in the farm acreage is also a way of hedging towards income risk. When assuming a CARA utility function and more risk adverse farmers, innovative systems should have a double influence. They increase production risk and they decrease income risk since they enhance crop diversification. In addition to this, some crops in the innovative rotation (like Pea) present a large decrease of the average yearly profitability.

The risk aversion coefficient is varied from a low level of 0.1 to a very high level of 1.3. The Fig. 7 shows that the higher the level of risk aversion, the shorter the stabilizing period.

The Fig. 8
                            shows the farm acreage after a stabilizing period (13th year). The results show that when the level of risk aversion increases from AV1 = 0.1 to AV2 = 0.3 and from AV2 = 0.3 to AV3 = 0.5, the area in diversification crops increases (Pea, Sunflower, Sorghum, Rapeseed under innovative longer rotations) to the detriment of conventional Wheat and Sunflower in a short rotation. But the farm acreage is not reactive to an increase in relative risk aversion higher than AV4 = 0.7. Beyond this level of risk aversion, the total acreage under innovative rotation remains the same, about 60 percent of the total agricultural area, Pea representing about 6 percent and Sorghum 13 percent. This probably results from the conflicting impact of long rotations on risk exposure. It decreases income risk through the diversification effect and it increases production risk through the introduction of more risky crops in terms of yield. It also induces yearly decreases of the average profitability, due to the Pea crop.

The issue of crop rotation choice has been handled by OR mainly with static approaches and in the point of view of two main disciplines: agronomy and economics. The literature can be divided in twofold: cropping plan selection models and cropping plan decision models. As an example of cropping plan selection model, the agronomic model of (dos Santos, Costa, Arenales, & Santos, 2010) simulates legumes rotations as a division of the available agricultural area to meet the demand and under agro-ecological constraints. Cropping plan decision models are more focused on farmer's behavior and the approach developed in this article clearly affiliates to this second type. Martins and Marques (2007) use OR, always in a static way, but under a stochastic environment, to evaluate the influence of farmer's behavior in the adoption of soil-tillage technologies. They use compromise programming with a risk MOTAD model for two situations: one with only traditional technology and the other where all the technologies are competing. According to the weight they give to the expected income and to the income variance criteria respectively, the degree of adoption of new tillage technology varies. El Nazer and Mac Carl have modeled crop rotation by building a MOTAD model to account for the impact of the precedent crop without predetermined rotations. Doole and Pannell (2008) used other techniques of OR (compressed annealing) to test the benefit of incorporating pasture inside land-use. Here a dynamic Discrete Stochastic Programming model of crop rotation under risk is built to investigate the adoption of longer cash-crop rotations in the presence of risks. The simulations are based on data obtained from a case study of real farmers currently experimenting innovative rotations. Thanks to the mathematical programming model, simulations are conducted by varying parameters, some of them being directly assessed through direct surveys among farmers (risk preferences). The survey has shown that innovative cropping systems (here long rotations) are almost always perceived as riskier than short rotations in terms of production risk. The simulations performed with the dynamic DSP model, based on the survey data, show that long rotations get more attractive when they are supported by a protein crop premium. Indeed the crops introduced in the long rotations are less lucrative and market forces have significant influence in the short term on farm profitability by counteracting farmers’ long term efforts to insert less lucrative but environmentally beneficial crops. In the case-study, farmers have already begun to experiment long rotations and the premium to protein crops exists. The support also consists in the non-financial support targeted to farmers and brought by extension networks in the form of technical advice, knowledge, information, references, which can transform risk perceptions. The results of the simulations also show that under production and market risk, an increasing level of relative risk aversion, up to 0.7, tends to discourage the long term engagement of farmers into long rotations because long rotations are perceived as risk increasing. But long rotations also enhance farm crop diversification which also comforts a strategy to hedge income risk. Therefore with very high levels of risk aversion, the innovative rotation is no more discouraged.

The combination of Discrete Stochastic and Recursive Programming tools, which have already been used as a stochastic optimal control in (Kobayashi et al., 2007) and also in (Mosnier et al., 2009) seems a promising approach for the assessment of agricultural innovations implemented in the long run. Modeling approaches are relevant when data are missing and when innovations are pioneered by a small number of firms, with very little feedback on economic performance. Also, farm innovation entails risks and uncertainty. Therefore stochastic programming is a way of mapping the different states of nature linked to different scenarios and combination of states of nature for the different random variables at play. Dynamic recursive programming enables us to account for the adaptability of the crop acreage to price fluctuations from one year to the other, while assuming some environmental benefits of crop alternation.

Dynamic mathematical programming models have several advantages that have been highlighted. They are relevant to take into account the technical changes that have not or little been experienced and for which too few statistical insights exist. Moreover, these models can simulate scenarios for technical adaptation such as changes in rotation and choices of crop with high flexibility that is not possible with models that have been statistically estimated. But, in return to this high flexibility, the simulations are based on numerous assumptions and on many data and settings, be they technical parameters (like the production yields, the rotation possibilities or the type of costs) or behavioral parameters (like the level of risk aversion). The solutions are therefore dependent on the quality and validity of these data, so that the validation of this model type is still subject to debate (see for instance Heckelei, Britz, & Zhang, 2012). On the part of the validation, another problem is that of the representativeness of these types of models that are not based on statistical inference. Thus, modelers have to face a tradeoff between the precision and accurateness of the data used to implement the production function and the statistical representativeness of the model. The methodological choice operated is very dependent to the nature of the issue which influences the need for representativeness. Also, the models’ outputs need to be considered first in terms of tendencies rather than for their absolute values.
