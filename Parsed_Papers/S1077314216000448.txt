@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Line triangulation refers to the process of determining a 3D line given its projections in two or more images and the corresponding camera matrices [1,5]. Compared to point features, line segments are more robust to matching errors, occlusions, and image uncertainties. 3D reconstruction from line segments has been widely studied or used in the literature. In order to automatically recognize corresponding lines, a novel line segment recognition algorithm was presented in [20] based on epipolar constraints and straight-line auto-grouping. A toolbox LMATCH was designed in [21] to match and reconstruct 3-D line segments across multiple calibrated images. Linger [22] proposed an algorithm to detect and match straight-line segments between multiple images. Uchiyama et al. [23] adopted the three-view constraints to find the correspondence of line segment, by exploring a color feature of the line segment and the preliminary knowledge of the vehicle motion. By combining projective geometry and statistical information, the uncertainties of line segments are presented in a homogeneous coordinate system to better match and reconstruct 3D line segments [24]. In [28], a novel method was proposed to accurately extract plane intersections from large-scale raw scan points. The line segments were matched from Line-based Eight-directional Histogram Feature (LEHF) in [29].

Zhang [19] firstly investigated the problem of structure from motion using line segments. In [30], 3D line segments were used to estimate the pose of an RGB-D camera. Appearance-less epipolar guided line matching was utilized in [31] to create a potentially large set of 3D line hypotheses, which were then verified using a global graph clustering procedure. Then, these 3D line segments were used to improve the 3D model of man-made environments. The generation of an improved reconstruction by imposing global topological constraints given by connections between neighboring lines was studied in [27]. In [18], line segments were reconstructed from visibility information. A linear method for simultaneously reconstructing 3D lines and cameras from many perspective views was proposed in [25] by using a direct reference plane. A geometric error minimization scheme was proposed in [26] to achieve projective reconstruction from line segments.

As one of the fundamental problems in computer vision, this problem of line triangulation is trivial in theory since the 3D line is the intersection of the back-projected planes of the image lines. However, when the number of views is larger than two, the back-projected planes usually do not intersect at one line in the 3D space due to measurement error and image noise. Thus, we have to find a 3D line that fits optimally with the measurement; this is called optimal line triangulation. In the literature, some approaches have been proposed for line triangulation based on different optimality criteria, such as minimizing algebraic errors, geometric errors, and the re-projection errors [2,7,9,15,16].

The algebraic error minimization of line triangulation is a linear least squares problem with a quadratic constraint (called the Klein constraint, as discussed in Section 2). Bartoli and Sturm [2] proposed a linear algorithm for the algebraic error minimization. This algorithm first finds a solution of the corresponding linear least squares problem by ignoring the Klein constraint, then, the solution is corrected subsequently by singular value decomposition (SVD) with the Klein constraint enforcement. This algorithm provides only an approximation of the optimal solution to the algebraic error minimization. In our recent study [17], we proposed several methods for line triangulation by minimizing algebraic errors. Based on the Lagrange multipliers theory, a formula to compute the Plücker correction is provided, and from the formula, a new linear algorithm is proposed for line triangulation. Two nonlinear optimal algorithms are proposed by minimizing the algebraic error without further Plücker coordinates correction step.

Compared with the algebraic error minimization, finding the optimal solution to minimizing the geometric/re-projection error is more difficult, because, as shown in Section 2, we have to solve a problem of sum-of-fractions programming with the Klein constraint. Freund and Jarre [6] pointed out that the fractional programming is an NP-Complete problem under the assumptions that the feasible region is convex and the numerator and denominator of each fraction in the sum are convex and concave, respectively. Thus, any approach to finding optimal solution of the fractional programming will necessarily be very slow unless P=NP. Based on the above assumptions, Josephson and Kahl [9] proposed a branch-bound algorithm for the re-projection error minimization. In this algorithm, the Plücker coordinates of 3D line are parameterized as a form of four variables with two specific planes, in which one of its components is a non-linear function of the four variables. When only the non-linear component is considered as an independent variable, parts of the sum in the cost function can be expressed as a ratio of convex functions, and thus, the algorithm can only provide a suboptimal solution to the re-projection error minimization. Bartoli and Sturm [2] proposed an iterative algorithm for the geometric error minimization based on the orthogonal representation of 3D lines, which does not guarantee to yield an optimal solution. In addition, this algorithm can also be used for the re-projection error minimization.

In studies on line triangulation, a natural question is that which one of the above three optimality criteria is the “best”? In order to answer this question, we need a criterion that is independent of the three optimality criteria to describe the “bestness”. One intuitive criterion is the 3D error, i.e. distance between a reconstructed line and its ground truth. The Euclidean distance does not give a reasonable measure since it is not an intrinsic distance on 3D line space. So far, no study on the metrics of 3D lines is available in the literature, and thus, it is still an open problem for the evaluation of line triangulations.

This paper focuses on the triangulations and metrics of lines. The main contributions are summarized as follows:

                        
                           •
                           For the geometric/re-projection error minimization, it is proved that finding the optimal solution to minimizing the geometric/ re-projection errors can be transformed to finding roots of

                                    )
                                 
                               or

                              -degree polynomial equations in six variables, where N is number of views.

In practice, the above transformation-based approach is computationally intensive for a large number of views. To handle this issue, an effective iterative algorithms, ITEg, is proposed to minimizing the geometric errors.

Three metrics on 3D line space, i.e., the Euclidean metric, the orthogonal metric, and the quasi-Riemannian metric, are analyzed and compared in detail. The orthogonal metric is based on the angular distance on rotation groups [8] and the orthogonal representation of 3D lines [2]. The quasi-Riemannian metric is based on the Riemannian metric on a 5-dimensional unit sphere.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some preliminaries used in the paper. Three common criteria for optimality are stated in Section 3. The proposed optimal algorithm is elaborated in Section 4. Section 5 presents two new metrics on 3D line space. Some experimental results with synthetic and real data are presented in Sections 6 and 7, respectively. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 8.

In 3D projective space, the Plücker coordinates of a line is defined by a nonzero 6-vector:

                         are two non-coincident points on the line. The Plücker coordinates is homogeneous since the two 6-vectors computed with two different pairs of points on the line are equal up to a nonzero factor. From (1), it is easy to see that

In 5D projective space, the quadric defined by (2) is called the Klein quadric [14], thus, the Plücker coordinates satisfies the Klein quadric constraint. Conversely, if a nonzero 6-vector satisfies the Klein constraint, it must be the Plücker coordinates of a line in a 3D projective space.

                         are called the linear least squares fitting and the orthogonal least squares fitting of the measured point set ℓ, both of them have linear solutions [7]. The orthogonal least squares fitting is frequently used in practice, since it usually gives a better estimation for the line l.

                         can be theoretically transformed to finding the real solutions of the algebraic equations. However, such transformation-based approaches are not feasible if the number of views is large. For example, when 
                           
                              N

                        , we need to solve a system of 25-degree or 19-degree polynomial equations in six variables. If the continuous homotopy method is used, then, there will be 256 or 196 one-dimensional connected components to be tracked in the zero-point set of homotopy, and the involved computational cost is unbearable in practice.

                         is not a stationary point of f(L).

The question now is turned into how to determine multiplier α*. Since (15) gives the relationship between the multiplier α and the variable L, an initial value of the multiplier α can be determined from the initial value of L. Then, in an iterative manner, the multiplier α is updated according to (15). From the above discussion, our iterative algorithm ITEg is outlined as follows.

                           Compared with the existing iterative algorithms in the literature, the ITEg avoids the selection of inhomogeneous Plücker coordinates with 4-parameter. Note that the ITEg is of local convergence like the existing iterative algorithms, that is, the convergence of ITEg is guaranteed only when the initial value is close to the optimal solution. According to our large number of numerical simulations, the ITEg with the initial value

The aim of this section is to introduce two new metrics on 3D line space, called the orthogonal metric and the quasi-Riemannian metric. Compared with the Euclidean metric and the orthogonal metric, the quasi-Riemannian metric appears more appropriate.

                           , since u and u′ are the normalized coordinates of the infinite lines L and L′, they are respectively the normal vectors of a plane passing through L and that passing through L′. Hence, the second mapping in the definition (29) is meant the orthogonal distance of two infinite lines is just two times of the included angle by the two planes.

In order to compare the performance of different metrics, we gerenated a 3D unit cube centered at the origin in space. Fig. 1
                            shows the 12 edges and other 16 line segments of the unit cube. Fig. 2
                            (a)–(c) shows respectively the distances between the edges computed by the Euclidean metric, the Orthogonal metric, and the quasi-Riemannian metric, where different distance values are represented using different colors.

Based on their relative positions, the edge pairs belong to either the two parallel relationships (P-I and P-II) or the two orthogonal relationships (O-I and O-II):

                           Each of the three metrics can give a unique distance for each relationship, as shown in Table 1
                           . However, from Table 1 it can be seen that the Euclidean metric could not distinguish between O-I and O-II; the orthogonal metric could not distinguish between P-I and O-I; while the quasi-Riemannian metric gives different distances for all four relationships, and these distances are consistent with our intuition that the distances for P-I, P-II, O-I and O-II should increase gradually. This observation implies that the quasi-Riemannian metric is more reasonable than the Euclidean metric or the orthogonal metric.

To make a more complete comparison, we analyzed the relationships between all the line segments (C(8,2)=28) through any two points of the unit cube in Fig. 1. According to the geometrical position, 378 (=C(28,2)) pairs of line segments were generated by these line segments, and all these pairs can be divided into 18 categories of relationships as shown in Fig. 3
                           . If a metric recovers the same distance for each pair in a certain category, we call it correct; otherwise, we call it incorrect. In practice, we may have two different types of incorrectness. If a metric yields the same distance for every line segment pairs in two different categories, we call it incorrect type-I; in another case, if a metric obtains different distances for any pairs in the same category, we call it incorrect type-II.

According to the above analysis, the sum of the correct relationships and the type-I incorrect ones should equal to 18, the total categories of all relationships. The result is shown in Table 2
                           , from which, we can see that the quasi-Riemannian metric recovers the most categories of the correct relationships with the least incorrect ones, while the orthogonal metric yields the most number of incorrectness. A detailed graphic result of all the metrics on different relationships of line segments is given in the appendix.

This experiment aims at comparing the line reconstruction results of different metrics. First, we generate the 2D images of the line segments through randomly selected 3D line segments and camera projection matrices, six images are used in the test. Then, we reconstruct the 3D line segments from the 2D image. In order to obtain a statistically meaningful result, Gaussian white noise is added to the points on the images of the line segments, and 20 independent tests are carried out. Under different metrics, the average value of the line segments are computed. The errors of different estimations under different metrics are ploted in Fig. 4
                           . It is evident that for the Euclidean error, the results of the the quasi-Riemannian metric and the Euclidean metric are smaller than that of the orthogonal metric; for orthogonal error, the results of the quasi-Riemannian metric and the orthogonal metric are smaller than that of the Euclidean metric; for quasi-Riemannian error, the results of the quasi-Riemannian metric and the Euclidean metric are smaller than that of the orthogonal metric; and for geometric error, the result of the quasi-Riemannian metric is smaller than the other two metrics.

All these experiments imply that the quasi-Riemannian metric is more reasonable than the Euclidean metric or the orthogonal metric. Therefore, in the following experiments of this paper, the quasi-Riemannian metric is used to evaluate the 3D errors of line triangulations.

In the experiments, we simulated eight 3D space lines on symmetrically distributed on two orthogonal planes, as shown in Fig. 5
                     . Using the synthetic lines, we generated six images using different viewpoints and cameras parameters. The size of the images is set at 1024×1024. In order to simulate the effect of image noise, we evenly sample 20 points on each image line segment, and add Gaussian white noise to these sampled image points, then, the actual projected lines are fitted by the orthogonal least squares fitting from these noise-corrupted point set.

We evaluated and compared the performance of the linear algorithm LIN [2]; the optimal algorithm based on the algebraic optimality criterion (AOC): OPTa-I [17]; and the iterative algorithm based on the geometric optimality criterion (GOC): LIN / OPTa-I+ITEg. The criteria used in the evaluation are RMS (root mean square) of the 3D errors (i.e., the quasi-Riemannian distance of reconstructed line to its ground truth) and the geometric errors.

This experiment aims to test the numerical stability of the algorithms with respect to different noise levels under the same geometric configuration. During the experiment, Gaussian white noise was added to each image point. The noise level was varied from 0.0 to 3.0 pixels in steps of 0.5, and 150 independent trials were carried out under each noise level. We reconstructed the 3D lines from six images using the proposed algorithms, as well as the linear algorithm (LIN) and the algebraic optimal algorithm (OPTa-I). Fig. 6
                         shows the reconstructed 3D errors and geometric errors by different approaches. It is evident that the RMS errors of all algorithms increase with the increase of noise levels; the linear algorithm LIN performs the worst, while the proposed GOC based algorithms yield the lowest 3D errors and geometrical errors. The two iterative algorithms based on the GOC have very close accuracy, although they start with different initial values.

We also compared the computational cost of these algorithms. The real computation time of the LIN, OPTa-I, and LIN/OPTa-I+ITEg algorithms are 0.002, 11.681, 7.372, 15.688s, respectively. It can be seen from the results that the OPTa-I+ITEg requires less iterations than the LIN+ITEg algorithm due to a more accurate initialization. However, since the OPTa-I algorithm is computational intensive by itself, the total computation time of the OPTa-I+ITEg is much longer than the LIN+ITEg algorithm, while both algorithms yield very close final results. Therefore, LIN+ITEg is a better choice in practice.

This experiment is to test the numerical stability of the algorithms with respect to different geometrical configurations. During the experiment, the number of views was varied from 4 to 12 with the steps of 2. At each number of views, 150 independent trials were carried out to produce a statistical meaningful result.

                        . From this figure, we can see that, with the exception of the linear algorithm, the 3D error and geometric error of all the other algorithms decrease slowly with the increase of image numbers. The image number has a big influence to the LIN algorithm, whose errors decrease greatly when the frame number increase from 4 to 8. In every situation, the two proposed iterative algorithms yield similar results that are better than other approaches.

This experiment provides more comparative results using the same configurations as in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. We compared the performance of the proposed iterative algorithm based on the geometric optimality criterion (LIN +ITEg) with respect to the linear algorithm (LIN) and the non-linear optimization of lines using a minimal 4D parameterization (MLE) [2]. In this experiment, we only used the two endpoints of the line segment the same as [2], and the results are shown in Figs. 8
                         and 9
                        , respectively. We can see from the results that, in every situation, the proposed LIN+ITEg outperforms the other two algorithms. If all points on the line segment are utilized, our experiment shows that the performance of the MLE algorithm is almost the same as the proposed algorithm, and the two performance curves overlap with each other, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively.

The proposed algorithms were evaluated using extensive real images. The experimental results on four data sets are reported below. As shown in Fig. 10
                     , the used images include a calibration cube, the Oxford “Wadham College”, the “corridor” datasets, and the “model house” (the datasets were downloaded from the Visual Geometry Group of Oxford. http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/data-mview.html). The lines marked in white and red in these images are used to test the algorithms.

For the calibration cube, six images were taken by a Nikon D40 camera, with a resolution of 3008 × 2000 pixels. The correspondences between the 3D points on the cube and their images are used to compute the camera matrices. The camera matrices are computed by the calibration toolbox (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/ bouguetj/calib_doc/). For the Wadham College images, the model house images, and the corridor images, the camera matrices and the coordinates of the two end points of the image lines are provided by the Oxford datasets.

                      show the 3D errors and geometric errors obtained from different algorithms using the calibration cube, the Wadham College, the corridor, and the model house datasets, respectively, from which we can obtain the same conclusion as that in the simulations. The two proposed iterative algorithms based on the GOC and the MLE algorithms yield very close results, which outperform the results by the LIN and the OPTa-I algorithms.


                     Fig. 15
                      shows the 3D reconstruction results from the fours datasets using the LIN+ITEg algorithm. We can see that the proposed algorithm correctly recovers the 3D structure of all detected lines. The reconstruction results by other methods are omitted here due to limited space.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, line triangulations and line metrics based on geometric errors are systematically investigated. The main contributions include: (1) For geometric and reprojection optimality criteria, we show that finding their optimal solution can be transformed to finding the real roots of algebraic equations, and two effective iterative algorithms are proposed; and (2) we analyzed and compared three metrics on 3D line space, including the Euclidean metric, the orthogonal metric, and the quasi-Riemannian metric. The experiments using synthetic data and real images show that the iterative algorithms based on geometric optimality criterion can reconstruct more accurate 3D lines than those based on the linear algorithm and the algebraic optimality criterion. Therefore, the geometric optimality criterion is a better choice for line triangulation.

The appendix presents an illustration of different line segment relationships given in Section 5. Fig. A1
                      illustrates the Euclidean metric of all line segment pairs in the unit cube of Fig. 1; Fig.A2
                      shows the orthogonal metric; and Fig.A3
                      shows the quasi-Riemannian metric. In these figures, different color indicates different value of the distances between two line segments. The grid at the ith row and the jth column and the grid at the jth row and the ith column indicate the distance between the ith line segment and the jth line segment as shown in Fig. 1. Since they stand for the same line segment relationship, the two grids have the same color, and all these illustrations are symmetric with respect to the diagnal.
