                  Natural earthquake disasters are unprecedented incidents which take many lives as a consequence and cause major damages to lifeline infrastructures. Various agencies in a country are responsible for reducing such adverse impacts within specific budgets. These responsibilities range from before to after the incident, targeting one of the main phases of disaster management (mitigation, preparedness, and response). Use of OR in disaster management and coordination of its phases has been mostly ignored and highly recommended in former reviews. This paper presents a formulation to coordinate three main agencies and proposes a heuristic approach to solve the different introduced sub-problems. The results show an improvement of 7.5–24% when the agencies are coordinated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Major earthquakes shake various parts of the world every few years, claiming major losses in human lives and belongings. They are devastating, particularly in developing countries, because of poor housing construction materials and technologies. Lifelines, specifically transportation networks, are also vital in earthquakes because they provide a platform for humanitarian goods (e.g., water, food, medical goods and survival equipments) to be dispatched. Therefore, retrofitting certain transportation links assures their functionality in earthquakes. Location and allocation of humanitarian goods is the final responsibility of crisis managers to save more lives. Lack of efficient integration between the mentioned sectors has intensified casualties in some recent earthquakes such as Bam (located in Kerman province of southeastern Iran) where use of mud brick, high response time, and lack of relief supplies increased the death toll to 26,271 people (USGS, 2006).

Three main actors that play major roles in contributing to more earthquake resilient communities, before and right after the incident, are the building renovation sector, the emergency response sector, and the transportation sector. The building renovation sector is responsible for renovation of aging and deteriorated structures and buildings. The emergency response sector is in charge of locating emergency aid centers and allocating appropriate potential to them to reach the affected population. And the transportation sector is accountable for retrofitting transportation facilities, such as bridges and highways, to make sure they are up-right to carry emergency supplies.

Building renovation is usually a very extensive task, which is too expensive to be assigned to any governmental budget. Mobilization of private investors by local governmental bodies, along with central government ordinance and jurisdictional assistance, may handle such heavy operations and create a perpetual momentum to put an end to this operation in a specific plan. Transportation infrastructure reinforcement to withstand high impact earthquakes is an operation under the auspices of local governments, such as municipalities. Location planning for emergency aid centers along with allocation planning for constructing various facility levels and relief resource storages at these centers is usually assigned to central governments. Although all the mentioned operations are under the jurisdiction of separate agencies, the impact of communication and coordination between the different actors is usually ignored.

Disaster management is a process composed of four phases: namely mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery (Waugh and Hy, 1990). Mitigation is a set of strategic measures taken to reduce, or eliminate the disaster impacts. Preparedness activities are (tactical) measures aimed to lessen or avoid disaster consequences by preparing the community for hazards. Response includes acting according to emergency plans to preserve lives, properties, the environment, and the community’s social, economical, and political structures. Finally, recovery involves long-term actions that will restore normalcy to the affected areas. Altay and Green (2006) identify potential research directions in future OR/MS applications to the problem. They acknowledge the above four phases of disaster operations management and list typical activities involved in each phase. They point out that about 44%, 21%, 24%, and 11% of the reviewed papers address mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery, respectively. They observe that little attention is paid to both (a) the recovery phase of the process, and (b) more importantly, the integration of these phases, and thereby the collaboration of the agencies involved in this process.

This paper presents a formulation to model three main actors participating in disasters and emphasizes the importance of coordination between the actors. Every actor presented in this paper is in charge of one of the four phases, integrating all the phases in disaster management except recovery. The building renovation sector and the transportation sector mitigate the impact of the disaster by stabilizing certain structures and transportation facilities. The residents of these structures are not in danger because their dwellings are no longer vulnerable to collapsing. The emergency response sector on the other hand, is responsible for both the preparedness and response phases. By locating and allocating relief supplies to aid centers, prior to the earthquake, the community is prepared and by distribution of these supplies at the onset of the earthquake the community responds. In other words, this paper is a study of disaster management from a multi-agent, multi-phase point of view.

In general, the above multi-agent problem is a problem of security threats. The general problem is defined as follows. There are some vulnerable areas in the study region; and some vulnerable infrastructure facilities (transportation facilities) which are used before the incident, and are access tools for the emergency response centers after the incident to reach the inflicted areas. The problem is how to plan for (a) strengthening structures of the vulnerable areas (b) retrofitting transportation links to ease access to the affected areas and (c) locating and equipping emergency response centers to reach the inflicted areas in a reasonable time span for help.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Previous research in management of disastrous events is mainly devoted to studying the three mentioned agencies independently. It is therefore important to study each agency individually and review the significance of coordination between agencies in disaster management.

Rehabilitation of deteriorated urban development constitutes a wide range of topics. These include partnership between public and private sectors (Russell, 2001); general role of the public sector in supporting the investment and activities of the private sector (Turok, 1992 and Imrie and Thomas, 1993); Land Development Corporation (LDC), its relationships with local communities, and its place in the broader political structure (Adams and Hastings, 2001a,b; Cuthbert and Dimitriou, 1992); and prioritizing urban planning projects (Gómez-Navarro et al., 2009).

In a literature review De la Torre et al. (2012) analyze the potential of operational research models to help relief agencies saves lives, maintain standards of humanitarianism and maximize the use of limited resources. This analysis, based on interviews with aid organizations and review of previous publications, emphasizes the complexity of disaster relief distribution and highlights the potential of operational research in disaster relief routing.

To provide relief to victims of disasters, significant distribution of life-saving commodities to beneficiaries is required with the least transportation time. Viswanath and Peeta (2003) present a multi-commodity problem for the choice of bridges to be retrofitted under a budget constraint so as to solve a maximal population covering problem in a minimal transportation time. Haghani and Oh (1996) propose a multi-commodity, multi-modal network flow model which solves the problem of moving humanitarian goods from a number of origins to a number of destinations with time windows. Barbarosoğlu and Arda (2004) also propose a multi-commodity, multi-modal flow of first-aid commodities, but use a two-stage stochastic programming framework and represent both resource mobilization and resource requirements as random variables.


                        Goretti and Sarli (2006) analyze the post earthquake performance of the road network in an urban area in relation to the damaged buildings to identify the most important and vulnerable links. They emphasize that the most important tasks after a disastrous event are emergency response to the affected areas and evacuation of the population in these areas to a safe haven. They consider the effects of demolished buildings in denying access to the disaster-hit areas in order to properly perform these two tasks.

A damaged transportation system directly affects the effectiveness of the emergency response plan and has huge socio-economic losses (Okuyama and Chang, 2004). In the past two decades, reliability (function) has been prevalent in studying the vulnerability of lifeline networks. Through this concept, the performance of networks is measured during disasters. Use of reliability (function) is also common in calculating the importance of each link in the network for solving the link importance values (Poorzahedy and Shetab-Bushehri, 2006).

In former study of network reliability, Sanso and Soumis (1991) present a general framework for evaluating reliability of different flow networks (communication, power, and transportation), and give specific modeling approaches for each system. In transportation networks, Wakabayashi and Iida (1994) highlight construction of a reliable network which would provide alternative routes when parts of the network are degraded due to factors such as traffic accidents, road closures for repair, traffic volume fluctuation, or natural disaster incidents.

Reliability (function) is also used in evaluating the benefit of having specific links present in the network. Nicholson and Du (1997a,b) present reliability of transportation networks, based on flow levels, in the events of natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. They focus on critical links in the network whose absence will significantly affect the reliability. Identification of critical links allows decision makers to act prior to the disaster to increase reliability as much as possible. Chang and Nojima (1998) stress the evaluation of special parts of the network such as bridges to check their sufficiency to withstand major earthquakes. Nojima (1998) introduces resource limitation as an important factor in any improvement plan for transportation facilities to withstand major earthquakes, and proposes a probabilistic method to evaluate the performance of transportation facilities, to choose the most important links to be improved.


                        Poorzahedy and Shetab-Bushehri (2006) present a network performance improvement problem for the case of major disaster events, and offer a solution algorithm for this problem. They propose a network reliability measure based on the economic concept of consumer surplus and compute links importance values accordingly. Their model chooses from a selection of actions with different costs, the ones which compared to others would increase reliability the most. Although one of the main objectives in former network reliability research is emergency response, no effort has been directly devoted to this concept.

Though abundant in social sciences literature, disaster operations management encompasses a poor OR/MS participation. Altay and Green (2006) define key concepts of Disaster Operations Management (DOM), classify the surveyed literature, identify potential research directions, and offer a good starting point for future OR/MS researchers. Breaking down the DOM into four main phases (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) they emphasize the lack of multi-agency research in the DOM literature. This is very unfortunate, because as Altay and Green (2006) mention, DOM is by nature multi-organizational and lack of connections leads to managerial confusions and ambiguity of authority. Another suggested concept for future research is “management engineering”, which in the case of disasters refers to coordination of different phases of disaster.

Disaster management is also divided into two stages which cover the four conventional disaster management phases; pre-event and post-event response (Tufekci and Wallace, 1998). Pre-event actions are those taken before the incident to mitigate the adverse consequences and post-event response starts at the onset of the disaster. Tufekci and Wallace (1998) emphasize the importance of integrating these two stages and state that lack of coordination may lead to suboptimal solutions to the overall problem.

The multi-functional nature and political hierarchy in emergency response organizations, make the associated public/private sector problems generally ill-defined with a high behavioral content, and overlaid with strong political implications (Gass, 1994). In other words, responsibilities of various sectors which are in charge of managing disastrous events are not clearly defined and lack of a proper organizational structure makes agency coordination more devastating.

In integrating different phases of DOM, Onur Mete and Zabinsky (2010) propose a two-stage stochastic optimization approach focusing on the storage (preparedness phase) and distribution (response phase) of medical supplies under a wide variety of possible disaster types and magnitudes. In the first stage of the model, locations of medical supply warehouses along with related inventory levels are determined from a set of possible locations and in the second stage, the distribution of the medical supplies is established. In other words, the first and the second stages of the model target the preparation and response phases, respectively. At last, with the aid of the aggregate decisions of the model, an emergency transportation plan is devised in which the number of needed vehicles at each warehouse is established. Even though, in contrast to Beraldi et al. (2004) and Chang et al. (2007), this model takes into account the available transportation routes and transportation travel times, it does not consider the effect of any mitigation activities on the demand. In concept, the Onur Mete and Zabinsky (2010) model is closest to our proposition, with many differences such as the scope of the problem and additional agency coordination.

Every city is made of zones which are composed of buildings that are either seismically stable or collapse if a design earthquake (with a specific magnitude) hits the region. Collapse of buildings is the prime reason for the high number of deaths in an earthquake. Therefore any action to stabilize the weak structures reduces the number of casualties.

Once an earthquake hits, the main priority in management of the situation is to send relief to those who are in need of help. It is therefore essential to store humanitarian goods prior to the earthquake and devise emergency operation plans of how to most efficiently distribute the relief supplies. An effective emergency response system is one which immediately distributes emergency response supplies to the affected areas with the minimum delay time (time it takes for the supplies to reach their destination). This delay time plays a key role in the survival of the victims.

The transportation network is the platform through which relief supplies are distributed. Failure of any link(s) increases the delay time which reduces the efficiency of the emergency response operations. It is therefore necessary to retrofit critical links in the network, prior to the earthquake, to have the most efficient emergency response operations.

The three main sub-problems in this paper are (I) how to renovate the deteriorating zones (which zones and to what capacity), (II) how to locate the emergency relief supplies, and (III) how to upgrade the existing transportation facilities in order to maximize the reliability of the network in cases of emergencies.

The study area is divided into a set of R regions according to some (e.g., administrative) criteria, and each region r into a set of S
                        
                           r
                         sub-regions, or zones, based on structural stability. In other words, boundaries of zones are chosen based on the land use so dwelling with similar attributes are groups together. Here, we denote zone l of region r by rl. The transportation network is composed of nodes and links. Let N(V,
                        L) be the network of concern in the study area, where V is the set of nodes and L is the set of links. The network is independent of the regional divisions, but may be related to the zones for ease of computations, where each zone, or set of zones, sets up a traffic zone.

A standard earthquake strength (e.g., with magnitude of 7.5 in Richter scale) is assumed here for planning and design purposes. One may also randomize earthquake magnitudes, instead of considering a standard one, and formulate the problem accordingly.

The levels of investment in the different parts of the problem (e.g., buildings, infrastructures, and emergency aid centers) are in different scales. Some of these investments may overweigh others in scale. The budgets are allocated to different actors which have independent shortage of resources. In this sense, the investments may not be compared to each other, but should rather be compared to the respective budgets.

There are two strategies to save lives in an earthquake; stabilize buildings so they do not collapse and rescue people by emergency response. The model of this study is composed in a way which highlights the death toll. The objective function of the model, called the CiTy Disaster Level (CTDL), is the number of people who die. It is not significant how people are saved, whether their buildings were stabilized or they were pulled out from the debris, as long as the CTDL is minimized. By this strategy we eliminate any discrimination among humans and consider them all to be of same value.

Link failure happens due to a variety of reasons such as the demolition of the nearby buildings or collapse of bridges. Let Q
                        
                           ij
                         be the failure probability of link (i,
                        j), (i,
                        j)∈
                        L, should a standard (or, design) earthquake occur. This means that link (i,
                        j) in the network would cease to function in such incidents, leaving that part of the network disconnected. Let s be the state of the network after the earthquake, indicating certain functioning and certain failed links. Every state s has an occurrence probability Pr
                           s
                        , which is a function of link failure probabilities (Q
                           ij
                        ).

The transportation network is a life-line: It may save lives through relief distribution if it works properly after receiving a severe shock from a strong earthquake. In an earthquake, it is not clear which links of the network will function, and which link will fail. To a by-stander, this is a probabilistic phenomenon. For links taking either of the two states of being available (1) or not (0), the state of the network after the earthquake shock may be in any of the 2∣L∣ states, where ∣L∣ is the number of links in the network. These 2∣L∣ different states make a set called M.

The state of the transportation network affects the network travel times. Therefore both the travel time

One problem for the emergency vehicles is route choice to the scenes of building destructions because of the earthquake. In such occasions, the traffic in the network flow is in states of instability and chaos. In the absence of a reserved network for emergency response vehicles, the two sides of the transportation network flow (namely, supply and demand) have to be considered. The formulation of the problem in this study takes care of the supply side probabilistically through retrofitting certain links and keeping them at the onset of an earthquake. However, to give a picture of the demand side, one has to postulate an O/D demand level, and a route choice behavior for the demand, in order to be able to estimate the travel time to reach to the scene of destructed zones for emergency aids. Similar to supply, demand can also be dealt which probabilistically by considering possible evacuation scenarios. Let d
                        
                           pq
                         be the demand from origin zone p to destination zone q, (p,
                        q)∈
                        P, where P is the set of O/D pairs. As a behavior, one may assume user equilibrium flow (x
                        ∗), or a Pessimistic Equilibrium Flow, PEF, (x
                        ∗∗) (Poorzahedy and Shetab-Bushehri, 2006). One consequence of a pessimistic choice, which is used in this research, is to prefer higher capacity routes over the narrower ones, to reduce the uncertainties of road blockage. Estimation of demand in such a complex situation, however, is beyond the scope of this study, and is a good subject for research. The result of such researches are inputs

                        , from an aid center in region k to zone rl. However, it is worth emphasizing that exclusive emergency routes/network, as well as GPS/GIS navigation and surveillance systems; obviate ambiguous assumptions in finding the travel routes and travel times of emergency vehicles to reach to the needy area.

The multi-agent nature of disaster management signifies the presence of various actors (public and private), each having their own resources and policies but one main objective in mind. Therefore, there is a need for a DIRecting Problem (DIRP) to direct the solution of the following problems: (a) Building Renovation Problem (BRP) (b) Emergency Location/Allocation Problem (ELAP), (c) Network Improvement Problem (NIP), and (d) Emergency Response Problem (ERP). In order to present the problem better, the formulation of the problem is described in association with a simple example. Fig. 2
                      illustrates the hypothetical city of the Example Problem 1. This study area has two regions, each with one zone: region 1 is a newly developed area, and region 2 a deteriorated one. Tables 1 and 2
                     
                      show, respectively, the information related to the transportation network and the zones of the study area. Table 3
                      presents the results of traffic assignment routines for various possible states of the network for the O/D demand (vehicles per hour) matrix presented in Eq. (4). In this example, we use the BPR volume delay function. However, other forms of volume delay functions may be used as well.

This step is called the initialization step and is explained in the solution algorithm in Section 4.5. Except for the initialization step, the building renovation agency is always coordinated with other agencies. The renovation ratios in different zones are therefore equal to

Locating the emergency aid centers, and allocating resources to them (i.e., designing their size or potential strength in dispatching rescue and aid task forces) are two important decisions related to organizations such as Civil Defense, or Disaster Management. Assigning the right level of relief goods to the appropriate aid centers plays a crucial role in a prompt and proper reaction to help the affected population. The total rescued population after the earthquake when the state of the network is s, called Effectiveness of Emergency Response System (EERS), is expressed as follows:

                           Y
                        ) for the improvement of the critical links of the network. Some of the links in the network are more important than others because their absence has adverse consequences. Therefore, the importance value of link (i,
                        j) is calculated and is denoted by I

                         (Nojima (1998); Poorzahedy and Shetab-Bushehri, 2006). This index shows the rate of change of the reliability of the network with respect to the change in the link’s failure probability. The computation of this index will be explained later in this paper.

Reliability in the context of disaster management may be translated into saving lives and preventing losses to occur. Here, reliability (function) is defined as the probability that the ratio of the efficiency of emergency response in a degraded network over the efficiency of the emergency response in the intact network does not reach a certain threshold. Mathematically, we have:

Link (i,

                           j) always present (R
                           +ij
                           ), and without this link (R
                           −ij
                           ), results the importance value of this link (I
                           
                              ij
                           ) according to Eq. (17).

The difference between (ERP) and (ELAP) is that ELAP is the planning problem (with x and w as variables), but ERP is an operational problem (which has only x as variable). In fact, in reality only one s becomes the state of the network system. However, since s is unknown before the incident of the earthquake, it is sensible to use the expected results. In other words, the ELAP is the problem of locating relief supplies in the preparedness phase prior to the earthquake, and the ERP is the operational problem of how to distribute these supplies at the onset of the earthquake in the response phase.

: Store the values of the final solutions of the three sub-problems BRP, NIP, and ELAP, and STOP.

The presented formulations of the 3 sub-problems (BRP, ELAP, and NIP) specify the connection between each of the involved actors. In other words, every agent’s decisions depend on another agent:
                           
                              (a)
                              Building renovation may be deferred in zones which are well linked with emergency aid centers through sufficiently strengthened transportation network infrastructure. This effect is implemented through the second term of zone importance values in Eq. (7).

Retrofitting weak network infrastructures to provide access is most efficient in an earthquake incident when it reinforces links between zones of demand for help and zones of emergency supply. Link importance values are therefore defined based on the efficiency of emergency response operations.

Provision of emergency centers may be postponed or halted where good building renovation activities are administered or sufficient access to other emergency centers is provided. This effect is applied here through the demand constraint in Eq. (10-ii) and (18-ii).

The purpose of this study to optimize objective functions of every involved actor locally and to show that guidance in coordination of different agencies leads to a better common objective (CTDL), than when there is no coordination (Fig. 4
                        ). One important point in this respect is that although each involved party has a distinct motivation, it has alternative solutions to select. Thus, there is a need for a directing guidance to coordinate the activities of the agents, to reach optimal objectives at both the local levels (optimal agency objective) and obtain the optimal common objective (CTDL). In Fig. 5
                        , the sub-problems are brought under the umbrella of the DIRecting Problem (DIRP), with the assumption that all parties accept the solution with a better value of the common objective function (CTDL). Fig. 6
                         illustrates the inputs and outputs for each sub-problem.

                           s
                        ), would result the values of this function as shown in Table 7
                        .

To examine the role of different sectors in the present problem, a budget analysis is performed for the simple problem illustrated in Fig. 2 and Tables 1–3. Observation of the role of the three previously introduced sectors is made here, by assigning a constant value to the budget of two sectors and increasing the other one to investigate the model’s behavior.


                     Fig. 7
                      is an illustration of the budget analysis. The top line in the figure is obtained by setting a constant value of 400 to each budget of the Transportation sector and the Building Renovation sector, while increasing the budget of the Emergency response sector from 0 to 400. The other two lines are presented with the same assumption for other sectors. From point A of Fig. 7 it is clear that allocating no budget to the Emergency Response Sector will have the adverse affect of increasing the CTDL to 3000. This is not necessarily an indication of the greater significance of the Emergency Response Sector, but means that the cost of saving lives through emergency response is lower than building renovation. By reducing the budget of emergency response in a city, point A gradually lowers. The fact that all the lines in the figure unite at point B is because at this point the budget of every sector equals 400.

The Transportation sector shows an odd yet comprehensive behavior. First of all, the lack of a transportation sector (B
                     
                        y
                     
                     =0, Point C) has the least effect on the CTDL, which is slightly higher than its final value of 1474. Second of all, the transportation sector effect is diminished at point D, where the line becomes flat. Even though the retrofitting of the transportation network does not directly affect the CTDL, it enhances the emergency response operations and must therefore be evaluated accordingly. Section 5.1 illustrates the mentioned hypothesis.

The Building Renovation Sector (BRS) and the Emergency Response Sector (ERS) are two agencies which directly affect the CTDL in case of a disaster. The BRS reduces the impact because it has previously mitigated risk of collapse by stabilizing a portion of unstable buildings of selected areas and the ERS assists the victims of disaster by having formerly allocated emergency supplies to selected regions, which would be dispatched when needed. On the other hand, the Transportation Sector facilitates the mobility of the emergency supplies which means that only if efficient supplies have be stored, does the retrofitting of important links reduce the impact. Fig. 8
                         illustrates the influence of the Emergency Response Sector on the effect of Transportation Sector on CTDL. By fixing the ERS’s budget (B
                        
                           x
                        ), the CTDL is computed for different Transportation Sector budgets (B
                        
                           y
                        ). It is clear in Fig. 8 that as (B
                        
                           x
                        ) increases, the slopes of the lines increase, resulting a higher effect of (B
                        
                           y
                        ) on the CTDL, which means the Transportation budget is effective only if adequate supplies have been stored. With a lower budget for the ERS, retrofitting of important links becomes ineffective, so far as the ERS is concerned, because no supply is transferred.

Here we introduce two new indices called the Life Assurance Index (LAI) and the Security Index (SI). The LAI is defined as ratio of all the rescued individuals to the total at risk population of a city. Since the number of rescued people never exceeds the total at risk population of a city, this index is between zero (loss of the whole population) and one (the entire population is rescued). Security Index (SI) is the ratio of people who were saved by the Building Renovation Sector, and therefore have shelter, to the number of rescued people by both the Emergency Response Sector and the Building Renovation Sector (overall saved people). Since the number of resided people does not exceed the total rescued population, this index is between zero (everyone saved by Emergency Response Sector) and one (everyone saved by Building Renovation Sector).

                        =1350). This figure illustrates how the LAI increases when a substantial budget is invested in the Emergency Response Sector (ERS), whereas if this budget was to be invested in the Building Renovation Sector, a loss of LAI would have occurred. This notion is explained by the fact that the mere cost of saving lives by the Building Renovation Sector (BRS) is higher than the Emergency Response Sector (ERS) and therefore with a limited budget it is more effective to save lives through the ERS. The blue area in the figure displays a larger budget in the Transportation Sector (TS) which is not wise because an efficient transportation network is worthless without adequate emergency response supplies to be transported.


                        Fig. 9 also illustrates how the SI is varied against changes in the Emergency Response Sector (ERS) and Building Renovation Sector (BRS) budgets. When a larger budget is allocated to BRS, more people get the chance to survive the disaster in their intact homes. Therefore the economic condition would be less harmed. On the other hand, if a larger portion of the entire budgets is assigned to the Emergency Response Sector (ERS), people survive the disaster by being pulled out from the collapsed homes and the economy is damaged.

Real size problems pose high dimensions in network size, and hence problem size in the unified case. This is as a result of the exponential increase in the size of the state space with the increase in number of links of concern in the network. For each state, network link travel times after the incident are computed along with three sub-problems (BRP, ELAP, ERS), in every iteration of the algorithm. This clarifies the necessity of devising methods which bring the computation burden of the solution algorithm of the unified problem to a manageable order.

This study, following that of Li and Silvester (1984), uses an average value of the upper and lower limits on the reliability of a network with only a limited number of states. In order to reduce calculations, only states where one, two, or no link has failed, are considered and are shown by set C, where the number of elements in set C

                     (θ) is the lower limit of reliability, and Z(c,θ) is equal to 1 if the network in state c is suitable, and 0 if otherwise. The second term in Eq. (20) which does not appear in Eq. (21) is the sum of the probabilities of the states which were not considered in the calculation. A second approach to reducing calculations is to use the modified versions of equation (20) and (21) based on the measured given by Poorzahedy and Shetab-Bushehri (2006). With the use of such approximate measures, link importance values (I
                     
                        ij
                     ) are obtained using Eq. (16).

In this section, the results of the application of the method on a larger example problem, the city and the network in Fig. 10
                         will be presented. The region presented in Fig. 10 is composed on 6 regions each containing one sub-region. Regions 1 and 3 are relatively built areas with higher durability of structures (at risk populations of 3000 and 400, respectively) with low unit costs of relief inventory. Regions 5 and 6 include a much higher at risk population (12,000 each) and low unit costs of relief inventory due to low value of land. Furthermore, zones 2 and 4 are dedicated to the more prosperous dwellers with much higher land values and hence higher unit costs of relief inventory.

The proposed approximate model of this paper is executed in 4.072seconds (using Matlab 7.12 running on a dual-core 2.40gigahertz Sony Viao with 6gigabyte RAM) whereas this computation time for the exact method is 452.745seconds with a calculated CTDL of 13,354 which differs from the approximate method by 1.5%.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

There are generally two forms of research that build the humanitarian literature: network link rehabilitation and relief supply inventory. However, no research attempts to integrate these two. Therefore the aim of this research was not to build a better relief inventory model or a more advanced network rehabilitation model, but to present the effect that each of these sectors can have on each other and highlight the efficiency of working together in order to save more lives (e.g., Section 5.1, Fig. 8).

This study focuses on the problem of minimizing the level of casualties after a major earthquake. Renovation of deteriorated and low quality buildings and developments, strengthening the existing transportation infrastructures, and locating/allocating emergency aid levels are three main activities involved in this problem. One of the main advantages of this research is that it quantitatively captures the efficiency of such coordination and highlights the major loss in lack of it. However, this model does not focus on how an initial budget should be divided between the associated parties to minimize the death toll. Such formulation is perhaps of priority concern before the issue of agency coordination.

The exact algorithm for the problem takes a relatively longer time (100 times more) than the approximated method. The main difference between the two is that the approximate method takes a maximum of two link failure scenarios whereas the exact method considers all possible scenarios (2
                        number of links). The computation time for the exact method will therefore increase exponentially with the number of links to the point of computation infeasibility. The approximate method, however, solves this problem and can be implemented on networks with a high number of links.

Furthermore, in this paper, the problem for each independent actor is formulated and solved independently. Then, a unified multi-agent optimization problem is formulated, and a heuristic solution method is proposed. Two example problems are considered and solved independently and in the unified manner, as a multi-agent optimization problem. The results show considerable improvement of 7.5–24% in the death toll in the solution of the multi-agent optimization. Finally, we make the following related suggestions for further research:
                        
                           1.
                           A question that is unfortunately usually posed after a disaster strikes is how to allocate a lump sum of money between associated agencies to minimize the impact of future disasters. The proposed model in this paper can perhaps be modified and presented in a bi-level programming nature to discover which budget scheme is most logical. Sensitivity analysis for the modified model would be significant to capture how the CTDL is affected when money is transferred between agents.

During times of chaos and disaster, network users are more inclined to react intuitively and not choose the shortest routes between their origin (home, work, etc.) and destination (shelter). The link travel times that are consequently obtained from such stochastic behavior of evacuees can become an input to the emergency vehicle routing problem so the relief units select the shortest possible routes. It is important to modify the model to capture the effect of such probabilistic behavior.

The last phase of disaster management which was not considered in this research is recovery. This phase can be added to the proposed model by accounting for the costs that would be borne by the community in case a disaster strikes. Such post-disaster costs can be incorporated in the model by weighing zone vulnerability ratios. For example, if a certain zone is more expensive to rebuild, it would obtain a higher vulnerability ratio. However, extensive research is needed to forecast these post-disaster costs.

This research proposes final aggregate output values for each of the involved parties. However, a modified dynamic version of the model can be proposed to capture the differences in time of operation for each of the parties. For example, building renovation operations is done in stages and takes a longer time than road retrofitting and building relief inventory warehouses.
