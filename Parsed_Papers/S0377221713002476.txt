                  Because individual interpretations of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) linguistic scale vary for each user, this study proposes a novel framework that AHP decision makers can use to generate numerical scales individually, based on the 2-tuple linguistic modeling of AHP scale problems. By using the concept of transitive calibration, individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale are first defined. An algorithm is then proposed for detecting the individual characteristics from the linguistic pairwise comparison data that is associated with each of the AHP individual decision makers. Finally, a nonlinear programming model is proposed to generate individual numerical scales that optimally match the obtained individual characteristics. Two well-known numerical examples are re-examined using the proposed framework to demonstrate its validity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Ishizaka et al., 2011b; Saaty, 1980; Vaidya and Kumar, 2006), a decision maker first provides several linguistic pairwise comparison matrices (LPCMs). Then, selecting a numerical scale to quantify the LPCMs obtains numerical pairwise comparison matrices (NPCMs). Finally, priority vectors are derived from the NPCMs (Dong et al., 2008b; Siraj et al., 2012b; Srdjevic, 2005). However, a recurring problem is how to select a reasonable numerical scale for quantifying LPCMs and then for obtaining NPCMs. Harker and Vargas (1987) argued that selecting a numerical scale is an open research question in AHP. Proposed numerical scales include the Saaty scale (Saaty, 1977), the Ma–Zheng scale (Ma and Zheng, 1991), the geometrical scale (Finan and Hurley, 1999; Ji and Jiang, 2003; Lootsma, 1993), and the Salo–Hämäläinen scale (Salo and Hämäläinen, 1997). Dong et al. (2008b) presented two performance measurement algorithms and comprehensively compared several existing numerical scales (in terms of average). Ishizaka et al. (2011a) analyzed the influence of aggregation and measurement scale on ranking a compromise alternative in AHP.

In the field of computing with words, words mean different things to different individuals (Herrera and Herrera-Viedma, 1997; Mendel and Wu, 2010). To reflect individual differences in words, Mendel and Wu (2010) proposed a model based on type-2 fuzzy sets, and Dong et al. (2009) extended the 2-tuple linguistic representation model developed by Herrera and Martínez (2000, 2001). In the AHP field, Huizingh and Vrolijk (1997) showed that the AHP linguistic scale has different numerical meanings to different people. Poyhonen et al. (1997) argued that empirical evidence does not support the superiority of any single numerical scale since the interpretation of the AHP linguistic scale depends on the user. Srdjevic (2005) argued that the best prioritization method relies on the content of a NPCM and that no single prioritization method is superior. Inspired by the works of Srdjevic (2005) and Dong et al. (2011) developed a 2-tuple linguistic multi-criteria approach to select the individual numerical scales. This linguistic multi-criteria approach selects the “best” one from five alternative numerical scales as the individual numerical scale for each LPCM.

A challenge for analysts is how to individually produce new numerical scales that optimally match the individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale. In order to do so, two subproblems need to be solved.

How to individually generate new numerical scales that optimally match the obtained individual characteristics.

Motivated by these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework for producing individual numerical scales in the AHP. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information about the 2-tuple linguistic representation model developed by Herrera and Martínez (2000) and the AHP proposed by Saaty (1980). The framework for producing individual numerical scales is presented in Section 3. Following this, individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale are defined, and then in Section 4 an algorithm is proposed to obtain the individual characteristics. Subsequently, Section 5 develops a model to produce new numerical scales that optimally match the obtained individual characteristics. Two numerical examples are provided in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the study.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The basic notations and symbolic operational laws of linguistic variables were introduced (Herrera and Martínez, 2000, 2001; Martínez and Herrera, 2012). Let S
                        ={s
                        
                           k
                        ∣k
                        =0,1,2,…,
                        g} be a linguistic term set with odd cardinality. The term s
                        
                           k
                         represents a possible value of a linguistic variable. Moreover, the linguistic term set should satisfy the following characteristics:
                           
                              (1)
                              The set is ordered: s
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                                 >
                                 s
                                 
                                    j
                                  if and only if i
                                 >
                                 j.

There exists a negation operator: Neg(s
                                 
                                    i
                                 )=
                                 s
                                 
                                    j
                                  such that j
                                 =
                                 g
                                 −
                                 i.

The number of linguistic terms in set S is called the cardinality of S. For example, S can be defined as: S
                        ={s
                        0
                        =
                        N(None), s
                        1
                        =
                        VL(Very Low), s
                        2
                        =
                        L(Low), s
                        3
                        =
                        M(Medium), s
                        4
                        =
                        H(High), s
                        5
                        =
                        VH(Very High), s
                        6
                        =
                        P(Perfect)}.

                              0,…,

                                 g
                              }, and let i
                              =
                              round(β) and α
                              =
                              β
                              −
                              i be two values, such that i
                              ∈[0, g] and α
                              ∈[−0.5, 0.5). Then α is called a symbolic translation, with round being the usual rounding operation.

Herrera and Martínez’s model represents the linguistic information by means of 2-tuples (s
                        
                           i
                        , α), where s
                        
                           i
                        
                        ∈
                        S and α
                        ∈[−0.5, 0.5). This linguistic representation model defines a function with the purpose of making transformations between linguistic 2-tuples and numerical values.

                              ∈[0, g] a value representing the result of a symbolic aggregation operation, then the 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information to β is obtained with the following function: Δ: [0, g]→

The AHP scale can be decomposed into a linguistic scale and a numerical scale. Table 1
                         shows the nine gradations of the AHP linguistic scale (Ji and Jiang, 2003; Saaty, 1980).

Justification for the selection of nine gradations in Saaty was given by Miller (1956), who demonstrated that an individual cannot simultaneously compare more than 7±2 objects without confusion.

A numerical scale used in AHP, which has 17 numerical values, can be described as follows:
                           
                              (1)

                           i

When a problem is solved using linguistic information, it implies the need for computing with words (Herrera and Martínez, 2000, 2001; Martínez and Herrera, 2012; Mendel and Wu, 2010). In order to analyze the AHP linguistic scale, Dong et al. (2011) proposed 2-tuple linguistic modeling for AHP scale problems. In Dong et al. (2011), a pre-established linguistic term set based on the AHP linguistic scale is defined as follows:

If the decision maker cannot provide some elements of L (or A), the elements are denoted null elements, and L (or A) is an incomplete pairwise comparison matrix. For notation simplicity, incomplete pairwise comparison matrices are also called pairwise comparison matrices in this discussion.

In AHP, decision makers use the AHP linguistic scale to make pairwise comparisons. Therefore, substantial linguistic pairwise comparison data are associated with individual decision makers. This section proposes a framework for producing individual numerical scales based on linguistic pairwise comparison data associated with individual decision makers. The framework is implemented in a two-step procedure (see Fig. 1
                     ).

                           Obtain the individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale, based on the use of linguistic pairwise comparison data associated with individual decision makers. Specifically, apply the algorithm presented in Section 4 below.

Produce new numerical scales to optimally match the individual characteristics. An optimization model is presented below in Section 5.

                        2, A

                        1 and A
                        3. In Finan and Hurley (1999), this procedure performed by the AHP decision maker was referred to as transitive calibration of AHP linguistic scale. Based on transitive calibration, Finan and Hurley (1999) and Ji and Jiang (2003) developed the geometrical scale. Dong et al. (2009) presented a similar concept in the extension of the 2-tuple linguistic model.

For example, suppose the preference intensity between A

                        3 is “s
                        10”. Then, let an AHP decision maker compare the preference intensity between A
                        1 and A
                        3. If the preference intensity between A
                        1 and A

                           It is natural that an individual AHP decision maker may directly provide his/her e
                              
                                 rt
                               values. However, providing the e
                              
                                 rt
                               values is time-consuming for an individual AHP decision maker. This section, therefore, proposes the algorithm listed in Table 2 to automatically detect the e
                              
                                 rt
                               values from discrete LPCMs. Using this algorithm implies that the LPCMs, provided by the individual AHP decision maker, are of acceptable consistency. Several methods (e.g., Alonso et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2008a) have been presented to help the user measure the consistency level of LPCMs.

In this section, two well-known numerical examples are re-examined using the proposed framework. As mentioned earlier, the proposed framework is implemented in a two-step procedure. First, the algorithm presented in Section 4 is used to detect the individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale. Then, model (15) is used to generate individual numerical scales that optimally match the individual characteristics.

Based on the individual characteristics listed in Table 9, model (15) is used to obtain the individual numerical scale:

                        Srdjevic (2002) presented the following example of reservoir water allocated to multiple users. This example has also been used in Srdjevic (2005) and Dong et al. (2011). A global economical goal in this example is defined as the most profitable use of the reservoir. Fig. 3
                         shows the hierarchy for this example.

The LPCMs provided in Srdjevic’s example are listed in Tables 10–15
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        .

The algorithm proposed in Section 4 is again used to detect the individual characteristics (i.e., e
                        
                           rt
                        ) from the LPCMs listed in Tables 10–15. Table 16
                         presents the obtained e
                        
                           rt
                         (r, t
                        =0,1,…,16).

Based on the individual characteristics listed in Table 16, model (15) is used to obtain the following individual numerical scale:


                        f
                        1
                        =1, f
                        2
                        =1.2, f
                        3
                        =2.6, f
                        4
                        =2.8, f
                        5
                        =3, f
                        6
                        =5.6, f
                        7
                        =6,
                        f
                        8
                        =15.8, and f
                        9
                        =16.

The selected numerical scales are evaluated based on the deviation between e
                        
                           rt

                        Table 17 shows that the geometrical scale is superior to the Saaty scale, the Ma–Zheng scale, and the Salo–Hämäläinen scale. Meanwhile, the individual numerical scale is substantially better than the geometrical scale.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Since interpretations of the AHP linguistic scale vary for each user, this study focuses on how to produce individual numerical scales for each user. The main points presented are as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           The framework for producing individual numerical scales is proposed. This framework has two phases: obtaining individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale, and producing individual numerical scales.

By using the concept of transitive calibration, individual characteristics in understanding the AHP linguistic scale are defined. An algorithm is proposed for detecting the individual characteristics from the LPCMs associated with each of the AHP individual decision makers.

A nonlinear programming model is proposed for generating individual numerical scales that optimally match the individual characteristics.

The AHP group decision making model has been studied intensively (Altuzarra et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2010; Groselj and Stirn, 2012; Pedrycz and Song, 2011a, in press; Srdjevic, 2007). Meanwhile, Chiclana et al. (1998), Herrera-Viedma et al. (2002) and Zhang et al. (2004) have studied group decision making models with different preference formats. Therefore, the results of this study provide a basis for investigating the AHP group decision making problems with different numerical scales. Moreover, we argue that it will be interesting in any future research to see if a better algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution to model (15) is proposed.
