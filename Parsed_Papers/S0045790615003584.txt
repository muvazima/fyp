@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Underwater transmission of acoustic signals is affected by several factors such as low propagation speed, signal attenuation, and multipath propagation. Moreover, strong multipath propagation develops because of the many reflections that occur between the surface and bottom boundaries and results in inter-symbol interference; this also badly affects the transmission process by limiting the data rate of communication. There are numerous applications for underwater acoustic information transmission, including the detection and tracking of submarines, tactical surveillance, disaster prevention, tsunami warning systems, and pollution monitoring [1]. The transmission of information underwater with the use of electromagnetic radiation has been found to be energy-inefficient in comparison to transmission using an acoustic carrier. When transmitted through an acoustic carrier, signals can suffer from distortion because of the presence of noise from natural sources such as rain, wind, and seismic activity or from other sources such as ships. For instance, Alkydiz et al. discussed the issues that underwater acoustic signal transmission must deal (with including distortion) for ocean environment monitoring systems [2]. A linear relationship between wind speed and noise spectra was reported in [1] along with the existence of a correlation between the noise level and wind speed. Karasalo I used the COMLAB software tool to develop a time domain model of turbo coded underwater communication; their results show that turbo coded systems achieve excellent bit error rates (BERs) even with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) [3]. However, considering the numerous receivers used in single carrier turbo coded systems, the observed results are very similar to the predicted communication performance [4]. Moreover, methods to minimize multipath propagation influences were discussed in [4], which suggested the use of a multi-carrier modulation technique; the inter-symbol interference effects in underwater acoustic transmission can be removed by assuming that the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol is longer than the multipath spread.

The use of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems for underwater acoustic transmission can attain better spectral efficiency and higher data rates without additional bandwidth. The space–time block code (STBC) encoder and Vertical Bell Laboratories layered space–time (VBLAST) architecture are two methods through which the MIMO system can be explored. Each method has its own benefits and advantages. Higher capacity using spatially encoded bit streams is provided by the STBC architecture, which supports spatial diversity. In contrast, spatial multiplexing is achieved by the VBLAST architecture, which helps transmit varying bit streams from each of the various antennas, improving the data rate. Considering both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing, a double space–time transmit diversity (DSTTD) type MIMO profile has been studied and discussed by various researchers [5]. The performance of DSTTD interleave division multiple access has been explained in detail in [6] which found that this system with the Block-Nulling detection method and iterative decoding algorithm achieves better BERs with lower SNRs. The authors in [7–9] demonstrated that turbo code with an iterative decoding algorithm also results in improved BERs with lower SNRs. In [10–12], it has been shown that multi-carrier transmission using the OFDM technique converts frequency-selective channels into flat fading channels and provides better BERs in multi-path environments with rich scattering.

In this contribution, we use an OFDM to mitigate the effects of multi-path propagation in acoustic channels and DSTTD to enhance the data rate. We evaluate the BER performance of the proposed DSTTD-OFDM system by employing a Block-Nulling detection algorithm at the receiver and a maximum Log-MAP decoding algorithm to alleviate the effects of acoustic interferences and ambient noise.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system configuration. Section 3 presents and discusses the performance results. Finally, our conclusions are drawn in Section 4.

                      presents the transmitter and receiver structure of the coded DSTTD-OFDM system. We presume that the transmitter is equipped with Nt
                      transmit antennas and each receiver is equipped with Nr
                      receiving antennas.

The acoustic signals are first converted into a digital bit stream using an A/D converter. Let the acoustic data bit stream corresponding to the kth transmitter be uk
                     . It is modulated by BPSK modulation and encoded by a turbo code. We implement a parallel concatenated convolutional encoder where the second encoder is preceded by a random interleaver. The output of both encoders is punctured to obtain a halved code rate.

Let the channel encoder output be expressed as sk

In this study, we calculate the BER performance of our DSTTD assisted MIMO multi-carrier system for underwater communication in multi-path channel environments based on the shallow water channel model [13]. Further, we consider an L tap delay [13,14] spread, as defined in Table 1
                     . The fading co-efficient connecting the v-th transmit antenna and w-th receive antenna is given by

The detected acoustic information is despread by a transmitter-specific despreading sequence and is de-interleaved. The de-interleaved bit streams are then decoded by the Log-Map decoding algorithm [16]. Finally, the estimated bit streams are converted into acoustic signals using a D/A converter.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we present the simulation results for the proposed DSTTD assisted MIMO-OFDM system in the shallow water channel multipath environment [17]. The channel parameters are described in Table 2
                     . We assume a transmitter of height 10 m and a receiver of height 5 m for our analysis. We consider 10 receivers located at a distance of 80 m from the transmitter. We assume the channel depth of 20 m, wind speed of 10 knots [17] and the ship activity factor of 0.1 for our calculations. We use a carrier frequency of 18.5 kHz, sampling frequency of 55.5 kHz, and Doppler shift of 9 Hz for our simulation. We implement the multi-carrier modulation using an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) with a block size of 128 for our computer simulation. We consider the random interleaver to mitigate the effects of burst errors. We consider 10,000 trials for channel realizations in our simulation.

                      shows the BER performance of the uncoded DSTTD-OFDM system with Block-Nulling detection. The figure shows that in order to produce a BER of 10−2, an uncoded DSTTD-OFDM system requires an SNR of 2.5 dB.

In contrast, Fig. 4 shows the BER performance of our proposed turbo coded DSTTD-OFDM system with Block-Nulling detection algorithm. This figure shows that in order to produce a BER of 10−5, our system requires an SNR of 0 dB. From Figs. 3 and 4, we observe that our system provides a better BER performance at lower SNRs.

                      using the minimum mean square error ordered successive interference cancellation (MMSE-OSIC) detector [18,19]. In this comparison, it is clear that in order to produce a BER of 10−4, VBLAST-OFDM requires an SNR of 5 dB, whereas our system requires an SNR of only −0.5 dB.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we evaluated the BER performance of the turbo coded DSTTD-OFDM system for underwater communication. We considered a shallow water channel model based on a time-varying wideband channel. It is clear that a multi-path environment in underwater communications causes an irreducible error-floor in the BER performance. Our simulation results reveal that DSTTD-OFDM system with an iterative decoding algorithm provides a better performance in terms of achievable BER for lower SNR in underwater communications while offering a higher data rate. Further, we observe that Block-Nulling detection algorithm provides performance that is superior to that of the MMSE-OSIC detector with fewer computations by mitigating the effects of acoustic interference and noise.
