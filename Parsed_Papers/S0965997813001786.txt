                  In this paper, a multi-project scheduling in critical chain problem is addressed. This problem considers the influence of uncertainty factors and different objectives to achieve completion rate on time of the whole projects. This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization model for multi-project scheduling on critical chain, which takes into consideration multi-objective, such as overall duration, financing costs and whole robustness. The proposed model can be used to generate alternative schedules based on the relative magnitude and importance of different objectives. To respond to this need, a cloud genetic algorithm is proposed. This algorithm using randomness and stability of Normal Cloud Model, cloud genetic algorithm was designed to generate priority of multi-project scheduling activities and obtain plan of multi-project scheduling on critical chain. The performance comparison shows that the cloud genetic algorithm significantly outperforms the previous multi-objective algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A multi-project scheduling problem involves defining feasible start times and feasible resource assignments for activities so that the different optimization objectives, defined as part of the problem, are reached. Moreover, to solve the various uncertainty factors, it is necessary to have knowledge about the effectiveness of the uncertainty factors in relation to different project activities. Compared with multi-project scheduling, multi-project scheduling on critical chain for decisions had superiority in more complex since multi-objective and related to different aspects of the project (i.e., overall duration, idleness of resources, financing costs) must be considered in order to arrive at a efficient schedule. Decisions therefore cannot be based solely on optimizing a single criterion such as cost or duration, but require a multi-objective approach. To address this need, new methodologies and approach should be developed to meet decision support system. In this paper we explore the multi-objective of decision making in multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC) and propose a multi-objective optimization model formulation.

Critical Chain Method (CCM) is first proposed by Goldratte [13], which can optimize overall objective of projects better, raise rate of completion on time and shorted overall span by considering the uncertainty of task duration in projects. Considering the problem form the view of system, which eliminates the influence of “students syndrome” and “Parkinson Law”, effectively solve the problem existed in multi-task between project interrelation and internal project. In multi-project management environment, multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC) have five steps: generating the priority of subprojects; planning and scheduling each subprojects according to Critical Chain Method; avoiding resource conflict among subprojects; setting various project buffers in multi-project environment, analyzing the buffer manage way to meet the objective of completion rate on time of the whole projects.

The fluctuation of duration and cost that involve subproject of multi-project, which bring serious challenge to the scramble for limited resources between subprojects [1,2]. In the literature, various kinds of multi-project scheduling problems have been described and addressed until now, nevertheless, few multi-project scheduling problems have efficient method for considering the uncertainty factors, which a important aspect in multi-project scheduling contexts. These problems state multi-objective optimization about the effectiveness of multi-project scheduling.

With advantages have received gradually, Critical Chain Method has being widely used in project management. In order to realize global optimization of multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC), the multi-objective optimization of time–cost–quality–robustness, which fits actual demand of engineering project better and provides theory basis for integrated management of project schedule in enterprises, was proposed in this article. The research target about multi-project scheduling in critical chain is mainly focused on time, cost and quality in China and abroad. However, the robustness will be an extremely valuable subject because of uncertainty and complexity in multi-project scheduling, which has become a hot topic with deeper research.

The existing techniques for multi-objective optimization can be classified into three categories: global search algorithms, mathematical programming models and heuristic algorithms. Previous research efforts have developed several scheduling techniques for multi-project scheduling. Several approaches to solve the multi-project scheduling problems, a one-stage and two-stage linear programming approach is proposed by Slowinski [20]. In order to solving lager-sized projects, heuristic and meta-heuristic procedures are proposed. Knotts et al. [21] design agent-based algorithm and Lova et al. [22] propose a multi-pass heuristics to solving the problems based on priority rules. However, previous researches do not consider the problem in dynamic scheduling, to find the optimal solutions, the multi model is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, no further research has been performed on the multi-project scheduling on critical chain. In this paper, we introduce a cloud genetic algorithm approach for solving the addressed problem.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, presents a literature review with regard to classification of multi-project scheduling and associated scheduling models and methodologies. In Section 3, we introduce a multi-objective optimization formulation for modeling the scheduling of multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC), which allows multi-objective optimization with respect to duration or cost related criteria in the parametric design. In Section 4, designs cloud genetic algorithm, to solve the problem is described. In Section 5, the computational experiments developed to evaluate the performance of the cloud genetic algorithm are presented, and these results are analyzed. Finally, in Section 6, the conclusions of this paper are presented.

In the literature, various multi-project scheduling problems were proposed, but only few multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC) problems have researched. Yannibelli and Amandi [3]consider the effectiveness of a human resource and to minimizing the project makespan, and proposed a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Zheng et al. [4] address multiple projects in a deterministic environment, which analyzes resource-constraint multi-project scheduling with priorities and formulates, that a discrete bi-objective model is proposed. Vincent and Mario [23] considers asymmetric information and opportunistic behavior in resource constrained multi-project scheduling problems. Browning and Yassine [8] attempt to address the static resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problems, which consider how to allocate resource to minimize the average delay and maximize the time to complete the whole projects. Krueger et al. [9] consider sequence and resource dependent transfer times into multi-project scheduling problems, and formulated an integer linear program. Voss et al. [6] consider a multi-mode multi-project scheduling problems, which takes into consideration the weighted tardiness. A heuristic and a genetic algorithm for multi-project scheduling is proposed by Kumanan et al. [7], which reach an objective to minimize the makespan of the projects. Rabbani et al. [14] put forward a schedule method for resource-constrained random network project;

Bai et al. [12] design fuzzy Critical Chain Method based on genetic algorithm to solve the resource constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSP), Rabbani et al. [14] attempt to using Critical Chain Method to analyze resource-constrained project scheduling in stochastic networks, which suggests a competition routine by implementing a policy to maximize the total contribution of activities using a new heuristic algorithm. Bevilacqua et al. [15] illustrate that Critical Chain Method (CCM) can shorten the duration of the project and reduced operating costs in maximum through application instances. Peng and Xu [16] argue that the earlier the project begins, the lower risk of time delay is and presented improved ways of CCM. Salmasnia et al. [17] introduce quality parameters into the traditional time–cost tradeoff project scheduling problem. Based on analysis of research status on multi-project scheduling problem, multi-objective optimization scheduling problems and Critical Chain Method in project scheduling problems, scholars of domestic and overseas have been tried to innovate theoretical model and solving algorithm to find out more optimal multi-project scheduling scheme on critical chain.

Afshar et al. [10] introduce a finance-based scheduling concept to investigate multi-objective finance-based scheduling, which presents a multi-objective model that search the non-dominated solutions considering duration, required credit and cost as three objectives. Senouci and Al-Derham [11] present a genetic algorithm to solving multi-objective project scheduling problems. Yannibelli and Amandi [3] develop a multi-objective project scheduling model based on a hybridizing multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm with evolutionary algorithm.

In contrast with the above proposed problems, the influence of uncertainty factors in dynamic scheduling environment has not been considered in other multi-project scheduling problems, for this reason, we introduce multi-project scheduling on critical chain (MPSCC), which considers multi-objective in optimization model and presents cloud genetic algorithm to solve the problems.

In this paper, multi-project scheduling on critical chain is addressed. The environment of MPSCC is more complicated and has higher demands about project cycle and resource utilization, in addition, Murphy’s Law and Parkinson’s Law is always involved. Thus, enough safety time should be reserved when making project activity durations to guarantee the project would be completed on time, however, ability against uncertainties will be weaken as this method distributes project risk into project activities. The existence of cascade effect is determined by the character of critical chain multi-project management, that is to say, the change of one project will lead to the change of another by shared resource, and because of this sharing, the service efficiency will be decreased when each project competes for resources. The ability of MPSCC against uncertainties can be lower, which means lower robustness, as delay of one single project will affect the others under multi-project circumstances. Abbasi et al. [18]designed a multiple objective model for project scheduling, which aims at the minimum of duration and maximization of robustness.

Based on the analysis above, the research goal of MPSCC can be divided into four categories: minimize total project duration, maximize robustness of project, and to use project resources in a balanced way. There are mainly three types of existing research: the first is single objective optimization, that is to choose one attribute from time, cost and quality as objective function to establish mathematical models; secondly, the three attributes are considered simultaneously in constructing multi-objective optimization models, which will be transformed into single-objective optimization and solved; thirdly, the robustness of solution in critical chain project scheduling and quality robustness are researched. In practical, time, cost and quality are three major concerns for operators, and the robustness of multi-project scheduling is the key to success of multi-project operation mode. However, there are no mature approaches for deep analysis of multi-objective problem in MPSCC at present. Therefore, the time–cost–quality–robustness multi-objective optimization of MPSCC will have considerable realistic significance.

On the basis of features analysis about MPSCC, this article discussed the four objectives deeply, established time–cost–quality–robustness multi-objective optimization of MPSCC, generated the initial dispatching plan according to priority principle and designed cloud genetic algorithm, by adopting randomness and stable tendency of cloud droplet and setting crossover operator and mutation operator, to solve the problem. A case was given to verify efficiency of the model and algorithm.

                      stands for the quantity of renewable resource demanded by activity j of project i in unit duration; nrijp
                      means the gross quantity of non-renewable resource demanded by activity j of project i; qij

                        Quantization of robustness is the key in robustness research of MPSCC, however, there is not mature study on this issue: maximizing minimum activity slack time can only increase the random time of activities in MPSCC rather than ensuring its abundance. For this reason, robustness will be quantified with the average value of slack time and minimum slack time of activities in this model and its calculation method is given:

                        ’s successor activity, ξ is the number of activities on non-critical chain. When free slack time of activities on critical chain equals zero (robustness of critical chain reaches the maximum), the free slack time of activities on non-critical chain will be maximized (flexible time of all activities on non-critical chain will be enough) which will improve stability of starting time for successor activity and then increase global robustness.

In order to guarantee the rate of completion on time and increase robustness of project quality, proper project buffer determined by the expectation probability of completion on time should be setting up in MPSCC according to self-adaptation which will set the value of buffer in line with RUF of each activity among the project. RUF is calculated as follows

                        T represents the length of critical chain and non-critical chain separately when calculating the project buffer and the time. The smaller value between buffer size and free float of the last activity on non-critical chain should be given to the buffer, in that way, the change of the critical chain because of oversized buffer can be avoided effectively.

To solve the addressed problem, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed. On the basis of considering time, cost, quality and global robustness which are mostly concerned by organizers and contractors, multi-attribute utility function is adopted to conduct comprehensive optimization of time, cost, quality, robustness, and the optimization model is established as follows:

Formula (14) (The objective function) means to maximize total utility of multi-objective optimization in MPSCC; formula (15) reflects the predecessor and successor relationship among the project, which demands that successor activity cannot be executed until the completion of current activity and activity cannot be stopped once it started for the sake of continuity; formula (16) represents that project buffer value will be setup with self-adaptation; formula (17) expresses that resource consumption in one activity cannot exceed its total amount; formula (18) shows the position to insert the buffer, namely, a feeding buffer PB will be inserted between one activity and critical chain when the activity is resource-constrained but does not belong to critical chain or it is a successor activity.

Cloud genetic algorithm is proposed for MPSCC as the priority rule has the limitation that optimal solution may not be generated because solution space will be narrowed when priority of each activity is determined. Randomness and stability of Normal Cloud Model is used to generate priority which is the foundation of drawing up the plan for MPSCC, then distinguish critical chain and non-critical chain, finally calculate and embed buffer to accomplish schedule scheme. Algorithmic flow for MPSCC based on priority is as follows:

                         is the set of activities in process. Critical chain can be confirmed with time relationship, predecessor and successor relationship. For activity Apq
                         on critical chain, searching its predecessor activities which are not on critical chain and connecting them in a series to get non-critical chain in multi-project scheduling. There is a chance to emerge more than one critical chain in the process of drawing up dispatching plan for MPSCC, to this issue, the one with the biggest utility value should be chosen as the final critical chain and others as non-critical chain. Self-adaptive method is adopted to set up project buffer and feeding buffer for MPSCC, which will be inserted into activities according to insert rule to turn dispatching plan into implementation plan (see Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        ).

Along with the development of scientific research, uncertainty has been drawing more and more attention of experts and scholars gradually. Aiming at the shortcoming of fuzzy mathematics and probability theory when handling uncertainty, the concept of cloud model was proposed in 1995, which could reveal the relevance of fuzziness and randomness and achieve the transformation between qualitative concepts and their quantitative expressions.

Cloud genetic algorithm (CGA) introduces cloud model theory into traditional genetic algorithm and the randomness and stable tendency of a normal cloud model are adopted to design the probabilities of crossover and mutation, Pc and Pm. Greater Pc and Pm are set up in the initial stage for the purpose of generating superior individuals quickly, while in the later stage, smaller Pc and Pm are set up along with crossover operator of maximum retention mechanism to protect superior genes from damage. The reason for doing above operations is to improve global optimization ability. Adaptive operator is imported via cloud generator together with excellent characteristics of genetic algorithm which can avoid premature convergence to promote the adaptive adjustment of control parameters of Normal Cloud Model while population fitness changes, in this way, accuracy in searching precision and searching coverage can be improved. Crossover probability Pc and mutation probability Pm of CGA can make dynamic adjustment according to fitness and Show a linear change with their self-fitness. The individual with higher fitness has lower probability of crossover and mutation, conversely, the lower fitness leads to higher probability.

The formula for adaptive generation of Pc and Pm is as follows:

There are three important control parameters in cloud model: Entropy En, reflecting the steepness of cloud model, Expectation Ex, indicating the horizontal position of cloud model and Hyper Entropy He, standing for the dispersion and fluctuation of cloud droplet. Stability of cloud model will drop if He is too high while randomness will descend when He is too low. The introduction of adaptive operator can effectively control the self-adaptation of parameters, adjust the convergence rate at the average value favg
                         of population fitness and improve search capability of individuals with low fitness on the premise of maintaining the stable tendency of superior individuals for generating a larger solution space. Individuals will adapt to environment in accordance with distribution of population fitness when adaptive CGA is adopted to solve multi-objective optimization in MPSCC, which could improve the robustness of algorithm significantly. Control parameter of algorithm could adjust population fitness dynamically, urge the individuals around the average of self-fitness to drive evolutionary optimization of entirety and avoid getting into local optimality effectively. The concrete steps of adaptive CGA are as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              Code design: Chromosome structure with multi-group code is selected in this article and each chromosome corresponds to a list of priority. Natural coding indicates the priority of mission which is a natural number within [1,
                                 m] and a higher value means a greater priority.

Initial population: Full permutation Wu
                                 (t) of priority is generated randomly and the priority of each mission settled by chromosome is important basis of generating critical chain. The ultimate critical chain can be determined through the steps mentioned above, then calculate project buffer and the embedded buffer and confirm the insert position.

Fitness function: Fitness function is the foundation to evaluate merits or defects of chromosome and let fitness function fit(t)=1/u(t). u(t) is the desired value of individual, so the one, whose fitness is lower, is more superior.

Crossover operator: Produced crossover probability Pc of population through X -generator of cloud model, calculate the certainty degree u,
                                 Ex,
                                 En and He, generate a pair of individuals by X -conditional cloud generator, employ double-crossing point operation and then chose one crossing point of gene to put the selected gene code at the first place of progeny chromosomes, delete the same gene code in paternal chromosome and copy other gene codes into progeny in order, adjust position of crossing point when some progeny chromosomes contrary to restraints is generated.

Mutation operator: Produce mutation probability Pm of population via X-generator of cloud model, give the original individual to Ex and calculate En and He, create a new individual with cloud generator and update it when the random number, within (0, 1), meets temp
                                 >
                                 u.

Repeat (2)–(5) and stop the process when Maxgen
                                 =50 or terminal condition is met, then output results.

In this section, the computational experiments developed to evaluate the performance of cloud genetic algorithm are described. After that, the results obtained are presented and analyzed. Take the multi-project scheduling problem consisted of three parallel subprojects as an example to test and simulate multi-objective optimization model and its solving algorithm above.

Seen from Fig. 5
                      that the result of the optimization model, with four objectives of time, cost, quality and robustness, can help managers and operators control and supervise the process of multi-project scheduling effectively. More energy should be given to activities on critical chain according to the experimental result and operators can change decisions based on different emphasis points to achieve maximum global utility.

In this paper, multi-objective optimization for multi-project scheduling on critical chain is addressed, which considers objectives of time, cost, quality and robustness. In the developed experiments, the cloud genetic algorithm was tested many times. To evaluate the performance of the cloud genetic algorithm in instance, the solutions obtained for instance were analyzed. based on the developed analysis, Multi-objective optimization in MPSCC was considered in this model and utility function was employed to realize optimization. This article designed CGA to determine priority of activities and then to generate schedule scheme for MPSCC. The randomness and stable tendency of a normal cloud model are adopted to design the probabilities of crossover and mutation which was given a greater value in the initial stage for the purpose of generating superior individuals quickly, while in the later stage a smaller value were set up along with crossover operator of maximum retention mechanism to protect superior genes from damage. Effectiveness of the model and algorithm were verified by a case study. However, the main defect of this model is that the process of determining weight can be influenced by subjective factor, which will continue to be researched.
