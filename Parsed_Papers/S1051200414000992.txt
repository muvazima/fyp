                  This paper presents a stochastic model for the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm operating in a nonstationary environment with complex-valued Gaussian input data. To derive this model, several approximations commonly used in the modeling of algorithms with normalized step size are avoided, thus giving rise to very accurate model expressions describing the algorithm behavior in both transient and steady-state phases. Such accuracy comes mainly from the strategy used for computing the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices arising from the model development, for which analytical solutions are also derived here. In addition, based on the proposed model expressions, the impact of the algorithm parameters on its performance is discussed, clarifying the tracking properties of the NLMS algorithm in a nonstationary environment. Through simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed model is assessed for different operating scenarios.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Since its inception in 1937 by Kaczmarz [1] (currently also credited to [2] and [3]), the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS)
                        1

                        The terminology of normalized LMS was coined by Bitmead and Anderson in 1980 [4].
                      algorithm has been successfully used in many practical applications, such as network and acoustic echo cancellation, noise cancellation, active noise control, channel equalization, and adaptive array beamforming [5–12]. This success is mainly because of its low computational complexity, inherent numerical stability, very good tracking properties, and high robustness in a wide range of operating conditions. Basically, such characteristics come from the use of a normalized step size in contrast to the LMS algorithm, which makes the NLMS algorithm less susceptible to variations in the input signal power [5–7]. However, due to the use of this normalized step size, the stochastic modeling of the NLMS algorithm becomes a very difficult task (as compared with the LMS one) which is still an open research problem.

In short, the stochastic modeling of adaptive algorithms aims to determine analytical expressions (i.e., a mathematical model) that describe with a certain accuracy the algorithm behavior under different operating conditions, thus providing the basis for a deeper understanding of the algorithm considered. Moreover, since stochastic models allow predicting the algorithm behavior, they can be used for tuning the algorithm parameters as well as for performance assessment, avoiding the need of exhaustive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Furthermore, from the model expressions, some cause-and-effect relationships between algorithm parameters and performance metrics can be established, giving support to consistent design guidelines [13–16]. Lastly, analytical models can reveal undesired (anomalous) algorithm behavior, allowing to modify the algorithm either for correcting such a behavior or customizing it for specific operating conditions [17].

Nevertheless, the modeling of adaptive algorithms presents several mathematical challenges, which are mostly circumvented by using a certain number of simplifying assumptions (e.g., based on the step-size value, filter length, or even statistical characteristics of the input data) during the model development [7]. However, the use of several simplifying assumptions generally gives rise to models with limited practical applicability (i.e., restricted to very specific operating conditions). On the other hand, to obtain accurate models for a wide range of operating conditions, a reduced number of simplifying assumptions should be considered in the model derivation, thereby implying more mathematical challenges [18]. In summary, there is a tradeoff between mathematical complexity, number/consistency of the simplifying assumptions, and accuracy of the obtained model.

Concerning the modeling of the NLMS algorithm, as pointed out by [13] and [19], one of the major challenges resides in the determination of the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices arising from the model development. Regarding the calculus of such matrices, for the case of real-valued input data, several approaches
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        The pioneer research work on this subject dates back to 1986 [20], when a very accurate methodology has been presented; however, analytical solutions are described there only for some particular conditions.
                      can be found in the open literature considering different approximations and, consequently, resulting in models with different accuracy levels (i.e., exhibiting better or worse match with MC simulations) [13,20–29]. In contrast, for complex-valued input data (as occurs in several practical applications [5–9]), the results presented in the literature are very scarce and eventually exhibit certain inconsistencies [30,31]. For instance, in [30], the authors claim that analytical solutions for the calculus of the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices are presented; however, this claim is not plausible since such solutions involve the generalized exponential integral [32] related to the algorithm regularization parameter [21]. In [31], disregarding now the regularization parameter, a solution for the normalized autocorrelation-like matrix (required in the model expression that describes the mean weight behavior) has been derived; however, it is possible to show that this solution diverges when filters with order greater than two are used. Therefore, in the case of complex-valued Gaussian input data, the determination of analytical solutions for the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices is still an open issue.

Besides the calculus of the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices, it is important to emphasize that other challenges arise during the derivation of model expressions describing the algorithm behavior in steady state. As a consequence, the steady-state analysis of the NLMS algorithm has been addressed only in [7,22,23,25,26,29,30]; however, model expressions obtained in most of these research works focuses exclusively on the case of real-valued input data. For complex-valued input data, model expressions describing the steady-state algorithm behavior are derived only in [7] and [30]; nevertheless, neither [7] nor [30] present analytical expressions. In particular, the results presented in [7] require the determination of an expected value (e.g., see [7, (21.21)]) whose solution has not yet been determined in the literature. Likewise, expressions developed in [30] involve the calculus of the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices as well as the inverse of a full matrix (e.g., see [30, (15)]), for which solutions have not been provided. Therefore, for complex-valued input data, the derivation of analytical expressions describing the steady-state behavior of the NLMS algorithm remains an open issue.

In this context, focusing on the methodology devised in [20], the present research work aims to address the following goals:
                        
                           i)
                           to obtain model expressions (mean weight behavior, learning curve, and weight-error covariance matrix) for the NLMS algorithm operating under complex-valued data;

to determine analytical solutions for the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices considering complex-valued Gaussian input data;

to derive a model comprising both nonstationary and stationary environments;

to obtain analytical expressions describing the algorithm behavior in steady state;

to investigate how the algorithm parameters affect its performance in a nonstationary environment.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 revisits the NLMS algorithm and introduces the general formulation of the nonstationary environment considered. Section 3 derives the proposed model, from which an analysis of the steady-state algorithm behavior is also carried out. Still, some particular results for uncorrelated input data are presented in this section. Section 4 shows some simulation results in order to assess the accuracy of the model expressions. Finally, Section 5 presents remarks and conclusions of this research work.

This section revisits the general expressions of the NLMS algorithm considering complex-valued data, and introduces a brief description of the nonstationary environment used for the model development.

A fundamental feature of the adaptive filters is their capability to track variations in the underlying signal statistics, thus motivating the development of models that describe the algorithm tracking behavior. For such, a model based on a first-order Markov process is used [33]. This model states that the system to be identified (plant) undergoes random variations according to [6,7]

                         denotes a plant perturbation vector.

Note that the value of parameter α in (3) must be close to 1, implying that many iterations of the Markov model are required to produce a significant change in the plant weight vector [6]. Particularly, for 
                           α
                           =
                           1
                        , (3) reduces to the random-walk model commonly considered in the literature [5–7]; as a consequence, such a condition follows as a special case. Still, making 
                           α
                           =
                           1
                         and 
                           ϕ
                           (
                           n
                           )
                           =
                           0
                         ∀n in (3), the plant weight vector becomes time invariant and, hence, one returns to the special case of a stationary environment.

Now, having the expressions characterizing both the NLMS algorithm and the nonstationary environment considered at hand, we can proceed to the derivation of model expressions that describe the algorithm behavior. For such, the following assumptions are firstly stated:

However, the procedure to compute such an expected value [as well as those in (21) and (22)] requires the knowledge of the probability density function of the input data; therefore, as a consequence of assuming Gaussian input data (see Assumption A1), distinct solutions are obtained depending on whether the input data is complex- or real-valued [33]. Particularly, for the case of complex correlated Gaussian input data,

Therefore, from the model expression (4), along with (6) and the solution of the autocorrelation-like matrix

Therefore, from the model expressions (15)–(17), along with (8)–(12) and (25)–(33), the algorithm learning curve can be properly predicted for both nonstationary and stationary environments.

In this section, we firstly derive model expressions relating algorithm parameters with some performance metrics (namely, steady-state EMSE and misadjustment); afterwards, based on these expressions, we discuss important philosophical aspects about the steady-state algorithm behavior.

Concerning the steady-state EMSE, making

                            characteristic with respect to μ, since larger step-size values are required to properly track the variations of the plant. Therefore, we conclude that there exists a tradeoff between the estimation error, the lag error, and the step size.

                         where 1 represents an M-dimensional vector of 1's. Thereby, the model expressions describing the mean weight behavior, learning curve, and weight-error covariance matrix [i.e., (4), (15), and (25)] can also be used to predict the algorithm behavior under complex uncorrelated Gaussian input data.

Because of the particular structure of (45)–(48), a model expression for the steady-state EMSE can be determined [disregarding the approximation given in (39)] by substituting (45)–(48) into (38) and the resulting expression into (34), using the Sherman–Morrison identity [5, (6.59)], and making

                         Notice from (49) that the estimation error does not depend on the variance of the input data, thereby evidencing the immunity of the NLMS algorithm against variations in the input signal power in contrast to the LMS algorithm (see [6, (5.98)] or [7, (16.10)]). On the other hand, observe that the lag error (50) is directly proportional to

                        , which may compromise the algorithm performance if the input signal power reaches a very high value. Moreover, since (50) is also an increasing function of M and

                        , higher-order filters and/or plants that exhibit fast variations will lead to larger lag errors. Finally, except for the common term (

                           μ
                        ), we verify that (49) is directly proportional to μ while (50) is inversely proportional to μ, ratifying the existence of a tradeoff between the estimation error, the lag error, and the step size.

As discussed, under certain conditions, the steady-state EMSE curve is convex with respect to the step size (e.g., see Fig. 4). This fact indicates the existence of an optimum step size, i.e., a step-size value that leads to a minimum EMSE in steady state. For this case, an analytical expression for the optimum step size can be determined by substituting (49) and (50) into (41), differentiating it with respect to μ and equaling the resulting expression to zero, which yields

In this section, aiming to assess the accuracy of the proposed model, four examples are presented considering different operating scenarios, i.e., covering different types of plants with several lengths, distinct SNR values, and various eigenvalue spreads of the input autocorrelation matrix. In these examples, the results obtained from MC simulations (average of 200 independent runs) are compared with model predictions. For such examples, a zero-mean Gaussian input signal

                         [Fig. 6(b)], irrespective of the SNR value considered. Hence, in the next examples, one considers only the cases of 20 and 40 dB SNR. Also, notice from Fig. 6 that the model expression describing the steady-state MSE [i.e., (15) along with (41)–(43)] exhibit a very good match with the simulation results.

This example has two main goals, namely: i) to assess the accuracy of the model expressions describing the mean weight behavior (4), the learning curve (EMSE) (17), and the steady-state EMSE (41)–(43); and ii) to ratify our claim that under certain conditions there exists an optimum step size that leads to a minimum EMSE in steady state. For these purposes, we consider here a complex-valued plant

                        , respectively, while the remaining parameters are the same as in Example 1. Especially to achieve Goal ii), results predicted by (41)–(43) are compared with those obtained from MC simulations, averaging the last 100 EMSE values in steady state.

For this operating scenario, Fig. 8
                         depicts (for the sake of clarity) the mean behavior of the real [Fig. 8(a)] and imaginary [Fig. 8(b)] parts of four adaptive filter weights obtained through MC simulations and from the prediction model (4). (In Fig. 8, the case of 40 dB SNR has been omitted, since the results are very similar to 20 dB SNR.) From these figures, one observes a very good match between MC simulations and model predictions for both real and imaginary parts of the adaptive filter weights. In addition, Fig. 9
                         shows learning curves (EMSE) obtained by MC simulations and from the model expression (17), where a very good accuracy is also verified for both transient and steady-state phases.


                        Fig. 10
                         illustrates steady-state EMSE curves (obtained by MC simulations and prediction model) as a function of μ, confirming (under certain conditions) the existence of an optimum step-size value [see Fig. 10(b)]. Notice from this figure that the model expressions (34) and (38) exhibit a very good match with the results obtained from MC simulations even for larger step-size values. In contrast, due to the use of the approximation (39), a mismatch is verified between simulations and the results predicted from the analytical expressions (41)–(43) as the step-size value increases.

Here, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model under a more realistic operating scenario, two plants encountered in microwave communication systems are used. Such plants termed

                        , and three different step-size values are considered, i.e., 
                           μ
                           =
                           0.1
                        , 
                           μ
                           =

                        , and

                           =
                           0.5
                        . In addition, to verify the accuracy of the model expression describing the steady-state EMSE, results obtained from MC simulations (averaging the last 100 EMSE values in steady state) are compared with those predicted from the model expression (49).

For this operating scenario, Fig. 13
                         depicts learning curves (EMSE) obtained through MC simulations and from the proposed model, considering complex uncorrelated Gaussian input data. Notice again the very good accuracy achieved for the step-size values used. In addition, Fig. 14
                         shows the steady-state EMSE curves (as a function of μ) obtained by MC simulations and from the model expression (49) for both SNR values considered. From these figures, a very good match can also be observed even for step-size values close to the stability upper bound.

Based on the results previously presented, one can infer that the proposed model presents a very good accuracy under different operating conditions, i.e., taking into account several types of plant and lengths, a wide range of eigenvalue spreads of the input autocorrelation matrix, as well as different SNR and

In this paper, considering complex Gaussian input data, an analytical stochastic model for the NLMS algorithm operating under a nonstationary environment was presented, from which a model for a stationary environment follows as a special case. In contrast to other models from the literature that, in general, do not properly predict the algorithm transient phase, the proposed model accurately predicts the algorithm behavior in both transient and steady-state phases for a wide range of operating conditions. Such accuracy is mainly due to the minimal number of simplifying assumptions considered and the strategy used for computing the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices. Regarding these matrices, the approach adopted here preserves in the model the effect of the step size normalization, which is verified through a reduction in the eigenvalue spread of the normalized autocorrelation-like matrices. Moreover, expressions describing the steady-state EMSE, misadjustment, and the step size for the minimum EMSE are derived here. Based on these model expressions, important philosophical aspects of the NLMS algorithm operating under a nonstationary environment are discussed. Through simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed model was confirmed for both nonstationary and stationary environments. Lastly, taking into account the accuracy of the proposed model, one can conclude that the proposed model can be used to predict the algorithm behavior in several applications, avoiding the use of exhaustive MC simulations for tuning the algorithm parameters as well as for performance assessment.
