                  This paper resolves the complexity status of the well-known Traveling Repairman Problem on a line (Line-TRP) with general processing times at the request locations and deadline restrictions. It has long remained an open research question whether an exact solution procedure with pseudo-polynomial running time can be developed for this version of the Traveling Repairman Problem that was known to be at least binary

Since recent literature provides significant new results for further variants of the Line-TRP and the Line-TSP, a brief updated overview of the complexity status of the different variants is given. Another major contribution is that a practically applicable exact best-first search Branch&Bound approach that optimally solves instances of real-world size in reasonable time is proposed. By applying sophisticated dominance rules as well as lower bounds, the number of enumerated partial solutions is kept limited. The efficiency of the new approach and the applied instruments is validated by a computational study.
               
            

In this paper, the Line-Traveling Repairman Problem (Line-TRP) is considered. In the literature this problem is also known as the Delivery Man Problem or the Minimum Latency Problem (Luo, Qin, and Lim, 2014; Sitters, 2004). In this problem the pure delivery or pickup tour of a single vehicle has to be planned in order to minimize the total customer waiting time. If, however, the objective is to minimize the tour length or tour duration the Line-TRP becomes the Line-Traveling Salesman Problem (Line-TSP). In both problems (Line-TRP and Line-TSP) all customer locations to be visited are positioned along a single path where each location is unambiguously defined by its one-dimensional distance from a predefined starting point. While the general TSP and, therefore, also the TRP are strongly 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard (Garey and Johnson, 1979; Gutin and Punnen, 2007; Lawler, Lenstra, Rinnooy Kan, and Shmoys, 1985), this does not necessarily rule out the existence of strongly polynomial or pseudo polynomial solution approaches for the Line TRP or the Line TSP. Specifically, the complexity status of these problems mainly depends on the existence of time window constraints as well as whether processing times at the customer locations occur.

A complete overview of the complexity status of the different Line-TRP- as well as of corresponding Line-TSP-variants at that time can be found in Tsitsiklis (1992) and partly in De Paepe, Lenstra, Sgall, Sitters, and Stougie (2004). Based on the findings of Afrati, Cosmadakis, Papadimitriou, Papageorgiou, and Papakostantinou (1986), Tsitsiklis additionally resolved the complexity status of some other problem variants. However, since 1992 new significant results of the complexity status of Line-TSP- and Line-TRP-variants have been suggested in the literature. An updated overview is provided in Table 1
                     . One major contribution of this paper is that it resolves the complexity status of the Line-TRP-variant with general processing times at the customer locations as well as with hard due date restrictions. Since a violation of these hard due dates is not allowed, we use the term deadline. Originally, Afrati et al. (1986) showed that the simpler variant with deadlines but zero processing times is already binary 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard. This obviously also applies to the considered extended problem variant. Afrati et al. (1986) additionally developed an exact Dynamic Programming procedure with pseudo-polynomial running time for the simpler variant with zero processing times. However, whether such an algorithm for the considered problem exists is unknown (Tsitsiklis, 1992). For this reason, it has long remained an open question whether the problem is strongly 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard.

The considered variant of the Line-Traveling Repairman Problem with general processing times at the customer locations and deadlines has various practical applications. It is, for instance, applicable whenever geographical restrictions cause transportation processes to be executed along a predefined transportation path and deliveries have to be made before given deadlines. Such kinds of predefined transportation paths may occur if the delivery process is executed in specific regions, for example along a coastline, a mountain road, or in a valley. Another typical application scenario is inland shipping along a river where cargo has to be delivered to specific ports within given time restrictions. In order to maximize provided service quality, the total weighted waiting time at the ports is minimized (Psaraftis, Solomon, Magnanti, and Kim, 1990; Tsitsiklis, 1992).

Furthermore, an application of the Line-TRP is possible if a time-critical production system has to be supplied in real-time with various materials. In order to guarantee efficient and safe transportation that fulfills existing time restrictions, these processes are often executed along predetermined transportation paths using tow trains (cf. Emde and Boysen, 2012; Emde, Fliedner, and Boysen, 2012). The resulting tour planning problem is a Line-TRP with individual station-dependent processing times and deadlines that result from a given production program. Since the available storage space at the assembly line is strictly limited, minimizing the resulting inventory levels at the production stations is pursued by applying the Line-TRP. Moreover, the considered Line-TRPTW variant can also be applied to scheduling problems of time-critical batch processes with specific sequence-dependent setup times. If these setup times are proportional to bridged machine state differences, each machine state is represented by a location and jobs are defined as requests (Bock and Klamroth, 2013; Pinedo, 2008). Furthermore, hard time restrictions are modeled as request deadlines.

This paper provides two major contributions for the Line-TRP with general processing times at the request locations and hard due date restrictions (also denoted as deadlines):

                           The Line-Traveling Repairman Problem with general processing times and deadlines is proven to be strongly

                              -hard.

A new practically applicable Branch&Bound algorithm that generates optimal solutions for the considered problem is proposed. By applying various specifically designed lower bounds and dominance rules, this algorithm solves problem instances of real-world size in reasonable time.

The outline of the paper is as follows: First, a mathematical definition of the problem is provided in Section 2. Subsequently, the complexity proof that shows that the considered problem variant is strongly

                     -hard is presented in Section 3. In order to solve the problem, a new best-first search Branch&Bound procedure is introduced in Section 4. The practicability of the exact procedure is validated by a computational study in Section 5. A brief summary of the findings, conclusions, and suggestions for future research is provided in Section 6.

The following reduction generates a specific tour scheduling problem with two groups of requests that have to be delivered. The first group consists of 3q small requests that represent the elements of 3-PARTITION. These small requests have a uniform processing time of L time units, but do not have a deadline. The second group comprises 
                        
                           q
                           ·

                      large requests altogether with a significantly larger uniform processing time of M ≫ L time units. Note that, due to M ≫ L, the urgency of the large requests requires that these large requests be delivered in a fixed sequence that is depicted in Fig. 1
                     . This sequence of requests forces the vehicle to move along the entire path from the first to the last location in each of the q cyclical rounds. In each round 
                        
                           (

                      large requests are delivered while the tour passes by the delivery locations of the 3q small requests of the first group. If no small request is serviced during these rounds, the large requests that are delivered during the lth round are serviced exactly

                      time units before their deadline. Therefore, in order to reach a total completion time that is below a carefully chosen threshold, this slack time has to be completely used for servicing the 3L small requests during the L tours.

Note that the considered instance of the Line-TRP is designed such that scheduling the delivery of a small request

                     . Note that, due to dominance of the processing time of the large requests, this detour is necessary in order to keep the resulting total completion time below a predetermined threshold. Moreover, the tight deadlines of the large requests allow for the delivery of, at most, 3 · l small requests up to the end of round l. As mentioned above, the generated structure of the delivery locations of the large requests ensures that the durations of the necessary detours strictly increase from round to round. Specifically, the detour for servicing request

                      is defined in such a way that it can be fulfilled only if the total detour in each preceding round 
                        
                           j

                      coincides with 2 · j · B or if the resulting total completion time is not below the predetermined threshold. Hence, it can be concluded that the problem of finding a feasible tour that possesses a total completion time below the predefined threshold is equivalent to generating a feasible solution of 3-PARTITION. Specifically, the respective sets of three chosen small requests that are delivered in an identical round define a feasible solution of the given instance of 3-PARTITION, and vice versa. The details of this reduction are given in the proof of the following Theorem:

                           M is integral for all q ∈ IN. The chosen values of the parameters M, L, and B ensure a strict hierarchy in the objective function. Specifically, for the occurring values, a larger multiplier of parameter M cannot be evened out by reduced multipliers of the parameters B and L. Analogously, a larger multiplier of L cannot be compensated for by smaller multipliers of B. Note that this strict hierarchy results from the fact that the defined values of M and L are computed by deriving an upper bound of the total completion time of an instance that corresponds to a perfect partition. This is carried out in the proof of Lemma 3.2. Conversely, in order to be able to identify those schedules that correspond to perfect partitions solely by their total completion time value (see the proof of Lemma 3.3), this upper bound and the defined values of M and L have to be tight. Note further that, due to the dominances of these parameters, the structure of the schedule is considerably simplified. This leads to the mentioned fixed sequence of the large requests and allows for the conclusion that at most 3 · l small requests are serviced up to the end of round l. Due to their restrictive deadlines, the large requests have to be scheduled into q rounds with

If there is a solution of P(Φ) with a total completion time strictly less than Cmax
                            then Φ has a perfect partition.

We assume that S(Φ) is a feasible tour with a total completion time strictly less than

                     . Consequently, the number of small requests that are delivered during the first l rounds is upper bounded by 3 · l.    (Claim 2)□


                     Claim 3. There are exactly 3 · l small requests that are delivered in the first l rounds. This proposition is shown by deriving a lower bound of the total completion time of tour S(Φ) that proves that if there are less than three small requests per round the resulting total completion time is not strictly lower than

                     Clearly, if there are exactly three requests per round a simple lower bound of the total completion time of the small requests can be derived by summing up the time that is necessary to deliver the previously scheduled large requests. Specifically, for the three small requests that are delivered in round l we have a minimum delay by the preceding rounds of

                     . Furthermore, we have to add a total processing time at the visited delivery locations of small requests. This total processing time amounts, at least, to

                      tour schedule S(Φ) provides a feasible solution for the corresponding instance of 3-PARTITION. (Lemma 3.3)
                     □

Therefore, both problems are equivalent. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.1.

                        Observation 3.4
                        The feasibility problem of the Line-TRP with general processing times and deadlines is binary 
                              
                                 N
                                 P
                              
                           -hard.

Since the feasibility problem of the Line-TRP with general processing times and deadlines is equivalent to the feasibility problem of the Line-TSP with general processing times and deadlines, the proposition follows directly from the results presented in Bock and Klamroth (2013).□

Note that it is still an open research question whether the feasibility problem of the Line-TRP or Line-TSP with general processing times and deadlines can be decided in pseudo-polynomial time. If this problem is proven to be strongly 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard the complexity status of the Line-TSP variant with general processing times and deadlines would also be resolved. As indicated in Table 1, it remains an open research question as to whether there is a pseudo-polynomial solution approach for this problem.

This section introduces a new best-first Branch&Bound procedure. It solves the Line-TRP with deadlines and general processing times to optimality. According to the mathematical definition of the problem in Section 2, (partial) schedulesα that are explored by this procedure are stored as partial sequences of requests that are assigned to their final position.

In what follows, a formal definition of a (partial) schedule is provided. We assume that all requests are sorted according to non-decreasing deadlines, i.e., it holds that ∀i < j ∈ SN
                     : di
                      ≤ dj
                     . Moreover, if it holds that i < j and

                           . Therefore, schedule β can be fathomed since all schedules that are subsequently enumerated in the corresponding subtree are dominated by solutions considered in the subtree starting at schedule α.□

The following dominance criterion allows us to reduce the number of enumerated assignments at the last position f(α) of a currently considered schedule α. Specifically, two cases that allow for the exclusion of dominated requests are derived.

We first directly compare the completion times of the requests i and j in both schedules αf
                            and β. Specifically, schedule β completes the service of the request i exactly

                            completes the delivery of request j. Moreover, schedule β completes the service of request j at least t
                           
                              j, i

                            completes the service of request i. Therefore, according to the sum of the completion times of the considered requests i and j, we observe an improvement of at least

                     . A minimum makespan is obtained by delivering k requests along this tour with minimal processing times. Clearly, if request h does not belong to these k requests the makespan of the currently considered tour is not minimal since the detour to location xh
                      is not necessary.

A second lower bound results from optimally solving a derived instance of the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) (see Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin, 1993; Burkard, DellÁmico, and Martello, 2012; Harold and Kuhn, 1955). Assignment costs in this instance are defined by the minimum completion time of unscheduled requests that are assigned to the vacant schedule positions. Specifically, a lower bound of the resulting completion time

A third lower bound arises by optimally solving a relaxed variant of the considered Line-TRP instance. This variant ignores processing times of the requests at their delivery locations, i.e., it defines 
                        
                           
                              p
                              i
                           
                           =
                           0
                           ,
                           ∀
                           i
                           ∈
                           
                              S
                              N
                           
                        
                     . However, deadlines of the requests are reduced by subtracting the respective original processing times. This leads to the well-known variant of the Line-TRP that, although proven to be already binary 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard, can be efficiently solved by a pseudo-polynomial algorithm (see Afrati et al. 1986 as well as Table 1). Consequently, the objective function value of the generated optimal solution provides a lower bound of the considered problem that includes request processing times at the delivery locations.

In order to compute the third lower bound in each node, the Dynamic Programming procedure proposed by Afrati et al. (1986) is applied. If this procedure does not result in a feasible solution, the original partial problem is not solvable as well and the respective node is fathomed. After being generated, the schedule that is found by the Dynamic Programming procedure is tested to find out whether it still fulfills all deadlines after integrating the given request processing times. If so and the schedule additionally outperforms the best currently known solution, it is stored as a candidate for an optimal solution. Consequently, the application of the third lower bound allows the generation of upper bounds during the best-first enumeration process.

In what follows, the efficiency of the introduced Branch&Bound approach is validated. Specifically, the effectiveness of the proposed dominance rules as well as of the lower bounds is analyzed in detail. For this purpose, this section provides a brief introduction of the utilized test environment, the generated test instances, and the applied versions of the Branch&Bound approach.

The different Branch&Bound variants were coded in C
                           
                              +
                              +
                           
                        . Each variant is characterized by an individual set of dominance rules as well as of lower bounds that are activated. Based on the respective numbers of lower bounds (L) as well as of dominance rules (D) that are activated, the applied variants of the Branch&Bound procedure are simply denoted as B&B-L1D1, B&B-L13D1, B&B-L13D12, B&B-L13D123a, B&B-L13D123, and B&B-L123D123. Note that, besides the lower bounds 1 and 3 as well as the dominance rules 1 and 2, the variant B&B-L13D123a checks only the first (much simpler) case of the third dominance criterion. All computational tests were conducted on an Intel Core i7-3770 with Ivy-Bridge and 3.4 GHz CPU that is equipped with 32GB working memory.

In order to evaluate the performance of the different Branch&Bound versions, various test instances were randomly generated. Depending on the number of requests to be serviced, the number of delivery locations, the tightness of the request deadlines, and the significance of request processing times at the delivery locations, these instances were clustered into different groups. Since we set 
                           
                              
                                 t
                                 u
                              
                              =
                              
                                 t
                                 d
                              
                              =
                              1
                           
                         in all test instances, travel durations solely result from randomly drawing the positions of the predetermined number of delivery locations out of the equally distributed integer interval [0, 2000].

After the generation of the delivery locations we assign a first request to each location. Subsequently, in case of N > L, all remaining requests are randomly assigned to the L locations. Consequently, the average travel time

Based on the generated requests and delivery locations, corresponding deadlines are determined by simulating 100 randomly generated tours. Each of these tours starts at the location of the initial dummy request that is randomly drawn beforehand. In each subsequent iteration the next visited customer is randomly drawn out of at most 10 unserviced requests with a minimal direct completion time. For a partial schedule α this direct completion time of an unserviced request j ∈ Su

                        ) are combined with the three deadline and two processing time scenarios. As a result, 42 problem groups, which respectively comprise 10 instances, are generated. In the conducted 420 tests the running time per instance is limited to at most 6 hours (i.e., to 21,600 seconds). After the elapse of these 6 hours the algorithm switches to a heuristic state that prefers considering schedules with a minimum total completion time per assigned requests in order to attain first solutions earlier. Clearly, due to the 
                           
                              N

                        -hardness of the feasibility variant of the considered problem (see Observation 3.4), the heuristic state can neither guarantee finding a feasible solution nor prove that such a solution does not exist. Furthermore, since the Branch&Bound approach (also in the heuristic state) terminates when a first completed solution is taken from the heap of partial schedules, the optimality of the found schedule is no longer proven.

In this section, we directly compare the results of the six implemented Branch&Bound procedures for the 420 instances that are clustered into 42 problem groups. Each group is characterized by a tuple (N, L, D, P). The parameters N and L give the predetermined numbers of generated requests and locations, respectively. D ∈ {T, M, R} defines the deadline structure (introduced in Section 5.1) that is either tight (
                           
                              D

                        ). Finally, the parameter P ∈ {M, S} determines the relative size of the processing times at the request locations. If it holds that

Note that the used abbreviation “N.a.” (not applicable) indicates that a problem group cannot be explored due to memory problems. Since not all instances were solved to optimality after 6 hours in each group, two average time values are given. While the first value gives the average computation time of the respective version over all 10 instances, the second value excludes instances that were not solved to optimality by all versions. Consequently, without being distorted by unsolved instances, the second value illustrates the relative dominance of the best Branch&Bound version more clearly. Note that we denote an instance as (optimally) solved only if the applied procedure has been able to completely explore the solution space of the considered instance. By doing so, the optimality of the generated solution is proven or it is proven that the considered problem is unsolvable.

By analyzing the results of Table 2, it becomes obvious that if a given instance possesses considerable complexity, best average results are attained by applying the Branch&Bound version B&B-L123D123. This version uses all bounds and dominance rules that are introduced in Section 4. Specifically, apart from some problem groups with a moderate complexity, B&B-L123D123 significantly outperforms all other procedures for the majority of more complex instances. Therefore, if B&B-L123D123 does not solve an instance to optimality within 21,600 seconds, no tested version was successful. In contrast, B&B-L123D123 was able to optimally solve various complex instances that were not solved to optimality by all other variants. For instance, while B&B-L13D12, B&B-L13D123a, and B&B-L13D123 only solve 4 of 10 experiments of group (60,60,M,S) to optimality, B&B-L123D123 solves five further instances within the given time limit. All in all, B&B-L123D123 proves the optimality of the generated tour in 382 of 420 cases, while the other variants B&B-L13D123, B&B-L13D123a, and B&B-L13D12 solve only 327, 323, and 308 instances to optimality, respectively.

Therefore, by applying sophisticated bounds and dominance rules, problem instances of real-world size can be solved to optimality in reasonable time by B&B-L123D123. Furthermore, detailed analyses of the measured results indicate that a considerable amount of computational time is frequently utilized to prove that the best found schedule is optimal. Therefore, it can be conjectured that B&B-L123D123 also provides almost optimal solutions of the 38 remaining instances that are not enumerated completely. This is underscored by the fact that the relative improvement of the average objective function value attained by B&B-L123D123 in direct comparison to the second best variant B&B-L13D123 is comparable with instances where B&B-L123D123 is solely able to prove optimality. Moreover, in comparison to the second best procedure B&B-L13D123, the average running time was significantly reduced for almost all experiment groups with a considerable complexity. These improvements can be ascribed to the fact that the activation of the second lower bound was able to tighten the average lower bound values by approximately 10 percent. While the first lower bound does not provide competitive results (this bound was outperformed by approximately 90 percent on the average), the average difference between the third and the second bound increases with larger problem sizes as well as with larger processing times. The latter effect can be ascribed to the fact that unlike the second bound, the third lower bound does not cover the impact of larger processing times on the optimal tour. Note that the third lower bound only reduces the request deadlines accordingly, but the applied relaxation assumes a zero handling time at the delivery locations. Hence, the average gap between the lower bounds two and three increases to approximately 12 percent for the most complex experiment group (60,60,R,S). In comparison to the two other bounds, the first lower bound does not provide competitive results. Specifically, this bound was outperformed by approximately 90 percent on the average.

By significantly tightening the applied lower bound values, B&B-L123D123 generates a sequence of partial solutions on the priority heap that more reliably estimates the quality of the solutions of underlying subtrees. For complex problems, therefore, the number of explored partial solutions is between 5 to almost 17 times larger if B&B-L13D123 is applied instead of B&B-L123D123. In direct comparison to B&B-L13D123, larger running times of B&B-L123D123 for solving less complex instances result from the significant computational effort (
                           
                              O
                              (
                              
                                 N
                                 2
                              
                              ·
                              
                                 L
                                 2
                              
                              +
                              
                                 N
                                 3
                              
                              )
                           
                         (see Section 4)) of the second lower bound. In these cases the reduced number of enumerated partial solutions does not yet prevail against the increased computational effort for handling each partial solution.

Apart from the indicated relevance of the second lower bound for solving complex instances, the application of the second dominance criterion is of particular importance. By comparing the results of the versions B&B-L13D1 and B&B-L1D1 with the results of the other approaches, it becomes obvious that the deactivation of the second dominance criterion leads to substantial memory problems. This already applies to the experiment groups of lowest complexity. Specifically, a detailed analysis of the results of B&B-L13D1 and B&B-L13D12 for the smallest experiment groups with 40 requests and locations reveals that the average number of explored partial solutions is 178–382 times larger if the rule is deactivated. This clearly shows that the application of the second dominance criterion is a prerequisite for ensuring the practicability of the Branch&Bound approach. It obviously avoids a repeated enumeration of a huge number of partial solutions with an identical set of assigned requests. Due to considerable memory problems, the versions B&B-L13D1 and B&B-L13D12, that do not apply the second dominance criterion, solve only a few instances with more than 40 requests.

Compared to the second dominance rule, the impact of the third dominance criterion is substantially smaller. However, although its computation requires the additional effort of 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              
                                 N
                                 2
                              
                              ·
                              L
                              )
                              ,
                           
                         the positive consequences of this rule are also significant. Note that this applies to both cases of the rule. By comparing the attained results of B&B-L13D123 with the ones of versions B&B-L13D12 and B&B-L13D123a, considerable reductions of the number of enumerated partial solutions can be observed if the third dominance rule is additionally applied and includes both cases. By activating the complex second case of the third dominance criterion, B&B-L13D123 considerably outperforms B&B-L13D123a. Specifically, it attains speedups of more than 20 percent of the average running time for instances that were optimally solvable by at least one approach. In comparison to B&B-L13D12 (that deactivates the dominance criterion completely), this speedup was further increased to almost 30 percent. Due an increased usage of the first case of the rule, B&B-L13D123 attained the most significant improvements compared to B&B-L13D12 for solving instance groups with a larger N/L-ratio (e.g., for the experiment groups with 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              60
                              ,
                           
                        
                        
                           
                              L
                              =
                              30
                              ,
                              40
                           
                        ). The simultaneous application of both rules (implemented in B&B-L13D123 and B&B-L123D123) is most effective for these instance groups, since a larger N/L-ratio makes the applicability of the first case more likely.

As indicated by the results of Table 2, the average complexity of the generated instances approximately increases with a more relaxed deadline structure and with a larger ratio of average processing time divided by average travel time. This complexity increase can mainly be ascribed to the fact that, in these cases, a considerably smaller number of possible schedules can be fathomed because of deadline violations. Moreover, larger relative request processing times may increase the possibility that the optimal tour comprises a larger number of turnarounds. Therefore, the exploration process has to enumerate a substantially larger number of possible tours that, otherwise, would have been fathomed in early steps. Consequently, largest average computational times are observed for the instances with a relaxed deadline structure and significant processing times (i.e., the last listed experiment groups that are denoted as (60, 30, R, S), (60, 40, R, S), (60, 50, R, S), and (60, 60, R, S)). Since the efficiency of the various proposed lower bounds and dominance rules obviously increases with the complexity of the solved instances, B&B-L123D123 significantly outperforms other versions the most for these experiment groups.

In order to further evaluate the competitiveness of the proposed Branch&Bound algorithms, the performance of B&B-L123D123 is additionally compared with CPLEX 12.6. In order to do so, the MIP model of the considered Line-TRP variant was built by using the concert library for C
                           
                              +
                              +
                           
                        . The formulation of the MIP-model that is solved by CPLEX 12.6 is based on 
                           
                              0.5
                              ·
                              (
                              
                                 N
                                 2
                              
                              −
                              N
                              )
                           
                         binary sequencing variables and N continuous variables defining the completion times of the requests (Manne, 1960; Roshanaei, Azab, and ElMaraghy, 2013). However, preliminary tests indicated that the test instances of the considered 42 problem groups are much too complex to be optimally solved by CPLEX 12.6 in reasonable time. Therefore, as depicted in Table 3
                        , a second set of smaller sized instances was generated and solved by B&B-L123D123 and CPLEX 12.6. This set consists of 12 additional problem groups with 10 instances each. Depending on the respective problem group, each instance possesses 30 requests that are positioned at 20 or 30 locations. Analogous to the first set of 42 problem groups, the due date structure of the requests are either tight, moderate, or relaxed while delivery times are either moderate or significant. The available running time per instance was not limited.

It is worth mentioning that CPLEX 12.6 simultaneously executes 8 threads that use the processing power of the 4 cores of the Intel Core i7-3770 efficiently by hyper-threading. Since B&B-L123D123 uses only a single thread, this setting considerably benefits CPLEX.

Despite this significant disadvantage, the results in Table 3 show that B&B-L123D123 substantially outperforms CPLEX 12.6 for all tested instances. Due to the application of sophisticated bounds and dominance criteria, the average running time of the Branch&Bound approach is smaller than or equal to 2 seconds for all problem groups. Most of the instances were solved to optimality by B&B-L123D123 in less than 1 second while the longest computation took 14 seconds. In contrast to this, the performance of CPLEX is much worse. Due to excessive memory consumption, CPLEX is even unable to optimally solve the problems of the five groups 8–12. Particularly, the relaxed due date structure of the problem groups 9–12 leads to an increased complexity that was not manageable by CPLEX. Furthermore, for the optimally solved problem groups 1–7, the average running time of CPLEX was between 1,975 and 1,008,059 times larger in comparison to B&B-L123D123. For instance, CPLEX needs between 76 minutes and more than 68 hours to optimally solve the instances of problem group 7, while B&B-L123D123 optimally solved each of these problems in at most 1 second. Therefore, the application of CPLEX 12.6 is strongly limited to smaller sized instances, while B&B-L123D123 can be used to optimally solve instances with up to 60 requests and 60 locations in reasonable time. This additionally underscores the competitiveness of the proposed Branch&Bound approach.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper resolves the complexity status of the well-known Traveling Repairman Problem on a line with general processing times at the request locations and deadlines. This had remained an open research question for a long time. In the paper, the problem variant is found to be strongly 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard. Therefore, there is no exact solution procedure with strongly polynomial or pseudo-polynomial running time possible unless it holds that 
                        
                           N
                           P
                           =
                           P
                        
                     . Apart from this significant result, the paper proposes the first known practically applicable exact solution approach. The best performing Branch&Bound variant B&B-L123D123 is able to solve instances with up to 60 requests and locations to optimality despite relaxed deadline restrictions and considerable processing times. The practicability of the Best-First Branch&Bound approach is attained by the application of various specifically designed lower bounds and dominance rules. Although their application may cause significant computational effort, the resulting reductions of the number of explored partial solutions result in considerable speedups particularly for complex problem instances.

While the results of the paper contribute to a better understanding of specific Line-TSP and Line-TRP-variants, there are still various open research questions. As indicated in the overview of Table 3, a very interesting question still open for research is the complexity status of the Line-TRP variant without any time restrictions but with general processing times at request locations. This problem is equivalent to the Tree-TRP where each request location is connected to the single path with an edge half the length of the respective request processing time. Such trees are denoted as caterpillars (Sitters, 2004). Up to now, the question whether this problem can be solved to optimality in strongly or at least pseudo-polynomial time or whether it is 
                        
                           N
                           P
                        
                     -hard remains open. Furthermore, future research should be also devoted to the generation of robust tour plans. Note that in real-world applications, travel times may change due to congestions (Bock, 2010; Larsen, Madsen, and Solomon, 2007). Hence, the quality of a generated tour plan does not solely result from its total customer waiting time in an average case scenario, but rather has to additionally integrate robustness issues. Specifically, the plan has to integrate adequate time buffers in order to avoid deadline violations. For this purpose, the considered problem model has to be extended accordingly.
