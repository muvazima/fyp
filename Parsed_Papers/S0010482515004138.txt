@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

When tissue damage impairs the function of an organ, transplantation is one option. Nevertheless, in Europe alone about ten people die every day while waiting for a transplantable organ [1,2]. The waiting list of the Eurotransplant International Foundation (which spans seven European countries) includes about 15,000 transplant candidates [1]. In the United States, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, as of August 21, 2015, 133,602 people are waiting for a transplantable organ; in contrast, the number of donors was of about 6000 in 2015, and 14,400 in 2014 [3].

Transplantable organ shortage motivates research in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Tissue engineers combine methods of cell biology, polymer chemistry and engineering to build three-dimensional (3D) constructs suitable for replacing or repairing damaged tissues [4,5]. On the long term, tissue engineering aims to build functional organs, thereby solving the problem of transplantable organ shortage [6].

Understanding the principles of morphogenesis is indispensable for developing efficient strategies in tissue engineering. In this endeavor, computational methods proved valuable in pointing out dominant morphogenetic mechanisms [7]. Random walk, Monte Carlo and particle dynamics algorithms have been used to simulate rearrangements of cells in vitro and in vivo 
                     [8]. Monte Carlo models of cellular resolution [8–10], although unable to account for tissue rheology, were able to simulate shape changes of artificially assembled multicellular systems. Among these, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations proved especially successful in predicting multicellular rearrangements in bioprinted tissue constructs made of heterotypic cell aggregates [9]. The kinetic Monte Carlo approach was recently extended to address the time evolution of a bioprinted vascular network [10], an important problem of bottom-up tissue engineering. Based on a careful calibration of the time scale [9], kinetic Monte Carlo simulations predicted the time course of the emergence of branched tubes made of endothelial and smooth-muscle cells [10].

Using the CompuCell3D modeling environment (based on the Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model, also known as the cellular Potts model), Thomas et al. [11] simulated the fusion of two contiguous multicellular aggregates and pointed out the role of individual cell motility in this process. To simulate cell invasiveness in the context of a two-dimensional wound healing assay, Scianna proposed and extension of the Glazier–Graner–Hogeweg model, in which cells are represented as a set of three subcellular compartments (nucleus, cytosol and plasma membrane), moving on substrates covered by collagen fibers of various architectures [12]. Tissue fusion was simulated also by a model that takes into account the resistance of cells to shape changes, cell adhesion, drag forces, and active forces exerted by adjacent cells [13].

A wide variety of multicellular systems are viscoelastic, behaving as elastic solids on short timescales (seconds) and highly viscous fluids on long timescales (hours) [13–15]. Tissue rheology is well captured by several computational models [13,16–18]. A detailed model of subcellular viscoelasticity [16] proved able to describe individual cells, as well as cell populations in interaction with the extracellular matrix. In this model, a cell is composed of subcellular elements (nodes) that represent the plasma membrane, viscoelastic elements that represent the cytoskeleton, and nodes bound by viscoelastic elements that represent the cell nucleus. The model incorporates cell growth, cell division, cell death and cell adhesion. It was used to simulate relevant morphogenetic phenomena involving hundreds of cells [16]. The subcellular element model (ScEM) [17,18] views cells as a set of nodes (subcellular elements) subject to pairwise interactions described by an effective potential. Nodes represent micrometer-sized volume elements of the cytoskeleton, whereas the interaction potential describes forces mediated by protein filaments that connect neighboring volume elements. The potential describes short range attraction, as well as repulsion at short distances, accounting for volume exclusion. Nodes located on the interface between two different cells are also subject to an intercellular interaction potential, which accounts for cell adhesion. The ScEM also incorporates cell growth, cell division and active forces exerted by cells, being suitable to simulate morphogenetic phenomena involving thousands of cells [18]. A recent model of cellular resolution [19] captures tissue plasticity in simulations of epithelial layers made of hundreds of cells. In this model, cells are represented as point-particles able to establish bonds with their neighbors. Unlike radial interactions, these bonds are able to transmit non-central forces and torques; moreover, they are dynamic.

Individual-based computational models enable us to study morphogenesis and tissue biomechanics. Certain tissue engineering applications, however, do not require the level of detail offered by individual-based models. A typical tissue construct consists of 
                        
                           
                              10

                        −
                        
                           
                              10
                           
                           
                              9
                           
                        
                      cells. Therefore, the focus is on the shape changes of the construct rather than on the movement or shape changes of individual cells. Moreover, on the timescale of interest in tissue engineering (days) many biological tissues behave as viscous fluids. Hence, in a first approximation, the viscoelasticity of cells and tissues, which is manifest at timescales of minutes, may be omitted if we aim to describe the evolution of a tissue construct.

As an alternative to individual-based models, our group developed a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model of a multicellular system placed in cell culture medium [20]. Since it describes evolution in terms of distribution functions, the LB method does not impose a limit on the number of constituent cells. Recently proposed phase field models of multicellular aggregate fusion also present this advantage [21].

The LB model of Ref. [20] describes the multicellular system as a highly viscous, incompressible fluid, whereas the embedding medium (i.e. cell culture medium) is modeled as the vapour phase of the fluid. To validate the LB approach, we simulated the sidewise fusion of two multicellular cylinders and, for a certain range of model parameters, we observed a qualitative agreement with experimental results regarding the fusion of multicellular spheroids [20]. We are unaware of quantitative experiments on the fusion of two contiguous multicellular cylinders, which would allow a quantitative calibration of our LB model.

The analogy between multicellular systems and viscous fluids is justified by the differential adhesion hypothesis proposed by Steinberg, which states that cells seek positions that enable them to establish the largest possible number of strong bonds with their neighbors [14,22]. Thus, a system made of cohesive cells behaves as a highly viscous fluid, and, therefore, it can be characterized by physical quantities such as surface tension and viscosity [15,23].

Mesoscale modeling techniques, such as dissipative particle dynamics and the LB method, are being employed to describe a wide variety of flow phenomena in biological systems, and are viewed as powerful in silico tools in biomedical research, able to facilitate the development of new therapies [24].

In this paper we extend our LB model to treat two components of different viscosities and simulate the time evolution of certain tissue constructs (tubes and sheets) of interest in tissue engineering. The model extension is necessary in order to treat multicellular systems embedded in a supportive hydrogel, a configuration encountered in bioprinting – an emergent tissue engineering technique, in which multicellular spheroids, or cylinders, are deposited by a 3D printer, along with a hydrogel that provides mechanical support until the construct becomes sturdy [25–27].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the mathematical details of the extended LB model and the methods used to analyze the results of simulations, Section 3 presents computer simulations of the evolution of bioprinted tubes and patches made of cohesive cells, Section 4 discusses the results in the view of 3D printing experiments and Section 5 presents the conclusions of the work.

To simulate tissue fusion in a viscous environment, we developed a finite difference Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for a system made of two components of different viscosities; both components describe a highly viscous, incompressible fluid.

First we briefly describe the model of Ref. [20], then we point out the extensions proposed here.

We discretize the LB equations on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice phase space [28–31]. For a system made of two different particle species, labelled by the index

Nevertheless, the numerical scheme used to solve the LB equations might influence the results of the simulation by introducing spurious terms, which alter the physical values [37–39].

Our parallel simulation code was written in PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) [46]. For 104 iterations on a lattice of 400×400 nodes, typical computation times were of the order of three hours on a cluster of 8 AMD Opteron 2.26GHz processors.

Snapshots of the model system at various stages of the simulations are shown as grayscale images, in which white (black) regions represent structures made of cells (hydrogel).

To assess the size of the emergent structures, we analyzed the snapshots using Image J [47]. The reference size, which serves as a scale bar in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 5 is the diameter of the white disks in the initial configurations (panels a). These disks depict the transversal cross sections of multicellular cylinders used in bioprinting experiments, of about 0.5mm in diameter [27].

We computed the mean area, A, of the white disks, in pixels. Then, we calculated the radius of a disk in units of pixel size, and we estimated one pixel size as

                           mm
                        .

To compute the area of each white disk from an initial configuration, such as the one shown in Fig. 1
                        (a), we first obtained the negative of the image using the “Edit 
                           →
                         Invert” command; then, we set the threshold by the “Image 
                           →
                         Adjust 
                           →
                         Threshold 
                           →
                         Auto” command, and obtained the numbers of constituent pixels for each disk via the “Analyze 
                           →
                         Analyze Particles” command.

Final configurations were analyzed similarly, except when the regions of interest were dark (such as in Fig. 5(b)–(f)), when “Edit 
                           →
                         Invert” was not necessary.

In experiments [27], tubular structures emerged by the fusion of contiguous, parallel cylinders printed in a hexagonal arrangement. Six disks in contact, as shown in Fig. 1(a), represent the initial state of the LB simulation of the time course of the system׳s transversal cross section. The other panels of Fig. 1 depict successive snapshots of the simulation. The supplementary movie sm1.mp4 presents this process, with successive frames taken at every 5000 iterations. The frame rates of the movies are described in the Supplementary Material.

To study the result of imprecise printing that leads to a defect in the early stages of fusion, we considered two of the cylinders slightly misplaced, as shown in cross section in Fig. 2
                     (a), and simulated fusion for

                     Fig. 3
                      shows the results of a simulation of the cross section of a cell patch obtained by contiguously laying down multicellular cylinders on a planar, non-adherent surface such as an agarose bed.


                     Fig. 4
                      plots the cell density in a transversal cross section of the sheet-like structure of Fig. 3 for three stages of the simulation. Different markers correspond to simulations that differ by the value of the viscosity ratio, r; other model parameters are given in the second paragraph of this section.


                     Fig. 5
                      suggests a simple way of creating a perfusable tissue construct from several layers of contiguous multicellular cylinders placed on top of each other (Fig. 5(a)). Supplementary movie sm3.mp4 shows the evolution of this system.

The dark disks from Fig. 5 represent the transversal cross sections of cell-free cylinders that may be turned into perfusable channels by removing the hydrogel from them by chemical or physical means [26,27].

As explained in “Methods”, using ImageJ [47], we estimated the cross-sectional areas of the channels (dark disks on Fig. 5(b)–(f)), as well as of the multicellular cylinders before fusion (white disks on Fig. 5(a)). From the mean value of the latter we found that the radius of an initial cylinder is 23.9 pixels. This corresponds to about 0.25mm in bioprinting experiments [27], so one pixel from Fig. 5(a) corresponds to about

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We simulated shape changes of multicellular structures embedded in a hydrogel. To simulate the evolution of a system of parallel cylinders that were initially in contact along a generator, we developed a 2D LB model. Such simulations describe the evolution of the transversal cross section of a 3D system of infinite cylinders. We assumed that they are relevant for systems built of cylinders whose length is about two orders of magnitude larger than their diameter, as employed in bioprinting experiments [27].

In experiments, cylinders of pig smooth muscle cells were deposited in a hexagonal arrangement by the bioprinter (see Fig. 5 of Ref. [27]). The transversal cross section of the bioprinted construct was similar to Fig. 1(a). Within about three days, post-printing tissue fusion gave rise to a multicellular tube with an outer diameter of 1.5mm and inner diameter of 0.5mm [27]. Assuming that a white disk of Fig. 1(a) represents the transversal cross section of a multicellular cylinder of 0.5mm (as used in experiments), in the simulation of Fig. 1 the fusion of adjacent cylinders gave rise to a tube with an outer diameter of 1.44mm and an inner diameter of 0.62mm (measurements done using the “Straight Line” tool of Image J [47]).

The comparison with experimental results enables us to calibrate the time scale of the LB simulation. According to Fig. 1, complete fusion occurs in about 
                        5
                        ×

                      time steps (panel f). In experiments, on the other hand, complete fusion was observed after 3 days [27]. Thus, one time step of the LB simulation corresponds to about 5.184s in experiments.

In supplementary movies, the duration of a frame is set proportional to the number of iterations run between that frame and the next one, with 1000 iterations corresponding to 0.1s in the movie. Thus, one second in the movie corresponds to about 14.4h in experiment.

The qualitative agreement between the results of experiments and simulations suggests that our LB simulations describe well the evolution of the bioprinted tube in a cross-sectional plane that is perpendicular to the axis of the tube, and intersects the axis several diameters away from either end of the tube.

Nevertheless, the simulations based on the present model are unable to capture the experimentally observed rounding of the ends, and the longitudinal shrinking of the tube [27]. A 3D model should be developed in order to address these phenomena.

In experiments, one or more agarose cylinders are placed in the lumen of the bioprinted tube, as well as around the construct, in order to assure its stability in the early stages of fusion [27]. In these conditions, fusion takes place in the cell culture medium that baths the system, but the presence of the agarose cylinders, which cells are unable to penetrate, affects cellular rearrangements. To simulate such a system, a 3D LB model is needed, with a suitable representation of the agarose gel.

The simulation of Fig. 2 suggests that, if early fusion is incomplete, cellular rearrangements work against sealing the defect, leading to a solid cylinder of cells (Fig. 2(k)) within

A long-standing challenge of tissue engineering, the fabrication of vascularized, bulky tissue constructs, is addressed by the simulation of Fig. 5. This problem has attracted much attention in recent years, since promising results have been obtained by several techniques [48–50]. Printing a vascular tree, along with other cell types that compose a typical organ, exceeds the capabilities of current bioprinting methods. An important step in this direction would be the printing of a bulky system that incorporates channels that allow cell culture medium to reach close enough to cells, so that nutrients are delivered to them by diffusion. In biological tissues, diffusion is an effective mechanism for transporting small molecules along distances of the order of

                     m [51]. Thus, ideally, cells should not be farther apart from regions bathed by cell culture medium. The initial state shown in cross section in Fig. 5(a) may be built using available 3D printers [27]. Our simulations suggest that longitudinal, perfusable channels emerge spontaneously by the fusion of adjacent cylinders. Moreover, within 12 days in culture (the time that corresponds to a simulation of 
                        2

                      steps) the construct is expected to round, while the mean diameter of the channels shrinks just a bit. According to Fig. 5, typical distances between the cells and the nearest region accessible for cell culture medium remain less than the radius of the printed cylinders (of about

                     m [27]). Thus, fusion gives birth to a long-lived structure, which could be connected to a perfusion system in order to keep the construct alive and to arrest further shrinking of the channels.

The emergent configurations shown in Figs 1, 3, and 5 are metastable, slowly evolving towards the equilibrium shape predicted by continuum hydrodynamics (a single solid cylinder of cells according to a 2D model). Indeed, the tube of Fig. 1 shrinks, the patch of Fig. 3 rounds up (as seen at the margins), and the configuration of Fig. 5 also rounds up. In the latter, adjacent channels are likely to fuse, giving rise to a single lumen, which might shrink (just as in Fig. 1), eventually yielding the equilibrium shape. The point of our simulations is that the evolution of these constructs is slow enough to allow for practical applications. For instance, experiments show that the shrinking of bioprinted tubes is arrested once they are connected to a perfusion bioreactor [27]. Will the configuration of Fig. 5 be stabilized by perfusion? This is an exciting question to be answered experimentally.

The LB model proposed here treats a multicellular system embedded in a supportive hydrogel, both phases being modeled as highly viscous, incompressible fluids. While the fluid analogy is well established for tissue constructs made of cohesive cells [14,15], a hydrogel is not fluid, but viscoelastic on the timescale of interest (days). Why did the LB model yield a qualitative agreement with experiments? An explanation may be that cells synthesize a family of enzymes, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), which enable them to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix, a web of filamentous proteins such as collagen, laminin and fibronectin [51]. Thus, a hydrogel that can be remodeled by cells does not prevent cell rearrangements, and, therefore, tissue fusion. Here we propose to treat such a hydrogel as a viscous fluid, its viscosity being a measure of the difficulty encountered by cells in their attempt to remodel the gel. A hydrogel that cells cannot remodel, such as agarose, can be viewed as an infinitely viscous embedding medium. Agarose has been used in experiments in which tubes of living cells were obtained by printing multicellular cylinders [27], whereas collagen has been used as mechanical support of bioprinted toroidal structures [25,26]. Cells did not penetrate agarose [27], whereas in collagen cell aggregates fused at a pace modulated by collagen concentration [25].

The results of this work suggest that the LB model presented here describes tissue fusion in cell culture medium, as well as in a hydrogel that can be remodeled by cells. Besides extending the capabilities of this LB model, an interesting topic for further research would be to compare its predictions with those of the phase field model of Ref. [21]. While the results of phase field simulations qualitatively agree with the results reported here (compare Fig. 3. of Ref. [21] with Fig. 3 of this work), a quantitative comparison would require simulations that treat systems of similar complexity with model parameters that describe the same interfacial tension and the same viscosities.

Several extensions are necessary in order to turn the present LB model into a predictive tool of tissue engineering. First, the model should be formulated in 3D. Second, it should incorporate more components. Third, it would be desirable to implement a component that mimics the practically infinite viscosity of agarose. Such a medium could be taken into account, perhaps, by fixed boundary conditions. Finally, it would be necessary to incorporate cell proliferation and cell death. LB models that treat chemical reactions [31] might represent a good starting point for implementing these features.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model of a multicellular biological system embedded in a hydrogel bathed by cell culture medium. The model consists of two highly viscous immiscible fluids of different viscosities. Shape changes of the system are driven by the interfacial tension and resisted by the viscosities of the two fluids. Similar multicomponent LB models are known in the literature. The novelty of this work is not the model itself, but its adaptation for the biological problems raised by tissue engineering.

On a long timescale, of the order of hours or days, the fluid-like behavior of multicellular systems is well established experimentally [14,15]. Here we argued that the fluid analogy might be applicable also for hydrogels that can be reorganized by cells (by locally secreting extracellular proteolytic enzymes) [51]. In such a model, the viscosity of the fluid that represents the hydrogel is an effective measure of the cells׳ ability to remodel the hydrogel (the faster the remodeling, the lower the viscosity).

Our two-dimensional LB simulations were found in qualitative agreement with the evolution of three-dimensional tubular tissue constructs built by printing contiguous multicellular cylinders in a hexagonal arrangement [27].

Then, using the same parameters, we have simulated the evolution of a structure that had a fusion defect due to imprecise printing. The results suggest that incomplete fusion will not heal in time; on the contrary, the niche in the tube will grow, eventually leading to a solid cylinder of cells. Thus, according to our simulations, if the early fusion is incomplete it is useless to further culture the construct.

Since multicellular patches are of interest in many tissue engineering applications, ranging from corneal repair to heart patches [52], we have also simulated the shape changes of sheet-like structures obtained by contiguously printing multicellular cylinders on a planar, non-adherent substrate.

Finally, we used LB simulations to suggest a feasible way to build a bulky, perfusable tissue construct by cell cylinder printing.

The results presented here indicate that Lattice Boltzmann simulations might offer useful hints for tissue engineers, enabling them to test different working hypotheses at a fraction of the cost of laboratory experiments.
