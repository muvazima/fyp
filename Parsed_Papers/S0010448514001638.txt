                  Fitting curve and surface by least-regression is quite common in many scientific fields. It, however cannot properly handle noisy data with impulsive noises and outliers. In this article, we study

                     -regression based subdivision schemes to handle this problem. In addition, we propose fast numerical optimization method: dynamic iterative reweighted least squares to solve this problem, which has closed form solution for each iteration. The most advantage of the proposed method is that it removes noises and outliers without any prior information about the input data. It also extends the least square regression based subdivision schemes from the fitting of a curve to the set of observations in 2-dimensional space to a

                     -dimensional hyperplane to a set of point observations in

The curve and surface fitting is the process of constructing curve and surface that has the best fit to the data. In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex. Situation becomes more worse when some data points deviate so much from the other data points as to arouse suspicions in data. Such type of data points are called outliers. Outliers are also referred to as abnormalities, discordants, deviants, or anomalies in the data mining and statistics literature. Outlier detection and dealing with noisy data have been extensively studied in the past decades in different disciplines. Here is the brief survey of the related work.

One of the most widely used statistical technique to detect outlier is weighted least squares regression  [1]. In 1997, Sohn and Kim  [2] proposed an algorithm for detection of outliers in weighted least squares regression using Studentized weighted residuals. Multiple case outlier detection in least squares regression model using quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm has been introduced by Khan and Aktar  [3]. Iteratively reweighted minimization algorithms for sparse recovery and matrix rank minimization have been discussed by  [4–6]. Bissantz et al.  [7] offered convergence analysis of generalized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithms on convex function spaces by using quantile,

This is because in high dimensionality, the data becomes sparse and the sparsity behavior makes all points look very similar and almost equidistance to one another. A practical algorithm to outlier detection and data cleaning for the time-dependent signal is proposed by Pan et al.  [9]. It is claimed that proposed algorithm is good for bioinformatic application.

Subdivision schemes (i.e. classical schemes) are widely used for curve and surface fitting from few decades. An intensive study and literature along with mathematical descriptions and formulations are available now  [19–23]. A major advantage of subdivision schemes is that they can be easily applied to virtually any data type. However, early work in subdivision schemes does not deal with noisy data with impulsive noises and outliers. A downside of subdivision algorithm is that they are sensitive to outliers. One outlier can damage whole model and in most of the cases, schemes give overfitted model for noisy data with outliers. One algorithm has been reported by  [24] for fitting a Catmull–Clark subdivision surface model to an unstructured, incomplete and noisy stereo data set by using quasi-interpolation technique but this work does not deal with outliers. Recently, Dyn et al.  [25] have presented univariate subdivision schemes based on least squares minimization to deal with noisy data. They have compared their schemes with least squares minimization problems with kernel weights. The main purpose of their work was to address an open question: How to approximate a function from its normally distributed noisy samples by subdivision schemes?

The purpose of our article is to address the open question: How can we approximate a function by subdivision technique from its noisy samples with impulsive noises and outliers? To address this question: we use the

Numerical results show that new schemes have the ability to remove outliers and give better fitted models as compared to the other subdivision schemes when data is contaminated with noises and outliers. A major advantage of our schemes is that they give best fit to any type of data with and without added noise and outliers in high dimensional spaces. Throughout this paper,

There exists vast classical subdivision-based literature of fitting curves and surfaces to a given data set in Geometric Modeling. But this literature does not deal with noisy data along with outliers (see Fig. 1
                        (a)). Although a class of least square regression based subdivision schemes  [25] are good to deal with normally distributed noisy data but these do not seem reasonable to deal with outliers. Fig. 1(b) shows a fitted curve to a data with outliers by least square regression based subdivision scheme. A significant perturbation has been occurred in the fitted curve due to outliers. This is because the outlier has big distance value to the fitting curve, however, in

                        -regression, it is not penalized too much, while in least square regression based model, the distance is squared, and thus it has a big impact to the objective energy. Also

                        -regression based procedure is more robust to the presence of outlying observations  [26]. So we propose to initiate a new class of subdivision schemes based on

                         It cannot be solved the same way as least square regression owing to the lack of differentiability. We resort to the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS)  [7]. The IRLS is based on the idea that, in a first step, the

                           2
                           n
                         local initial points then these weights are iteratively reweighted. During this process the outliers (if any) among these local 
                           2
                           n
                         points have been killed (or assigned less weight). Also noisy sample points assign less weights during this step.

Second step comprises two rules: the topological rule and subdivision rule. The topological rule describes how the refined mesh is created from the original mesh. The subdivision rule computes the locations of the vertices of the new mesh by taking a linear combination of the local 
                           2
                           n
                         points with iterative dynamic weights assigned by step one to these points. These steps are carried out for next local 
                           2
                           n
                         points. In other words subdivision rule computes the locations of the vertices of the new mesh and topological rule describes how many new vertices are added to the mesh and which vertices in the new mesh are connected by edges.

Both iterative steps are repeated for next level of iteration. These steps continue until the resulting curve / polygon become sufficiently smooth. If all the dynamic weight

The support of basic limit functions and subdivision scheme is the area of the limit curve that will be affected by the displacement of a single control point. That part which is dependent on a given control point is called the support width / region of that point. The following proposition is related to the support of basic limit function of the scheme

In this section, we present intrinsic comparisons among

                         schemes. We present several experiments to illustrate the performances of fitting curves generated by these schemes from input noisy data with outliers or impulsive. The fitting performance is also characterized by the fitting error. The fitting error for each point is displayed through the jet color-bar as shown in Fig. 3
                        , where the fitting errors are normalized to

                         do not give response to these outliers. Arrows in this figure indicate outliers and their effect on fitting curves. Since an outlier sample assign a small corresponding weight defined in  (6) then in turn enhancing outlier rejection (or a small response) by scheme  (4). Large complexity schemes also give less response to outliers than small complexity schemes. This is one of the reasons that small complexity schemes are more effected by outliers than other schemes.

                         schemes in terms of visual fitting and error between fitting curve and original function when data is noisy along with outliers. We also notice that low complexity schemes give more response to outlier, and to noise so these schemes have more error. Since high complexity schemes give less response to outliers, noise and even to real sample values so these schemes also have more error than low complexity schemes. The scheme

                         offers better fitted results than other schemes. Our claim is supported by this experiment as well as by other experiments.

The iterative results of our proposed scheme are shown in Fig. 4
                         for this example (Fig. 5). We can see that the fitting curve gets further improved as iterations increase.

From this figure it is observed that outlier leave significant effect on fitting surfaces for low complexity

                         schemes are free from the effect of outlier. However, both schemes have ability to produce smooth surface fitting models. The surface reconstructed by classical scheme i.e. bi-quadratic B-spline is shown in Figure (c). From this figure we conclude that classical schemes are not suitable for fitting such type of data.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have developed 
                        
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     -regression based subdivision algorithm with dynamic iterative reweighted weights which has closed form solution for each iteration. It is suitable for curve and surface fitting when the data points are given as exact, or contaminated with random noise, or noisy data with impulsive noises and outliers. Several experiments have been carried out on different types of data such as functional and parametric data along with and without added noise and outliers. These experiments demonstrate that the introduced algorithm can significantly outperform 
                        L
                        S
                     -regression based subdivision algorithm with constant weights. Compared with 
                        L
                        S
                     -regression based subdivision algorithm, our algorithm can approximate an input model with a much smaller error. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first subdivision-based algorithm for removal of outliers. The introduction of subdivision-based algorithm for preservation of sharp features in the presence of noise and outliers is the possible future research direction.

                         consecutive points form initial polygon to compute new point in order to get a refined polygon. Dotted points in Figs. 3–5 are initial points of the initial polygon. For example: for 
                           n
                           =

At the moment we cannot propose an automatic way of selecting 
                           δ
                        . However, numerical experiments show that small value of 
                           δ
                         is good choice. Sufficiently large value of 
                           m
                         is better choice. However, the choice of 
                           m
                           =
                           5
                         or 6 is sufficient.

                        -dimensional hyperplane to a set of point observations in

                        -dimensional space. Again using the IRLS as optimality criterion, we obtain
