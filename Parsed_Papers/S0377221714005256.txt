                  One index satisfies the duality axiom if one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another, accepts a gamble, the latter accepts any less risky gamble under the index. Aumann and Serrano (2008) show that only one index defined for so-called gambles satisfies the duality and positive homogeneity axioms. We call it a duality index. This paper extends the definition of duality index to all outcomes including all gambles, and considers a portfolio selection problem in a complete market, in which the agent’s target is to minimize the index of the utility of the relative investment outcome. By linking this problem to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems, the optimal solution is explicitly derived. It is shown that if the prior benchmark level is too high (which can be verified), then the investment risk will be beyond any agent’s risk tolerance. If the benchmark level is reasonable, then the optimal solution will be the same as that of one of the Merton’s series problems, but with a particular value of absolute risk aversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the optimal solution. According to our result, it is riskier to achieve the same surplus profit in a stable market than in a less-stable market, which is consistent with the common financial intuition.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Diamond and Stiglitz (1974) point out that whether or not a person takes a gamble depends on two distinct considerations:
                        
                           (i) The attributes of the gamble and, in particular, how risky it is; and

(ii) The attributes of the person and, in particular, how averse he or she is to risk.

In terms of the first issue, the concept of the risk measure has been used to explain how risky a gamble is. Many well-studied risk measures are described in the literature, such as the superhedging price, value at risk, tail value at risk, and expected shortfall as well as general coherent risk measures. These measures emphasize certain aspects of risk. However, few of them directly reflect the risk-averse person’s attitude; that is, the perspective that “risk is what risk-averters hate” (Machina & Rothschild, 2008). The entropic risk measure, which depends on such a risk aversion through the exponential utility function, is one of the few to have attempted to capture this feature. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing measures, Aumann and Serrano (2008) have developed one risk measure which emphasizes such a risk-averters’ attitude. This preserves many properties of the coherent risk measure such as first-order monotonicity, convexity and positive homogeneity. Unlike the coherent risk measure, however, it is also second-order monotonic, which is consistent with the emphasis on the risk-averters’ attitude. Unfortunately, Aumann and Serrano (2008) only define the measure for a certain type of discrete random variables called gambles. It is acknowledged that most outcomes in financial applications are of continuous or mixed type, so their measure cannot be applied to many of theses outcomes. To incorporate general outcomes such as price of stocks, options and general contingent claims, this paper generalizes the definition of the measure to cover all random variables. The measure, like the original, will satisfy an essential axiom, namely the duality axiom. This axiom states that if one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another agent, accepts a gamble, the latter will accept any less-risky gamble under the measure. It clearly demonstrates the solid connection between the measure and the attitude of the risk-averter. We therefore label it as the duality risk measure or duality index. The axiomatic characterization of the measure will be considered in detail in the following section.

In terms of the second consideration, utility functions have been used to describe the risk-aversion of an agent. The most widely used utility functions are concave, which represents that the agent is globally risk-averse. Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 1992) consider S-shaped utility functions
                        1
                        
                           S-shaped utility function is convex on the negative return and concave on the positive return.
                     
                     
                        1
                      to reflect the risk-seeking attitude of the agent in a loss situation and the risk-averse attitude in a gain situation. Meanwhile, they also introduce a reference point to separate gain and loss situations. Though many other utility functions are considered in the literature, only the globally risk-averse (which includes risk-neutral) agent as well as a reference point will be discussed in this paper. The reference point reflects the agent’s relative financial situation.

To incorporate both considerations, namely how risky an outcome is and how risk-averse the agent is, we introduce a portfolio selection problem. This problem aims to find out a portfolio that minimizes the duality risk measure of the utility of the relative investment outcome, that is the difference between the investment outcome and the benchmark level. The risk measure addresses the first consideration and the utility function the second. Since the duality risk measure is highly nonlinear, we adopt a novel idea to deal with the portfolio selection problem, by firstly linking the problem to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems, and then solving them using the well-known Lagrange method. It turns out that the original problem is equivalent to one of the series problems but with a particular choice of absolute risk aversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the explicit optimal solution. Thus the explicit solution of the original problem is derived and the problem is completely solved. A critical threshold is also derived, so that once the surplus level (that is, the difference between the benchmark level and initial endowment) is beyond a threshold, the investment risk will exceed the agent’s risk tolerance. In particular, if the agent is risk-neutral, that is to say with a linear utility function, then the investment risk will grow linearly with respect to (w.r.t.) the surplus level. The investment risk is also positively related to the entropy of the pricing kernel of the market. The result verifies the common financial intuition that it is much harder and riskier to achieve the same surplus profit in a stable market than in a less-stable market.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the duality risk measure for all outcomes, studies its properties and axiomatic characterization, and then shows that it is the unique nontrivial index satisfying two axioms. Section 3 presents a portfolio selection problem under a complete market setting. The problem is to find a possible outcome to minimize the duality risk measure of the utility of the relative investment outcome. Section 4 is devoted to solving this portfolio selection problem. We first study how well posed the problem is, that is, whether its value is finite. Then we link it to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems via a bridge problem. The series is then treated using the standard Lagrange method. Finally, the optimal solution and value of the original problem are derived. Analytical and numerical examples are also presented in Section 4 to illustrate the main result of this paper. We conclude the paper in Section 5.

In order to define the duality risk measure, we need to review some of the concepts used in Aumann and Serrano (2008).

A gamble is a random variable whose mean is positive and that takes finitely many values, some of which are negative.

Say that an agent with utility function u accepts a gamble g at wealth w
                     
                        2
                        Throughout this paper, wealth is constant.
                     
                     
                        2
                      if 
                        
                           E
                           [
                           u
                           (
                           w
                           +
                           g
                           )
                           ]
                           >
                           u
                           (
                           w
                           )
                        
                     , where 
                        
                           E
                        
                      stands for “expectation”; that is to say, the agent prefers taking that gamble to refusing it at wealth w.
                        3
                        By this definition, no agent accepts 0, which is inconsistent with financial intuition that no loss is an acceptable situation. In Aumann and Serrano (2008), it is not an issue because 0 is not regarded as a gamble. However, we will regard 0 as an outcome in this paper, so we assume that all agents accept 0 throughout this paper. It would not make any essential difference if 0 was assumed to be accepted by nobody.
                     
                     
                        3
                      Throughout this paper, we only consider the risk-averse (which includes risk-neutral) agent; that is to say, u is concave.

Say that one agent is uniformly more risk-averse than another, if whenever the former accepts a gamble at some wealth, the latter accepts that gamble at any wealth, but not vice versa.

A risk measure or index is a (positive) real-valued function on gambles. A gamble is less risky than another under an index if its index value is strictly less than that of the latter.

Now we will introduce two important axioms related to indices.
                        
                           
                              Duality axiom: If one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another, accepts a gamble, then the latter agent will accept any less-risky gamble under the index.


                              Positive homogeneity axiom: If a gamble is scaled by some positive scalar, then the index value is also scaled by the same scalar.


                     Aumann and Serrano (2008) show that, up to a positive multiple, there is a unique index satisfying the above two axioms. The duality axiom is more central than the other because together with the weak conditions of continuity and monotonicity it already implies that the index is unique up to the ordinal equivalent. Thus, we call the unique index satisfying both the duality and positive homogeneity axioms the Aumann–Serrano duality risk measure or Aumann–Serrano duality index, or simply the duality risk measure or duality index. Some important properties of the duality index are listed as follows.
                        
                           
                              Sub-additive: The duality index of the sum of two gambles is no more than the sum of the indices of each gamble.


                              Law-invariant: The duality indices of two identically distributed gambles are the same.


                              Convex: If a gamble is a linear combination of two gambles, then its duality index is no more than the same combination of the indices of each gamble.


                              Monotonic: The duality index decreases monotonically w.r.t. the first- and second-order (stochastic) dominance.
                                 4
                                 Say that one gamble first-order dominates another one, if its value is always no less than the latter. Say that one gamble second-order dominates another one, if the latter can be obtained by replacing some of the former’s value with an outcome whose mean is that value. Say that one gamble stochastically dominates another one if there is a gamble distributed like the former that dominates the latter. A gamble g second-order stochastic dominates another gamble h if and only if 
                                       
                                          E
                                          [
                                          f
                                          (
                                          g
                                          )
                                          ]
                                          ⩽
                                          E
                                          [
                                          f
                                          (
                                          h
                                          )
                                          ]
                                       
                                     for all decreasing and convex utility functions f.
                              
                              
                                 4
                              
                           

It is noted that the convexity property is not stated explicitly by Aumann and Serrano (2008), however, this property will play a very important role in our analysis. It accords with the widely accepted financial wisdom that diversified investment reduces risk.

Now, let us define the duality index for general outcomes.

This paper is going to investigate a portfolio selection problem under the duality index. Portfolio selection means finding the best possible outcome in a certain set under a certain meaning, in the current setting, that is related to the duality index. Every outcome with a mean (which may not be finite) will be considered. The definition of the duality index in Aumann and Serrano (2008) cannot be employed, because the outcomes considered there only take finitely many values, and the index is not well-defined for many of which need to be addressed here. The details will be stated after Example 2.1 below. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the definition of duality index to cover general outcomes.

We think, however, it would contradict the financial intuition that no loss is always an acceptable situation, so we do not adopt this definition.

In this section, we show that the duality index satisfies the duality and positive homogeneity axioms, which is unique.

We need a technical result as follows. It shows that the duality index is continuous under the meaning given below.

                                 Say that a nonnegative real-valued index is nontrivial, the index of an outcome is zero if and only if the outcome is accepted by all risk-averse agents. In fact, the latter means the outcome is nonnegative.

The constraint

                      is often called the budget constraint and limits the choice of a particular hedging strategy as attainable or replicable given an initial endowment x. In this paper, we assume the market is complete, that is to say, any outcome 
                        
                           X
                           ∈
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      can be replicated. However, we do not study here how to replicate an outcome. Interested readers can consult Pardoux and Peng (1990) for an analysis of related topics.

It may be observed that people tend to think of possible outcomes relative to a benchmark or reference point rather than the absolute outcomes themselves. This phenomenon is called the framing effect. So we consider the relative outcome 
                        
                           X
                           -
                           ℓ
                        
                      instead of the absolute outcome X in the target. It turns out that the benchmark plays an essential role in the problem.

A risk-averse agent tends to derive less utility from consuming additional units of the same product. This phenomenon is called the law of diminishing marginal utility and is reflected by the concavity of the utility function in the target. If the agent is risk-neutral, then the utility function is just the identical function, and we will discuss it as an example later.

                        , then the value of problem (5) and that of the original problem (4) are both infinity. That is to say, if the benchmark level 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         compared to the initial endowment x is too aggressive, then the investment risk will be beyond any agent’s tolerance. By contrast, in the classic mean–variance model, some agents may enter the market regardless of the benchmark level because the investment risk will still be lower than his/her tolerance.

In the following part, we look for the optimal solution of problem (5). From now on, we assume 
                           
                              0

                                    y
                                 
                                 
                                    ˆ
                                 
                              
                           
                        .

The main difficulty in solving problem (5) is due to the nonlinearity of the duality index. To overcome this, we introduce a series of problems and study their relationships. Eventually, we link problem (5) to a solvable classic portfolio selection problem, and then deduce its optimal solution and optimal value. It will be seen that Basic Lemma plays a key role in this approach.

Before introducing a new series of problems, we firstly need to analyze the value function of problem (5).

From the above result, it can be seen that if the benchmark level 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         is very close to the initial endowment x, then the risk can be arbitrarily small. In other words, if an agent is not greedy, then he/she can set a benchmark level which brings the investment risk within his/her level of tolerance (no matter how small it is, provided it is not zero). That is to say, he/she will enter the market. By contrast, in the classic mean–variance model without a risk-free asset, there is a so-called system risk which is positive. If the system risk is beyond the agent’s risk tolerance, then no matter how small the benchmark level is, he/she will not enter the market.

It is clear that the duality index in the target of problem (5) is not easy to deal with. To avoid this, we introduce a bridge problem

The above result links problem (5) to problem (10). We now only need to consider the latter. Problem (10) is significantly simpler than problem (5) since the duality index has been removed. However, there are still two variables that need to be optimized in problem (10), and it may not be easy to find the optimal solution directly because the feasible set may not be convex and the standard Lagrange method cannot be applied directly. Our second novel idea is therefore to introduce a new series of single-variable optimization problems which are easier to solve but still closely linked with the bridge problem (10) and therefore also with problem (5).

In this paper, a nontrivial, nonnegative, real-valued index for general outcomes is defined. It is a generalization of the index introduced by Aumann and Serrano (2008). It retains many properties of the original index including sub-additivity, law-invariance, convexity and monotonicity as well as continuity. It is also the unique nontrivial index that satisfies both the duality and positive homogeneity axioms.

A portfolio selection problem is then considered in a complete market setting. The problem is completely solved by linking it to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems via a bridge problem. The problem is equivalent to one of the series, which is revealed by an explicit algebraic equation.

In an incomplete market setting, the problem will be much harder to tackle and a new method needs to be adopted. Optimal stopping problem under the duality index is also interesting. These problems will be addressed in the forthcoming papers.

                     . That is to say, the agent B accepts Y at wealth w. Now we proved that the duality index satisfies the duality axiom.

It is evident that the duality index satisfies the positive homogeneity axiom.

The uniqueness of the index can be proved by a similar limit argument. We leave the proof to interested readers.
