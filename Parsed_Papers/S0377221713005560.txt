                  This paper proposes a shape-restricted nonparametric quantile regression to estimate the τ-frontier, which acts as a benchmark for whether a decision making unit achieves top τ efficiency. This method adopts a two-step strategy: first, identifying fitted values that minimize an asymmetric absolute loss under the nondecreasing and concave shape restriction; second, constructing a nondecreasing and concave estimator that links these fitted values. This method makes no assumption on the error distribution and the functional form. Experimental results on some artificial data sets clearly demonstrate its superiority over the classical linear quantile regression. We also discuss how to enforce constraints to avoid quantile crossings between multiple estimated frontiers with different values of τ. Finally this paper shows that this method can be applied to estimate the production function when one has some prior knowledge about the error term.

Quantile frontier with τ
                     ×100% acts as a benchmark for whether a decision making unit (DMU) achieves top τ efficiency. In statistics, this τ-frontier is merely the τ-quantile of random output conditional on various input levels. If one DMU produces output not less than the τ-frontier at its input level, the DMU is regarded as τ-efficient; otherwise, τ-inefficient. In contrast with the full frontier that envelopes the production possibility set, the τ-frontier partitions the production possibility set into two portions: upper τ-efficient and lower τ-inefficient.

Linear quantile regression (LQR: Koenker & Bassett JR, 1978) has been applied to τ-frontier estimation by Behr (2010) and Bernini, Freo, and Gardini (2004). The first paper studied the productivity of German savings, cooperative and commercial banks, and the second paper analyzed the efficiency of the Italian hotel industry. In both papers, τ-frontier is assumed to be linear with the input (or log-input). But this linear functional form may fail to describe complex dependence relationships between conditional quantiles and input levels. Real applications call for flexible nonparametric methods, instead of LQR that is characterized primarily by technical convenience.

This paper provides a concave nonparametric quantile regression (CNQR) for τ-frontier estimation. Similar to previously proposed nonparametric extensions in frontier analysis, e.g. convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS: Kuosmanen, 2008), corrected concave nonparametric least squares (C2NLS: Kuosmanen & Johnson, 2010) and stochastic non-smooth envelopment of data (StoNED: Kuosmanen & Kortelainen, 2012), this estimator has a piecewise linear form and satisfies monotonicity and concavity. The main characteristics of CNQR are described as follows. First, it is robust to functional misspecification that could undermine conventional parametric regression methods. Second, with the CNLS formulation (14a–d) developed by Kuosmanen (2008), it adheres to the regularity conditions (monotonicity and concavity) implied by microeconomic theory. Third, it enables the transformation of continuously constrained shape-restricted quantile regression into a tractable linear program.

A nonparametric quantile regression model for τ-frontier estimation is proposed in Wang and Wang (2013), which applies shape-restricted support vector regression with pinball loss. Although this estimator is smooth, it may fail to be globally nondecreasing and concave, because it only imposes the first and second-order derivative constraints on the sample points, as that in Wang and Ni (2012). However, the CNQR estimator in this paper is globally nondecreasing and concave, which is a decided advantage over Wang and Wang (2013).

Quantile frontier in this paper differs significantly from partial frontier in Aragon, Daouia, and Thomas-Agnan (2005), Daouia and Simar (2007) and Martins-Filho and Yao (2008), which is also based on conditional quantiles of random output. In these papers, the α-partial frontier at a given input level x is the α-quantile of random output conditional on input level not larger than x, whereas in this paper the τ-quantile frontier at x is the τ-quantile conditional on input level right equal to x. The α-partial frontier in the aforementioned studies is to evaluate whether one specified DMU achieves the largest α output among companies with inputs less than or equal to its input. Because comparing a DMU’s output to that of other DMUs with substantially less input is a meaningless endeavor, we do not test their models in the experiments.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the shape-restricted nonparametric quantile regression for τ-frontier estimation. Section 3 investigates the performance of CNQR through Monte Carlo simulations. Section 4 discusses how to enforce non-crossing constraints in estimating multiple frontiers with different values of τ. Section 5 introduces how to estimate the production function with CNQR by adjusting τ when the modeller has some prior knowledge about the error distribution. Section 6 concludes the paper.

                     . The economic meaning of τ-frontier is intuitive: one DMU with production (x,
                     y) is τ-efficient if y
                     ⩾
                     φ
                     
                        τ
                     (x); otherwise τ-inefficient. This τ-frontier divides the production possibility set into two parts: upper τ-efficient and lower τ-inefficient. For any given input level x, the percentages of upper τ-efficiency and lower τ-inefficiency are τ and 1−
                     τ, respectively.


                     τ-frontier can be indirectly acquired by a two-stage procedure: first, estimating the conditional distribution F
                     
                        Y∣x
                     ; second, computing φ
                     
                        τ
                     (x) by inverting F
                     
                        Y∣x
                     . Usually the performance of this procedure heavily depends on the assumptions on the distribution of ∊ and the functional form of φ. To circumvent this model specification, we can directly estimate τ-frontier by building the dependence between x and φ

The development from parametric to nonparametric quantile regression for τ-frontier estimation is not straightforward. Some shape-related constrains must be imposed to guarantee that the estimated quantile frontier satisfies monotonicity and concavity. Or else the flexibility of nonparametric methods may lead to counter-intuitive predictions.

                      is nontrivial, because it involves an infinite number of inequality constraints. Problem (6) belongs to shape-restricted nonparametric regression that has a long history in statistical literature with seminal works dating back half a century (e.g. Brunk (1955) and Hildreth (1954)). The common shapes analyzed in nonparametric econometrics are monotone, convex (concave), supermodular and homogeneous. Typical applications of shape-restricted regression in economics include the estimation of utility functions and production functions. Statistical convergences of piecewise linear convex least squares regression can be found in Aguilera, Forzani, and Morin (2011), Seijo and Sen (2011) and Lim and Glynn (2012). One can refer to Magnani and Boyd (2009), Kim, Vandenberghe, and Yang (2010), Toriello and Vielma (2012) and Lee, Johnson, Moreno-Centeno, and Kuosmanen (2013) for computational issues of piecewise linear convex least squares regression.

CNLS (Kuosmanen, 2008) also considers the nondecreasing and concave shape restriction, and represents them with the inequalities (8a)–(8c). What differentiates CNQR from CNLS is the loss function. In CNLS the objective function is the symmetric least squares loss, whereas in CNQR the objective function is the asymmetric least absolute loss. The CNLS model is a quadratic programming problem

                        ): (1,1), (2,3) and (3,2). It is easy to verify that both (1,2,2)′ and (1,3,3)′ are optimal solutions for problem (7) when τ
                        =50%. The pinball loss function (5) has a piecewise linear form that is not strictly convex. Different from CNQR, CNLS has a unique optimal solution due to strict convexity of the ℓ2-norm loss. Because problem (7) is a convex program, any convex combination of optimal solutions is also optimal for (7).

Distinct solutions to problem (7) imply different benchmark τ-frontiers. But we will show that distinct solutions cannot differ ridiculously in the sense that any sample cannot be strictly τ-efficient and strictly τ-inefficient in distinct solutions, i.e., for any two distinct optimal solutions

As shown in Kuosmanen (2008, Theorem 4.1), the two linear programming problems (13) and (14) can be simplified. The lower bound of τ-frontier at x
                        0 can be obtained by

We generated 50 samples by assuming that the input X follows a uniform distribution Uni[1,10] that is independent of V and U.

For each τ, the LQR estimator underestimates the quantile frontier in the middle portion, while significantly overestimates in the left and right portions. This shortcoming is general, because LQR attempts to fit a concave function with a linear functional. It is clear that, for each τ, the piecewise linear CNQR estimator approximates the true τ-frontiers more close than the LQR estimator.

                        To overcome sampling error, we conducted 100 trails and computed the average MSE. Model comparison between LQR and CNQR was based on two criteria. One is the difference between their average MSEs. The other is the fraction among the 100 trails that CNQR achieves a lower MSE than LQR. The results shown in Table 1
                         can be summarized as follows.

First, overall CNQR achieves significantly better result than LQR. In all the forty scenarios, the fraction of CNQR better than LQR exceeds 50%. Especially in the lower noise case (σ
                        
                           V
                        
                        =0.1), these fractions are uniformly equal to 100%. All differences (the average MSE of LQR minus that of CNQR) are positive, except the scenario (n
                        =100, σ
                        
                           V
                        
                        =0.4, σ
                        
                           U
                        
                        =0.1, τ
                        =10%) where LQR beats CNQR with a narrow margin (0.001).

Second, the superiority of CNQR over LQR in the lower noise case (σ
                        
                           V
                        
                        =0.1) is greater than that in the higher noise case (σ
                        
                           V
                        
                        =0.4). This feature reveals that high noise can obscure the underlying curvature and weaken the advantage of CNQR. But the margin between CNQR and LQR increases with the data size n. When σ
                        
                           V
                         is 0.4, both the two criteria Diff and Frac in the ten scenarios of n
                        =200 uniformly dominate that in the ten scenarios of n
                        =100.

If multiple τ-frontiers are estimated individually, they may cross or overlap, which leads to an invalid distribution for the output Y. For example, it may turn out that the predicted 10%-frontier is lower than or equal to the predicted 20%-frontier at some input levels. If we plot the three CNQR estimators for 10%-frontier, 20%-frontier and 30%-frontier in Section 3.1 together in Fig. 2
                     , we can immediately find the existence of crossings between estimated τ-frontiers. In statistics this embarrassing phenomenon is called quantile crossings, which happens frequently even in the linear case. This problem is well-known, but currently no simple and general solution exists. One can refer to Bondell, Reich, and Wang (2010) and Liu and Wu (2011) for the recent literature on non-crossing quantile regression.

Fortunately, we can enforce non-crossing constraints conveniently in CNQR. Suppose that we want to estimate H quantile frontiers with 0<
                     τ
                     1
                     <
                     τ
                     2
                     <⋯<
                     τ
                     
                        H
                     
                     <1. Our scheme is to estimate these H quantile frontiers simultaneously and enforce non-crossing constraints by separating them at every sample point. The multiple-τ extension of CNQR is

                     To reduce sampling error, we conducted the above procedure 100 rounds and adopted the average MSE as the final criterion for model evaluation. The results shown in Fig. 4
                      clearly demonstrate that in each scenario the empirically optimal τ is very close to the theoretically optimal τ
                     ∗ 
                     (27). It is also evident that the empirically optimal τ decreases with the signal-to-noise ratio λ.

Although CNQR provides an alternative way to stochastic frontier analysis (SFA: Aigner, Lovell, & Schmidt, 1977) for production function estimation, it requires more prior knowledge about the error term than SFA. CNQR needs further specification on the signal-to-noise ratio. The difficult in obtaining this prior knowledge may retard its successful applications in practice.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper proposes a nonparametric shape-restricted quantile regression for τ-frontier estimation. Its computation can be divided into two steps: fitting and interpolation. This method can efficiently tackle the two challenges in frontier analysis: flexibility in functional forms and fidelity to economic theory. It is a nonparametric method that allows for flexible functional forms. Its shape-restriction makes it conform to economic theory and avoid counter-intuitive predictions. Experimental results on some simulated data sets demonstrate that CNQR can achieve significantly better performance than LQR. This improved performance of CNQR sufficiently compensates its lack of parsimony. This paper also suggests a way to tackle quantile crossings in multiple τ-frontiers estimation. We also show that CNQR can be used to estimate the production function, provided that we have prior knowledge on the signal-to-noise ratio.

We first prove that the set

                     0 associated with any nondecreasing and concave function. The convexity of
