                  This paper deals with a variation of the Heston hybrid model with stochastic interest rate illustrated in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011). This variation leads to a multi-factor Heston model where one factor is the stochastic interest rate. Specifically, the dynamics of the asset price is described through two stochastic factors: one related to the stochastic volatility and the other to the stochastic interest rate. The proposed model has the advantage of being analytically tractable while preserving the good features of the Heston hybrid model in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011) and of the multi-factor Heston model in Christoffersen et al. (2009). The analytical treatment is based on an appropriate parametrization of the probability density function which allows us to compute explicitly relevant integrals which define option pricing and moment formulas. The moments and mixed moments of the asset price and log-price variables are given by elementary formulas which do not involve integrals. A procedure to estimate the model parameters is proposed and validated using three different data-sets: the prices of call and put options on the U.S. S&P 500 index, the values of the Credit Agricole index linked policy, Azione Più Capitale Garantito Em.64., and the U.S. three-month, two and ten year government bond yields. The empirical analysis shows that the stochastic interest rate plays a crucial role as a volatility factor and provides a multi-factor model that outperforms the Heston model in pricing options. This model can also provide insights into the relationship between short and long term bond yields.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The pricing of derivative products is probably one of the most challenging topics in modern financial theory. The modern fixed income market includes not only bonds but also derivative securities sensitive to interest rates. In this paper we consider a modified version of the hybrid model illustrated in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011). This model is described by a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which combines different models for equity, interest rate and volatility in order to efficiently price European vanilla call and put options with short and long maturities.

Specifically, we focus on the model which combines the Heston model 1993 for equity and its volatility and the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) (CIR) model for interest rate. Roughly speaking, the proposed model can be interpreted as the Heston multi-factor model introduced by Christoffersen, Heston, and Jacob (2009) where one volatility factor is the stochastic interest rate. Indeed, a multi-factor Heston-like stochastic volatility model capable of explaining some stylized facts on interest rate volatility and of forecasting bond yields with different maturities has been introduced by Trolle and Schwartz (2009). This model describes the yield using a stochastic differential equation where the drift and the coefficients of the stochastic variances are dependent on time and maturity date.

Furthermore, Cieslak and Povala (2014) propose the joint use of a short term yield with another stochastic factor as an efficient tool to explain the volatility of the yields. Motivated by the results of these papers, the hybrid model proposed here has been applied to option pricing (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3) and, at a very preliminary stage, to bond yield analysis (see Section 4.4).

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Recent literature motivates the use of hybrid SDE models due to the empirical evidence that the asset volatility and the interest rate are not constant over time. Indeed, the relaxation of the constant volatility assumption in time continuous stochastic volatility models goes back to the end of 1980s with (Ball & Roma, 1994; Heston, 1993; Hull & White, 1988; Stein & Stein, 1991).

The Heston model is one of the most celebrated models because it allows for closed-form formulas for option pricing. In fact, this model accurately describes the asset price behavior when the assumption of constant interest rate is realistic and the volatility is not affected by abrupt oscillations. Improvements of this model can be found in the recent literature with the models of Christoffersen et al. (2009), Fatone, Mariani, Recchioni, and Zirilli (2009), Fatone, Mariani, Recchioni, and Zirilli (2013), Wong and Lo (2009), Date and Islyaev (2015), Islyaev and Date (2015), Pun, Chung, and Wong (2015). These models are modified versions of the Heston model which are able to better capture the price volatility dynamics in order to efficiently solve option pricing problems.

The relaxation of the constant interest rate assumption can be found in the literature of the last decade. Far from being exhaustive, we cite the papers of Chiarella and Kwon (2003), Trolle and Schwartz (2009), Andersen and Benzoni (2010), Christensen, Diebold, and Rudebush (2011), Moreno and Platania (2015) which show that stochastic interest rates should be used in order to capture the bond yield behavior.

In line with the attempt to deal with stochastic interest rates and stochastic volatility(ies) several hybrid SDE models have been introduced since 2000. In fact, Zhu (2000) introduces a model capable of generating a skew pattern for the equity using a stochastic interest rate not correlated to the equity. Later, Andreasen (2007) generalizes the Zhu model using the Heston stochastic volatility model and an indirect correlation between the equity and the interest rate process. Ahlip (2008) studies a model for the spot FX (Foreign Exchange) rate with stochastic volatility and stochastic domestic as well as foreign rates. Specifically, these rates are modeled by the Ornstein–Uhlenbbeck process and the volatility is modeled by a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process correlated with the spot FX rate. Ahlip also derives an analytical formula for the price of European call options on the spot FX rate. Grzelak, Oosterlee, and Van Weeren (2012) propose the so called Schöbel–Zhu–Hull–White hybrid model. This is an affine model whose analytical treatment is shown by Grzelak et al. (2012) following the approach proposed by Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000). However, as highlighted in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011), the model allows for negative volatility and interest rate. In order to overcome this problem they propose the use of a Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process to describe the variance and interest rate processes. Local volatility models have also been extended to deal with stochastic interest rates. For example, Deelstra and Rayee (2012) propose a three factor pricing model with local volatility and domestic and foreign interest rates modeled by the Hull and White (HW) model 1993. In line with the latter, Benhamou, Gobet, and Miri (2012) provide analytical formulas for European option prices when the underlying asset is described by a local volatility model with stochastic rates.

As previously mentioned, this paper focuses on a modified version of the hybrid Heston-CIR model illustrated by Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011). However, the analytical treatment proposed here extends to the hybrid Heston-Hull and White model. Our contribution is threefold.

Firstly, we modify the hybrid SDE model of Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011) in order to preserve the affine structure and to permit a “direct” correlation between the equity and the interest rate. As highlighted by Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011) this correlation plays a fundamental role in getting a good match between the observed and the theoretical option prices.

Secondly, we present the analytical treatment of the model. Specifically, we derive a parametrization of the probability density function of the stochastic process by solving the backward Kolmogorov equation using some ideas illustrated in Fatone et al. (2009, 2013).

This parametrization allows us to express the prices of European call and put options as one dimensional integrals and to derive elementary formulas for the moments and mixed moments of the asset price variable as well as the moments of the log-price variable. These elementary formulas which do not involve integrals show that the existence of bounded moments of the price variable depends on the value of the correlation coefficients. This finding coheres with the results obtained by Lions and Musiela (2007) as well as Andersen and Piterbarg (2007) on the explosion of moments of some well known probability distributions. As a byproduct of this analytical treatment we obtain an efficient approximation of the stochastic integral appearing in the discount factor (i.e. an efficient approximation of the zero-coupon bond). This approximation is suggested by the explicit formula of the zero-coupon bond in the CIR model (see Eq. (29)) and permits us to approximate the option prices as one dimensional integrals of explicitly known elementary functions.

Thirdly, we calibrate the model in order to measure its performance in interpreting real data and forecasting European call and put option prices (see the empirical analysis on the U.S. S&P 500 index options in Section 4.2 and on the Credit Agricole pure endowment policy in Section 4.3) and in predicting the trend of the two and ten-year U.S. government bond yields (see Section 4.4).

The calibration procedure of the empirical analysis of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 is based on the solution of a nonlinear constrained optimization problem whose objective function measures the relative squared difference between the observed and theoretical call and/or put option prices while the calibration of Section 4.4 is based on the maximum likelihood approach. Numerical simulations show that the approximate formulas for the discount factor and option prices work satisfactorily for any maturities (see Section 4.1). Moreover, the empirical study conducted using real data shows that the model is capable of fitting and predicting satisfactorily call and put option prices using only one set of model parameters obtained from the calibration procedure (empirical analysis of call and put options on U.S. S&P 500 index). In addition, it is capable of forecasting values of long-term products (Credit Agricole pure endowment policy) and of interpreting the relationship between short and long term bond yields.

The empirical analysis regarding the pure endowment policy and the two/ten-year U.S. government bonds show the crucial role played by the stochastic interest rate factor when long maturities are considered. However, we show that the interest rate is a significant factor even in the case of European options on the U.S. S&P 500 index. To do this we use a two-stage calibration. In the first stage we estimate the parameters of the CIR model by using the U.S. three month government bond yields and then we estimate the remaining parameters by using option prices. The hybrid model calibrated in this way still outperforms the Heston model highlighting that the stochastic interest rate is a crucial factor (see Section 4.2).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the hybrid SDE model and illustrate the main relevant formulas. In Section 3 we propose formulas to approximate the European vanilla call and put option prices as one-dimensional integrals of explicitly known functions. In Section 4 we illustrate some experiments involving the moments of the price variable and the zero coupon bond formula (Section 4.1). Furthermore, we estimate the model parameters implied by the option prices by solving constrained optimization problems. We use the daily prices of European vanilla call and put options on the U.S. S&P 500 index from April 2, 2012 to July 2, 2012 in Section 4.2, the weekly values of the Credit Agricole pure endowment policy from April 4, 2012 to April 13, 2015 in Section 4.3. In Section 4.4 the daily data of the three-month, two(ten)-year U.S. government bond yields in the period December 31, 2002 to April 3, 2014 are analyzed by estimating the model parameters using the maximum likelihood approach. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5 and in the Appendix we derive the formula for the probability density function and explicit formulas of the moments of the asset price.

In this section we present the Heston hybrid model and some relevant formulas (i.e. transition probability density function, explicit moments of the price variable, the first order moment of the log-price variable, etc.) that are necessary for estimating the model parameters and deducing option pricing formulas.

Roughly speaking, this model generalizes the Heston model within a framework of stochastic interest rates. This stochastic rate is described by the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR for short) model resulting in a hybrid Heston model named HCIR model.

Indeed, this model is closely related to the multi-factor Heston model proposed by Christoffersen et al. (2009). In fact, the latter describes the dynamics of the asset price through several stochastic volatilities while assuming a constant risk free interest rate. We, on the other hand, have made the interest rate a factor driving the price. However, the proposed analytical treatment which allows us to deduce explicit formulas for the conditional moments and mixed moments can also be applied to the Heston multi-factor model in Christoffersen et al. (2009).

                     . The quantities χ, v*, γ, λ, θ, η describe two mean reverting processes: one for the price variance and the other for the stochastic interest rate. More precisely, the quantity χ is the speed of mean reversion of the variance process and v* is its long term meanwhile γ is the so called volatility of variance process (vol of vol for short).

It is worth noting that the variance vt
                      remains positive for any t > 0 with probability one given that 2χ 
                     v*/γ
                     2 > 1 and

                      (see Heston, 1993). As a consequence, the equity price St
                      remains positive for any t > 0 with probability one given that

The parameters λ, θ and η of the CIR model which describe the interest rate, rt
                     , have the same interpretation as the corresponding parameters χ, v* and ϵ of the variance process, vt
                     . Hence, with regard to the variance process, vt
                     , the interest rate, rt
                     , described by the HCIR model remains positive with probability one for any t > 0 given that 2λθ/η
                     2 > 1 and

Furthermore, as in the Grzelak and Oosterlee model, the decomposition of the Wiener processes appearing in (1) allows us to show how the conditional expected value of the log-price depends on ρ
                     
                        p, v
                      as well as on Δ and Ω (see Eq. (24)). This is possible thanks to the explicit formulas of the moments of the (log)price deduced by the analytical treatment of the model illustrated later in this section.

For simplicity, in order to illustrate the analytical treatment, we assume 
                        
                           
                              Ω
                              t
                           
                           =
                           Ω
                           ,
                        
                      with Ω being a positive constant. More general choices of Ωt
                      can be considered while preserving the analytical treatment of the model.

Let us now give the main formulas derived in this paper and used in the simulation and empirical analysis. To this aim, we rewrite the model (1)–(3) in term of the log-price,

                      are real indices. The indices of these Bessel functions are positive under the conditions 2χv*/γ
                     2 > 1 and 2λθ/η
                     2 > 1. Positive indices imply that the modified Bessel functions are bounded at zero and this guarantees that the function pf
                      given in (14) is a probability density function with respect to the future variables.

On the other hand, as already mentioned, these conditions are those that guarantee positive values of the variance and interest rate processes for any time (with probability one) given that the initial stochastic conditions v
                     0, r
                     0 are positive (with probability one).

Moreover, it is worth noting that formula (14) can be interpreted as the inverse Fourier transform of the convolution of the probability density functions associated with the stochastic processes described by Eqs. (7)–(9) when one of the two factors, vt, rt
                     , is dropped. This specific form of the transition probability density function is a consequence of the correlation structure (4) and (5).

                     We highlight that in formulas (17) and (18) the variables x, v, r are the initial values of the log-price, the stochastic variance and the stochastic interest rate respectively. These two last variables are not observable in the financial market and should be estimated using an appropriate calibration procedure. The estimation of the initial stochastic volatility is a common practice as suggested by Bühler (2002).

In addition, formulas (17) and (18) are useful in estimating model parameters using a maximum likelihood approach and deriving the explicit formulas for the moments of the price variable and the mixed moments. In fact, the formula for the mth moment of the price

                     We highlight that formulas (20), (22), (21), (23), (24) are elementary formulas that do not involve integrals. The derivation of these formulas is possible thanks to Eq. (14). This equation reduces the computation of the transition probability density function, which depends on a “regularization” parameter, q, to a one dimensional integral whose integrand function is the product of smooth functions of the future variables. This smoothness is a result of the specific way in which the formula is deduced. This together with an appropriate choice for q permits us to derive elementary formulas for the marginal probability density functions and the moments illustrated above. These formulas are used to estimate the model parameters with great savings of computational time.

In fact, the marginal probability density function, D
                     
                        v, q
                     , can be used to price European call and put options with payoff functions independent of the variance process in the framework of stochastic interest rates. Thus, we use D
                     
                        v, q
                      to deduce formulas for European call and put vanilla options.

As stressed in Christoffersen et al. (2009) a multi-factor model is more flexible for conditional kurtosis and skewness. Thanks to formula (20) we can easily compute these indicators. Finally, a useful byproduct of these formulas is the moments and the mixed moments associated with the Heston model.

In the framework of the model (7)–(9) we derive integral formulas to approximate the prices of European vanilla call and put options with strike price E and maturity time T. This is done using the no arbitrage pricing theory. As illustrated in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011) we compute the option price as the expected value of the discounted payoff with respect to an equivalent martingale measure known as a risk-neutral measure (see, for example, Duffie, 2001; Schoutens, 2003; Wong & Heyde, 2006). Denoting the spot price at time zero by S
                     0 and the initial stochastic interest rate and variance by r
                     0 and v
                     0 respectively, we can compute the prices of these European vanilla call and put options as follows:

                      and the expectation is taken under the risk-neutral measure Q. In the numerical experiments we use only option prices to calibrate the model. That is, we use only the risk-neutral measure and not the physical one. As a consequence, it is not necessary to introduce the risk premia parameters.

Note that v
                     0 is not observable in the market and that an appropriate choice for r
                     0 is unclear. For these reasons we consider v
                     0 and r
                     0 as model parameters that must be estimated (see Section 4).

However, the model parameter estimation requires the numerical evaluation of formulas (25), (26) which is very time consuming. We overcome this difficulty using formulas introduced in the previous section while approximating the stochastic integral that defines the discount factor as follows:

                     Note that in formulas (29) and (31) we have denoted the expected values appearing in the left and right hand sides of Eq. (28)
with B(r
                     0, T) and BA
                     (r
                     0, T) respectively to highlight the dependence of these formulas on r
                     0 and T. It is worthy to note that formula (31) differs from that presented in Choi and Wirjanto (2007) in that the latter is based on a suitable approximation of the stochastic differential equation that defines the interest rate while our formula is obtained using the integral representation formula of the transition probability density and a specific approximation of the stochastic interest rate process.

The simulation study, illustrated in Section 4, shows that formula (31) satisfactorily approximates zero-coupon bonds with maturities up to twenty years. In fact, comparing the zero-coupon bond values obtained using Eqs. (31) and (29) we show that the approximation (31) guarantees at least five correct significant digits for maturity up to 20 years (see Table 1
                     ). This good performance of formula (31) guarantees a good approximation when used to price options.

As shown in Section 4 this approximation works well also for long maturity. Furthermore, the use of formula (27) allows us to reduce the computation of the option prices to the evaluation of a one dimensional integral. In fact, let pf

                     We use these formulas in the empirical analysis to compare the performance of the Heston model and the stochastic model proposed here in interpreting real data. It is worth noting that the integrand functions appearing in formulas (34)–(37) are smooth functions whose integration does not require a specific care. This regularity is due to the specific approach used to derive them.

In this section we illustrate some experiments on simulated data as well as an empirical analysis relative to the U.S. S&P 500 index and its European options and some insurance policy known as pure endowment policy. This analysis uses a suitable calibration of the model parameters.

In this subsection we propose two experiments to validate the formula to approximate the stochastic integral (see Eqs. (31) and (27)) and the formulas of the moments (see Eq. (20)).

The first experiment analyzes the performance of formula (31) in approximating the bond price.

We consider two sets of parameter values.

The relative errors in Table 1 show that the approximate formula guarantees at least five correct significant digits for maturity up to 20 years. This is a satisfactory result that supports the approximation of the discount factor given in formula (27).

In the second experiment we compare the first two theoretical moments given in Eq. (20) (i.e.

                        ) with those attained using the Monte Carlo method. The latter is implemented integrating numerically the stochastic differential equations with the explicit Euler method with variable step-size. The largest value of the Euler step-size is

The upper panels of Fig. 1
                         show the first and second moments of the asset price variable as a function of time computed using Eq. (20) (solid line) and the Monte Carlo method (dotted line). The lower panel shows the corresponding relative errors. The values of the model parameters are those of Set 
                        A. The moments obtained using the Monte Carlo method approximate quite well those obtained with the theoretical formulas. However, the theoretical formulas lead to significant savings in computing time. In fact, the Monte Carlo method requires about ten minutes while formula (20) requires only a few milliseconds when their Matlab code is run on a laptop with Intel core i3 processor and 8 gigabyte of RAM.

In this subsection, we conduct an empirical analysis calibrating the model parameters against real data. The calibration procedure is based on the solution of an appropriate nonlinear constrained least squares problem, whose set of feasible vectors,

                        where R
                        12 denotes the 12-dimensional Euclidean real space.

We highlight that the set 
                           V
                         also includes the initial stochastic volatility and interest rate, v
                        0, r
                        0, of the stochastic model (7)–(9). That is, the initial values v
                        0, r
                        0 are considered parameters to be estimated via the calibration procedure.

This choice is motivated by the fact that v
                        0 cannot be observed in the market while r
                        0 refers to a risk free interest rate associated with the risk neutral measure and, subsequently, its value is not clearly identified by the financial market. The estimation of the initial stochastic volatility is a common practice since 2002 (see, for example, Bühler, 2002), while the interest rate has been estimated only recently (see, for example, Fatone et al., 2009, 2013; Grzelak & Oosterlee, 2011).

In order to formulate the least square problem, we have to define the objective function. Let nD

                        We also calibrate the Heston model (Heston, 1993) by solving problem (40) with the appropriate adjustments. That is, we remove the parameters of the stochastic interest rate model with the exception of the parameter r
                        0.

We use formulas (34)–(37) to evaluate option prices. The one-dimensional integrals appearing in these formulas are computed using the midpoint quadrature rule with 214 nodes.

This quadrature rule gives satisfactory approximations since the integrand functions appearing in Eqs. (34)–(37) are smooth functions whose numerical integration does not require special care.

Moreover, problem (40) is solved using a steepest descent algorithm with variable metric (see, for example, Fatone et al., 2013; Recchioni & Scoccia, 2000). The real data analyzed are the daily closing values of the U.S. S&P 500 index and the daily closing prices of the European call and put options on this index. These options have an expiry date of March 16, 2013 with strike prices

Fig. 2(b) shows the U.S. three month government yields (in percent) as a function of time. Usually, the short-dated government bonds are used as proxy of the risk free interest rate and we expect that the initial stochastic interest rate r
                        0 and the long-term mean θ have values similar to those in Fig. 2(b) from April 2 to July 27, 2012.

In the empirical analysis we consider a rolling window of six consecutive trading day data (i.e.

                        ). We move this window by one day along the historical series. The time window covers the period April 2 to July 2, 2012. In this way we solve

                         have a twofold effect. First, we have a sufficient number of data to validate the model (sixty option values). Second, we obtain a “daily” time series of the estimated parameters. The values of the parameters obtained in the jth window are representative of the last day of the jth window.

It is worth noting that when the time series of the parameter values are constant the model (7)–(9) will correctly interpret the asset price dynamics. In fact, when the values of the estimated parameters are constant in time, the model is able to reproduce the asset price dynamics in the analyzed period by using only one set of model parameters. Figs. 4
                         and 5

                        .

We can observe that these values are relatively constant as a function of time.

We observe a significant difference between the initial interest rate r
                        0 of the hybrid Heston model (i.e. r
                        0 ≈ 0.00022) and the Heston model (i.e. r
                        0 ≈ 0.04). The two models also differ in the value of the vol of vol γ and the correlation coefficient ρ
                        
                           p, v
                        . In fact, as already stressed by Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011), the hybrid Heston model shows lower values of the parameter γ and a more negative correlation coefficient ρ
                        
                           p, v
                         with respect to the Heston model. The lower value of γ may be due to the additional volatility coming from the interest rate process, while the more negative correlation may be due to an increase of the leverage effect caused by the previously mentioned additional volatility.

The values of the initial stochastic interest rate r
                        0 and of θ are about 0.02 percent and 0.04 percent, that is values comparable with those shown in Fig. 2(b). Moreover, Fig. 2(b) shows an abrupt change of the yield trend in February. This abrupt change may explain the fluctuations of the initial stochastic rate shown in Fig. 5.


                        Figs. 6
                         and 7
                         show the in-sample values of the European call and put option prices obtained using the Heston (dashed line) and the hybrid Heston (dotted line) models with the parameters estimated in the period April 2, 2012 to July 2, 2012.

These figures show that the theoretical option prices of the hybrid Heston model provide satisfactory approximations of observed put prices for all values of the strike prices and time to maturity. These values outperform those obtained with the Heston model. Both models overestimate the observed values of the call options, but their relative errors are reduced by over one half using the hybrid Heston model. In fact, the sample mean of the relative errors of the call and put options are 9.6 percent and 6.9 percent for the hybrid Heston model while 21.2 percent and 11.2 percent for the Heston model.


                        Figs. 4–7 show that the hybrid Heston model is capable of matching with sufficient accuracy both call and put option prices for several strike prices and expiry dates using only one set of parameters. This results from the use of a stochastic interest rate.

We use the value of the model parameters estimated in the last window, June 25, 2012–July 2, 2012, to evaluate the out-of-sample European call and put option prices. The out-of-sample period is July 3 to July 27, 2012. The time to maturity for this period is 176–160 days. We measure the performance of the stochastic model proposed and its parameter estimation procedure with an “a posteriori” validation. That is, we compare the observed out-of-sample option prices with those obtained using formulas (36), (37), (34), (35) which use estimated parameters and observed spot prices.


                        Figs. 8
                         and 9
                        
                         show the out-of-sample option prices for the hybrid model (dotted line) and for the Heston model (dashed line).

The out-of-sample put option prices of the Heston model are very accurate while the call option prices are not. The hybrid Heston model provides accurate approximations of put option prices and outperforms the Heston model in approximating the call options. In fact, the sample mean of the relative errors on the put and call options obtained using the hybrid Heston model are 9.5 percent and 7.8 percent and using the Heston model are 9.6 percent and 17.9 percent.

In conclusion, the empirical analysis shows that the hybrid model interprets satisfactorily the real data considered in the period April 2 to July 27 2012 using only one set of model parameters. Moreover, the values of the initial stochastic rate, r
                        0, could be considered a proxy of the short-dated government bond yield. The results illustrated here are consistent with those obtained using the multi-factor stochastic volatility model of Christoffersen et al. (2009). Indeed, in the latter the authors use two stochastic factors but they are not specified. The results shown in this subsection suggest that the stochastic interest rate is one of these volatility factors.

To provide further evidence on the role of the stochastic interest rate, we conclude this subsection by repeating the previous analysis with an alternative calibration procedure which includes the U.S. three month government bond yields as data in the parameter estimation. Specifically, we use a two-stage calibration procedure to estimate the model parameters. Several two stage procedures applied to multi-factor stochastic volatility models can be found in the literature such as those illustrated in Christoffersen et al. (2009) and Islyaev and Date (2015).

The two stage calibration used here consists of a first stage where we estimate the parameters λ, θ, η and r
                        0 of the interest rate process using the U.S. three month government bond yields. This is done by minimizing the squared residuals of the observed and theoretical bond values employing the same rolling window of the experiment described immediately above. Then, in the second stage we calibrate the remaining parameters using option prices.

As in the previous experiment, we compare both in-sample and out-of-sample observed option prices with the option prices provided by the hybrid Heston model calibrated with this two stage procedure. The sample mean of the in-sample relative errors of the call and put options are 8.3 percent and 9.4 percent for the hybrid Heston model calibrated with the two stage procedure while, as already mentioned, they are 21.2 percent and 11.2 percent for the Heston model. The sample mean of the out-of-sample relative errors of the call and put options are 8.3 percent and 8.8 percent for the hybrid Heston model calibrated with the two stage procedure while they are 17.9 percent and 9.6 percent for the Heston model. Fig. 10 shows the parameters estimated with the two stage approach (dotted line) and those estimated using option prices (solid line) which have already been shown in Figs. 4 and 5. As we can see the parameter values estimated by using the two step procedure are basically the same obtained without using the two stage calibration except for Δ and Ω in the time windows indexed by 30 to 55 which corresponds to the period May 23, 2012 to June 25, 2012. Note that in this period the U.S. S&P 500 index shows abrupt oscillations (see Fig. 2(a)). We note that the y-scale of the graphs relative to the parameters ρ
                        
                           p, v
                        , v
                        0 of Fig. 10 differs from the y-scale of Fig. 4 in order to show the slight difference in the estimated values of these parameters.

The results obtained using the two stage calibration provides empirical evidence that the stochastic interest rate is a crucial volatility factor. In fact, the hybrid Heston model significantly outperforms the Heston one even when we use the two-stage calibration where the interest rate process parameters are estimated without using option prices.

In this subsection we show the ability of the hybrid model to price long-run products. We estimate the model parameters by using the time series of a pure endowment policy of the Crédit Agricole insurance company. Specifically, we use the weekly data of the index linked policy, Azione Più Capitale Garantito Em.64, freely available at the website http://www.previdoc.it/d/Ana/CREM64/_credit-agricole-vita-azione-piu-em64-01082017.

On the maturity date Action Capital Piú Guaranteed Em.64 policy guarantees the insured, should he be living, the payment of the premium plus a variable bonus obtained by multiplying the premium by 35 percent of the relative difference

We model the risky asset specified in the contract under the risk-neutral measure (using the hybrid Heston model) and the mortality risk under the physical measure (using the mean reverting Gompertz model, see Milevsky and Promislow, 2001) with the assumption that these two measures are independent. As a consequence, the pricing of this policy consists in the evaluation of the following product:

                        The parameters appearing in formula (44) are chosen as shown in Table 2
                        . These values are motivated by the analysis proposed in Recchioni and Screpante (2014) on a similar Crédit Agricole pure endowment policy.

We estimate the model parameters solving the calibration problem (40) after appropriate adjustments (i.e. removing the put option prices and replacing the call option prices with policy prices). We use formula (34) to evaluate the first expected value appearing in Eq. (42). As in Section 4.2 the integrals are computed by using the midpoint quadrature rule with 214 nodes.

We use the weekly prices covering the period April 4, 2012 to April 13, 2015 corresponding to 152 observations. In formula (39) we choose

                         (i.e. one strike price Sr
                        ). We consider a rolling window of size nT
                         and we move this window along the time series discarding the oldest observed price of the window and inserting the new observed one. In this way we solve sixty problems covering the period April 4, 2012 to August 4, 2014 and we obtain a time series of each parameter made of weekly observations. The parameter value estimated in a given time window is associated with the last date of the window. Fig. 11 shows the estimated values as a function of the window index. We can observe that the time series are approximately constant except for the time series of r
                        0 which shows some oscillations in the year 2014.

We use the model parameters estimated in the last window to evaluate the policy out-sample that is in the period August 11, 2014 to April 13, 2015. Fig. 12
                         shows the in-sample and out-sample observed policy values (solid line), the approximations obtained with the hybrid model (dashed line) and those obtained with the Heston model (dotted line). The observed policy values and their approximations before the vertical bar are in-sample while those after the vertical bar are out-of sample. We can observe that the hybrid model outperforms the Heston one in both the in-sample and out-of-sample. More specifically, the average relative error of the hybrid model approximations is 2.5 percent and
                         the maximum is 5.7 percent, while those of the Heston approximations is 4.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively.

In this section we illustrate some preliminary results regarding the application of the hybrid model in interpreting bond yield term structure. Specifically, we show the model’s ability to capture the relationship between short and long term bond yields and to forecast their upward/downward trend. This application is possible because the hybrid model proposed here is closely related to the multi-factor stochastic volatility model of Trolle and Schwartz (2009). In fact, roughly speaking, the hybrid model is similar to the Trolle and Schwartz model when only two stochastic factors are chosen: one is the short term yield and the other is the long-term yield volatility. Recently, Cieslak and Povala (2014) showed that the use of the short term rate as a volatility factor provides a good fitting of the bond yield term structure.

Specifically, we describe the generic U.S. two(ten)-year government bond yield using Eq. (7) where one factor is the volatility of the two(ten)-year bond yield and another factor is the generic U.S. three-month government bond yield. Fig. 13 shows the yield values in the period December 31, 2002 to April 3, 2014.

                        Fig. 14 shows the model parameters estimated with daily data of the three-month and two-year government bond yields using a time window of one month,

                         (solid line). We can observe that the estimates obtained behave similarly except for the parameters v
                        0, Δ and Ω. In fact, the estimates of these parameters obtained using one-month time windows show oscillations which are more pronounced than those obtained using a three month window. This is especially true when the index value is in the interval [1900, 2200] which corresponds approximately to the period July 2010 to September 2011. These oscillations seem to precede the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.

                         shows the results obtained using the three-month bond yield as a volatility factor to describe the two year government bond yield. Specifically, Fig. 15 displays the true log-returns (solid line and squares), the forecast log-returns (dotted line and stars) and the naive forecast log-returns (dashed line and circles). We can observe that the forecast values obtained using the hybrid model are able to capture the trend of the log-return better than the naive approach in periods where the yields experienced strong fluctuations such as the crisis that followed the Lehman bankruptcy in the middle of September 2008 (lower left panel of Fig. 15) and the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2011 (lower right panel of Fig. 15).

To better analyze the quality of the forecasts in predicting the trend, we compute how many times the forecast values match the upward/downward trend of the observed values. Note that the upward/downward trend is given by the sign of the difference between the value at

                        Table 3
                         illustrates the results of the trend forecasts obtained by first using the three-month and two-year government bond yields and then using the three-month and ten-year ones. Table 3 shows that the hybrid model forecasts outperform the naive ones in all cases considered except for the one-month ahead forecasts of the 10-year bond yield. This may be due to the fact that the maturity of the short-term bond yield used in the calibration is three months which may be too long for one-month ahead forecasts. Finally, Fig. 16 compares the estimates of the parameters obtained calibrating the hybrid model with a rolling time window of three months. The solid line indicates the values of the model parameters obtained by three-month and two year bond yields while the dashed line those obtained by three-month and ten-year yields. It is worth noting that the estimated values of the parameters obtained using the ten-year bond yields display less fluctuations than those obtained using two-year yields. This is particularly true for the parameters γ, χ, v
                        0, v* and η, λ, θ which are related to the volatility of the stochastic processes which describe the long-term yield. This finding is coherent with the fact that bond yields with long-maturity usually are less volatile than those with short maturity. As previously mentioned, this is only a preliminary analysis on the use of this hybrid model to study the term structure of yields. However, the results seem to be encouraging.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We present a Heston model with a stochastic interest rate. This model can be seen as a modified version of the model in Grzelak and Oosterlee (2011) as well as of the multi-factor Heston model in Christoffersen et al. (2009) where a volatility factor is the interest rate. This hybrid model is analytically tractable. The analytical treatment is based on a simple “trick” which allows us to suitably parameterize the transition probability density function. That is, the transition probability density function is expressed as a one-dimensional integral of a smooth integrand function which depends on a real parameter q. Thanks to this formula and suitable choices for the parameter q, we deduce explicit elementary formulas for the moments and mixed moments of the price and log-price variables as well as efficient formulas to approximate the option prices.

We conduct an empirical analysis of three different data-sets. The empirical analysis of European call and put options on the U.S. S&P 500 index shows that the hybrid Heston model outperforms the Heston model in interpreting both call and put option prices. In fact, the use of a two stage calibration provides empirical evidence that the stochastic interest rate plays a significant role as a volatility factor in the option pricing. Moreover, the hybrid Heston model outperforms the Heston one even when the Credit Agricole policy values are analyzed. This result is not surprising since the assumption of constant interest rate is not realistic in the pricing of long-term products.

Finally, the preliminary results of the empirical analysis on U.S. government bond yields confirm the validity of the Heston-like multi-factor stochastic volatility models to interpret bond yield term structure. The use of short-term yields as a volatility factor is a recent approach of Cieslak and Povala (2014) that deserves further investigation.

In conclusion, the hybrid model seems to interpret satisfactorily call and put option prices and, consequently, the volatility implied by these prices. It also holds promise in analyzing the term structure of yields.

The use of this model to forecast implied volatility as well as the use of the moment formulas to calibrate the model following the approach of Date and Islyaev (2015) will be the object of future research.

In this section we derive an integral representation formula for the transition probability density function of the process described by Eqs. (7)–(9) and initial conditions (11).

In addition, we deduce the moments of the price variable and the mixed moments.

                     The representation formula (47) for the transition probability density function pf
                      depends on a “regularization” parameter, q, which plays a crucial role in deriving explicit formulas for option pricing and conditional mixed moments.

Using (47) into (12) we obtain that the function f is the solution of the following problem:

                     Using Eqs. (83)–(86) and the definitions of the marginal distribution and of the moments with an easy computation we obtain formulas (17), (18), (20), (22), (21).

We conclude this section with some comments on the existence of the moments. Formula (20) shows that the existence of the moments is guaranteed when ζ
