                  There is increased interest in deploying charging station infrastructure for electric vehicles, due to the increasing adoption of such vehicles to reduce emissions. However, there are a number of key challenges for providing high quality of service to such vehicles, stemming from technological reasons. One of them is due to the relative slow charging times and the other is due to the relative limited battery range. Hence, developing efficient routing strategies of electric vehicles requesting charging to stations that have available charging resources is an important component of the infrastructure. In this work, we propose a queueing modeling framework for the problem at hand and develop such routing strategies that optimise a performance metric related to vehicles’ sojourn time in the system. By incorporating appropriate weights into the well-known dynamic routing discipline “Join-the-Shortest-Queue”, we show that the proposed routing strategies not only do they maximise the queueing system’s throughput, but also significantly mitigate the vehicle’s sojourn time. The strategies are also adaptive in nature and responsive to changes in the speed of charging at the stations, the distribution of the vehicles’ point of origin when requesting service, the traffic congestion level and the vehicle speed; all the above are novel aspects and compatible with the requirements of a modern electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the last few years a strong push is occurring to reduce the use of hydrocarbons in the transportation sector. This trend is supported by the latest advances in battery and power electronics technology, along with government mandates on energy independence and resilience, as well as an increased emphasis on a smarter infrastructure. It is strongly enabled by the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) and their close relatives Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) by major car manufacturers that have drastically increased consumer choices.

According to a recent report of the International Energy Agency (2012a), the transportation ‘ accounted for 6.7 gigatons of emitted CO2 or 22 percent of the world’s total. Further, global fuel demand for transportation is projected to grow approximately 40 percent by 2035 International Energy Agency (2012b), driven by the rapid adoption of automobiles in the fast growing economies of China, India and more recently in the African continent. EV/PHEVs represent an innovative technology that could help address both environmental concerns and longer term reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, fast EV adoption relies on a number of socio-economic, as well as technological factors. Key socio-economic factors include stringent emissions regulations, rising fuel prices and financial incentive programs OECD/International Energy Agency (2013), while the most pressing technological one is the large scale deployment of an efficient and well managed charging station infrastructure. At present, there are diverging forecasts on the growth rate of the EV population International Energy Agency (2011), although there is consensus that it is going to represent a sizable portion (at least 7 percent in the US) of the national fleet by 2025–30. Obviously, penetration rates could be significantly higher than these estimates depending on how the aforementioned socio-economic and technological factors evolve. Further, the impact of fast adoption of EVs on utilities and on the stability of the grid is mostly dependent on regional or even local penetration rates; e.g., Southern California Edison has projected a penetration rate larger than 7 percent in its service territory already by 2020.

The key concern regarding rapid adoption of EVs by utilities is that they could have a disruptive impact on the power grid, since under Level 1 charging conditions, an EV represents a load equivalent to 50 percent of that of a house, while under Level 2 conditions it represents a 2.5-fold equivalent load. Obviously, the extent of their impact will depend on the degree and local/regional density of their penetration, charging requirements and the time of the day they are charged. However, studies have shown that a fleet of EVs can be effectively powered by the underutilised electric power grid during the off-peak hours with little need to increase the energy delivery capacity of the existing grid infrastructure (Taylor, Maitra, Alexander, Brooks, & Duvall, 2010) if scheduled carefully. Hence, the literature has focused on coming up with efficient schedules of charging EVs overnight, e.g. an incentive based energy consumption controlling scheme was introduced in Caron and Kesidis (2010), and a direct load control (DLC) scheme for residential energy control was discussed in Ruiz, Cobelo, and Oyarzabal (2009); Wu, Wang, and Goel (2010). To achieve a sustainable electrification of the transportation sector, a robust charging station infrastructure needs to be in place that would not interfere with regular grid operations and at the same time address EV driver’s range anxiety resulting from the limited ability to recharge EVs in a time commensurable with filling the tank of a gas-powered vehicle. Specifically, UCLA Smart Grid Energy Research Center argues that if 25 percent of all vehicles were pure EVs, the current US power grid would be challenged in meeting the demand for power. For some utilities, even adding Level-2 charging infrastructure may overload distribution transformers during peak hours. On the driver’s quality-of-service issue, note that charging EVs is an inherently slow process (it takes between 20 minutes to several hours to fully charge them, depending on the technology used (Lukic, Cao, Bansal, Rodriguez, & Emadi, 2008)), thus requiring careful planning and control to accommodate customers.

In this study, we focus on the development of efficient routing strategies for a general model of EV charging systems with fully random environments, so as to provide quality service to EV drivers and release their range anxiety. This directly leads to the goal of minimising the strategy’s performance metrics related to “sojourn time” (including EV’s travel time, waiting time for charging, and charging time), which is different from the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) (Dantzig & Ramser, 1959; Pillac, Gendreau, Guéret, & Medaglia, 2013) and Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (DTRP) (Bertsimas & Ryzin, 1990, 1993) that involve design of vehicle-delivery routes from a depot to a set of scattered demand locations, so as to minimise the overall routing cost (e.g., travel time/distance) under various side constraints (Baldacci, Toth, & Vigo, 2007; Ferrucci, Block, & Gendreau, 2013; Jaillet & Wagner, 2008; Kergosien, Lenté, Piton, & Billaut, 2011; Laporte, 2007, 2009; Li, Mirchandani, & Borenstein, 2009; Pavone, Frazzoli, & Bullo, 2007; Pillac et al., 2013; Solomon, 1987). We assume that service demands are placed by the EV drivers according to a general process, and the distribution of the locations of where EVs originate is arbitrary, although its support is determined by a compact Euclidean service region. There are K charging stations located in the service region, and each of them has a known charging speed (usually in kiloWatt-hours). Upon the request of service, each EV is directed to one of the stations according to some routing policy and heads to the station at a constant speed. After entering the station, EVs queue up to be serviced and their charging times are assumed to be randomly distributed from an arbitrary distribution. We also assume that real-time communication between vehicles and the decision maker is possible (e.g., advanced mobile phones or global positioning systems (GPS) can be integrated into the vehicle devices). These flexible assumptions are suitable for real-life settings, but also require more complicated routing strategies (e.g., dynamic/online routing) for solving the designated optimisation problem.

Note that the way we formulate the problem allows us to depict the EV service system as an acyclic network with two layers of feed-forward parallel queues (see Section 2 for details), thus facilitating the development of routing strategies and fundamental analysis regarding throughput and stability. For example, it was shown that the dynamic routing strategy “Join-the-Shortest-Queue” (JSQ) along with a scheduling policy based on “maximal matching” maximises the throughput of a general acyclic network and achieves system stability defined by the uniform mean recurrence time (Hung & Michailidis, 2012). Although the EV system described here has different characteristics (see Section 2 for details), the JSQ strategy appears to retain the property of throughput maximisation (see Section 4 for details). However, to minimise a key performance metric -the vehicle’s sojourn time in the system- the routing strategy must in addition be responsive to other system states and control parameters. In this work, we show that the vehicle’s sojourn time can be significantly mitigated by incorporating the following two factors as “weights” into the JSQ policy: (i) the rate at which vehicles can be charged at the stations and (ii) the distance of the EV to each station upon its service request. Further, its performance is adaptive to the change of several control parameters, such as the speed of charging stations, the distribution of demand locations, the traffic congestion level, and the vehicle speed. It should be noted that the idea to integrate the elements of queue length, service rate and distance to the charging facility in the development of routing strategies for queueing systems has not been proposed in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 depicts a general model for the EV service system with fully random environments, characterises the system’s maximum throughput based on the capacity of each service station, and defines system stability via the uniform mean recurrence time property. Section 3 introduces some routing policies, some of which have been used in different settings in the literature, while others have to property of maximising the system’s throughput. The performance of some of these policies is assessed numerically in Section 5. Section 4 establishes that the proposed weighted versions of JSQ policies indeed maximise the system’s throughput under fairly weak stochastic assumptions on the arrival and service (charging) processes. Since appropriate dependence structures are allowed for the arrival, service, and routing processes, a technique called the “perturbed Lyapunov function method” (Hung & Michailidis, 2012; Kushner, 1967) was employed to obtain the result. Section 5 evaluates the proposed throughput-maximising policies in terms of their sojourn-time metrics under various control parameter settings through a simulation study. Some concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.

Suppose there are K EV charging stations placed in a compact Euclidean region

                      whose locations are denoted by

                     . Service demands for charging are placed by EV drivers at random locations in region 
                        R
                      according to a general random process with rate λ, and we assume the demand locations follow an arbitrary distribution F over the region 
                        R
                     . Upon request of service, each EV is guided to one of the charging stations according to some routing policy π and heads to the station, for simplicity, at a constant speed v > 0. Note that the latter assumption is made to simplify the exposition, although in practice v can be a non-decreasing function of λ; e.g. one may imagine that vehicles slow down when the system is heavily loaded. We also assume that assigned EV routes do not change, while the EVs are in route to the assigned station. Finally, to simplify the formulation of the problem, we assume that each charging station comprises of an infinite buffer first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue and a charger with random service times. When the EV is charged (service completed), it leaves the system immediately.

                     (l) > 0 for each charging station k, the demand for charging stemming from arriving EVs to the system is then divided into K parallel flows passing through, respectively, the K charging stations. At any event time

                     which is based on the property of ergodicity for long-term observation. Second, note that each divided flow k comprises of two queues in tandem, where the lengths of the first-layer (which is actually a virtual queue) and second-layer queues at time tn
                      are Mk

                      gives a graphical presentation of the system described above. Since there is “no delay” on the service of the vehicles in the first-layer queues (i.e., vehicles head to the designated service stations immediately after the service request), each one of the first-layer queues can be treated as a G/G/∞ (but not necessarily FIFO), with the mean service time (or mean travel time) being defined as

The first step here is to develop a routing policy so that system stability can be established for any input rate

                      under fairly mild assumptions. Since no strong assumptions are made for all the involved stochastic processes, the stability is defined via the “uniform mean recurrence time” property (Hung & Michailidis, 2012; Kushner, 1967). That is, the system is said to be stable if there exists some positive integer b
                     0 and nonnegative real-valued function F( · ) such that for any n and

We next introduce selected routing policies, some of which are popular in the literature, while others can potentially maximise the throughput of the system.

The key objective of this policy is simple and straightforward - direct EVs to the nearest station upon their demand for service (Solomon, 1987). The associated routing processes are then given by

                         for all j ≠ k, the maximum throughput is simply μk

Note that π
                        5 can be viewed as the converse of the “maximal matching” discipline in the queueing literature (Armony & Bambos, 2003; Hung & Michailidis, 2012, 2008; Mekkittikul & McKeown, 1996) and many of the existing policies can be included under this framework. For example, if wj
                         are the same for all j, then π
                        5 reduces to the standard JSQ policy; if Qj
                        (ti

                        5 is equivalent to π
                        1. However, the choice of wj
                         will not affect the system’s throughput and stability (see Section 4 for details).

It is also worth noting that π
                        4 and π
                        5 are both maximum throughput policies. However, due to the shortcomings of π
                        4 mentioned earlier, the theoretic aspects of system stability will be investigated by utilising merely π
                        5 in the remainder of this work.

We first show that policy π
                     5 maximises the system’s throughput and achieves the stability defined in (11). Suppose relaxed assumptions such as correlated vehicle arrival times, correlated vehicle service times, and interdependent routing processes are made. These assumptions then lead to non-Markovian dynamics for the arrival and service processes of the system, for which a more general framework provided by the perturbed Lyapunov function method (Hung & Michailidis, 2012; Kushner, 1967) will be used. Note that to utilise the perturbed Lyapunov function method, one usually starts with a standard Lyapunov function V(Q(tn
                     )) and then incorporates a perturbation term δV(tn
                     ) into V(Q(tn
                     )). By placing a reasonable bound on δV(tn
                     ),

                      can then be used to show the desired system stability.

The following assumptions are needed to establish the stability result.

When the future becomes less and less predictable, it is assumed that the conditional likelihood of such interdependence gets weaker.

                           This is basically a combination of Assumptions 1 and 2. Moreover, it allows the existence of a cross-dependence structure between the routing process and the arrival process. When the future becomes less and less predictable, it is assumed that the conditional cross-dependence gets weaker.

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the introduced maximal throughput policies in terms of the sojourn-time metrics via computer simulation. Note that the sojourn time in this setting corresponds to the amount of time that an EV spends in the system, which by definition includes its travel time (to the station), waiting time (for charging), and charging time. The core of the simulator was written in C++, while the simulation setup is described as follows.

                      (Join-the-Doubly-Weighted-Shortest-Queue policy, abbreviated as JDWSQ). Note that wj
                      associated with the JDWSQ policy clearly represents a random process (not just a constant). However, the policy becomes more flexible by taking into account “the distance from the demand location to each service station”. The numerical results show that the sojourn time can be mitigated with respect to a large class of control parameters based on such a routing scheme.
                  

The mean sojourn times under the four policies RR, JSQ, JWSQ, and JDWSQ, for various choices of the input rate λ and EV speed v, are depicted in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the JDWSQ policy outperforms the other three policies for most of the simulation scenarios. An exception is found in the case that system is heavily loaded (
                           
                              λ
                              =
                              10.9
                           
                        ) and EV speed is relatively low (
                           
                              v
                              =
                              0.5
                           
                        ), for which the JWSQ policy appears to perform best in minimising the mean sojourn time. Note that as the EV speed increases, the difference between policies JWSQ and JDWSQ becomes less significant. Such a phenomenon will be further discussed in Section 5.3.1.

The 95th percentile of the distribution of sojourn times under the four policies RR, JSQ, JWSQ, and JDWSQ, for various choices of the input rate λ and EV speed v, are depicted in Fig. 5
                        . As can be seen, the JDWSQ policy performs best for various choices of EV speed when the system is lightly or moderately loaded. On the other hand, the JWSQ performs best for various choices of EV speed when the system is more heavily loaded. The results may come from the intuition that, when the EV speeds are slow, the JDWSQ policy would be largely affected by the “demand locations” generated by the underlying random mechanism, thus increasing the variation of the resulting sojourn time. Analogously, the difference between policies JWSQ and JDWSQ becomes less significant as the EV speed increases.

The sojourn time performance is of particular interest in practice when the system is heavily loaded (i.e., λ is large). This usually coincides with a higher traffic congestion level and results in slower EV speeds (i.e., smaller values of v), as mentioned earlier in Section 2. In this section we introduce how to modify the JDWSQ policy so that the sojourn time metrics can be further mitigated when λ is large. We also show that the performance of the distance-based policies is fairly robust to a number of control parameters, such as the input rate λ, the EV speed v, the service rates μk
                        , and the distribution F of demand locations.

As can be seen from the numerical results in Section 5.1, the JDWSQ policy is not optimal in minimising the mean sojourn time when λ is large and v is small. Next, we provide insights on why policy JDWSQ may not be optimal for this metric in such a setting. Suppose there is a 2-station service system with

                           . It is clear that policy JDWSQ will direct the vehicle to S
                           1. Consider the scenario that the 10 vehicles on the first flow are all ahead of the current arriving vehicle (i.e., li
                            is the farthest from S
                           1 compared to other vehicle locations on the first flow) and the 11 vehicles on the second flow are all behind the current arriving vehicle (i.e., li
                            is the closet to S
                           2 compared to other vehicle locations on the second flow). Since v is small, it is expected that relatively few vehicles are waiting in both service stations most of the time. In this case, directing the arriving vehicle to S
                           2 (though it has a smaller service rate) might be a better choice since its location is much closer to S
                           2 and there are no vehicles ahead (thus has a shorter waiting time for service). The above example suggests that, instead of looking at all the vehicles on each flow, in the policy one may consider the number of vehicles “ahead of the arriving vehicle”. Therefore, the routing process associated with the JDWSQ policy can be justified by

Let us consider the same service system as in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 with 
                              
                                 λ

                            (recall that the maximum throughput is 11). Tables 1
                            and 2
                            show the mean and 95th percentile sojourn times under policies JSQ, JWSQ, JDWSQ and their modifications based on Hj
                           (ti
                           ) (denoted by JSQ*, JWSQ*, and JDWSQ*), with various choices of EV speed v. As can be seen, the modified version of the JDWSQ policy (i.e., the JDWSQ* policy) improves both the sojourn time metrics when the EV speeds are slow (i.e., 
                              
                                 v

                            and 0.5), while policies JSQ and JWSQ do not benefit from such modifications for most of the cases. It should also be noted that, though the distance-based policies (i.e., JDWSQ and JDWSQ*) are suboptimal in minimising the 95th percentile sojourn time (see Table 2), numerical results show that they remain fairly competitive (compared to policy JWSQ) under this particular simulation setup.

In this section, we show that the proposed distance-based policies also work well for a system comprising of homogeneous charging stations. Consider the same service system as in Sections 5.1–5.3 with 
                              
                                 μ
                                 =

                                 4
                                 ,
                                 4
                                 ,
                                 4
                                 )
                                 ,
                              
                            viz., the speeds of three charging stations are all the same. In this case, the two policies JSQ and JWSQ are obviously identical. Table 3
                            shows the mean and 95th percentile sojourn times under policies JSQ/JWSQ, JDWSQ, and JDWSQ* with a heavily loaded input rate 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 11.9
                              
                            (the maximum throughput is 12) and various EV speeds 
                              
                                 v
                                 =
                              
                            0.1, 0.5, 2, 10. As can be seen from Table 3, the JDWSQ policy outperforms the JSQ/JWSQ policy in terms of both the mean and 95th percentile sojourn time for all EV speeds considered in this study. The numerical results strongly support that incorporating “distance” as another weight in the policy is beneficial for such systems. However, numerical results show that both the mean and 95th percentile sojourn time are not further improved by the JDWSQ* policy.

In this section, we show that the distance-based policies also work well for the system with non-uniform demand locations. Let us consider the same service system in Sections 5.1–5.2 with

As can be seen, for this particular case policy JDWSQ* outperforms all the other policies in terms of both sojourn time metrics. As the EV speed becomes slower, numerical results show that the improvement in both sojourn time metrics becomes more significant.

We have introduced a general modeling framework for EV service systems and established that a class of dynamic routing policies maximises the throughput and maintains system stability defined via the uniform mean recurrence time under fairly weak stochastic assumptions. As the dependence structure is appropriately incorporated into the vehicle arrival, service, and routing processes, the theoretical results are established via a technique called the perturbed Lyapunov function method. Simulation results show that the proposed weighted versions of the JSQ policy, titled JWSQ, JDWSQ and JDWSQ*, outperform the existing policies in terms of both the mean and P95 of sojourn time for almost all the simulation scenarios. In addition, the performance is adaptive to the change of (i) input load λ (or traffic congestion level); (ii) EV speed v; (iii) service rates μk
                     ; and (iv) distribution F of demand locations. It is noted that for such service systems there always exist a number of control parameters that will influence the performance measures of interest. Therefore, it would be valuable to explore the optimisation problems with respect to other control parameters, e.g. how to best allocate the charging stations so as to minimise the vehicle’s mean sojourn time. Nevertheless, finding the solutions for this type of optimisation problems appears to be a challenging and involved task, and hence a topic for future work.
