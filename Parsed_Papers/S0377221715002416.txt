                  This paper discusses a two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem, in which the whole set of source–destination links consists of two disjoint partitions namely Level-I and Level-II links. Some quantity of a homogeneous product is first shipped from sources to destinations by Level-I decision makers using only Level-I links, and on its completion the Level-II decision maker transports the remaining quantity of the product in an optimal fashion using only Level-II links. The objective is to find that feasible solution for Level-I decision corresponding to which the optimal feasible solution for Level-II decision maker is such that the sum of shipment times in Level-I and Level-II is minimum. A polynomial time iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem. At each iteration a lexicographic optimal solution of a restricted version of a related standard time minimization transportation problem is examined to generate a pair of Level-I and Level-II shipment times and finally the global optimal solution is obtained by selecting the best out of these generated pairs. Numerical illustration is included in support of theory.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An important class of optimization problems is the class of transportation problems. In a classical transportation problem, one may be interested in finding least expensive way of transporting large quantities of a homogeneous product from a number of sources to a number of destinations. Mathematically, a classical cost minimization transportation problem (CMTP) can be stated as:

The first formulation of transportation problems dates back to the late 1930s and early 1940s. Kantorovich (1960) contributed to this field in 1939. Later on Hitchcock (1941) discussed the problem of distribution of a product from several warehouses (or sources) to numerous locations (or destinations). The problem of optimal routing of messages in a communication network, the contract award problem and routing of aircrafts and ships are important applications of transportation problems.

In a classical transportation problem, if capacity of each source–destination link is also introduced, then it is called capacitated cost minimization transportation problem (CCMTP). CCMTP is a generalization of a classical transportation problem. Mathematically, CCMTP is defined as

                     Wagner (1959) gave an algorithm for a class of CCMTP. Extensive work has been done on capacitated CMTPs. Ford and Fulkerson (1957), Bit, Bisal, and Alam (1993), Arora and Puri (2001), Zheng, Moxu, and Min Hu (1994), Rachev and Olkin (1999), Dahiya and Verma (2007) have studied CCMTPs and its variants. Appa (1973) studied some useful variants of the CMTP. Koopmans (1947) also contributed in this field. The CMTP with mixed constraints has been studied by Brigden (1974), Klingman and Russel (1974). Khanna, Bakhsi, and Puri (1983) and Khanna and Puri (1984) presented a study on a flow constrained cost minimizing transportation problem.


                     Kuno and Utsunomiya (1997) proposed a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to find the global minimizer of a production-transportation problem by solving a corresponding Hitchcock transportation problem. Later on, they proposed a Lagrangian based branch-and-bound algorithm for the production-transportation problem (Kuno & Utsunomiya, 2000). Nagai and Kuno (2005) developed a branch-and-bound algorithm to find a global optimal solution of nonconvex minimization network flow problem consisting of production and transportation simultaneously.


                     Klanšek and Pšunder (2010) studied suitability of branch and reduce method, the branch and cut method and the combination of global and local search strategies to find the exact optimum solution of the nonlinear transportation problem. Xie and Jia (2012) developed a hybrid genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution of a nonlinear fixed charge transportation problem where the objective is to ship the available amounts of goods to satisfy the demands at the minimal total cost, on the condition that any route has a fixed cost irrelative to its shipment amount and a variable cost directly proportional to the quadratic of its shipping amount. Mizutani and Yamashita (2013) developed an algorithm to find a global optimizer of a concave cost transportation problem where the cost function is quadratic or square-root concave. Schmitzer and Schnörr (2013) presented an extension of the auction algorithm to solve linear assignment and mass transportation problem.

Various strongly polynomial time algorithms are available to solve CMTP (see, Tardos, 1985, 1986). An algorithm is strongly polynomial if it consists of (elementary) arithmetic operations and number of such operations is polynomially bounded in the dimension of the input (i.e., number of data items in the input). The best strongly polynomial running time algorithm for CMTP is

                      which is obtained by Orlin (1993). This bound is obtained for uncapacitated CMTP. Kleinschmidt and Schannath (1995) developed an algorithm which runs in time proportional to m log m(k + n log n), where k is the number of feasible arcs. This complexity bound is slightly better than the bound obtained by Orlin (1993). Later on, Sharma and Sharma (2000) proposed a computationally attractive O(c(m + n)2) dual based heuristic procedure for solving a CMTP where c is a constant.

An important class of transportation problems in terms of its prevalent applications is the bottleneck transportation problem or the time minimization transportation problem (TMTP), which usually arises in connection with the transportation of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables, where a delay in transportation may result in much larger loss than any cost advantage attained by transporting at lower cost or situations arising in military operations where in times of emergencies the time of transportation of various military troops to the battle field is of prime importance. In this problem, a transportation time is associated between each source and each destination. In a TMTP, it is required to find a feasible distribution (of the supplies) which minimizes the total time, measured as the time of the slowest link. This problem was first addressed by Hammer (1969). The mathematical structure of this problem is as follows:

                     Bansal and Puri (1980) proved that T(X) is a concave function. Thus TMTP involves minimization of a concave function over a transportation polytope and hence it belongs to the class of concave minimization problems. Due to the concavity of the objective function, the search for an optimal solution is restricted to the set of basic feasible solutions only.

Important studies in TMTP have been made by Szwarc (1966), Garfinkel and Rao (1971), Bhatia, Swarup, and Puri (1977), Ahuja (1986), Prakash (1982), Chandra, Seth, and Saxena (1987), Issermsnn (1984), Arora and Puri (2001), Gupta (1977) and Hammer (1971). Later on, Burkard and Franz (1991), Arora and Puri (1997) studied lexicographic bottleneck problems. In a lexicographic time minimizing transportation problem one is not only interested in minimizing the transportation cost on the routes of the longest duration but also on the routes of second longest, third-longest duration and so on. Sherali (1982) studied multi-objective programs and proposed two algorithms to compute weights for lexicographic optimal solutions. Mazzola and Neebee (1993) developed an algorithm for bottleneck generalized assignment problem.

Almost all the techniques for solving TMTP involve an ordinary cost minimization transportation problem for which strongly polynomial algorithms are known to exist (see Orlin, 1993; Tardos, 1985). Therefore, it follows that a time minimization transportation problem is also solvable in strongly polynomial time.


                     Sonia and Puri (2004) discussed an invariants of time minimization transportation problem in the form of two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem (HTMTP) in which all the source–destination links are grouped in two categories viz. Level-I links and Level-II links. In Level-I links, the leader can use only Level-I links for shipment of goods from the sources to destinations. On the completion of the shipment in Level-I, the follower uses Level-II links optimally to transport the left over quantity. Since the transportation time for the leader (Level-I) and follower (Level-II) is a concave function, it follows that transportation time in two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem is a concave function and the objective is to find the feasible shipment schedule for the leader in Level-I so that the corresponding optimal schedule for the follower in Level-II is such that the overall shipment time for the two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem is the least. The technique proposed by Sonia and Puri (2004) involves solving a related standard time minimizing transportation. Based upon the solution of this related time minimization transportation problem, a corresponding cost minimizing transportation problem is constructed whose optimal basic feasible solution (OBFS) yields the first feasible solution of two level HTMTP. A time minimization transportation problem with respect to Level-II shipment time is defined and based upon its OBFS a cost minimization transportation problem is constructed whose OBFS yields the second feasible solution of two level HTMTP. This process of defining a TMTP with respect to Level-II shipment time and constructing CMTP based upon its optimal solution is continued to generate various feasible solutions of two level HTMTP. These solutions yield pairs

In the current paper, a polynomial time iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the two level HTMTP (which is proposed by Sonia & Puri, 2004). The proposed algorithm generates only one sequence of Level-I and Level-II shipment times where at each iteration Level-I shipment time decreases strictly and Level-II shipment time increases. To generate this sequence, at each iteration a related cost minimizing transportation problem is solved, depending upon Level-I time.

This paper is organized as follows: In next section, motivation for studying the current problem is given. Mathematical formulation of two level hierarchical time minimizing transportation problem is given in Section 3. Various theoretical results are established in Section 4. Based upon these results, an algorithm is developed in Section 5. Numerical illustration is given in Section 6. In Section 7, comparison of proposed algorithm with the algorithm available in literature (Sonia & Puri, 2004) is given and Section 8 contains concluding remarks.

Hierarchical structures are found in many complex systems like environment, ecology, biology, chemical engineering, classification theory, databases, network design, economics and industry. Understanding the complexity of hierarchical structure requires system methodologies that are amenable to modeling, analyzing and optimizing structure. The simplest two-level programming problem describes a hierarchical system which is composed of two level of decision makers.

For an industry, there is need of a strategy that can allow its organization to concentrate its resources on the optimal opportunities with the goals of increasing sales and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Developing such a marketing strategy is vital for any business. Without one, its efforts to attract customers are likely to be haphazard and inefficient. One of the important parts of such a strategy, which may have a crucial influence on the business, is to deliver its product to customers in time. So, all the above factors which have direct impact on the business motivated us to study a garment industry project which involves the export of garments from various production units (sources) to various distribution centers (destinations). In the garment industry, various quality checks have been imposed by the governing bodies situated at various distribution centers and one has to pass the quality test depending upon the production unit from where garments are supplied. For this purpose, quality check centers have been set up by the governing bodies at various distribution center. After going through the quality test, demand of all the distribution centers is satisfied. It is not necessary that the quality check test is imposed on all the production units. In this situation, transportation takes place in two stages. In first stage, transportation is done for quality check and after satisfying quality test, the remaining demand at various distribution centers is satisfied in second stage. The objective is to plan a transportation schedule so that the demand at the distribution centers can be satisfied in minimum time after clearing all quality checks imposed by the governing bodies, which leads to a two-level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem.

The set of source–destination links in I × J is partitioned into two non-empty disjoint sets L
                     1 and L
                     2 such that L
                     1 consists of links (i, j) ∈ I × J to be used in shipment pertaining to Level-I (quality check centers). Therefore, L
                     2 = I × J\L
                     1 represents the set of Level-II links. It is assumed that transportation is done in parallel in both the levels and the total demand of the product at various destinations is equal to the total availability of the same at various sources. The Level-I transportation in which the transportation is done using only Level-I links is mathematically defined as:

As the shipment times in Level-I and Level-II are concave functions, two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem aims at minimizing a concave function over a polytope. Hence HTMTP is also a concave minimization problem. As the global minimum of a concave minimization is attained at an extreme point only, it is desirable to investigate only its extreme points.

The proposed algorithm generates a sequence of pairs of Level-I and Level-II times such that Level-I time decreases strictly and Level-II time increases. The first pair generated by the algorithm is one which corresponds to the optimal time of Level-II problem. An optimal solution of Level-II problem is obtained by solving the following cost minimization transportation problem CMTP:

We want to generate pairs such that Level-I time decreases strictly and in each pair Level-II time is minimum corresponding to the Level-I time. To generate such pairs, transportation is blocked along all those Level-I links for which time of transportation is greater than or equal to the current Level-I time

                        -feasible Solution): A feasible solution of the problem (CP
                        k
                     ) is called an 
                        
                           M
                        -feasible solution if xij

                      = M.

Practically, an M-feasible solution means that nothing is transported along a link (i, j) for which cij
                      is defined as M.

An optimal basic feasible solution OBFS of the problem (CP) is denoted by Y

Consider the following 6 × 8 two level hierarchical time minimizing transportation problem given in Table 1
                      where cells with bold and underline entries denote the Level-I links. The problem considered here is same as discussed by Sonia and Puri (2004).

The partition of various time routes is given by t
                     1( = 13) > t
                     2( = 12) > t
                     3( = 10) > t
                     4( = 9) > t
                     5( = 8) > t
                     6( = 7) > t
                     7( = 6) > t
                     8( = 5) > t
                     9( = 4) > t
                     10( = 3) > t
                     11( = 2) > t
                     12( = 1). Here ts
                      = t
                     12 = 1, therefore s = 12.

                        Remark 4
                        In this current problem, the algorithm generates eight pairs by solving only eight problems while the algorithm proposed by Sonia and Puri (2004) generates six pairs by solving corresponding twelve problems.

The algorithm given in Section 5 and the algorithm available in literature (Sonia & Puri, 2004) have been coded in MATLAB and experiments were conducted using Intel Processor i5 with 2.5 gigahertz, 2 gigabyte RAM on 64-bit windows operating system. The algorithms run successfully for randomly generated problems for different classes of problems depending upon the values of m and n. All the test problems have been randomly generated and values of tij
                      have been drawn from a uniform distribution from 1 to 100. Table 3 narrates the computational behavior of randomly generated problems in terms of time depending upon the percentage of Level-I links. In a class for each size, we report the average running time (in seconds) (taken over about 100 instances) for all the entries in the table. We have used notations A1 and A2 for denoting the algorithm proposed in Section 5 and for the algorithm available in literature (Sonia & Puri, 2004), respectively. The number of Level-I links for any class of size (m × n) is taken as greatest integer value corresponding to a particular percentage of mn. If this value is zero, then we have not run the algorithms for that percentage. In Table 3, some time entries are marked as ‘–’ which correspond to those cases when the greatest integer value for that particular percentage of mn is zero or the Level-I links for 95 percent and 99 percent are same. For each pair, the best time is highlighted in italics. Computational experiments show that our approach behaves better in terms of time in 182 out of 187 experiments, despite the percentage of Level-I links. The performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than the one available in literature when the percentage of Level-I links is 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm runs almost two times faster than the algorithm available in literature (Sonia & Puri, 2004) when the percentage of Level-I links is 50 percent.

                           In this paper, a two level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem is studied, which was first formulated by Sonia and Puri (2004). An iterative algorithm is proposed to find its optimal solution which generates a sequence of pairs of Level-I and Level-II shipment times starting with minimum time of Level-II. The generated pairs are such that Level-I shipment time decreases strictly and Level-II time increases. The algorithm terminates as soon as minimum time of Level-I problem is reached.

The algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps. The maximum number of iterations is (s − r + 1) where

At each iteration a time minimizing transportation problem is solved by solving a corresponding cost minimization transportation problem. And a cost minimization transportation problem is solvable by polynomial bound algorithm and only finite number of such problems (at the most (s − r + 1)) are solved, so the proposed algorithm is a polynomial bound algorithm.

The algorithm proposed in this paper is better than the algorithm proposed by Sonia and Puri (2004) in following ways:
                                 
                                    (a)
                                    To generate one pair of Level-I and Level-II times, we are solving only one time minimization transportation problem whose optimal solution is obtained by solving a corresponding cost minimization problem. On the other hand, the algorithm proposed by Sonia and Puri (2004) solves one time minimization transportation problem and one associated cost minimization transportation problem to generate one pair of Level-I and Level-II times.

The proposed algorithm generates only one type of sequence of pairs in which Level-I time is strictly decreasing and Level-II is increasing.

The proposed algorithm solves at the most (s − r + 1) problems while the algorithm proposed by Sonia and Puri (2004) solves at the most 2(l
                                       2 − v) + 2(l
                                       1 − u) (for values of parameters l
                                       2, l
                                       1, u, v refer to Sonia and Puri, 2004). Thus, proposed algorithm is better than the latter if (s − r + 1) < 2(l
                                       2 − v) + 2(l
                                       1 − u).

In the current problem, the transportation time values along various source–destination links are taken as integers. But there is no restriction on the values of transportation time entries. If all the mn links have different values of time, even then the algorithm works successfully.

This problem can be explored further if the total availability at the sources is not equal to the total requirement at the destinations.

The Level-I links are randomly selected and there is no restriction on the number of Level-I links. The algorithm runs successfully if almost all the links are Level-I or Level-II as evident from the computational experiments given in Section 7.

The algorithm works successfully for all two-level HTMTP in the availability of the homogeneous product at sources is equal to the demand of the same at the destinations.

The hierarchical time minimization problem can be explored further for transportation of non-homogeneous products and for the case which involves three or more levels.
