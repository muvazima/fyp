                  This paper examines whether the conclusions of standard supply-chain models carry over to repeated supply-chain relationships. The past models assume profit-maximizing agents in one-shot games. In these games, an essential unresolved issue concerns which parties in the supply chain have greater power to extract a larger share of supply chain profit: the manufacturer or the retailer. In particular, we consider a two-manufacturer/one-retailer supply chain over repeated periods of interaction. We find that the experimental results are closest to a symmetric outcomes hypothesis: the supply chain members tend to choose similar margin levels and profits tend to be more fairly divided than non-cooperative, game-theoretic, supply-chain models predict. Individual supply chain member's behavior shows evidence of fairness concerns for supply chain members. These results indicate the significant role of fairness in competitive supply chain relationships, even in a scenario that is designed to favor one supply chain member over the others.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the evolution of distribution methods in recent decades, practitioners and academics are studying supply chain relationships assuming various theoretical forms of channel power relations. For example, following a standard structure, supply chain contracting models assume leader–follower behavior with the supplier acting as leader and the retailer as follower (e.g., Aust & Buscher, 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Choi, 1991; Coughlan, 1985; He, Prasad, & Sethi, 2009; Hsieh, Wu, & Huang, 2008; Huang & Li, 2001; Lau, Lau, & Zhou, 2006; Lee & Staelin, 1997; McGuire & Staelin, 1983; Spengler, 1950; Yao & Liu, 2005). An alternate form of leader–follower relationship involves the retailer playing the role of leader (e.g., Aust & Buscher, 2012; Choi, 1991; Lau et al., 2006; Lee & Staelin, 1997); this formulation reflects the growing belief among practitioners that retailers are gaining power in the supply chain. In addition, several papers have considered a more symmetrical relationship between suppliers and retailers (e.g., Aust & Buscher, 2012; Choi, 1991; Huang & Li, 2001; Jeuland & Shugan, 1983; Lau et al., 2006; Lee & Staelin, 1997; Yao & Liu, 2005). An essential unresolved issue concerns which parties in the supply chain have greater power to extract a larger share of supply chain profit: the manufacturer or the retailer. All these models, however, have limitations as to how adequately they can capture channel power relations.

The above models of supply channel relationships assume two things: (1) they are one-shot games (some involving a sequence of two stages played once) and (2) supply chain members’ behavior is entirely profit-maximizing. In this paper, we study a supply chain experiment that considers empirical challenges to these two assumptions.

A challenge to the first assumption is that the models (Manufacturer Stackelberg Leadership, Retailer Stackelberg Leadership, Vertical Nash, Collusion, etc.) generally are intended to describe business situations that involve repeated interactions in real applications. In such repeated contexts, it is natural to allow competitive dynamics to come into play – particularly since the actions taken in the previous period provide a natural focal or reference point that may anchor and influence subsequent play. Such competitive dynamics can induce a player to strategically cooperate with rivals in repeated interactions (e.g., Dreber, Fudenberg, & Rand, 2014; Fischbacher, Gächter, & Quercia, 2012; Sonnemans, Schram, & Offerman, 1999) or to behave in what amounts to a cooperative fashion when they take into consideration future interactions (Reuben & Suetens, 2012).

A challenge to the second assumption is that players interacting over time may also come to consider their own outcomes in relation to the outcomes of the other players. In particular, an important related behavioral theory with dynamic (as well as static) implications arises from considerations of perceptions of fairness in previous periods (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1986; Rabin, 1993). In fact, cross-sectional survey research in the past three decades has shown that fairness considerations among channel members play a significant role in channel relationships (e.g., Anderson & Weitz, 1992; Frazier, 1983; Heide & John, 1988; Kumar, 1996; Kumar, Scheer, & Steenkamp, 1995; Li, Karande, & Zhou, 2009), though it is unknown the extent to which fairness concerns influence channel power relations. Furthermore, the experimental economics literature has challenged the equilibrium predictions that assume profit-maximization behavior by showing extensive evidence on the importance of fairness in explaining negotiations behavior. Until recently, however, economics-based theoretical research on supply chain relationships has mostly disregarded fairness as a factor. A notable exception consists of Cui, Raju, and Zhang (2007), who consider the implications of incorporating fairness into supply chain research in a simple single-manufacturer/single-retailer dyad. Caliskan-Demirag, Chen, and Li (2010) extend the results of Cui et al. (2007) to nonlinear demand functions. And recently, Du, Nie, Chu, and Yu (2014) incorporate supply chain member's preferences of reciprocity into a dyadic channel.

Only a few studies, however, have examined the role of fairness in an experimental context by investigating the extent to which fairness model specifications describe supply chain members’ behavior. Loch and Wu (2008), for example, study the role of social preferences in the context of repeated interactions between one supplier and one retailer and find that supply chain members consistently deviate from profit maximizing behavior, which suggests cooperation between members over time. Ho and Su (2009) and Ho, Su, and Wu (2014) examine peer-induced fairness concerns and distributional fairness concerns in the one-supplier/two-retailer setting. However, no study has examined the impact of fairness in supply chain relationships in the presence of competition between suppliers. We accordingly study the applicability of profit-maximizing predictions, as compared to competing models, when there are repeated interactions in the context of two suppliers and one retailer.

The current paper complements previous experimental oligopoly game literature by examining the implications of fairness among supply chain participants with repeated interactions. This builds on past work that examines simultaneous and sequential quantity and price competition, dynamics and convergence in oligopolistic markets, and collusion (summarized effectively in an extensive overview of recent oligopoly experiments by Potters & Suetens, 2013). This past work includes the role of repeated interaction in quantity and price competition (e.g., Brandts & Guillen, 2007), game dynamics (e.g., Davis, 2011; Huck, Normann, & Oechssler, 2002), and tacit collusion (e.g., Bruttel, 2009; Hampton & Sherstyuk, 2012), but it does not consider fairness.

Overall, the intended contribution of the current paper is to add to the empirical work on supply chain relationships by providing laboratory experiments designed to examine (1) the dynamic behavior in a repeated interaction context in the presence of competition at the supplier level and (2) the applicability of profit-maximizing predictions of supply chain contracting games as compared to fairness models. In our experiments, we particularly consider the supply chain structure considered by Choi (1991) involving two manufactures selling through a common retailer.

We begin by reviewing the one-shot game supply-chain model of Choi (1991) in which two manufacturers sell through a common retailer. In this context, we also introduce a formulation of fairness theory suggested by Fehr and Schmidt (1999).

Following Choi (1991), the two-manufacturer/one-retailer model can be described as follows. Suppose there are downward sloping demand functions:

                         (given that the retail price of the other brand j is pj
                        ) and γ describes the degree of substitutability between the two products (Choi, 1991; Ingene & Parry, 1995; Jeuland & Shugan, 1988; McGuire & Staelin, 1983). When γ = 0, the model represents two (independent) single-manufacturer/single-retailer bilateral monopoly channels. It is also assumed that the own-price effect exceeds the cross-price effect (so that b >γ).

                         represents manufacturer i’s profit (manufacturer i is the producer of product i). Equilibrium wholesale prices and retail margins (w
                        1, w
                        2, m
                        1, and m
                        2) for a single-period game are calculated by maximizing the three profit functions in Eq. (2).

A different sequence of optimization calculations is used to compute three of the competing profit-maximizing equilibrium predictions (see Choi, 1991). Manufacturer Stackelberg leadership involves the manufacturers simultaneously choosing w
                        1 and w
                        2 in Stage 1 and the retailer choosing m
                        1 and m
                        2 in Stage 2. Retailer Stackelberg leadership involves the retailer choosing m
                        1 and m
                        2 in Stage 1 and the manufacturers choosing w
                        1 and w
                        2 in Stage 2. The Vertical Nash game involves the manufacturers and retailer all simultaneously setting w
                        1, w
                        2, m
                        1, and m
                        2 in a single stage.


                        Fig. 1
                        , for the simplifying case of no cross-price effects (γ = 0), describes the possible equilibrium concepts for a single-period game, such as Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS), Retail Stackelberg (RS), and Vertical Nash (VN). The equilibrium outcomes for these three single-period games provide a starting point for describing what can happen in alternate contexts, including multi-period, repeated games.

In the left-hand panel of Fig. 1, the VN equilibrium lies at the intersection of the reaction functions (first-order conditions) of one manufacturer and the retailer. The MS equilibrium lies at the point on the retailer's reaction function that provides the highest manufacturer profit (similarly, the RS equilibrium lies at the point on the manufacturer's reaction function that provides the highest retailer profit).

The right-hand panel of Fig. 1 depicts the retail and manufacturer profits for the MS, RS, and VN cases. The retailer profit is typically greatest under RS and lowest under MS, and manufacturer profit is the reverse. Consequently, each supply chain member has a direct incentive to become a leader (Choi, 1991; Lee & Staelin, 1997).

In addition, we consider the Collusive Channel Optimum, Symmetric Collusion, and Symmetric Pricing as alternative outcomes. The Collusive Channel Optimum consists of any wholesale price and retail margin that, when combined, equal the retail price that a vertically integrated monopoly would charge. The Collusive Channel Optimum points are associated with the maximum possible level of channel profits, and the associated retail prices are lower than the prices for MS, RS, and VN. These points are also Pareto optimal, and descriptions of negotiations with binding contracts often assume such Pareto optimal outcomes. The Symmetric Collusion point is the particular Collusive Channel Optimum that delivers equal profit per product to the three players. This will arise from the Nash Bargaining solution in cooperative game theory (Corfman & Gupta, 1993; Nash, 1950). More generally the set of Symmetric Pricing outcomes (equal margins net of costs) will serve as a bench-mark for fairness concerns.

We observe that, when γ > 0, the equilibrium wholesale prices, retail margins, and profits under RS, VN, and MS for both Products 1 and 2 will be shifted upwards relative to what is shown in Fig. 1. The resulting distribution of channel profits is more favorable to the retailer. The exact equilibrium points are shown later in the paper (see Fig. 4).

In an infinitely repeated game, according to the folk-theorem (see Fudenberg & Tirole, 1991, chapter 5), all profit combinations in the triangular region of the right-hand panel of Fig. 1 can be supported in each period as profit-maximizing (subgame perfect) equilibrium outcomes. In a finitely repeated game, it is less recognized that the Manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) outcome in each period is the unique profit-maximizing (subgame perfect Nash) equilibrium outcome. Formally, this latter outcome is our maintained prediction because our experiments use a finite-move game in which the two manufacturers move first.

                           Although our formal prediction is the MS outcome, we think it is desirable to explore empirical regularities of how the supply chain structure in the paper influences human decision-making. Thus, we wish to know empirical regularities of whether the repeated-interaction setting generates outcomes closer to the predicted outcome or those of several competing theories of one-shot interaction.
                         RS and VN are two alternative profit-maximizing predictions. RS is an interesting alternative hypothesis because the presence of two manufacturers would seem to give the retailer the opportunity to take a price leadership role by “playing” the manufacturers off against each other.

In the past two decades, economists have incorporated fairness into game-theoretic modeling (e.g., Bolton & Ockenfels, 2000; Levine, 1998; Rabin, 1993) to explain anomalous behavior observed in the experimental literature. Fehr and Schmidt (1999), in particular, propose a fairness model that assumes that competing firms/agents/players dislike outcomes that are inequitable to any player (henceforth, F&S model). Accordingly, players care about what others get and show some increase in utility when players get the same payoff. The utility function of the F&S model is given by

                        where α is associated with the utility loss from an inequitable profit allocation that is disadvantageous to the subject in question (envy; i.e., the utility penalty for a “disadvantageous inequality”) and with β associated with the utility loss from an inequitable profit allocation that is advantageous to the subject in question (guilt; the utility penalty for an “advantageous inequality”). Generally, one expects α > β.

In this paper, we adopt the F&S approach together with other potentially relevant considerations that we draw from the literature. If fairness effects are present in players’ utilities (as in Eq. (3)), then, when inequitable outcomes arise in one period of a game, we expect players to take action to yield more equitable outcomes in subsequent periods. In particular, following Normann, Requate, and Waichman (2014), we consider whether the players adjust their decision variables in the current period based on the decisions variables and outcomes from the previous period, according to the following equations.

                           It is expected that players’ choices are dependent on the game history in repeated games (e.g., Bottazzi and Devetag, 2007; Brown and Rosenthal, 1990). However, the most influential information is the last period interaction in many experimental markets. For example, Kruse et al. (1994) find that most sellers adjust their prices to a price prediction based on the rival's last period price but do not adjust them to the once-lagged prediction in their oligopoly market game. Furthermore, Zwick and Rapoport (2002) confirm that the behavior of subjects is significantly influenced by the results of their decision in the most recent iteration of the game, which indicates adaptive behavior, in their market entry game. This approach is also consistent with recent work by Normann et al. (2014).

                         indicate a manufacturer's reaction to (dis)advantageous inequality relative to the other manufacturer. We expect  β
                        4 < 0  and  β
                        5 > 0. Thus, for example, when a manufacturer earns lower profits than the competing manufacturer, the manufacturer would like to acquire more equitable profits by reducing its price in the next period, but when a manufacturer earns higher relative profits, the manufacturer does the opposite. Similarly, the coefficients (β
                        ., 6) β
                        ., 7 indicate a player's reaction to (dis)advantageous inequality relative to the channel retailer (i.e., between a manufacturer and the retailer for a product).

Regarding these latter coefficients, one should recognize the following caveat. Even if the coefficients in the disadvantageous and advantageous inequalities are significant and in the expected directions, this is not indicative of players’ motivations for why they make such adjustments to move toward more equitable outcomes. In repeated games, instrumental reciprocity (i.e., a strategy in which a forward-looking, self-interested person sacrifices his short-term payoffs in an effort to increase his long-run payoffs) and intrinsic reciprocity (i.e., a person's willingness to sacrifice his own payoffs in order either to increase a kind opponent's payoff or to decrease an unkind opponent's payoff) could both be sources of cooperation (e.g., Sobel, 2005). Thus, the repeated context applied in this paper is not able to identify whether a decision is motivated by selfish or other-regarding preferences (e.g., Fehr & Krajbich, 2014).

The dummy variable JPM (Joint Profit Maximization) indicates that a channel counterpart's net unit margin is equal to the symmetric channel collusive margin (i.e., between $11 and $12) in the previous round, which is associated with the maximum possible level of channel profits. In the symmetric treatments 1 and 2, the margin is $11.78 for all channel participants for both products, whereas, in the asymmetric treatment 3, the margins are $11.28 (Product 1) an $11.78 (Product 2), respectively.

The dummy variable Spiteful indicates that a player's price decision (i.e., choice of margin) is so high that it hurts all players since its own net margin exceeds the channel collusive-level for the full retail price, which is $33.57 in Treatments 1 and 2 and $34.56 (Product 1) and $33.56 (product 2) in Treatment 3, respectively. That is, the Spiteful variable is an indicator that one of the competitors is picking a net margin that is so aggressively high that the total retail price will be forced to exceed the channel collusive-level if the competitor's channel partner choses any net margin in excess of zero. The variables JPM and Spiteful follow Normann et al. (2014), and are included in part for comparative purposes (see this source for further motivation for these variables).

The dummy variables Information and Cost indicate the Incomplete Information (Treatment 2) and Asymmetric Cost (Treatment 3) treatments, respectively (we motivate these two treatments in Section 3.3 of the “Experimental Method” described below). Finally, we add a dummy variable for each group of three participants (two manufacturers and one retailer) playing the game for thirty rounds. Note that we have 20 groups for each of the three treatment conditions, but one group for each treatment condition does not have a dummy variable and constitutes the base case, subsumed in the intercept. We, thus, have

180 MBA and undergraduate business students from a large university in North America participated in a session that lasted about 90 minutes. Subjects were recruited through advertisements and class announcements. In return for participating, subjects were given class credit, a fixed payment of $5, and a further payment contingent upon performance.
                           4

                           In an experiment about quantity discount contracts in a distribution channel, Lim and Ho (2007) compared the decisions and outcomes of the experiment involving less-experienced undergraduates with those involving more-experienced MBA students who are ten years older on average and have more decision-making experience in the business world compared to the undergraduate subjects. They also compared the low-stake size and the high-stake size by doubling the stake size. Interestingly, they found that experience and stake size have little or no effect on the results. In addition, the authors found that student subjects were highly motivated to make the best possible decision in order to earn higher monetary payoffs in a similar experiment involving a one-manufacturer/one-retailer channel, which is consistent with the motivation of real-world channel players.
                        
                     

In our experiments subjects were randomly divided into groups of three players (taking the roles of two manufacturers and a retailer). Each group engaged in thirty rounds of interaction. We had 20 groups for each treatment condition. We ran a total of 22 sessions with an average of 2.73 groups per session, or equivalently 8.91 participants per session. As shown in Fig. 2, each round had three steps reflecting the institutional reality of the sequence of the game.

In the first step, Manufacturer 1 chooses w
                        1, and Manufacturer 2 chooses w
                        2. In the second step, the retailer chooses gross margins m
                        1 and m
                        2 for the two products. In the third step, market demands for the two products, q
                        1 and q
                        2, and each player's profits are realized (according to Eq. (2)).

Our experimental procedure began by giving subjects’ detailed instructions and a quiz (see the online Appendix) in a computer laboratory. The quiz consisted of ten questions to ascertain that the instructions were understood, and subjects were awarded 10 cents for each correct answer.
                           5
                        
                        
                           5
                           The average quiz score was 8.73/10, which indicated that players understood the game well, even before playing the practice rounds.
                         Subjects then played at a computer terminal with a randomized, anonymous partner for seven ‘practice’ rounds. No compensation was provided for practice rounds. The parameters of the model were then changed and each subject was randomly reassigned to a different partner but each subject's role was not changed. Subjects then engaged in 30 rounds of play and subject fees were earned based on the game profits earned. Any form of communication to learn with whom they were interacting was not possible. Subjects then filled out a survey about the strategies they applied in the game (see the online Appendix). They were then paid subject fees in private, and debriefed. Our payment formula was as follows: each subject was paid $5.00 automatically, plus the quiz payment (maximum of $1.00), plus $0.50 times his/her profits divided by the doubled collusive profit per round. Thus, if a player earned an equal share of the collusive profit in a round, the player would earn $.50 that round. Adding these three components together, the average actual payment for all runs of the experiments was $17.91.

The manufacturers and the retailer computer screens in steps 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 3
                        . In the example of this figure, both manufactures chose their own wholesale prices in Round 7 to be $20.00 respectively. The retailer received those prices and then selected retail gross margins of $15.00 and $17.00, respectively, for Products 1 and 2 in Round 7. (Note that, before making a final decision, the retailer sees a calculation of the retail prices and net margins associated with its gross margin selections in the upper right hand corner. A small traffic signal image shows a yellow light until the player confirms, “OK.”). All players see a running tally of market outcomes for the last five rounds of play including wholesale prices, retail margins, retail prices, quantities demanded, and profits accruing to them.

In addition to a base condition, we also consider the impact of two variables—information and production costs—on supply chain relationships in our experiments.

Concerning the former variable, we manipulate the information environment concerning both costs and profits. This manipulation builds on Chu and Messinger (1997) who examine the impact of market information acquisition on the distribution of channel profits. They find that improved information about demand always results in greater absolute profits. Desiraju and Moorthy (1997) also show that performance requirements on price and service improve channel performance when the retailer is better informed about demand conditions than the manufacturer. In exit surveys in pilot runs, we also found that participants felt that knowledge of competitors’ costs and profits could be particularly interesting. Accordingly, we predict that total channel profits will be higher under full information about competitor's costs and profits due to the informed channel member's ability to “fine tune” prices in response to changes of demand conditions. We also predict that there will be greater dispersion in outcomes across participants because there is more guesswork under incomplete information. Thus, this manipulation enables us to investigate the role of information in achieving fair supply chain relationships.

Concerning the latter variable, we manipulate the production cost differences between manufacturers in order to examine whether firms exploit cost advantages or cope with cost disadvantages through pricing. Choi (1991) argued that a low-cost manufacturer benefits not only from a larger contribution margin, but also from a larger market share due to the lower price. But while the manufacturers compete to sell more of their respective products by transferring part of the cost savings to wholesale prices, the common retailer lacks an incentive to reduce its margins. We therefore predict that asymmetric production costs yield higher net prices and profits for the low-cost product, for both the manufacturer and the retailer, than for the high cost product (as compared to the case of symmetric production costs). We also predict that the retailer's benefit is greater than the manufacturers’ from asymmetric production costs. In addition, this manipulation enables us to examine an impact of the asymmetric structure on fairness concerns.

To examine these predictions we consider three conditions: Full Information with No Production Cost Differences, Incomplete Cost and Profit Information, and Production Cost Differences.

                           6
                           We choose not to do Treatment 4 (interaction effect) because we think it is important to examine the effect of information separately from the effect of the asymmetric production costs.
                         The demand and cost parameters used in the experiments are shown in Table 1
                        .
                           7
                        
                        
                           7
                           To provide external validity, players are not told the parameters of the demand function under which they are operating, but must infer the demand relation through the evolving history of play.
                        
                     

In the full information with no production cost differences condition (Treatment 1), the computer screens inform the players of the pricing decisions, costs, and profits of the other players (all players know their own pricing decisions, costs, and profits, of course). In particular, each manufacturer is informed of the competing manufacturer's wholesale price decisions, production cost, and profit, and the retailer's margin decisions, handling cost, and profit; and the retailer is informed of both manufacturers’ wholesale price decisions, production costs, and profits.

In the incomplete cost and profit information condition (Treatment 2), all parameters are the same as in Treatment 1—the only difference is that the players do not know (and the game screens do not show) the costs and profits of the other players. In particular, manufacturer i knows its own wholesale price, production cost (
                           
                              c
                              
                                 m
                                 i
                              
                           
                        ), and profits, but not the other manufacturer's wholesale price, production cost, and profit, or the retailer's handling costs and profit. The retailer knows its handling costs (
                           
                              c
                              
                                 r
                                 1
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              c
                              
                                 r
                                 2
                              
                           
                        ), and profits (for both products), but not the production costs and profit of either manufacturer. All players know the retail prices of both products.

In the asymmetric production costs condition (Treatment 3), we set 
                           
                              
                                 c

                              =

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 c

                        , leaving the other parameters and information availability the same as in Treatment 1.

In sum, the first factor is related to the market information level shown during the experiments. The second factor is related to the parameter values in calculating demands and profits.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

We discuss our findings in detail by describing model-free results and then applying the manufacturer and retailer adjustment models described in Eqs. 4 and 5. The model-free results consist of descriptions of the central tendency of game outcomes, aggregate treatment effects, heterogeneity of game outcomes across groups, and respondent behavior over time.


                        Fig. 4
                         presents our mean price/margin and profit outcomes for the three treatment conditions.
                           8
                        
                        
                           8
                           To avoid extreme prices being too influential, if a player chose a value of w or m greater than $57.5 in a given round, then NA was recorded for (i) that player's value of w or m, (ii) the associated p, (iii) both product quantities (q
                              1 and q
                              2), and (iv) all players profits. This occurred very infrequently.
                         This figure shows mean outcomes for each treatment across subject dyads and across all 30 rounds and compares these results with the predictions of profit-maximizing equilibrium concepts. As discussed earlier, the predicted profit-maximizing outcome from game theory is the Manufacturer Stackelberg Leadership outcome (because this is a finitely repeated game in which the manufacturers move first in each round).

Contrary to Manufacturer Stackelberg Leadership, however, the price outcomes shown in Fig. 4 lie closest to the Symmetric Pricing outcome (the upward sloping diagonal line) where the manufacturers and retailers charge the same net prices and net margins. More formally, Table 2
                         shows that the aggregate mean net wholesale prices (wholesale price minus production cost) and net retail margins (retail margin less handling costs) for Product 1 and Product 2 are significantly different from the predictions of Manufacturer Leadership, Retail Leadership, and Vertical Nash (at the 0.01 level using F-tests) and from the Collusive retail price outcome (using t-tests). The results, however, are not significantly different from the Symmetric Pricing outcome for either Product 1 or Product 2 (at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels, using t-tests). Also the mean net wholesale price for Product 1 is not significantly different from the mean net wholesale price of Product 2 (at the 0.05 level, using t-tests). The mean properties of the data suggest that Manufacturer Leadership, Retail Leadership, Vertical Nash, and Collusive pricing do not hold for these data. The Symmetric Pricing outcome is not rejected, however.

The above description is based on standard tests, and there is always a question in experiments whether the data can be assumed to be normally distributed, or even symmetrically distributed, and whether outliers may skew the means. To examine this briefly, we report the means, medians and standard deviations of the data in Table 3
                         below. We remove the first and last two rounds of data (Rounds 1, 2, 29, and 30) before calculating the statistics in Table 3 (following Normann et al., 2014) to remove possible begin-game and end-game effects. The resulting statistics are changed little from Fig. 4.
                     

Overall, the mean and medians are very close for net wholesale prices and net retail margins for both Product 1 and Product 2 for the three treatment conditions. The aggregate data do not appear to be highly skewed or unduly influenced by outliers (this is not to say that there are no outliers, but that Fig. 4 is accurate in capturing the aggregate tendencies for both mean and median pricing behavior). We also confirm that the cases of significant t-tests conducted in Table 2 are also supported by similarly significant nonparametric, one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests. We do observe that there is a higher standard deviation of net retail margin than there is for net wholesale price under Treatment 1, which we will comment on later.

Overall, Treatment 1 exhibits a possibility of an “equity heuristic,” which we will study more fully when we estimate manufacturer and retailer price adjustment models toward the end of this experimental results section. We do reject Manufacturer Leadership; and the manufacturers’ “first-mover” advantage in each round appears to be dissipated when there are multiple rounds. However, we also do not get an outcome where the common retailer takes advantage of its strategic position of being able to play the manufacturers off against each other. Even the Vertical Nash outcome, which factors in some strategic advantage to the common retailer, is rejected. Lastly, although the results seem to reflect the symmetric outcome, they do not reflect collusive pricing behavior.

On the basis of theory, we expect relative profit for Treatment 2 to be the same as for Treatment 1 (and our predicted profit-maximizing outcome for both Treatments 1 and 2 is Manufacturer Leadership). But because an environment of incomplete information may cause players to misinterpret competitor's actions, we also expect lower total individual and channel profits and greater dispersion of profits across subject groups.

We actually find that price and profit outcomes for Treatments 2 and 1 are somewhat different, as shown in Fig. 4(a and c). We formally test for price differences between Treatments 2 and 1 using Kolmogorov–Smirov tests and find that the net prices for Treatment 2 are significantly different from those of Treatment 1 (KS statistics for w1, w2, m1
                        , and w2
                         are 3.92, 5.01, 6.03, and 4.55, respectively, p<.01 for all four variables). We also find that Treatment 2 yielded slightly higher average total channel profits per round than Treatment 1, but that this difference is not significant at the 0.05 level.

Lastly, we calculate variance ratio tests to examine whether there is greater dispersion of outcomes for Treatment 2 than for Treatment 1. We, indeed, find greater dispersion for the following variables (which describe outcome differences between Products 2 and 1): (a) wholesale price difference, w2 – w1
                         (F(19, 19) = 7.43, significant at 0.01 level), (b) retail margin difference, m2 – m1
                         (F(19, 19) = 2.06, significant at 0.10 level), (c) manufacturer profit difference,

                         (F(19, 19) = 2.04, significant at 0.10 level), and (d) retail profit difference, 
                           
                              
                                 Π
                                 
                                    R
                                    2
                                 
                              
                              −
                              
                                 Π
                                 
                                    R
                                    1
                                 
                              
                           
                         (F(19, 19) = 4.07, significant at 0.01 level). The data, thus, indicate somewhat more variation in outcomes between the two products for Treatment 2 than for Treatment 1.

Overall, for both Treatments 1 and 2, the strategic advantage for the retailer from playing off the two manufacturers against each other appears to be counterbalanced by the manufacturer's first-mover advantage (perhaps a bit more than counterbalanced). The only effect apparently present is that there is greater variation in prices and profits between Products 1 and 2 for Treatment 2. To the extent that manufacturer profits exceed retail profits, the first movers (i.e., manufacturers) may gain from an “open high” tactic in the hope of anchoring pricing behavior advantageous to them (Siegel & Fouraker, 1960; Srivastava, Chakravarti, & Rapoport, 2000), but such an advantage is not well supported by our data.

Concerning Treatment 3, Choi's model (1991) predicts that asymmetric production costs (cm1=10; cm2
                         = 8) yield higher net prices and profits for the low-cost product, for both the manufacturer and the retailer, than for the high-cost product (as compared to the case of symmetric production costs, cm1=8=cm2
                        ), as one might expect. It is also expected that the asymmetric production costs generate greater benefits for the retailer.

To consider these issues, we first perform Kolmogorov-Smirov tests for net price differences between Treatment 3 and Treatment 1 and find that only net wholesale price 1 (w1
                        ) is significantly different in the two treatments (KS statistics for w1
                         is 7.20, p<.01). In particular, we find that Manufacturer 1 (which has high cost) chooses lower net wholesale price than Manufacturer 2 (Mean net wholesale prices of $11.67 vs. $14.97; t = −3.439, p<.01). However, profit outcomes are not significantly different between the two manufacturers (mean profit of $36,441 vs. $39,675, t = −1.313). In addition, unlike our expectation, Manufacturer 1 does not earn significantly lower profits than the Retailer for Product 1 ($36,441 vs. $45,453, t = −1.96, p = 0.065) although the retailer appears to be behaving much as it did under Treatment 1 (including charging nearly equal margins for both products (t = 0.584, which is not significant in showing a difference)).

Overall, the low cost manufacturer and the retailer fail to fully capitalize on their strategic advantage under Treatment 3. At the same time, the high cost manufacturer appears unable to get either the retailer or the other manufacturer to absorb part of the profit reductions from its high costs.

To understand heterogeneity across groups (participant triplets playing the game for 30 rounds), we examine the four panels for Treatment 1 on the left side of Fig. 5
                        , starting from the top. Treatment 1 shows that most of the variation in net price is in terms of who gets a greater share of the total channel profit, the manufacturers or the retailer. Thus the inter-game heterogeneity in the top two left-hand panels is thus mostly parallel to the collusion line with downward minus 45° slope, but shifted to the right somewhat. That the final retail price is higher than collusion is a result of the basic externality between the retailer and manufacturers: by pursuing individual profit-maximization, players end up pricing higher than what would arise from joint profit-maximization. The Vertical Nash equilibrium in this game favors the retailer because the retailer has common control over both retail margin, but the actual play has most of the groups coming closer to the symmetric outcomes – although there is substantial across-group variation in the manufacturer/retailer share of the total channel profit.

The third panel on the left shows surprisingly close pricing for Manufacturer 1 and Manufacturer 2 (along the 45° line). The manufacturers end up looking like they are imitating each other's net wholesale prices (as a rule of thumb), even though there is substantial variation as to what their “mirrored” net price will be along the 45 degree line. The retailer also seems to often set similar net margins for the two products (perhaps as a rule of thumb to make the decisions easier). There is, however, somewhat more variation in the cloud pattern in the panel on the bottom left than for the panel third from the top. This is reflected in the fact that the standard deviation in Table 3, Treatment 1, is higher for net margin than for net wholesale price.


                        Fig. 6
                         shows the same patterns of outcomes for manufacturer and retailer profits outcomes across the 20 groups within Treatment 1.

This figure is included to corroborate the evidence of Fig. 5, and, actually, the profit outcomes of Fig. 6 are somewhat redundant with the net price outcomes of Fig. 5. An argument could be made that the data in Fig. 6 is slightly more robust to highly aggressive players, who may suddenly “jack up” or “slash” prices as a competitive statement, and Fig. 5 is more interpretable in terms of game decisions, so both are included. Actually studying these two figures is instructive to readers new to these games to better understand the structure of incentives and equilibrium outcomes, and how the various participant triplets (i.e., groups) respond to the incentives. The play seems to gravitate to simple rules of thumb of various forms of mirroring and equality, even compared to the Vertical Nash equilibrium (which factors into its equilibrium the advantage of the retailer being the common retailer for these two products). But the variation that emerges, perhaps based on such factors as “group chemistry,” skill, and personalities, is along the dimension of who gets a larger share of the channel profit: the manufacturer or the retailer.

Moving toward Treatment 2, the middle column of plots in Figs. 5 and 6, we see a repeat of same pattern of group outcomes as for Treatment 1. The only difference graphically is that the inter-group variation seems to be somewhat larger. This is summarized in Table 3, where Standard Deviation for the net wholesale price is larger under Treatment 2 than for Treatment 1. Given that Treatment 2 is a case of incomplete information on the part of the players as to competitor's costs, this is as one would predict. The mean wholesale prices are also higher for Treatment 2 than for Treatment 1, suggesting that the manufacturers actually can benefit from this information impoverished environment (perhaps because there is more face-justification for according to rules of thumb which are better for them than the various other patterns of behavior are). Interestingly the retailer margins have similarly high standard deviations for Treatments 2 and 1.

For Treatment 3 (asymmetric production cots), the more powerful manufacturer does better vis a vis both the other manufacturer and the retailer, as predicted by the theory. There is also somewhat less variation across groups, for the retailer in particular (lower standard deviation of net retail margins verses Treatment 1, as seen in Table 3).

Lastly, considering the heterogeneity in standard deviation of price across groups, we examine the “Whiskers Plots” of Fig. 7
                        . This shows for Treatment 1 that there is more variation across groups in standard deviation for retail margin than for wholesale price. It also shows outliers particularly. Based on this, we removed 17 rounds of data (out of 1800), which despite the impressions of Fig. 7, turned out to be spread rough evenly across the three Treatment conditions – the biggest three outliers were for Treatment 1. The results reported earlier in this paper included these outliers, but the results were not sensitive to including or removing them, because the number of such outliers is small. However, for the subsequent analysis of the adjustment models, we remove these outliers before conducting the analysis, because the results are sensitive to these very high prices (and after all, a retail price of $100 has the same effect on demand as a retail price of $57 – both cause demand to go to zero).

The above findings raise the question of why our game outcomes differ from the expected profit-maximizing outcome of Manufacturer Stackelberg equilibrium. We are also interested in examining the dynamic behavior, across periods within a game. To help understand this, we examine the responses of the players to other players’ moves. Since the only profit-maximizing subgame perfect equilibrium of the game is the Manufacturer Stackelberg, we first examine the reason why the game results are different from the Manufacturer Stackelberg outcomes. One way might be to scrutinize the responses of the retailer to the manufacturer wholesale prices. In addition, we study how far each of the two manufacturers diverges from their profit-maximizing best responses.

In Fig. 8
                        , the left panels indicate the difference between actual wholesale prices and the predictions of the profit-maximizing reaction function, averaged over all groups within a treatment condition for each round. The right panels indicate the difference between actual retail margins and the predictions of the profit-maximizing reaction function, averaged over all groups within a treatment condition for each round. Thus, positive (negative) values indicate wholesale prices and margins above (below) the players’ profit-maximizing best response function.


                        Fig. 8 shows that manufacturers are generally setting their wholesale prices above their profit-maximizing best responses while retailers are setting their margins below their profit-maximizing best responses, especially in the first half of the game. (For Treatment 3, however, the high-cost manufacturers are setting their net wholesale prices a bit below their profit-maximizing best responses, and the retailers often set their margins far below their profit-maximizing best responses for both products.) A synthesis of these outcomes suggests that manufacturers are trying to exercise price leadership, and retailers are responding according to an equity heuristic yielding profits and net margins similar to those of the manufacturers over time. Retailers do not appear to be exercising their power as the “common retailer” in this game structure. Indeed, by following an equity heuristic, retailers are pricing more passively than would a Stackelberg follower and much more passively than would a Stackelberg leader. An interpretation of why this may occur is that violating the equity heuristic is very salient to both the manufacturers and the retailer. Taking advantage of the strategic position as “common retailer” is subtle for the retailer, and may also lead to retaliation from manufacturers who may perceive the equity heuristic as more “fair.”

These intuitive considerations motivate our consideration of a dynamic model that incorporates such factors as fairness, price imitation, and adjusting to a purely rational best response. The following analysis will allow us to assess the relative importance of such factors in driving behavior.


                        Table 4
                         shows our estimates for the dynamic adjustment process described earlier in Eqs. (4) and (5). This specification builds on the analysis of Normann et al. (2014).

The estimates for the four equations are consistent with each other and immediately interpretable in light of the previous discussion. The fit, as measured by R-squared, ranges from 0.35 to 0.20, and the residual standard errors display greater unexplained heterogeneity for the retailer than for the manufactures, as was also reflected in the earlier discussion of Table 3 and Section 4.3. Overall, the coefficient estimates are in accordance with a weighting of both rational and other behavioral heuristics and considerations.

The best response coefficients are all significant at the 0.01 level or better, and have values that range from 0.34 to 0.23. For example, Manufacturer 1 will raise price $.29 for every dollar implied by a rational best response adjustment from last period. As a way of interpreting these coefficients, if the four best response coefficients were all $1.00, and all of the other coefficients in the model were zero and there were no other source of error, then these equations would converge to the Vertical Nash equilibrium (assuming standard regularity conditions and a suitable starting point). Indeed, the motivating principle and assumption of the Vertical Nash equilibrium is that all players are best-responding to each other. Thus, for our experimental data, players are giving roughly 30% weight to their best response adjustment.

The imitation coefficients are all also highly significant at the 0.01 level or better, and have values ranging from 0.20 to 0.08. The two imitation coefficients relative to the other manufacturer are 0.20 and 0.18. Roughly speaking players can be interpreted as giving roughly 19% weight in their price adjustment to every $1 price increase implied by purely imitative behavior.

The retailer's imitation coefficients relative to the manufacturers are also 0.20 and 0.16. Retailers when setting net margin are behaving roughly in accordance with giving perhaps 18% weight are to every $1 increase implied by purely imitative behavior relative to the Manufacturer's net wholesale price. This may arise from the order of moves of the game. In a given round, retailers are given the manufacturers’ wholesale prices and the retailer, seeing this information, then is told to set the retail margin to complete the current round of pricing.

Manufacturers’ imitation coefficients are slightly lower, 0.10 and 0.08, indicating that they are giving less weight to the most recently observed retailers margin than the retailers are giving to the most recently observed manufacturer wholesale prices.

Manufacturers’ disadvantage inequality coefficients are also −.29 and −.19, and significant at the 0.01 and 0.05 levels, respectively. Thus (recognizing how the profit data was scaled), for every $1000 in profits that the other manufacturer earned last period in excess of what the focal manufacturer earned, the focal manufacturer will lower its price by $.29 and $.19, respectively. Given the parameters of the game in Table 1, there can often be profit differentials between the players of several thousand dollars, and this is associated with substantial price reductions to become more competitive.

Concerning channel interactions between a manufacturer and a retailer, the advantageous inequalities are all significant at the 0.01 level or more. For the retailer earning a profit surplus over its partner manufacturer, the coefficients are 0.68 and .27. For the manufacturer earning a profit surplus over the retailer, the coefficients are 0.29 and 0.19. These advantageous inequalities represent aggressive behavior relative to the channel partner, when a party is earning more profit than the channel partner, the original party has a tendency to capitalize on this strength and to raise its net price component still further! This finding is consistent with results from quantity competition experiments. Müller and Tan (2013) find positive and significant advantageous inequality coefficients in sequential play fixed-matching treatments of a duopoly market game (see Tables 10 and 11 in Section I of their Web Appendix), which indicates a player's tendency to raise its quantity in response to an advantageous inequality situation.

Cost is another significant coefficient in the first equation. Cost (difference) is a dummy variable for Treatment 3 which entails Manufacturer 1 having a $2.00 cost disadvantage (higher cost of $10) relative to Manufacturer 2 (whose cost is $8). Thus, the significant coefficient indicates that when Player 1 has a cost disadvantage, it has a tendency to offer $2.80 lower price than Manufacturer 2 – this is fairly aggressive behavior.

The last variable that is significant in both retailers’ equations is Spiteful, with coefficients of −1.48 (0.05 level) and −2.72 (0.01 level). These coefficients indicate highly responsive, and generally accommodative responses to aggressive efforts to price high (and choke off demand). Spiteful is a dummy variable that indicates that a player picked a high wholesale price or retail margin (in excess of $34) the previous period, then it is necessarily to lower price quickly in the current period. This also shows aggressive price-cutting behavior when need be. But this holds for the retailer (who may be responding to a manufacturer's current-period high wholesale price), indicating some measure of follower behavior (at least when price cuts are needed). The coefficients are not significant for the two manufacturers,

We also find that many of the group dummy variables are significant, often positive; this provides further evidence of heterogeneity across different groups (building on the evidence from Section 4.3). There is also no evidence of the Joint Profit Maximizing behavior.

Note that we did not find significant interactions between these various variables in Table 4 (a couple were almost marginally significant, but not interpretable). We also tried including dummy variables for all but one of the rounds, and these were generally not significant. To keep the presentation relatively short, these outcomes are not reported.

Overall, this constitutes an interesting set of results. There appears to be greater weight to behavioral responses (coefficients for an imitation effect and for the disadvantageous inequality) than to rational effects (coefficients on the best response function). And the relative weights make intuitive sense. The behavior described by these adjustment models is corroborated in the exit survey we took (see the online Appendix). There are a number of statements indicating that participants adjust prices when they see that other players make more profits than they do, in a way that is consistent with the associated disadvantageous inequality terms in the estimated fairness model. Similarly, other respondents consciously match competitors’ prices or net prices.

Experimental evidence has shown, in various contexts, that models assuming rational behavior based on profit maximization do not fully capture actual behavior. As a consequence, behavioral economists have proposed that fairness concerns can better explain observed behavior that is not consistent with the predictions of utility maximization. In fact, a considerable body of experimental economics literature supports fairness considerations in bargaining games (Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin, & Sefton, 1994; Roth, 1995), public good games (Andreoni, 1995; Ledyard, 1995), trust games (Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 1995), and coordination games (van Huyck, Gillette, & Battalio, 1992). In addition, research on relationship marketing has shown a significant role of fairness in channel relationships (Anderson & Weitz, 1992; Frazier, 1983; Heide & John, 1988; Kumar, 1996; Kumar et al., 1995; Li et al., 2009). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, none of these analyses empirically investigate the applicability of fairness concerns and pricing imitation in supply chain relationships when competition between suppliers exists.

This paper describes experiments that replicate some of the essential incentives present in a supply chain involving two manufacturers and a common retailer. The objectives of the study are to describe experimental outcomes of multi-period supply chain relationships when competition between suppliers exists and to examine the implications of fairness in such supply chain relationships.

We find that the game results are closest to the Symmetric Outcomes prediction in all three conditions. This means that the profit distribution between the players is very equal, suggesting the applicability of an “equity heuristic.” Thus, the manufacturers’ “first-mover” advantage in each round appears to be dissipated. Similarly, retailers do not appear to be exercising their power as the “common retailer” in this game structure.

Concerning the treatment conditions, for the incomplete information condition, we find more variation in outcomes between the two products than under full information. This indicates that there is more guesswork than under full information and that an equity heuristic would be somewhat harder to achieve. For the asymmetric production costs treatment condition, we find that the high-cost manufacturer is very responsive by pricing evenly lower than the cost disadvantage that it finds itself faced with.

With respect to individual players’ behavior, we find that manufacturers are setting their wholesale prices slightly above their profit-maximizing best responses, and retailers are setting their margins below their profit-maximizing best responses in most cases. This means that manufacturers are trying to exercise leadership in pricing, and retailers are playing more passively than a Stackelberg follower (consistent with an equity heuristic). It is natural for the retailer to be more concerned about “fair” payoffs than manufacturers because the retailer has the opportunity to maximize its profits given the decisions of the two manufacturers in our experiments.

The adjustment model results show how fairness concerns influence channel interactions. In fact, manufacturers are shown to lower prices in response a disadvantageous inequality, in order to become more competitive, gain market share, and possibly rectify a profit disadvantage.

Overall, our results suggest that actual competitive behavior in the supply chain context may be described by a combination of the predictions of the Manufacturer Stackelberg model and fairness concerns and a proclivity to imitate (or match) a competitor's price or a supply chain partner's price. In particular, retailer behavior is less aggressive. Under all treatment conditions, the net effect lies near the Symmetric Outcomes line, perhaps reflecting fairness concerns even in competitive environments and even under incomplete information. Such considerations may have implications for how to interpret the conclusions of one-shot, game-theoretic models intended to describe repeated-move contexts. In repeated-move contexts, the considerations of the folk theorem suggest a range of possible outcomes. Within this range, the outcome may be influenced by behavior based on social norms that factor into what players believe is “fair.” Our experiments show evidence of a norm associated with fairness, or an “equity heuristic,” as well as a tendency to imitate pricing behavior of a competitor or channel partner.

This suggests an important research avenue that incorporates fairness concerns into theoretic analyses and empirical investigations for supply chain relationships, pricing, promotions, and other market competition, particularly in long-term marketing relationships. For instance, recent work (e.g., Caliskan-Demirag et al., 2010, Cui et al., 2007, Du et al., 2014) shows the promise of incorporating fairness into a game theoretic channel model in the conventional dyad supply chain. They show that when channel members care about fairness, channel coordination can be facilitated and double marginalization may fail to materialize even in one-shot game settings. We look forward to extensions of this type of theoretical research to repeated-move games and to various supply chain structures.

More generally, our experimental results describe experimental market outcomes and individuals’ reactions in a two-manufacturer/common-retailer channel. We also look forward to extensions of this type of empirical research to different, and possibly more complex, supply chains.

Although examining the role of fairness in repeated supply channel interactions helps us understand the dynamic behavior in a realistic competitive supply chain, our approach has a limitation in that it cannot distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental reciprocity as the underlying motivation for fairness preferences. Both instrumental reciprocity and intrinsic reciprocity can increase the possibility of cooperation in repeated games (e.g, Sobel, 2005), and analysis of data such as ours cannot determine whether players are motivated by self-regarding or social preferences (e.g., Fehr & Krajbich, 2014). We again acknowledge this limitation and encourage additional examination of this issue.

In addition, we stress that our experiment involves a simple supply chain structure considering only one strategic variable-price. A direction for future research is to test more general models that include other variables such as advertising, promotions, quantity discounts, and store brands.
