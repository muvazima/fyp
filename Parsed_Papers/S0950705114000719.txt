                  A new approach to the rule-base evidential reasoning based on the synthesis of fuzzy logic, Atannasov’s intuitionistic fuzzy sets theory and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is proposed. It is shown that the use of intuitionistic fuzzy values and the classical operations on them directly may provide counter-intuitive results. Therefore, an interpretation of intuitionistic fuzzy values in the framework of Dempster-Shafer theory is proposed and used in the evidential reasoning. The merits of the proposed approach are illustrated with the use of developed expert systems for diagnostics of type 2 diabetes. Using the real-world examples, it is shown that such an approach provides reasonable and intuitively obvious results when the classical method of rule-base evidential reasoning cannot produce any reasonable results.

The methods of rule-base evidential reasoning are based on the synthesis of the tools of Fuzzy Sets theory 
                        
                           (
                           FST
                           )
                        
                      and the Dempster-Shafer theory 
                        
                           (
                           DST
                           )
                        
                     . The integration of FST and DST within symbolic, rule-based models primarily was used for solving control and classification problems [5,6,23,36,41]. These models combine these theories in a synergic way, preserving their strengths while avoiding disadvantages they present when used as monostrategy approaches. Generally, such a rule-base evidential reasoning system may be presented as in [6]:

These approaches seem to be justified in the solution of control and classification problems when outputs can be presented by real values.

On the other hand, if we deal with decision support systems, system’s outputs can be only the names or labels of corresponding actions or decisions, e.g., the names of medical diagnoses. It is clear that in such cases, the methods based on conventional fuzzy logic, developed for the controlling cannot be used at least directly. A more suitable for the building decision support systems seems to be the so-called RIMER approach proposed in [39,40] based on the Evidential Reasoning approach [38].

In the belief rule system, each possible consequent of a rule is associated with a belief degree. Such a rule base is capable to capture more complicated and continuous causal relationships between different factors than traditional IF-THEN rules. Therefore, the traditional IF-THEN rules may be treated as a special cases of the more general belief rule systems [20,25,30]. In the framework of rule-base inference methodology, using the evidential reasoning (RIMER) approach [39] a belief IF-THEN rule, e.g., the kth rule

In the framework of RIMER approach, the final outcome obtained as the aggregation of belief rules is presented as

                      to N, is the aggregated degree of belief in the decision (hypothesis, action, diagnosis) 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D

                     .

Therefore, the decision characterised by the maximal aggregated degree of belief is the best choice. So the RIMER approach can be used for building decision support systems. Nevertheless, there are two restrictions in the RIMER approach that reduce its ability to deal with uncertainties that decision makers often meet in practice.

The first restriction is that in the framework of RIMER approach, a degree of belief can be assigned only to a particular hypothesis, not to a group of them, whereas the assignment of a belief mass to a group of events is a key principle of the DST.

The second restriction is concerned with the observation that in many real-world decision problems we deal with different sources of evidence and the combination of them is needed. The RIMER approach does not provide a technique for the combination of evidence from different sources.

It is important that usually the advantages of the approaches based on the rule-base evidential reasoning were demonstrated using simple numerical examples and only relatively small number of examples of solving real-world problems using these approaches were found in the literature [6,22,29,35]. In [42], a novel updating algorithm for RIMER model is proposed based on iterative learning strategy for delayed coking unit 
                        
                           (
                           DCU
                           )
                        
                     . Daily DCU operations under different conditions are modelled by a belief rule-base, which is then updated using iterative learning methodology, based on a novel statistical utility for every belief rule. The paper [33] presents a hybrid evidential reasoning 
                        
                           (
                           ER
                           )
                        
                      and belief rule-based 
                        
                           (
                           BRB
                           )
                        
                      methodology for consumer preference prediction and a novel application to orange juices. In [19], a novel combination of fuzzy inference system and Dempster-Shafer Theory is applied to brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the purpose of segmentation where the pixel intensity and the spatial information are used as features. The authors of paper [32] proposed a specific algorithm-Evidential Reasoning based Classification algorithm to recognise human faces under class noise conditions. The methods used in these papers are charged with two above mentioned restrictions of RIMER approach. The method used in [24] is free of the second restriction while the first one is retained.

In [16,18,27], a new approach free of both above mentioned restrictions was developed and used for the solution of real-world problems.

It is important that in all above mentioned approaches to the rule-base evidential reasoning, the conventional fuzzy logic was used. For example, the following rule may be used: 
                        
                           If
                           
                           x
                           
                           is
                           
                           Low
                           
                           Then
                           
                           D
                        
                     , where Low is some fuzzy class defined by the corresponding membership function 
                        
                           
                              
                                 μ
                              
                              
                                 Low
                              
                           
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           ,
                           
                           D
                        
                      is a name of decision. Nevertheless, in practice we often deal with the intersecting fuzzy classes, e.g., Low and Middle, and therefore we often have

In the current paper, we will show that such a loss of information may lead to incorrect results in the rule-base evidential reasoning and a new method for the solution of these problems based in the synthesis of Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy sets (A-IFS) [1] and DST will be proposed.

In our recent paper [15], we have shown that there exists also a strong link between A-IFS and DST. This link makes it possible to use directly the Dempster’s rule of combination to aggregate local criteria presented by IFVs in multiple criteria decision making problems 
                        
                           (
                           MCDM
                           )
                        
                     . The usefulness of the developed method was illustrated using the known example of MCDM problem. In [17], we have shown that the classical arithmetical operations on intuitionistic fuzzy values IFVs have some limitations (drawbacks) which can lead to incorrect results in applications of A-IFS in different fields. Therefore, in [17] using interpretation of A-IFS in the framework of DST, a set of new operations on IFVs treated as belief intervals was proposed and it was proved that these operations are free of limitations (drawbacks) of the classical operations on IFVs.

To make the presentation of our approach more transparent, we shall use as an illustration the simple enough, but real-world problem of diagnostic of type-2 diabetes.

For these reasons, the rest of paper is set out as follows. Section 2 presents the basic definition of A-IFS and DST, the commonly used arithmetical operations on IFVs (with their limitations and drawbacks) and introduced in [17] new operations on IFVs in the framework of DST needed for the subsequent analysis. In Section 3, we present our new approach to the rule-base evidential reasoning based on the synthesis of A-IFS and DST and perform its advantages using examples obtained with the use of expert system for diagnostics of type 2 diabetes developed on the base of our approach. Finally, the concluding section summarises the paper.

The concept of A-IFS (the reasons for such a notation are presented in [14]) is based on the simultaneous consideration of membership

                        This aggregation operator provides IFVs, is idempotent and currently is the most popular in the solution of MCDM problems in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting.

An important problem is the comparison of IFVs. Therefore, the specific methods which are rather of heuristic nature were developed to compare IFVs. For this purpose, Chen and Tan [11] proposed to use the so-called score function (or net membership) 
                           
                              S
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              =
                              μ
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              -
                              ν
                              (
                              x
                              )
                           
                        . Let A and B be IFVs. It is intuitively appealing that if 
                           
                              S
                              (
                              A
                              )
                              >
                              S
                              (
                              B
                              )
                           
                         then A should be greater (better) than B, but if 
                           
                              S
                              (
                              A
                              )
                              =
                              S
                              (
                              B
                              )
                           
                         this does not always mean that A is equal to B. Therefore, Hong and Choi [21] in addition to the above score function introduced the so-called accuracy function 
                           
                              H
                              (
                              x
                              )
                              =
                              μ

Xu [34] used the functions S and H to construct order relations between any pair of intuitionistic fuzzy values A and B as follows:

Summarising, we can say that the undesirable properties of addition (1) and multiplication (3) operations lead to the undesirable properties of intuitionistic weighted arithmetic mean operator (11). Moreover, this operator seems rather like some modification of intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator since in (11) the multiplication by weights

                               is changed by the power operator, i.e., the usual weighted averaging structure is violated.

Therefore, in our paper [17] using interpretation of A-IFS in the framework of DST, a set of new operations on IFVs treated as belief intervals was proposed and it was proved that these operations are free of limitations (drawbacks) of the classical operations on IFVs. We will recall briefly these results in the following subsection.

Firstly we recall briefly the basics of DST needed for the subsequent analysis.

                         go back to the work by A.P. Dempster [13] who developed a system of upper and lower probabilities. Following this work his student G. Shafer [28] provided a more thorough explanation of belief functions.

Assume A are subsets of X. It is important to note that a subset A may be treated also as a question or proposition and X as a set of propositions or mutually exclusive hypotheses or answers. A DS belief structure has associated with it a mapping m, called basic probability assignment (bpa), from subsets of X into a unit interval,

                         is called the degree of conflict which measures the conflict between the pieces of evidence. Zadeh [43] underlined that this rule involves counter-intuitive behaviours in the case of considerable conflict.

It is important to note that the Dempster’s rule is commutative and associative, but not idempotent operator. Nevertheless, in spite of the lack of idempotency, the Dempster’s rule is successfully used in different real-world applications.

The above information of DST is quite enough for the presentation of A-IFS in terms of DST.

It was shown in [15] that convenient for practical applications methods for MCDM can be developed using DST semantics for A-IFS.

It was shown in [15] that in the framework of DST the triplet

                         represents the basic assignment function. Really, when analysing any situation in context of A-IFS, we implicitly deal with the following three hypotheses:

At first glance, the Definition 1 seems as a simple redefinition of A-IFS in terms of Interval Valued Fuzzy Sets, but this interpretation makes it possible to represent mathematical operations on IFVs as operations on belief intervals. The use of the semantics of DST makes it possible to enhance the performance of A-IFS when dealing with the operations on IFVs.

In [17], the two sets of operations on IFVs based on the interpretation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets in the framework of DST were proposed and analysed. The first set of operations is based on the treatment of belief interval as an interval enclosing a true probability. The second set of operations is based on the treatment of belief interval as an interval enclosing a true power of some statement (argument, hypothesis, etc.). It was shown in [17] that the non-probabilistic treatment of belief intervals representing IFVs performs better than the probabilistic one and operations based on the probabilistic and non-probabilistic treatments of belief intervals representing IFVs perform better than operations on IFVs defined in the framework of conventional A-IFS.

Therefore, here we shall use only the treatment of belief interval as an interval enclosing a true power of some statement.

Based on this reasoning, we can say that if we pronounce this statement, we can obtain some result, e.g., as a reaction on this statement or as an answer to some question, and if we repeat this statement twice, the result does not change.

Such a reasoning implies the following property of addition operator:

                        It is easy to see that operators (22) and (23) in practice will produce equivalent orderings of compared alternatives.

Since BIs are regular intervals, the problem of their comparison is the problem of interval comparison. A lot of methods for interval comparison is proposed in the literature. To compare intervals, usually the quantitative indices are used (see reviews in [31,26]). The most of them are simple enough, but some methods seem to be complicated ones. For example, in [26] it was shown that the result of interval comparison is belief interval. In [9], the authors introduced the concept of an admissible order as a total order that extends the usual partial order between intervals and proposed a method to build these admissible orders in terms of two aggregation functions. In [10], the admissible order is used to study the construction of interval-valued ordered weighted aggregation operators.

Nevertheless, all proposed approaches to the interval comparison provide the same qualitative intuitively clear results.

Therefore, here we will use the simple approach to the interval comparison based on the interval subtraction. It is justified in [17] that based on this approach, to compare belief intervals it is enough to compare their centres.

With the use of corresponding theorem, it was proved in [17] that introduced operations on belief intervals are free of undesirable properties (1)–(4) of conventional operations on IFVs.

Strictly speaking, the synthesis of fuzzy logic and 
                        
                           A
                           -
                           IFS
                        
                      is not a new idea, since in [8] a method for inference in approximate reasoning based on the normal 
                        
                           A
                           -
                           IFS
                        
                      was proposed. The authors of this paper wrote that they used a very specific method of inference in one dimensional case and for normal 
                        
                           A
                           -

                     .

Here we present an another approach to the solution this problem based on the synthesis of fuzzy logic, 
                        
                           A

                      and DST.

Of course, in practice the rule-based evidential reasoning systems may involve hundreds of rules [16]. But the analysis of methodological aspects on the base of such great systems is usually very difficult. Therefore, to present our approach in a more transparent form, in this section we shall use a relatively simple example of building the expert system for diagnosing type 2 diabetes which makes it possible to show the features of the proposed approach and avoid here the use of complicated general expressions.

It is important also that in spite of simplicity this system is the real-world one.

The following tests are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for diagnosing of the type 2 diabetes:
                        
                           Test 1. A fasting plasma glucose test measures blood glucose in a person who has not eaten anything for at least 8h.

Test 2. An oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose after a person fasts at least 8h and 2h after the person drinks a glucose- containing beverage.

These tests are used to detect diabetes and pre-diabetes. Although, WHO proposes crisp intervals for blood glucose which correspond to the health (H), Pre-diabetes (H,D) and diabetes (D), in practice doctors use for diagnostics, e.g., such fuzzy concepts as Low, Medium and Big blood glucose, which can be presented by corresponding membership functions as in Fig. 1

Therefore, the diagnosis Pre-diabetes in the spirit of DST can be treated as the compound hypothesis (H,D). Based on the known approaches to the rule-base evidential reasoning [16,18] we get the following rules:

Since these two tests are different sources of evidence, to obtain the final diagnosis they should be combined using an appropriate combination rule.

It is important that the classical fuzzy logic may lead to the counterintuitive results. That may be explained as follows. In the test 1, we take into account only diagnosis H, whereas the diagnosis (H,D) is possible as well with a non-zero value of membership function

                     It is easy to see that the part of components of above sums may be equal to 0 in the concrete situations. Of course, the obtained bpa should be normalised.

Another problem of classical approach is that it is possible in the considered case to use two different rules:

Since we cannot use these rules simultaneously, we need an additional information to choose a correct rule and this information usually may be found only out of the framework of classical fuzzy logic.

Summarising, we can say that the known methods of rule-base evidential seasoning have some inherent limitations and drawbacks and may lead to the loss of important information which may affect the final results.

To avoid this problem, we propose to use the tools of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. To clarify the basics of proposed approach, consider an example which can be treated as an extension of reasoning used by Atannasov [3] to explain the essence of 
                        
                           A
                           -
                           IFS
                        
                     .

Let us consider a general presidential election where 30% of eligible population votes for the first candidate (X) and 50% – for the second one (Y). The rest of the votes, 20%, are for none or lost for some other reason. For the first candidate X one can state that the membership 
                        
                           μ
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      of the eligible population to those who support the first candidate is equal to 0.3; the membership 
                        
                           μ
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                      to those who does not support the first candidate because they prefer the second candidate is equal to 0.5; Therefore, we can say that 
                        
                           ν
                           (
                           X
                           )
                           =
                           μ
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                        
                      is the non-membership to those who support the candidate X. Similarly, for the second candidate we have 
                        
                           ν
                           (
                           Y
                           )
                           =
                           μ
                           (
                           X
                           )
                        
                      and the uncertain part also known as hesitation degree 
                        
                           π
                           (
                           X
                           ,
                           Y
                           )
                        
                      is equal to 0.2.

This reasoning may be used for the presentation of intersecting membership functions. Let us consider the Fig. 1.

                      belongs to the fuzzy class Low with the membership equal to

An important question arises: does the fundamental property of 
                        
                           A
                           -
                           IFS
                        
                      
                     
                        
                           (
                           μ
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           +
                           ν
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           )
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                      hold for all cases when we deal with the intersecting fuzzy classes? Below we shall show that this property holds only if membership functions of competing fuzzy classes satisfy jointly some reasonable and justified conditions which are not so important in the framework of traditional approach.

Let us consider some illustrative examples. In Fig. 1, we can see that competing membership functions intersect in the points where the values of membership functions are less or equal to 0.5, and therefore the fundamental property of 
                        
                           A
                           -
                           IFS
                           
                           (
                           μ
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           +
                           ν
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           )
                           ⩽
                           1
                        
                      holds. In Fig. 2
                     , we can see that if competing membership functions intersect in the points where the values of membership functions are equal to 0.5 we have

On the other hand, if the membership functions intersect in the point where their values are greater than 0.5 (see Fig. 2), the fundamental property of 
                        
                           A

The next step is the combination of obtained bpas. To do that we propose to use the direct intuitionistic fuzzy extension of the Dempster’s rule (16). If bpas are usual real values, the Dempster’s rule produces a resulting

                     . It is important to note that in this case the normalisation (division by 1-K) is obligatory. Obviously, if bpas are presented by IFVs there is no way to provide such a normalisation. On the other hand, all classical operations on IFVs produce IFVs as well. Hence, using only the numerator of direct intuitionistic fuzzy extension of (16) we obtain

                     In the considered case, we deal with the fuzzy rules with interval-valued consequent attributes. This can be treated as a considerable complication of the problem. On the other hand, in [7] the solution of much more complicated problem of approximate reasoning based on the interval-valued fuzzy sets is presented.

In this case, we can say only that we deal with a high conflict between the pieces of evidence and cannot obtain a reasonable solution (diagnosis) in the considered real-world example. On the other hand, according to the doctor’s opinion, in our case the diagnosis Pre-diabetes seems to be more justified than Diabetes and Diabetes is more preferable than Health. The Pre-diabetes is intuitively obvious for the doctor in the considered example. Moreover, in his informal, but based on common sense analysis, the doctor considered the values

                     . We can see that in this case the diagnosis Pre-diabetes is completely excluded. This result is in contradiction with common sense since in both test (see Fig. 4) we have non-zero and even considerable arguments in favour of Pre-diabetes.

Therefore, the use of conventional fuzzy logic may lead to the loss of information, which may be very important, e.g., if we extend the task considering the third source of evidence where the diagnosis Pre-diabetes is dominating one.

Summarising, we can say that the interpretation of 
                        
                           A
                           -

                      in the framework of DST makes it possible to use more information in the evidential reasoning, and as a consequence to obtain reasonable results when the synthesis of classical fuzzy logic and DST is failed.

The counter-intuitive results obtained in the first critical example with the use of (25) and (27) when operations the

It is shown that the direct use of intuitionistic fuzzy values and classical operations on them may lead to the counter-intuitive results. This may be a consequence of bad properties of classical operation on intuitionistic fuzzy values. It is shown that the interpretation of
