                  This work is concerned with the development of an efficient and robust isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation for the mechanical simulation of thin-walled structures. Such structures are usually defined by non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) surfaces in industrial design software. The usage of isogeometric shell elements can avoid costly conversions from NURBS surfaces to other surface or volume geometry descriptions. The shell formulation presented in this contribution uses a continuous orthogonal rotation described by Rodrigues’ tensor in every integration point to compute the current director vector. The rotational state is updated in a multiplicative manner. Large deformations and finite rotations can be described accurately. The proposed formulation is robust in terms of stable convergence behavior in the nonlinear equilibrium iteration for large load steps and geometries with large and arbitrary curvature, and in terms of insensitivity to shell intersections with kinks under small angles. Three different integration schemes and their influence on accuracy and computational costs are assessed. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation is shown with the help of several examples. Accuracy and efficiency is compared to an isogeometric shell formulation with the more common discrete rotational concept and to Lagrange-based finite element shell formulations. The competitiveness of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation in terms of computational costs to attain a pre-defined error level is shown.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Thin-walled structures occur frequently both in nature and in man-made structures due to their advantageous ratio between load capacity and dead weight. They can be described by a two-parametrical surface embedded in the three-dimensional space together with the description of the thickness behavior. Such dimensionally reduced structure models are called shells. The two main formulations for the analysis of shells are Kirchhoff–Love and Reissner–Mindlin shell formulations; see e.g. the survey work  [1]. The deformation behavior of thin shells is dominated by bending and membrane strains, whereas the behavior of thick shells is also influenced by transverse shear strains. A common distinction criterion between thick and thin shells is a ratio of 
                        20

                        1
                      between radius of curvature and wall thickness. Within this work a shear-deformable Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation is proposed, which is able to accurately describe the deformation behavior of thin and moderate thick shells. The thickness dimension is described with the help of a director vector. The kinematic behavior is expressed by displacements and rotations as additional unknowns, which are used to model the deformations of the director vector. Only first derivatives of the displacements and of the additional unknowns appear in the equilibrium equation. Thus, 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                     -continuity of deformations and additional unknowns suffices.

Current CAD tools describe thin-walled structures by their mid-surface with the help of non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) surfaces. The basic idea of isogeometric analysis, which was introduced in  [2], is to use the same geometry description for design and analysis in order to increase accuracy and to reduce computational costs induced by conversions. NURBS surfaces are two-parametrical surfaces embedded in the three-dimensional space, which is exactly the kind of geometry definition shell formulations are based on. Thus, efficient NURBS-based shell formulations are essential for the isogeometric analysis of thin-walled structures in order to avoid conversions to volumetric NURBS. The higher continuity provided by splines allows an exact determination of curvature, tangent and normal vectors in every physical point. This favors the formulation of a shell formulation which takes advantage of this additional geometrical information.

The first shell formulation in the context of isogeometric analysis basing on the Kirchhoff–Love shell theory was presented in  [3]. As a Kirchhoff–Love kinematics is used, no rotational degrees of freedom are needed at the expense of required 
                        
                           
                              C

                     -continuity of displacements between elements. This requires penalty-like measures at the intersection of patches to avert unintentional hinge-like behavior, see  [4]. This shell formulation is used in  [5] as a basis for the simulation of arbitrary complex NURBS surface geometries. A further rotation-free shell formulation was proposed in  [6], where the need for higher continuity is avoided by fulfilling the Kirchhoff conditions only in discrete points. The first isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation was proposed in  [7]. The interpolation of the current director vector is accomplished by rotating nodal director vectors in a discrete manner. The quality of the interpolation of rotations deteriorates with rising order of the NURBS basis functions. Thus, divergent deformation behavior can occur. A Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation which uses a more precise continuous rotational formulation is proposed by the first author of this work in  [8,9]. The continuous rotation ensures convergence and stability for rising orders of the NURBS basis functions. However, the rotational formulation used in  [8,9] yields a problematic path-dependency for geometries with kinks under large rotations, which is shown in the Appendix and in  [10]. This is the main motivation for the rotational formulation proposed in this work which reduces this path-dependency to an extent at which its influence is negligible and at the same time is more efficient.

All shell formulations mentioned above do not take any measures against locking effects. The hierarchic shell formulation with linear kinematics proposed in  [11] is by construction free from transverse shear locking, which occurs in Reissner–Mindlin shells with standard kinematics. Furthermore, the DSG method (Discrete Strain Gap, see  [12]) and the usage of a Hellinger–Reissner variational formulation are examined to alleviate remaining locking effects. A non-uniform integration rule for shell elements is presented in  [13]. This rule is designed to overcome locking by using an optimal number and layout of integration points. Isogeometric shell formulations of volumetric type with methods against locking are proposed in  [14–16].

The main objective of this contribution is to propose a shell formulation which is adapted to the possibilities and challenges yielded by the isogeometric concept. The numerical efficiency shall be comparable to standard finite element shell formulations. The exact geometry and the existence of a uniquely defined normal vector field are used to obtain robust computations with minimal user interaction. The term robust refers to computations with stable convergence behavior in the nonlinear equilibrium iteration for large load steps and geometries with large and arbitrary curvature. Furthermore, insensitivity to shell intersections with kinks under small angles is subsumed under the term robustness. The geometry is defined by a reference surface and a director vector field. The Reissner–Mindlin kinematic assumptions are enforced with the help of a rotational formulation to determine the current director vector. The geometrically nonlinear formulation allows the simulation of problems including large deformations and rotations. A precise concept for the interpolation of the current director vector using a continuous rotation with multiplicative update is proposed, which is the key to an efficient and robust isogeometric shell formulation. The non-uniform integration rule proposed in  [13] is extended to higher order NURBS and used in order to increase efficiency and especially to show the behavior of the proposed shell formulation if methods to reduce locking effects are taken.

                        B
                      with the thickness 
                        h
                      being significantly smaller than the two other dimensions are referred to as shell structures. This fosters a dimensional reduction to a two-dimensional surface in space with additional information about the thickness. In this work two kinematic assumptions are made for the dimensional reduction. The first assumption is that cross sections remain straight during deformation and the second assumption is the inextensibility condition in thickness direction. Shell formulations with these two kinematic assumptions are mostly referred to as Reissner–Mindlin shells to honor these authors’ contributions to theory of plates. The incorporation of transverse shear deformations entails realistic simulation results both for thin and thick shell structures. However, problems involving large strains cannot be treated properly due to the inextensibility assumptions. Problems of this class require additional parameters for thickness stretching.

The presented shell theory is derived from the three-dimensional continuum. The shell body is described by the shell reference surface

                         in combination with an inextensible director vector field

The entailed error is very small and negligible unless large curvatures occur. For a study on the influence of this approximation see  [1]. The unapproximated derivation can be found in  [10].

                           The application of a non-uniform Gauss integration rule basing on the work of  [13] slightly reduces locking effects. This reduction shows the behavior of the presented shell formulation if measures against locking are taken.

This is in contrast to previous works of the first author  [8] and the decisive difference which almost completely removes the path-dependency of the shell formulation with continuous rotations and additive rotational update that is presented in  [8]. Multiplicative update schemes were proposed e.g. in  [22] and  [23] for beams and shells, respectively. The incremental axial vector of the rotation

The presented shell theory is discretized with NURBS surfaces to make it amenable to numerical solution procedures. The isogeometric finite element method is used. Details about the basics of NURBS and isogeometric analysis can be found in  [24,25]. Complex geometries consist in general of several NURBS patches, which are defined independently in the geometry model. The total number of patches is denoted by

The paradigm of isogeometric analysis is to use the basis functions of the geometry description also in the frame of the analysis for the geometry definition and the approximation of unknowns. Thus, the geometry is defined exactly in every discretization. Within this work the geometry is defined by means of NURBS surface patches as defined in Section  3. The isogeometric shell element formulation presented in the following bases on the shell theory presented in Section  2. Computations with this element formulation are referred to as continuous in the numerical examples in Section  6.

It is extended to achieve a discontinuous interpolation of the director vector at kinks in  [9]. This method named computation of optimal nodal basis systems is given in full detail in  [10].

                        update is discussed in  [23] and elaborated in  [27]. But the idea is not followed further in  [23] as the higher computational effort does not pay off for the employed low-order Lagrange basis functions. The situation is shown to be different for higher order NURBS basis functions with the help of numerical examples in Section  6. This concept has been used in isogeometric analysis for the first time in  [10], where it is referred to by the abbreviation 
                           Δ
                        RID
                           ω
                        . This abbreviation reflects that a multiplicative update of the rotation of interpolated director vectors is performed, and that 
                           Δ
                           ω
                         is the interpolated rotational quantity.

The integrals for the element stiffness matrix and the element residual vector defined in Eq. (81) have to be evaluated numerically. In this investigation Gauss integration is used. Three different Gauss schemes are considered and compared in the numerical examples in Section  6. The number of integration points required for each integration scheme is compared in Fig. 2
                      for an exemplary NURBS mesh.

                         holds in both parametric directions. The usage of integration rule (87) is denoted by reduced integration (RI) in the following. This integration scheme yields 324 integration points for the exemplary NURBS mesh of Fig. 2. The integration points are visualized in Fig. 2(b).

A non-uniform Gauss integration rule for beam elements with uniform continuity is proposed in  [29]. Basing on a balance between unknowns and equations integration rules for quadratic and cubic B-spline basis functions are provided. The number of integration points is chosen to both alleviate locking and to preclude zero-energy modes. This approach is applied to shell formulations basing on NURBS surfaces in  [13].

Basing on the works aforementioned, which are restricted to quadratic and cubic B-splines, an integration rule for higher order NURBS surfaces is proposed in the following. This integration scheme represents a generalization of the scheme established in  [13]. The number of integration points is defined separately for every knot span in the two parametric directions

                         is used for the interior knot spans. The usage of this integration scheme is denoted by non-uniform integration (NI). The rules for the determination of integration points for every element are summarized in Table 1
                        . The accuracy of the integration rule slightly depends on the boundary conditions. If no or almost no boundary conditions are set in one parametric direction, the system response may be too soft. Thus, we add one more integration point at each end of the knot vector, which yields a more conservative integration rule. In the third knot span from either side also

                              )
                           
                         is used. In this case the integration rule is referred to as non-uniform integration (NI∗). This alteration affects only knot vectors with more than four elements in the corresponding parametric direction. Thus, in Table 2
                         only the two affected cases are displayed.

The definition of the non-uniform integration rule (NI∗) is rather empirical but it is suitable to stabilize computations in most cases. However, the numerical example given in Section  6.6 shows that adding one integration point at each end of the knot vector is not sufficient in all cases. This clearly shows that in-depth research is necessary to establish a reliable non-uniform integration rule. In all cases the correct number of rigid body rotations in an eigenvalue analysis of an unsupported patch was observed. This shows that no zero energy modes occur. At this point it is to be noted that the primary aim of establishing and using non-uniform integration within this work is to show the behavior of the proposed shell formulation if methods against locking are taken. Thus, no further investigations on stability and efficacy against locking are performed here. The non-uniform integration rule is applied as defined in order to examine the influence of methods against locking on each rotational concept. Furthermore, the reduction of computational costs yield by the reduction of integration points is a welcome side effect.

The integration scheme for the two-dimensional case is attained by a tensor product of the one-dimensional integration schemes. The use of non-uniform integration (NI) yields 144 integration points for the exemplary NURBS mesh of Fig. 2. The integration points are visualized in Fig. 2(c).

The proposed integration rule is not able to determine the area of the reference surface accurately. Thus, the element area

                         is computed using the reduced integration rule defined in Eq. (87). With the help of the accurate element area

                         a correction factor is determined.

Linear and nonlinear numerical examples are used to verify the implementation and to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation, which uses a continuous rotation to determine the current director vector. The results are compared to an isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation with a discrete rotational concept, see Section  6.1. The two shell formulations differ only in the rotational concept and are identical in all other aspects in order to allow a good comparison. Furthermore, efficiency is compared to finite element shell formulations with linear Lagrange basis functions. The influence of the integration schemes is assessed. Special focus is put on problems yielding large deformations and large rotations as well as on shell geometries with kinks. The orders of the NURBS basis functions in all patches and all parametric directions are uniform and denoted by 
                        p
                     . Order elevation is performed using 
                        k
                     -refinement. All computations are carried out in an extended version  [30] of the finite element code FEAP  [31].

Computations with the shell formulation presented in this contribution are referred to as continuous to denote the continuous character of the interpolation of the director vector. In  [10] the abbreviation 
                           Δ
                        RID
                           ω
                         is used to refer to this concept. The results of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept are compared to computations with a discrete rotational concept, of which the characteristic formulae are sketched in the right column of Table 3
                        ; see  [8,10] for more details. This concept in its diverse forms is used in the majority of Reissner–Mindlin shell formulations in literature, e.g.  [7,13,23,32,33]. The main feature of this concept is the interpolation of the current director vector in the form

                        . In some cases a multiplicative update instead of the additive update shown in Table 3 is used. The results do not differ significantly between the different forms of discrete concepts. In  [10] computations with the discrete concept and a multiplicative update are denoted by 
                           Δ
                        RND. The results have shown to coincide with the RND concept exactly except in proximity to the singularity of 
                           
                              R
                           
                        . Where required by the absolute value of rotations the multiplicative scheme 
                           Δ
                        RND is used for computations; in other cases the RND scheme as shown in Table 3 is used for the discrete concept. The difference between the RND and the 
                           Δ
                        RND concept in terms of computational costs is negligible. A comparison of the presented isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations to previous works  [8,9], which use a continuous rotational concept with more complicated interpolation and additive rotational updates, is given in the Appendix.

The pinched cylinder is a numerical benchmark from the shell obstacle course proposed in  [34]. It is a severe test for both inextensional bending modes and complex membrane states  [34]. The geometrical shape is a cylinder of radius 
                           R
                           =

                           600
                        . It is constrained at both ends by a rigid diaphragm. The material is specified by a Young’s modulus 
                           E
                           =

                           3
                        . Due to symmetry only one eight of the geometry is modeled. A system sketch is given in Fig. 3
                        . The system is loaded by a point load  
                           F
                        . The consideration of transverse shear deformations entails a slight singularity in the deformations at the loaded point. The influence of this singularity is negligible as can be seen in the mesh refinement study in Fig. 4(a). The rigid diaphragm is modeled by fixing all in-plane displacements at the concerned edge as well as the rotation around the tangent vector in circumferential direction. All computations are linear and the curvature is constant. Thus, the differences between the deformation results of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept and deformation results of a shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept are very small and only results for the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations are shown. The pinched cylinder is used to show the influence of the integration rules on the deformation results and on computational costs. Furthermore, the accuracy of the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations is compared to isogeometric reference shell formulations. All deformations in Fig. 4
                         are normalized to a deformation

                         of the loaded control point in direction of the load. This value is the rounded result of a computation with 200×200 elements of polynomial order 
                           p
                           =

                         with the presented shell formulation using the continuous rotational concept and non-uniform integration (NI).

The deformation results of computations with the continuous rotational concept using full integration (FI), reduced integration (RI) and non-uniform integration (NI) are compared in Fig. 4(a). Full integration (FI) yields the worst results for all orders. The convergence behavior is improved for all three displayed orders by using reduced integration (RI), whereby the greatest difference occurs for 
                           p
                           =

                         is a clear indication for the presence of locking, which is, from a numerical point of view, caused by spurious constraints. The use of less integration points reduces the number of constraints in the system, and thus reduces locking effects, see  [13]. The graphs of full integration (FI) and reduced integration (RI) for 
                           p

                          (RI) is not sufficient to alleviate locking significantly. The use of non-uniform integration (NI) further reduces the number of integration points. The results of computations using non-uniform integration (NI) are more accurate than those with reduced integration (RI). Even in the high order case 
                           p
                           =
                           5
                         significant improvements are visible if non-uniform integration (NI) is used. Thus, locking occurs even for higher orders. A positive side effect of non-uniform integration (NI) is a significant reduction of computational costs. The presented shell formulation with the continuous rotation concept is compared to a shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept in Table 4
                        . In the case of full integration (FI), the computational costs for the formation of the stiffness matrix of the continuous rotation concept are between 2.3 times and 1.3 times higher than for the discrete rotational concept. In the case of non-uniform integration (NI), this ratio reduces to 1.5 times for an order 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        , 1.17 times for 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         and 1.05 times for 
                           p
                           =
                           6
                        . As a rule of thumb, it can be said that the computational costs of reduced integration (RI) are about half of full integration (FI), whereas non-uniform integration (NI) is only about one fifth of it. The time for solution is independent of the integration rule and the rotational concept.

The deformation convergence behavior of the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations is compared to reference shell formulations in Fig. 4(b). The isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell proposed by Kiendl et al.  [3] and the isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell presented by Benson et al.  [7] are used as reference. The ratio between radius and wall thickness is 
                           R
                           /
                           t
                           =
                           100
                        , which classifies the system as thin shell. Thus, transverse shear strains do not cause significant deformations. This allows a comparison to results attained with Kirchhoff–Love shell formulations. Computations are performed with order 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        , 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           5
                        . The results of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept using non-uniform integration (NI) are slightly superior to the reference results of Kiendl et al.  [3]. The use of non-uniform integration for the reference shell formulation of Kiendl et al.  [3] would surely yield results which are in the same range as the results of the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations. The accuracy of computations with presented shell formulation with continuous rotations improves with rising order  
                           p
                         of the NURBS basis functions, which is not the case in the reference computations of Benson et al.  [7].

This example shows that the reduction of integration points, which is yielded by the use of non-uniform integration (NI), increases efficiency significantly as both accuracy is improved and computational costs are reduced. Thus, for this example the use of non-uniform integration is recommended.

The Scordelis–Lo roof is part of the shell obstacle course proposed in  [34] and mainly tests the ability to solve complex states of membrane strains. Membrane locking has no significant influence in this example; see  [34]. The geometry is defined by an 80° section of a cylinder which is fixed by a rigid diaphragm at both ends of the cylinder. The two other edges are free. The radius of the cylinder is 
                           R
                           =
                           25
                         and the length is given by 
                           L
                           =
                           50
                        . Only one quarter is modeled due to symmetry. A uniform gravity load of 
                           g
                           =
                           90
                         is applied in vertical direction, which is defined by the normal vector in the intersection of the two symmetry axes. A system sketch is given in Fig. 5
                        . The Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio are defined by 
                           E
                           =

                         and 
                           ν
                           =
                           0
                        , respectively. The wall thickness is 
                           t
                           =
                           0.25
                        . The rigid diaphragm is modeled by fixing all in-plane displacements at the concerned edge.

The displacements 
                           u
                         in vertical direction at point A are used in Fig. 6
                         to assess the deformation convergence behavior. The reference deformation value 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 r
                                 e
                                 f
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.3024
                         is taken from  [34]. A comparison to other isogeometric shell formulations is given in Fig. 6(a). The number of elements per complete edge is used as abscissa to allow a good comparison to the results of  [11], which are performed for the complete model. Thus, the number of elements per edge in the symmetric model is multiplied by two. The deformation results in Echter et al.  [11] are provided depending on the number of control points along the complete edge. This number has to be subtracted by two for the use in Fig. 6(a). The results in Kiendl et al.  [3] are provided depending on the number of control points along one symmetric part of the edge. This number has to be subtracted by two and then multiplied by two for the use in Fig. 6(a). The reference curve Ref. Echter et al.  [11], R-M, hier. are computations with the hierarchic isogeometric shell formulation proposed in  [11] using a Reissner–Mindlin kinematics and a pure displacement formulation. The reference curve Ref. Echter et al.  [11], R-M, hier. HS are computations with the hierarchic isogeometric shell formulation proposed in  [11] using a Reissner–Mindlin kinematics and a hybrid stress Hellinger–Reissner variational formulation. The reference curve Ref. Kiendl et al.  [3], K-L are computations with the isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell formulation proposed in  [3]. Computations with the isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations are given for full integration (FI), reduced integration (RI) and non-uniform integration (both NI and NI∗). The results of the computations using full integration (FI) correspond very well to the reference results with the displacement-based shell formulation of Echter et al.  [11] and the isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell formulation of Kiendl et al.  [3]. If reduced integration (RI) or non-uniform integration (both NI and NI∗) is used, then the computations with the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations agree very well with the results of the hybrid stress formulation of Echter et al.  [11].

A more detailed comparison of the integration schemes presented in this work is given in Fig. 6(b). Here the number of control points along one part of the symmetric edge is used as abscissa. Reduced integration (RI) yields the most precise results for coarse meshes, and non-uniform integration (NI) is the best choice for fine meshes. The differences between non-uniform integration (NI) and non-uniform integration (NI∗) are only very small. Furthermore, the influence of the area correction factor introduced in Section  5.3 is studied. Computations where this correction factor is skipped are denoted by an appended ANC in Fig. 6(b). The curves for computations with corrected area and without corrected area correspond very well. This shows that the influence of the area correction factor on the deformation results is negligible. The error of the area is given in Table 5
                         for some exemplary values. The area is computed several orders of magnitude more exact if the correction factor is used in comparison to computations without the correction factor. However, the influence of an error for the area in the range of 10−5 is negligible.

This example shows that the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations is competitive to existing isogeometric shell formulations in the literature. If reduced integration or non-uniform integration is used, then locking effects are significantly reduced for the Scordelis–Lo roof with basis functions of order 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        . The shell formulation of this work with reduced or non-uniform integration yields the same level of accuracy as the hierarchic isogeometric shell formulation with hybrid stress formulation proposed in  [11].

The hemispherical shell with hole is used to test the ability of the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations to handle large deformations and finite rotations and to compare its efficiency to an isogeometric shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept as well as to Lagrange-based finite element shell formulations. The linear form of this benchmark example was proposed in  [35]. The geometry is a hemispherical shell with an 
                           18
                           °
                         hole in the center. The upper and lower edge are free. The system is loaded with radial point loads  
                           2
                           F
                         on the equatorial edge with alternating orientation every

                           °
                        . Due to symmetry only one fourth of the system is modeled. The system is sketched in Fig. 7
                        . The radius of the hemisphere is given by 
                           R

                           =
                           100
                         is applied in ten equal loadsteps and yields large deformations and rotations. Nonlinear reference computations with finite shell elements can be found e.g. in  [23,33]. Nonlinear computations with isogeometric shell elements are reported in  [36,37], where results for discretizations with 16 and 256 elements are provided. Results obtained with the discrete rotational concept as well as with a more expensive, additively updated continuous rotational concept are given in  [8]. The main intention within this contribution is to show the competitiveness of the presented isogeometric shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept to Lagrange-based finite shell element formulations. The consideration of transverse shear deformations entails a slight singularity in the deformations at the loaded points. Thus, the solution tends to infinity for decreasing element size. In the range of the considered element sizes, the effect of the singularity is very small in comparison to the differences between the respective rotational concepts. Thus, the comparison of different concepts with the help of a deformation convergence study is of significance and this example can be used for a study of efficiency. The deformation

                        . This value is obtained by determining the mean value of the deformation 
                           u
                         computed with the proposed shell formulation using the continuous rotational concept and the integration schemes FI, RI and NI∗, whereby the system is discretized with 200×200 elements of order  
                           p
                           =
                           6
                        . Two finite shell element formulations based on linear Lagrange basis functions (
                           p
                           =
                           1
                        ) are used as reference for the assessment of efficiency. The results of a purely deformation-based nonlinear four node shell element are referred to as FE displacement. This shell element uses the rotational formulation presented in  [38] and the discrete shear gap (DSG) method (see  [39]) to alleviate locking effects. Results of a nonlinear mixed hybrid quadrilateral shell element basing on a Hu–Washizu variational formulation are referred to as FE Hu–Washizu. This element formulation is described in  [33]. Both finite shell elements were provided by Friedrich Gruttmann and are implemented in the same finite element code as the isogeometric shell elements of this work.

The deformation convergence behavior of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept is compared to computations with the discrete rotational concept and to Lagrange-based finite shell element computations in Fig. 8 for different orders  
                           p
                        . Results for full integration (FI) are given in Fig. 8(a). The deformation results of the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotation show monotonically increasing accuracy for mesh refinement and order elevation, and the graphs of all orders converge from below. Computations with the discrete rotational concept yield comparable results for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        , but this concept yields convergence from above for higher orders with deteriorating accuracy for rising orders. Beginning from 
                           p
                           =
                           6
                        , computations with discrete rotation are instable and thus not shown. The error level of the reference finite element computations with Lagrange basis functions of order 
                           p
                           =
                           1
                         is in the same range than isogeometric computations with the proposed shell formulation using the continuous rotational concept and basis functions of order 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                        . The reference finite element formulations use efficient measures against locking effects, whereby for the isogeometric shell formulation no measures at all are taken against locking effects. This shows that the isogeometric shell formulation is seriously affected by locking effects. The number of iterations required in the nonlinear Newton–Raphson equilibrium iteration is given in Table 6
                         for an exemplary mesh. Quadratic convergence in the energy norm has been attained in all cases.

The non-uniform integration (NI∗) scheme is applied in Fig. 8(b). The hemispherical shell with hole requires the usage of the NI∗ scheme for non-uniform integration as in one parametric direction no boundary conditions are set. Thus, in the third knot span from either side one integration point is added. If the unaltered NI scheme is used, then the system response is slightly too soft and the deformation convergence behavior is deteriorated. However, the results of the NI and the NI∗ scheme converge to the same deformations. The deformations of all computations are slightly increased in comparison to full integration (FI). This improves accuracy for the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations, especially for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        . In contrast to that, the accuracy of computations with discrete rotations is deteriorated for all orders, even for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         and fine meshes (beginning from 30 elements per edge). The comparison to the reference finite element computations with linear Lagrange basis functions shows that locking is still present.

The number of integration points is reduced in order to save computational costs and to alleviate locking effects. The effect of using reduced integration (RI) and non-uniform integration (NI∗) on locking effects and accuracy of deformation results is displayed in Fig. 9, separately for the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations and for an isogeometric shell formulation with discrete rotations. Double logarithmic diagrams displaying the error of deformation are used to show the influence of the integration schemes in detail. Results of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation which uses the continuous rotational concept, are shown in Fig. 9(a). The use of reduced integration (RI) improves the accuracy of computations in comparison to full integration (FI) for all orders. The effect is more pronounced for even orders, especially for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        . This is due to the higher ratio between integration points of full integration (FI) to reduced integration (RI). The use of non-uniform integration (NI∗) entails a further significant gain in accuracy for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        , whereas the accuracy of computations with 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         is only improved for fine meshes. The peaks in the NI∗-graphs for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         (at 40 elements per edge) and 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         (at 100 elements per edge) are due to a change from underestimated deformations to overestimated deformations. Computations with 
                           p
                           ≥
                           4
                         slightly overestimate deformations and show some oscillatory behavior, see Fig. 8(b). This entails the peaks in the NI∗-graphs for 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           p

                           5
                         in Fig. 9(a) and prevents significantly improved deformation convergence behavior. The resulting accuracy is slightly better than for full integration (FI). Due to the reduced computational costs in comparison to FI and RI computations, non-uniform integration (NI∗) is nevertheless an attractive choice. The effect of the alleviation of locking effects on an isogeometric shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept is assessed in Fig. 9(b). The use of reduced integration (RI) for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         entails significant improvements of accuracy. In contrast to that, accuracy of computations with 
                           p
                           ≥
                           3
                         slightly deteriorates in comparison to full integration (FI). This is due to the fact that the alleviation of locking yielded by reduced integration (RI) leads to larger deformations, which is counterproductive as computations with the discrete rotational concept converge from above. The use of non-uniform integration (NI∗) yields similar results. The deformation convergence behavior of computations with 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                         is slightly deteriorated in comparison to full integration (FI). Computations with 
                           p
                           =
                           5
                         do not converge for all discretization and are thus not displayed. The accuracy of computations with 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         is initially improved by the reduction of integration points, but beginning from 30 elements per edge the deformation is overestimated and the deformation convergence behavior of 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         is akin to higher orders. These observations suggest that methods to alleviate locking effects are counterproductive if a discrete rotational concept is applied.

An important point in the comparison of rotational concepts and integration schemes is the efficiency of computations. Efficiency is defined by required computational costs to attain a pre-defined error level. All isogeometric formulations and the reference Lagrange-based finite shell elements are implemented into the finite element code FEAP. This allows a meaningful comparison of computational costs measured in CPU seconds. All computations are performed with one core of an Intel®  Core™ i7-3520M CPU in order to exclude scaling effects. The global system of equations is solved with the PARDISO solver from the Intel®  Math Kernel Library. An error level of 
                           ±
                           0.1
                           %
                         with respect to 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 r
                                 e
                                 f
                              
                           
                         is chosen for the diagrams in Fig. 10. The underlying numbers for these diagrams can be found in  [10]. The appropriate discretization for all combinations of rotational concept, integration scheme and order 
                           p
                         can be inferred from the double logarithmic diagrams in Fig. 9. The computational costs consisting of costs for the formation of the stiffness matrix and for the solution of the global system of equations summed up for all load steps are given in Fig. 10(a). In general, the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotation is more efficient than the shell formulation with discrete rotation, except for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         for full integration (FI). The combination of the continuous rotational concept and non-uniform integration (NI∗) yields the most efficient computations for 
                           2
                           ≤
                           p
                           ≤

                        . For 
                           p
                           =
                           6
                         reduced integration in combination with the continuous rotational concept is the most efficient choice. Here reduced integration (RI) is more effective than non-uniform integration (NI∗) as computations with reduced integration (RI) require less elements than computations with the non-uniform integration (NI∗) in order to obtain the pre-defined error level. This is due to the oscillations which are yielded by non-uniform integration (NI∗) and are more pronounced for rising orders. The computational costs of the combination continuous rotational concept and non-uniform integration (NI∗) for 
                           p
                           =
                           2

                        ) are in the same order of magnitude as for the reference finite element shell formulations (
                           15.57

                         for FE displacement and

                         for FE Hu–Washizu). Furthermore, the computational costs of the continuous rotational concept do not grow dramatically for orders 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                        . Computations using reduced integration (RI) are between two and three times more expensive as with non-uniform integration (NI∗) for 
                           2
                           ≤
                           p
                           ≤
                           4
                        . The results of isogeometric computations with the discrete rotational concept reveal a completely different picture. The computational costs for non-uniform integration (NI∗) in the case of 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         are higher than for reduced integration (RI). The discrete rotational concept yields higher computational costs than the continuous rotational concept for all discretizations if reduced integration (RI) or non-uniform integration (NI∗) is used. Furthermore, computational costs grow significantly for rising order  
                           p
                        . The required number of integration points to attain the pre-defined error level is given in Fig. 10(b). The proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotation requires significantly less integration points than the reference finite shell elements. In case of more complicated material laws or multi-scale formulations, which entail additional effort at the integration points (e.g.  [18,40,41]), the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations can thus be more effective than the reference finite shell elements.

This example clearly shows that the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations is superior to an isogeometric shell formulation with discrete rotations in terms of accuracy and robustness. The proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations shows correct convergence behavior and is competitive to standard finite element shell formulations, which is not the case for the discrete rotation formulation. The reduction of integration points lowers computational costs and increases accuracy as locking effects are reduced. Non-uniform integration (NI∗) works very well for this example as it reduces computational costs and increases accuracy for the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations. Here the combination of continuous rotations and non-uniform integration (NI∗) is recommended.

The roll-up of a cantilevered flat plate strip is a severe test for the handling of large rotations. An analytical solution exists for the simplified computation as a beam. This favors the consideration of this benchmark example throughout literature on finite rotation shell analysis, see e.g.  [23,42]. The system is sketched in Fig. 11
                        . The plate strip of length

                        , which is used for the normalization in Fig. 12
                        . The absolute value of rotation requires a multiplicative update of the rotational tensor 
                           
                              R
                           
                         due to the singularity of

                        . Thus, in this example also the isogeometric shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept is updated multiplicatively. The deformation convergence behavior is reported in Fig. 12 with the help of the endpoint rotation in point A.

Results for the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept are shown in Fig. 12(a). Computations using full integration (FI) converge strictly from below and accuracy increases with rising order 
                           p
                        . Computations are stable, even for coarse meshes. If non-uniform integration (NI∗) is used instead, then accuracy increases significantly, especially for even orders. This is due to the alleviation of locking effects, which is more pronounced for even orders due to the ratio of integration points from full integration (FI) to non-uniform integration (NI∗). However, strict convergence from below is not maintained as computations with higher order tend to converge from above. The results of the full integration (FI) computations deteriorate from one element to two elements; see the kinks in the full integration (FI) graphs. The reason for this deterioration is locking effects. Full integration (FI) yields the optimal number of 
                           p
                           +
                           1
                         integration points for the discretization with one element. But for two elements 
                           2
                           
                              (
                              p
                              +
                              1
                              )
                           
                         integration points are used, whereby the optimal number of integration points is 
                           p
                           +
                           2
                        , see  [13]. Thus, the influence of locking effects is more pronounced for two elements than for one element. This effect explains the kink in the full integration (FI) graphs for coarse meshes. The kink in the graph for non-uniform integration (NI∗) for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         is due to the fact, that the employed integration rule yields an integration point sequence of 
                           2
                           ∣

                           ∣
                           2
                         for four elements and 
                           2
                           ∣
                           2
                           ∣
                           1
                           ∣
                           1
                           ∣

                           1

                           2
                           ∣
                           2
                         for eight elements. Thus, locking effects are more efficiently reduced for four elements, which in turn yields numerical results which are more precise for four elements than for eight elements.

Results for an isogeometric shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept are provided in Fig. 12(b). The fully integrated results for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         are akin to the continuous rotation results. But all computations with higher orders converge from above and accuracy deteriorates with rising orders. Furthermore, computations of coarse meshes do not converge at all, even for smaller load steps. This formulation is quite unstable if the differences between interpolated and nodal director vectors are large. The application of non-uniform integration (NI∗) for this rotational concept is not beneficial at all in terms of accuracy. The alleviation of locking effects leads to convergence from above for all orders with a higher absolute error than for full integration (FI). This effect is clearly visible for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                        , where the convergence behavior changes completely. For higher orders the differences are hardly visible. In addition to the deterioration of accuracy, also robustness of computations is affected. Finer meshes are required to attain stable computations. Obviously the use of the discrete rotational concept leads to an overestimation of deformations. In contrast to that, locking yields an underestimation of deformations. If no measures against locking are taken, then these two errors partly cancel out. But in case locking is alleviated, as is done by using non-uniform integration (NI∗), the alleviation of locking can lead to a deterioration of accuracy.

The results of this example clearly show the necessity to use the more precise continuous rotational concept which is used in the proposed isogeometric shell formulation. Only if this kind of rotational concept is used, methods against locking are beneficial. Here, the use of the presented shell formulation with continuous rotations together with non-uniform integration (NI∗) is the most efficient combination.

The channel section beam is used to show the ability of the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations to compute thin-walled geometries with intersections. The geometry is a cantilevered beam modeled by three adjoined plane shell stripes. Geometrical and material data are chosen as proposed in  [33,38]. A point load 
                           F
                         is applied at the free end at the intersection of web and upper flange. The system is defined in Fig. 13
                        . The length of the beam is 
                           L
                           =
                           900
                        , with a wall thickness 
                           s
                           =
                           1.0
                         of the web and 
                           t
                           =
                           1.6
                         of the flanges. Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio are 
                           E
                           =
                           21000
                         and 
                           ν
                           =
                           0.3
                        , respectively. All degrees of freedom at the clamped end are fixed. The classification criterion proposed in  [9] automatically assigns three rotational degrees of freedom to control points at intersections and two rotational degrees of freedom to all other control points. The coarsest mesh is defined by 18×3 elements for the web and 18×1 elements for each flange. Mesh refinement is performed by equal subdivision of all elements in both parametric directions. The maximum available continuity is obtained as 
                           k
                        -refinement is used. Deformation convergence studies for the linear and the geometrically nonlinear case are given in Fig. 14
                        . Results are provided for orders 
                           p

                         in the linear case, and for 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         and

                           4
                         in the nonlinear case. The odd orders are not displayed for clarity, but the results for these orders are in between the results of the next higher and the next lower even order. In addition to the studies performed in this section, a comparison of the presented continuous rotational shell formulation to the continuous rotational shell formulation with more complicated interpolation and additive update of previous works  [8,9] is given in the Appendix.

                        -refinement and order elevation. Reference computations in LS-DYNA with the isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation presented in  [7] converge to the same reference value 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 z
                              
                              
                                 r
                                 e
                                 f
                              
                           
                        ; see  [10] for more details. The employed integration scheme noticeably influences the deformation results for this example. Reduced integration (RI) yields more accurate results than full integration (FI), which can be justified by the alleviation of locking effects. Non-uniform integration (NI∗) yields too soft behavior for this example. Deformations are overestimated, especially for coarse meshes, and the absolute errors of the deformation results are higher than for full integration (FI). This shows that the non-uniform integration scheme used in this work, which is an extended version of  [13], requires comprehensive numerical testing and theoretical studies in order to establish reliable rules for the distribution of integration points.

In the geometrically nonlinear case a load 
                           F
                           =
                           15
                         is applied in 30 uniform load steps. This yields large rotations, which allows a good comparison of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations to a shell formulation using the discrete rotational concept. Furthermore, the influence of integration rules is assessed. Deformation results are given in Fig. 14(b). All computations converge to the same value 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 z
                              
                              
                                 r
                                 e
                                 f
                              
                           
                           =
                           −
                           209.045
                        , which is used for the normalization. The deformation results for full integration (FI) are akin to prior examples. Computations with the continuous rotational concept converge from below, whereas computations with the discrete rotational concept converge from above for 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                        . The use of reduced integration (RI) increases the deformations for all displayed orders and rotational concepts due to a slight alleviation of locking effects. For 
                           p
                           =
                           2
                         this entails more precise results for both rotational concepts. In the case 
                           p
                           =
                           4
                        , the accuracy of computations with the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations is slightly improved, but deformations are overestimated for coarse meshes. In contrast to that, the accuracy of computations with the discrete rotational concept is clearly deteriorated by the use of reduced integration (RI) instead of full integration (FI).

This numerical example shows that the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations is required to obtain correct convergence behavior for higher orders. Furthermore, non-uniform integration (NI∗) does not yield accurate computations for this example. Thus, the use the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations with reduced integration (RI) is recommended.

The ability of the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations to compute arbitrarily curved geometries with kinks is compared to computation with discrete rotations with the help of this example. Two patches, which are smooth within, intersect at an angle which changes from 
                           90
                           °
                         to almost 
                           0
                           °
                         along the joint. Thus, the robustness of the shell formulations to handle geometries which contain kinks with small angles is tested. The details to construct this geometry are provided in  [9,10]. A system sketch is given in Fig. 15
                        . The system is loaded with a line load 
                           
                              
                                 p
                              
                              
                                 y
                              
                           
                           =
                           10
                         along the upper edge of patch 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . Both patches are fully clamped along the lower edge. All other edges are free. The number of rotational degrees of freedom for control points along the kink is automatically determined with the classification criterion proposed in  [9]. The intersection angle between two surfaces at a kink is computed for each node in order to distinguish between nodes on kinks and nodes in smooth regions. A limit intersection angle 
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 a
                                 n
                                 g
                                 l
                                 e
                              
                           
                           =
                           2
                           °
                         is used for this distinction where not mentioned differently. If the intersection angle falls below this threshold, the respective node is classified to be in a smooth region. Thus, in this region the kink is treated as if it would be a smooth transition. This value is higher than the smallest value of the angle along the kink. Thus, some control points along the kink are classified wrongly as smooth node for fine meshes. The influence of the limit intersection angle on geometrically nonlinear computations will be shown below. The wall thickness  
                           t
                        , Young’s modulus 
                           E
                         and Poisson’s ratio 
                           ν
                         are given in Fig. 15. The coarsest mesh displayed in Fig. 15 is equally subdivided in both parametric directions for 
                           h
                        -refinement studies. Order elevation is performed using 
                           k
                        -refinement. The subdivision factor, which is defined by the number of knot spans per initial knot span, is used as abscissa in Fig. 16
                        , whereby the deformation of point A in 
                           y
                        -direction is used as ordinate. The initial order of the basis functions is 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                        . Refinement studies are given for orders 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         to

                           =
                           5
                        . The provided graphs are for computations using full integration (FI). Graphs for reduced integration (RI) are almost not distinguishable by the eye from the full integration (FI) graphs. Thus, the reduced integration (RI) graphs are not displayed in Fig. 16 for the sake of clarity. The continuity between elements is not uniform in this example. Thus, non-uniform integration cannot be used here as it is only defined for uniform conformity; see Section  5.3. Deformation convergence studies for the linear and the geometrically nonlinear case are given in Fig. 16. Here only the influence of the rotational concept on the accuracy of computations is assessed. A comparison of the presented continuous rotational shell formulation to the continuous rotational shell formulation with more complicated interpolation and additive update of previous works  [8,9] is given in the Appendix.

A linear deformation convergence study is given in Fig. 16(a). The deformation results are normalized to the reference value

                         using the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations. Akin to prior examples, computations with the present shell formulation using the continuous rotational concept converge from below and show correct convergence behavior for rising orders 
                           p
                        . With the exemption of coarse meshes, computations with an isogeometric shell formulation with discrete rotations converge from above and accuracy is deteriorated with rising orders 
                           p
                        . Thus, divergence occurs for order elevation. These findings are in accordance with prior examples.

The deformation convergence behavior in the geometrically nonlinear case is studied in Fig. 16(b). The deformation results are normalized to the reference value

                           =
                           0.410789
                        , which is computed with 73 728 elements of order 
                           p
                           =

                         using the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations. This subdivision factor in combination with 
                           p
                           =
                           5
                         exceeded available memory. The deformation convergence behavior in the geometrically nonlinear case shown in Fig. 16(b) is described as follows. As in the linear case, the deformation converge behavior of the proposed shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept is clearly superior to the shell formulation with discrete rotations. In this example, convergence from above can be observed also for the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations, but the correct convergence behavior for rising order 
                           p
                         is maintained. All computations are stable and show good convergence behavior in the Newton–Raphson equilibrium iteration. In each case eleven iterations are sufficient. The right column of Table 7
                         suggests that the choice of 
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 a
                                 n
                                 g
                                 l
                                 e
                              
                           
                         has only minor influence on the deformation results of computations using the continuous concept. Numerical stability is not affected at all, even for very small values of 
                           
                              
                                 c

                        . The situation is completely different for computations with an isogeometric shell formulation which uses the discrete rotational concept. There the graphs of all orders converge from above, and the accuracy of the deformation results deteriorates with rising order. Computations of order 
                           p
                           =
                           3
                         are stable and the results yielded by an additive and a multiplicative update of the rotational state are equivalent up to numerical precision. In all cases eleven iterations in the Newton–Raphson iteration are sufficient, and

                        . An explanation of this difference in sensitivity to kinks with small angles is given in the following. Stiffness against drilling rotations around the director vector arises only due to the intersection of the patches at kinks for the discrete rotational concept. If the intersection angle is very small, almost no stiffness arises. This entails a bad condition of the stiffness matrix, which can deteriorate accuracy or impede convergence in the equilibrium iteration; see  [10] for a study on this. If the continuous rotational formulation of this work is used, then stiffness against drilling rotations also arises due to the curvature of elements which adjoin the kink.

This example shows the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations in comparison to a shell formulation with discrete rotational concept. Here, reduced integration (RI) is the most efficient choice as its accuracy is akin to computations using full integration (FI), but the computational costs are lower. Non-uniform integration cannot be used in this example due to the non-uniform continuity between elements. Thus, in this example the combination of continuous rotations and reduced integration (RI) is recommended.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

An efficient and robust isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell formulation has been presented. The proposed continuous rotational concept ensures convergence for rising order of the NURBS basis functions and increases accuracy significantly in comparison to standard discrete rotational concepts. This is the main contribution of this work and the key to efficiency and robustness. Three numerical integration schemes have been presented and compared. If an efficient numerical integration scheme is employed, then the presented isogeometric shell formulation can be competitive to standard Lagrange-based isogeometric shell formulations in terms of computational costs to attain a pre-defined error level. The use of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept in combination with reduced integration (RI) is recommended as the most efficient and robust choice for all considered numerical examples. The detailed findings of this work are: 
                        
                           •
                           The computational costs to attain a pre-defined error level are significantly lower for the presented isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations than for an isogeometric shell formulation with the discrete rotational concept. This is due to the higher accuracy which is obtained by the presented isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations. The computational costs for a given discretization entailed by the presented isogeometric shell formulation are only slightly higher compared to an isogeometric shell formulation with the standard discrete rotational concept.

The large gain in accuracy and stability of the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept compared to an isogeometric shell formulation with the standard discrete rotational concept justifies the slightly higher computational costs per element in all cases. The differences between both rotational concepts increase with rising order of the basis functions, with rising curvature of the geometry and with the absolute value of the rotations.

The reduction of the number of integration points reduces computational costs significantly and at the same time counteracts locking effects. The use of reduced integration as proposed in  [28] always improves accuracy of the proposed shell formulation with continuous rotations. The presented non-uniform integration scheme reduces computational costs dramatically and alleviates locking in most cases. But in some cases the deformation response is too soft. Thus, this integration rule requires more detailed research and evaluation. Within this work, non-uniform integration is mainly used to show the behavior of the shell formulation in case methods against locking effects are considered. The lack of reliability and the limitation to knot vectors with uniform continuity between elements precludes the use of non-uniform integration in industrial applications. The use of reduced integration (RI) is recommended in all cases.

The alleviation of locking effects is only beneficial if the proposed continuous rotational concept is used. This effect is explained as follows. The alleviation of locking increases deformations. If convergence from below occurs, accuracy increases. But if convergence from above occurs, accuracy is deteriorated as deformations are further overestimated. Convergence from below is in general only observed if the proposed continuous rotational concept is used. However, in some cases also this rotational concept yields a slight overestimation of deformations.

The efficiency of the proposed isogeometric shell formulation with continuous rotations is competitive to standard Lagrange-based shell finite element formulations. This requires an integration scheme with minimal number of integration points. The non-uniform integration scheme used in this work yields competitiveness in terms of computational costs for a pre-defined error level in most cases, but lacks reliability. Further research is required to find a reliable integration scheme which at the same time requires a minimal number of integration points. In terms of total number of integration points, competitiveness to standard Lagrange-based shell finite element formulations is already achieved by using reduced integration for the proposed shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept.

This appendix is intended to point out the differences between the shell formulation with continuous rotational formulation with multiplicative update, which is presented in this work, and the continuous rotational formulation with more complicated interpolation and additive update presented in previous works  [8,9]. The most important points of a detailed comparison of both concepts given in  [10] are provided in the following.

                         is continuous which significantly simplifies the computation of the derivatives

                        . The second difference is the choice of the update formulation for the rotations. In previous works  [8,9] an additive update formulation is chosen, whereas in this work a multiplicative update is chosen. The combination of continuous rotational formulation and additive rotational update was shown to produce a problematic path dependency; see  [10] and the numerical results in Appendix A.2. Thus, in this work a multiplicative update formulation is chosen, which also entails a more simple variation of the Rodrigues’ tensor 
                           
                              R
                           
                        . The two described differences sum up to a variation of the current director vector 
                           δ

                        , which is significantly simpler for the formulation of this work compared to previous works. In this work only

The rotational formulation of this work is compared to previous works  [8,9] with the help of the channel section beam and the free form surface with arbitrary curvature and kink, which are defined above.

Results for the channel section beam are given in Fig. A.1(a)
                        . The computations with the continuous rotational formulation of this work and the shell formulation with discrete rotations converge to the same value

Results for the free form surface with arbitrary curvature and kink are given in Fig. A.1(b). Graphs for computations using one and two load steps are plotted for the presented shell formulation with the continuous rotational concept, for a shell formulation with discrete rotations and for the continuous shell formulation of previous works  [8,9]. The computations with the shell formulation presented in this work with one and two load steps correspond very well to each other. The same holds for the isogeometric shell formulation with discrete rotations. The results for the shell formulation with continuous rotations and additive update of previous works  [8,9] reveal a completely different behavior. They show a strong path dependency. If only one load step is used, the shell formulation of previous works converges to a slightly smaller deformation value for mesh refinement. If more load steps are used, then also this shell formulation converges to the correct deformation value. This behavior is exemplified for a refinement factor of 16 and order

                        . The results of the shell formulation of previous works  [8,9] differs by 0.66% between computations using one load step and computations using 16 load steps. This strong path dependency disqualifies the shell formulation of previous works for the use in nonlinear computations. If 16 load steps are used, then the results correspond very well to the deformation results of the continuous shell formulation of this work. The results of the shell formulation of this work differ only by

                         between computations using one load step and computations using 16 load step. Thus, the path dependency is reduced to an amount which is negligible.

The difference between the continuous rotational formulation and the continuous rotational shell formulation of previous works  [8,9] has been shown with the help of two numerical examples. The formulation presented in this work is clearly superior to the formulation of previous works. The proposed formulation is more simple and exhibits almost no path dependency. The converged deformation results are in good accordance with the more commonly used discrete rotational formulation. All these points do not hold for the formulation of previous works.
