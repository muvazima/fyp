                  We consider a stochastic knapsack problem in which the event of overflow results in the problem ending with zero return. We assume that there are n types of items available where each type has infinite supply. An item has an exponentially distributed random weight with a known mean depending on its type and the item’s value is proportional to its weight with a given factor depending on the item’s type. We have to make a decision on each stage whether to stop, or continue to put an item of a selected type in the knapsack. An item’s weight is learned when placed to the knapsack. The objective of this problem is to find a policy that maximizes the expected total values. Using the framework of dynamic programming, the optimal policy is found when 
                        
                           n

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the classic knapsack problem, given a set of items whose values and weights are deterministic, the objective is to find a subset of items to put in the knapsack in order to maximize the total values without incurring overflow. The knapsack problem and its variants have many applications in such areas as transportation scheduling, projects selection, resource allocation/management, and others.

This paper considers the zero return if broken (ZRB) knapsack problem. In ZRB knapsack problem, an item’s weight is unknown before being put in but follows a known distribution; its value per unit weight is given and determined by the item’s type. It’s assumed that once the knapsack is broken from breaching the capacity constraint, all the existing items in the knapsack are wiped out without any salvage value, i.e., no additional items can be inserted into the now empty knapsack and we stop there. The ZRB knapsack problem is an adaptive stochastic knapsack problem, for which a policy is defined as a schedule to put in items sequentially which adapts to the information feedback on the updated system state. The objective is to find a policy which maximizes the expected total return.

The ZRB knapsack problem can be applied in the situations where breaking knapsack triggers the wipeout effect, e.g., over-utilization of the credit line freezes account actions; medicine over-dosing negates the desired function, etc. Another application is in space exploration where loading over the capacity limit of a space craft leads to total lost of all on-board cargos. The ZRB knapsack problem is also important as its optimal expected return provides a lower bound on the optimal expected return in any adaptive knapsack problem which yields the same return as in our model when stopping occurs before the knapsack reaches capacity but where the return when the knapsack’s capacity is exceeded is any arbitrary nonnegative function of the sequence of types and values of the items in the knapsack.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The 0–1 knapsack problem (see Kellerer, Pferschy, & Pisinger (2004)) is one of NP-hard problems including traveling salesman problems, integer programming, etc. Martello, Pisinger, and Toth (2000) give a comprehensive review with further discussions on techniques commonly used in solving the knapsack problem. A stochastic knapsack problem (SKP) differs from the classic model by allowing randomness in the candidate items’ weights or values (or both). According to how we assign items to the knapsack, there exist two categories of SKP: static and adaptive.

In a static SKP, the only decision made is to choose a subset of items that are simultaneously put in the knapsack. Kosuch and Lisser (2010, 2011) discuss a static SKP which assumes that a cost proportional to the overflow (that is, the amount by which the sum of the weights of the items put into the knapsack exceed its capacity) is incurred whenever the knapsack’s capacity is exceeded, as well as one with a constraint on the probability of exceeding the capacity. They propose methods for locating upper and lower bounds to complement the branch and bound search. Under the assumption of normal distributions on items weights, Cohn and Mit (1998) explore dominance rules among candidate items and illustrate a search algorithm based on this. Merzifonluoğlu, Geunes, and Romeijn (2012) extend the discussion to include a penalty cost for capacity overflow and a salvage value for unused capacity. With results from the study of a continuous relaxation of the problem, Merzifonluoglu et al. develop a customized branch and bound search for the optimal decision and a high-quality heuristic policy. Lee and Oh (1997) discuss the asymptotic property when the knapsack capacity increases, and they use the asymptotic value-to-capacity ratio to approximate the optimal solution for a large knapsack capacity.

In an adaptive SKP, the decision maker has the option to select an available item or to stop on each stage while taking into account the latest knapsack state information from the system feedback. Some adaptive SKP papers have avoided the possibility of a broken knapsack by assuming deterministic item weights; others have included penalty terms to account for any overcapacity amount; and others have imposed a chance constraint on the overflow probability. In a SKP that assumes random values but deterministic weights, Iravani, Ilhan, and Daskin (2011) discussed the adaptive target achievement problem where the objective is to maximize the probability of achieving a target total value. They give a heuristic policy with limited look-ahead capabilities and show that it performs well. Lu, Chiu, and Cox (1999) consider the project selection problem with a deadline where projects with unknown value but deterministic resource requirements arrive to the system one by one according to a stochastic process. They give a simple form of the optimal project acceptance rule, although it’s usually computationally expensive to lay out the decision map. Lin, Lu, and Yao (2008) discuss a similar problem in revenue management, where offers with stochastic price and quantity information arrive at each tim e point, and the decision is whether to accept or decline the offer. They propose a class of switch-over policies and find the optimal one in the class which has asymptotic optimality as the problem size scales up. And they also apply the result in the dynamic/flexible pricing model. Van Slyke and Young (2000) study the finite horizon SKP and its applications in yield management. In SKP with random weights, Schilling (1994) gives results on the asymptotic optimal values. Ross and Tsang (1989) formulate the network admission problem in SKP and present an optimal static control by dynamic programming. Derman, Lieberman, and Ross (1978) consider a renewal decision problem that is equivalent to an adaptive SKP where the value of an item depends only on its type rather than being proportional to its weight, and where the problem continues until the knapsack is broken at which point a final return equal to the sum of the values of al l but the final item put in the knapsack is earned. Dean, Goemans, and Vondrdk (2004) study the benefit of adaptivity in the SKP with random weights where they assume the final overflowing item contributes no value. They bound the adaptivity gap, which measures the ratio of the optimal adaptive policy value to the optimal static policy value, to a factor of four; and they also devise a polynomial-time adaptive policy that approximates the optimal policy with a factor of

                        Kleywegt and Papastavrou (1998, 2001) define a class of very comprehensive SKP, the dynamic stochastic knapsack problems (DSKP). It assumes items with unknown values and weights arrive to the system stochastically. The item’s value and weight are revealed upon its arrival and the decision to accept or to reject has to be made. Penalty incurred by rejection, holding cost, salvage value of items, etc. are all incorporated in the DSKP. The structural results on the optimal policy for DSKP are given in the two papers.

In Section 2, the ZRB knapsack problem is defined and formulated mathematically under the dynamic programming framework. Preliminary notations are given in this part before proceed to explore the characteristics of the model structure. We show a type preference order and demonstrate the optimal stopping rule in the latter part of the section. In Section 3, we discuss the problem when 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                         and propose an optimal policy in this case. The general ideas behind the optimality proof are given alongside supporting propositions which lead to the core theorem in this section. We also summarize into an easy-to-implement action selection strategy from the optimal policy for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . In Section 4, we try to generalize the optimal policy for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                         to a policy that’s applicable for any n using the same logic. We evaluate the generalized policy and analyze its limitations. A second heuristic policy for general n is then given and tested in a numerical example. We conclude the paper with a brief introduction of our ongoing work in Section 5.

                        . We put the proofs which involve mainly algebraic manipulations in the Appendix A.

                      is the mean weight. It is assumed that an item’s weight is independent with the weights of other items both within the same type and between types. At each stage, we can either choose to stop and leave the system with all the existing values in the knapsack, or, we can choose to select an item of any type to put to the knapsack. An item’s weight is immediately revealed after its being put to the knapsack. If the knapsack is broken, because total weights of items in the knapsack exceed the capacity, we are forced out of the system with no return at all. Otherwise, we move to the next stage. We call the model defined above as the zero return if broken (ZRB) knapsack problem. The objective of the ZRB knapsack problem is to find a policy that achieves the maximal expected return.

The ZRB knapsack problem can be formulated in a dynamic programming framework. Let 
                           
                              (

The idea of the proof comes from Smith (1978). We construct a composite component which consists of N type j items, where N is a geometric distributed random variable with parameter

                              , it is always better to replace type i item with this composite component because the composite item has higher unit weight value than type i item does, and at the same time the weight of the composite component has exactly the same distribution as that of type i item.□

A natural question for this dynamic programming model is to determine the optimal stopping time. In analogy to one-stage look-ahead rule for optimal stopping problems, the candidate stopping rule for the ZRB knapsack problem is: if it’s better to stop now than insert one more item of any type and then stop, then just stop. We call this stopping rule the one-stage look-ahead rule for the ZRB knapsack problem. According to this rule, we should stop at state

From the previous discussions, one option to consider in the general model is to generalize the idea behind Policy Two to develop a policy for the model of any n. We’ll present the generalized policy for any n in this section. This policy’s limitation in implementation will be discussed. We also give a second heuristic policy and a numerical example is given to partially evaluate the performance of these heuristic policies.

In the following, Policy n is a generalized version of Policy Two for any n. As the starting point, Policy 1 is defined with Policy One. In the following policy statement, for any

                           The above definition is not a direct generalization from the same idea behind Policy Two because we cannot prove the analog of Lemma 2 for the case of general n. However, this version is much simpler to implement compared to the generalized policy in original form which does the comparison on each stage. We will show in the following discussion that even this simpler version of generalized policy requires unacceptable amount of computational power for big n.

From the policy definition, Policy Two is obvious an instance of the policy when 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . We proved the optimality of Policy Two by showing its value function

                        . Therefore, on the one hand, we cannot use the same technique to check whether Policy n is optimal or not for general n; on the other hand, if we want to implement this policy for 
                           
                              n

                              3
                           
                        , because the value function involved has no analytical form, the value function has to be simulated at each decision making point. This becomes a severe bottleneck as the problem size scales up. The running time of the implementation of Policy n rises exponentially as n increases.

We introduce a second heuristic policy based on the two statements: (a) at state 
                           
                              (

                        , only the types whose critical curves are above the state point should be considered, which are called feasible types for state

                        ; (b) if there are multiple feasible candidate types after considering (a), it’s better to select the one with higher unit value per weight. The first statement has already been proved in Proposition 2. Statement (b) is not generally true since we can find explicit counter examples in Optimal Action Theorem for 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                        . However, when the state 
                           
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              v
                              )
                           
                         is not close to those critical curves of feasible types, choosing the one with the highest unit value per weight could be a good choice. The logic behind it is the intuition that if capacity allows, we’d rather put in higher value items. We’ll show in a numerical example that this heuristic policy has the potential to perform well for our problem.

The heuristic policy is developed from ideas in statements (a) and (b). At any non-stopping state 
                           
                              (
                              r
                              ,
                              v
                              )
                           
                        , the heuristic policy selects the type which has the highest unit value per weight among all the feasible candidate types determined by statement (a). The policy is implemented as follows:

How to evaluate the heuristic policy when we do not know the optimal policy for the ZRB knapsack problem of 
                           
                              n
                              ⩾
                              3
                           
                        ? Our work-around is to consider the discretized version of the ZRB knapsack problem. By discretization, we assume items’ weights conform to the discrete geometric distributions instead of the continuous exponential distributions, and all other problem settings are unchanged. Dynamic programming enables us to find the optimal value function at any state in the discretized model. Our implicit assumption in this part is:


                        If one policy works well for the discretized model, it can also do well for the original model.
                     

We give a numerical example here on the discretized model for

From this example, we see the second heuristic policy has good performance compared to the optimal one in this discretized model. This gives us confidence that this heuristic works for the original adaptive BKP model as well. Another observation from this example is: 
                           
                              Policy

                        , for general n, is a sub-optimal policy for the original model, although it’s optimal when 
                           
                              n

This paper considers an adaptive SKP, the ZRB knapsack problem. In this model, there are n types of items available and each type has infinite supply; an item has an exponentially distributed weight and its value is proportional to its weight with a deterministic factor. One has to select a type of item to put to the knapsack or choose to stop on each stage. The objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected total return. In this paper, the model was formulated in the framework of dynamic programming. We proved items’ preference order and showed the one-stage look-ahead rule is always the optimal stopping rule for the ZRB knapsack problem in our model. An in-depth analysis was given for the model when there are two types of items available. We presented and proved an optimal policy for 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           2
                        
                     . For general n, we discussed the generalized policy derived from the optimal policy of 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           2
                        
                     . A second heuristic policy was presented and the performance of the two heuristics were evaluated on a numerical example of 
                        
                           n
                           =
                           3
                        
                     .

In Chen and Ross (2013a), we extend the ZRB knapsack problem to include exponential capacity. Under certain cases on the assumption of the joint distribution function of an item’s weight and value, we can either find optimal policies or transform the model to an equivalent static SKP model. In Chen and Ross (2013b), we consider two static SKP models, the static ZRB knapsack problem and the SKP with simple recourse and penalty cost. Both models try to maximize the expected total returns although with different objective functions. We show that given certain constraints on the distributions of items’ random weights, the expected return functions in the two models both have a unimodality property which can be used in the search for optimal policies.
