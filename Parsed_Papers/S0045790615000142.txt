                  This paper investigates an optimal adaptive rate and power transmission algorithms for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) – based Cognitive Radio (CR) systems. The aim was to study the problem of maximizing the overall rate achieved by the Secondary User (SU), while keeping the interference powers introduced by the SU on the spectrum band of Primary User’s (PU) below the specified thresholds and considering the total transmit power budget constraints. In addition, the novel suboptimal power allocation algorithm was proposed and consequently the maximum modulation level according to allocated power based on maximizing the overall achievable rate was obtained. The performance of the proposed suboptimal algorithm is compared with the optimal and existing algorithms including uniform loading and water filling algorithms. Numerical results revealed that the proposed suboptimal algorithm had a better performance than the uniform loading and water filling algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the rapid growth of wireless technology and increase in the number of wireless users, the frequency spectrum is becoming a more and more rare resource [1]. The Federal Communication Commission spectrum policy task force has reported that the traditional frequency band allocation to users may be inefficient, because the demands of frequency band highly vary along space or time domains [2]. CR has been proposed as a novel technology to enhance spectral efficiency by exploiting frequency holes in dynamically varying environments [3,4].

Adaptive resource allocation is a powerful technique to improve the performance and spectrum efficiency in a CR [5]. Using adaptive resource allocation, a CR can change its transmission power and modulation level based on spectrum bands of PUs and fading channel variations to maximize the achievable capacity of SU [6]. Due to the coexistence of the PU and SU in adjacent spectrums, Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) is introduced in both PU and SU transceivers and thus decreasing their performances. Therefore, the transmission power of Secondary User Transmitter (SUT) must be less than the power budget. Also, the amount of interference introduced by a SUT on a Primary User Receiver (PUR) must be less than an interference power threshold [7].

Considering the high advantage of dynamically allocation of frequency holes, OFDM is a proper modulation scheme for the SUs [3,4]. In order to improve the system performance in OFDM-based Cognitive Radio systems, modulation level and power needs to be adaptively assigned to each subcarrier according to its subcarrier state variation [8]. More powers and bits per symbol must be allocated to the subcarrier with higher channel fading gain, and less powers and bits per symbol to noisy subcarrier [9]. Adaptive modulation and bit loading are efficient techniques for reliable transmission [10]. The concept of adaptive modulation is to match the modulation type and modulation level to channel state variation [11]. The basic idea behind adaptive modulation is to guarantee that the most effective mode is always used over channel state variation [12]. Adaptive power allocation scheme changes the allocated power to fading channel states while satisfying the Bit Error Rate (BER) requirement [11].

The current study investigates the Multi-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) adaptive modulation and power allocation in an OFDM-based CR system to maximize the overall transmission rate of the SU. From the study conducted in [13], if perfect channel state information is available in SUT, a superior power allocation policy can be designed for SU so that to improve the performance of a CR system. Therefore, it is assumed perfect channel state information is available in SUT and the SUT is aware of instantaneous channel power gain between SUT and Secondary User Receiver (SUR) and channel power gain between SUT and PUR. Similar to [14], it is also assumed that different PURs can impose different interference threshold constraints to the CR system. Additionally, the study was expanded on the behavior of uniform loading and water filling algorithms. Due to complexity of optimal algorithm and low efficiency of uniform loading and water filling algorithms, a novel suboptimal power loading algorithm is suggested; thus the calculation of the maximum modulation level can be allocated to each subcarrier according to the allocated power. In the proposed suboptimal algorithm, the allocated power and modulation level of SU at each subcarrier are obtained adaptively based on several factors including; channel path gain between SUT and SUR, channel path gains between SUT and PURs, interference threshold, spectral distance between ℓth bands of PU and ith subcarrier of SU and noise variance and interference introduced by PUs on subcarrier of SU. Finally, the proposed suboptimal algorithm is compared to the optimal, uniform loading and water filling algorithms. Simulation results indicated that the proposed algorithm had a better performance than conventional power loading algorithms for the OFDM-based system including water filling and uniform loading. Also, it is found that the complexity of the proposed suboptimal algorithm is less than the optimal algorithm.

Subsequently the current study proceeds further as follows: Section 2 presents related works and Section 3 presents the system model, while Section 4 describes the problem formulation. In Section 5, a suboptimal algorithm system is suggested and Section 6 describes two conventional power allocation algorithms in OFDM-based systems, including uniform loading and water filling. Numerical results are presented in Section 7 and the paper is concluded in Section 8.

Due to complexity of optimal solution, it is difficult or rather impossible to use the optimal method in practice. Furthermore, due to low efficiency of conventional methods of allocated power in OFDM systems such as uniform loading and water filling algorithms, these methods may not be suitable for use in OFDM- based CR systems. In [2] authors introduced a method to calculate the allocated power to subcarriers if both the SU and PU use the same OFDM system. In some scenario, a CR user and L PUs co-existed in side-by-side bands. In this context, power can be allocated to each subcarrier of SU according to suboptimal algorithms that introduced in [3] when only all PUs has same interference threshold constraint. In [4] authors employed an iterative algorithm to obtain the suboptimal power allocation. In [14] authors assumed that all subcarriers of SU produce equal interference on PU bands and then introduced a suboptimal power loading algorithm to maximize the total transmission rate of SU, while interference constraint guaranteed in statistical manner. In this suboptimal algorithm, allocated power to each subcarrier is related to the spectral distance between subcarriers of SU and ℓth PU’s band and channel power gain between SUT and PUR. Researches on this algorithm ignored the channel fading gain between the SUT and SUR on ith subcarrier and the effect of the noise and interference that produced on the subcarriers of SU. Also, the assumption of equal interference that produces by all subcarriers on PU band may be unrealistic.

It is assumed that the spectrum has already been allocated and that a SU coexists with L PUs in adjacent spectrums as illustrated in Fig. 1
                      (similar to system model is used in [3,4,14]). The bandwidth of the SU is divided into N flat independent subcarriers each having a bandwidth of Δf, which is less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. The L PUs are supposed to be inhabiting spectrums of bandwidth B

                     . The SU employs adaptive M-QAM modulation scheme. It is also presumed that the transmission signals in the subcarriers of the SU are an ideal Nyquist pulse.

Adaptive modulation and power transmission can adjust the transmission power and rate for SU systems and improve the spectrum efficiency. Since the allocated power to SUT should not decrease the Quality of Service (QOS) of the PU, a constraint was considered on the interference power introduced by SUT at the PUR. Also, in practice, the transmission power of SU needs to be restricted according to the operating range of powers. Therefore, it is considered the problem of maximizing the overall transmission rate, C, achievable by the SU, while keeping the interference powers produced by the SU on PU bands below the specific interference threshold, Ith
                     , and the total transmit power less than the power budget. The optimization problem is:

Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (3), the maximum adaptive M-QAM constellation size can be obtained. Several methods such as Newton’s method can be employed to calculate the Lagrange parameters [17], but solving for whole Lagrange parameters may be very complex. Due to the high complexity of the optimal power and bit loading algorithm, in the next section, a novel low complex suboptimal power allocation algorithm is proposed and then the maximum modulation level is calculated according to allocated power. The optimal transmission rate for proposed system can be obtained as:

The power has to be allocated to the SU’s subcarriers so that to maximize the SU’s total transmission rate, while satisfying all the L
                     +1 constraints specified in Eqs. (8) and (9). In the optimal algorithm, all the L
                     +1 constraint was considered simultaneously, while in the proposed suboptimal algorithm only one constraint is kept and the transmission power in each subcarrier is determined.

In the proposed suboptimal algorithm, the power allocated to each subcarrier is proportional to the channel power gain between the SUT and SUR and to the inverse of (Ki
                        ℓ
                     
                     ×
                        Ni
                     ). The value of Ki
                        ℓ
                      is related to the spectral distance between the ℓth PU band and subcarriers of the SU and channel power gain between the SUT and PUR and symbol duration. Based on Eq. (11), the amount of interference introduce by SU on PU’s band is proportional to Ki
                        ℓ
                     . More power must be allocated to the subcarrier that introduce less interference on the PU’s band and less power must be allocated to the subcarriers that introduce more interference on PU’s band; therefore the allocated power to each subcarrier is reverse of Ki
                        ℓ
                      with respect to interference threshold constraint of ℓth PU. Ni
                      depends on noise variance and interference introduced by PUs on subcarrier of SU. Also, more power must be allocated to the subcarrier with less noise and interference and vice versa. In addition, more power must be allocated to subcarriers with higher channel power gains and less power must be assigned to subcarriers with lower channel power gains. Therefore, the ℓth interference constraint is considered in Eq. (8) to formulate the transmission power in the ith subcarrier according to the proposed suboptimal power loading algorithm as:

                     Substituting the power from Eq. (21) into Eq. (5) and then into Eqs. (6) and (3), the maximum transmission rate for the SU and the maximum adaptive M-QAM constellation size can be obtained.

In this algorithm, equal power is allotted in each subcarrier so that all constraints can be satisfied. Solving Eq. (8) to fulfill the strict equality on the ℓth interference constraint, the transmission power of the uniform loading algorithm to satisfy the ℓth interference constraint in the Eq. (8) can be obtained from [14]:

In this section, a numerical example is presented for the proposed system to compare the proposed suboptimal algorithm with optimal, uniform loading and water filling algorithms.

                     W. The channel path gains are modeled by Rayleigh distribution. The average channel power gains for |gi

                     2 are −5dB, −10dB and −7dB, respectively. The values of Ji
                        ℓ
                      are random value with an average 1×10−6
                     W and the target BER is assumed to be 1×10−3. The average transmission rates and powers for all algorithms under consideration are achieved from 100,000 independent simulation iteration runs.

The overall rate corresponding to different algorithms are depicted in Fig. 3
                     . From the figure, it is assumed that the values of Ith
                     
                     1, Ith
                     
                     2 and Pbudget

                     W, respectively. It can be seen that the optimal algorithm reveals the best performance. Also, the proposed suboptimal algorithm showed a better performance than water filling algorithm with uniform loading displaying the lowest performance.

Plots of transmission rate in bits/s vs. total transmission power budget in watt are shown in Fig. 4
                     . The values of Ith
                     
                     1 and Ith
                     
                     2 are assumed to be 2×10−6 and 5×10−6
                     W, respectively. It can be observed that the optimal power loading algorithm showed the best performance and the proposed suboptimal algorithm had a superior performance than conventional power loading algorithms especially in high power budget value. The water filling algorithm revealed a better performance than uniform loading algorithm. Also, Fig. 5
                      shows plots of the transmission rate in bits/s vs. the interference threshold in watt for both PU. It is assumed in the figure that both PU have the same interference constraint i.e. Ith

                     2. The value of power budget is assumed to be 5×10−4
                     W. It can be clearly observed that the optimal algorithm displays the best performance, while the proposed suboptimal algorithm exhibited a better performance than uniform loading and water filling algorithms especially in low interference threshold. The uniform loading algorithm also showed the lowest performance.


                     Fig. 6
                      shows plots of the transmission rate in bits/s vs. the target BER, where the SU employs the M-QAM modulation scheme to data transmission. In the figure it is assumed that the Pbudget
                     , Ith
                     
                     1 and Ith
                     
                     2 are 3×10−4, 7×10−6 and 4×10−6, respectively. It was observed that the transmission rate increases with increase in bit error rate. Also, it was noticed that the proposed suboptimal algorithm displays a better performance than uniform loading and water filling algorithms. The optimal algorithm showed the best performance and uniform loading revealed the least performance.


                     Table 1
                      provides the complexity of the optimal, water filling, uniform loading and the proposed suboptimal algorithms. The complexity of the optimal adaptive modulation and power allocation algorithm is higher than other algorithms due to the consideration of all constraint simultaneously. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is comparable to water filling algorithm and higher than uniform loading algorithm.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A novel suboptimal power loading algorithm was proposed and formulated by analyzing an optimal adaptive rate and power loading algorithm for an OFDM-based Cognitive Radio system. Results of the allocated power obtained from different algorithms were used by Eq. (3) to calculate the maximum modulation level. Simulation results indicated that the maximum achievable total transmission rate of the suboptimal algorithm was greater than water filling and uniform loading algorithms. The optimal algorithm performed an uppermost complexity while uniform loading exhibited an undermost complexity. The water filling algorithm showed a comparable complexity to the proposed algorithm, while the proposed algorithm is more efficient than water filling and uniform loading algorithms specially in low interference threshold or high power budget due to the fact that in these states the proposed algorithm can be allocated more power to each subcarrier while satisfy the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9).
