                  In this paper we study the economic lot sizing problem with cost discounts. In the economic lot sizing problem a facility faces known demands over a discrete finite horizon. At each period, the ordering cost function and the holding cost function are given and they can be different from period to period. There are no constraints on the quantity ordered in each period and backlogging is not allowed. The objective is to decide when and how much to order so as to minimize the total ordering and holding costs over the finite horizon without any shortages. We study two different cost discount functions. The modified all-unit discount cost function alternates increasing and flat sections, starting with a flat section that indicates a minimum charge for small quantities. While in general the economic lot sizing problem with modified all-unit discount cost function is known to be NP-hard, we assume that the cost functions do not vary from period to period and identify a polynomial case. Then we study the incremental discount cost function which is an increasing piecewise linear function with no flat sections. The efficiency of the solution algorithms follows from properties of the optimal solution. We computationally test the polynomial algorithms against the use of CPLEX.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

While the distribution of goods is usually driven by customer demand and is focused on service quality, the procurement of goods is a typically cost-driven phase (see Simchi-Levi, Kaminsky, & Simchi-Levi, 2007) in supply chain management. The procurement costs are mostly dependent on the cost of goods and on the transportation costs. One of the most frequently used transportation modes, especially when the shipment size is relatively small and the distance to be traveled is not too large, is less-than-truckload (LTL), where different shipments are consolidated in the same truck that delivers the goods to different customers. The assumption that the transportation cost charged by a carrier linearly depends on the shipped quantity usually makes the decision-making models simple and efficiently solvable. However, while this may be a reasonable assumption in a tactical planning phase, where the detailed cost structure is not essential, the linearity assumption is too simplistic in an operational phase. In fact, the tariffs applied by the carriers have a more complex structure. In LTL service, carriers encourage large shipments through non-linear cost structures. In most cases the tariffs have a piecewise linear structure. This is the case also in parcel rates and full-truck-load services (see Lapierre, Ruiz, & Soriano, 2004).

A company that optimizes its procurement phase has to take into account the procurement costs, that is the ordering costs and the inventory holding costs. Given the demand pattern, both kinds of costs are influenced by the ordering pattern. The classical model for the optimization of the procurement phase is the well known single-item economic lot sizing problem (ELS problem). A company has to satisfy a known demand over a discrete finite horizon. In each period the unit ordering and holding costs are known. Backlogging is not allowed and there is no constraint on the quantity ordered in each period. The problem consists in deciding when and how much to order in each period so that the total cost is minimized, where the total cost is the sum of the ordering cost and of the inventory holding cost (or simply inventory cost), both computed over the time horizon. The model, that is efficiently solvable, has been introduced by Wagner and Whitin (1958) and has attracted an enormous amount of research. The importance of the ELS problem in theory and practice has been widely recognized and the model appears in several textbooks on operations management (see, for example, Muckstadt & Sapra, 2009; Nahmias, 2001). The original paper has been recently reprinted in Management Science in Wagner and Whitin (2004) to evidence its relevance and impact on theory and practice. With respect to the basic Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model due to Whitin (1957), in the ELS a multi-period problem is modeled, with the demand and the inventory holding costs possibly different in different time periods. The ordering cost, as in the EOQ model, is a fixed cost charged in each period where an order takes place. Several papers appeared in the literature that studied extensions of the original ELS problem. In most cases such extensions consider different ordering cost functions and we discuss the most interesting cases in the following. Also, efficient solution approaches to already known problems were presented (see, for example, Aggarwal & Park, 1993; Federgruen & Tzur, 1991; Wagelmans, van Hoesel, & Kolen, 1992). We refer to Brahimi, Dauzere-Peres, Najid, and Nordli (2006) for a survey on the ELS problem and to Robinson, Narayanan, and Sahin (2009), Buschkühl, Sahling, Helber, and Tempelmeier (2010), Hwang (2010), Hellion, Mangione, and Penz (2012) and Li, Ou, and Hsu (2012) for recent contributions to this problem.

As discussed by Nahmias (2001), there are three types of cost discount schemes commonly used in practice. The first type is the all-units discount scheme under which different discount rates apply to all units of different ordered quantities. The second type is the incremental discount scheme under which different discount rates apply to incremental ranges of the ordered quantity. The third type is the Truck Load (TL) discount scheme (also known as the carload discount scheme) under which the transportation service provider charges a LTL rate until the customer pays for the cost of a full truckload of Q units, which is typically less than the cost of shipping Q units at an LTL rate. Once the first truck is full, the customer again pays the LTL rate until the second truck is full, and so on. The TL discount scheme is also applicable to the situation where the customer is using a TL carrier and paying a TL rate for its TL shipments, although an LTL carrier is used for the delivery of the leftover quantities.

In this paper, we study the economic lot sizing problem with two different cost discount functions. The first is the modified all-unit discount cost function studied in Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) which alternates sections with positive slope and flat sections. The initial flat section indicates a minimum charge that must be paid for shipping a small quantity. This cost function corresponds to the case called in the industry shipping a quantity, but declaring a lower quantity. For instance, each pair of positive slope and flat sections can corresponds to the transportation capacity of one vehicle. If the shipped quantity is in the flat part, the cost of the full load vehicle is paid. Therefore, there is an incentive in sending quantities corresponding to full load vehicles. For the further practical motivations to study the modified all-unit discount cost function we refer to Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) and Chan, Muriel, Shen, Simchi-Levi and Teo (2002), where a variety of arguments is provided. It was shown in Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) that the problem is NP-hard. Moreover, the performance of practical policies was investigated in Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) for the single retailer case, whereas in Chan, Muriel, Shen, Simchi-Levi and Teo (2002) the results were extended to the multi-retailer case. In Shaw and Wagelmans (1998) the capacitated version of the problem was studied and a pseudo-polynomial algorithm was presented that can be applied to the uncapacitated case by setting the capacity to a large value.

In this paper, we investigate the problem where the cost function does not vary from period to period. A minimum charge is paid for small quantities. Then, an alternating sequence of sections with positive slope and flat sections follows. Both the sections with positive slope and the flat sections have identical length. The two lengths may be different. We will discuss in the paper the relevance of this assumption, that makes the cost function regular. We show that the problem with this piecewise linear cost function, referred to as regular modified all-unit discount cost function, can be solved in 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 I
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 3
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                      time, where I is the number of echelons, and T is the length of the discrete finite horizon. An echelon refers to two consecutive line segments, one with positive slope and one flat. The number of echelons is equal to the number of sections with positive slope.

The second cost function we consider is the incremental discount cost function
                     which is an increasing piecewise linear function. We show that in this case the economic lot sizing problem can be solved with a more efficient polynomial algorithm, with complexity 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . The result relies on the property that it is never beneficial to order if the inventory available is sufficient to satisfy the current demand. This property does not hold in general for the economic lot sizing problem with regular modified all-unit discount cost function, but does hold if there is no minimum charge for small quantities.

To show how valuable the availability of polynomial algorithms is, we present computational results where we compare the solution time required by the algorithms with the solution of a mathematical programming formulation through CPLEX.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we define the problem we study in this paper and we give a mathematical formulation. In Section 3 we describe the problem with regular modified all-unit discount cost function, we prove properties of the optimal solution and present the polynomial algorithm for its solution. Then, in Section 4 we present properties of the optimal solution and a more efficient polynomial algorithm for the problem with incremental discount cost function. Finally, in Section 5 we present the computational results and in Section 6 we draw some conclusions.

In the economic lot sizing problem a facility faces known demands over a discrete finite horizon. At each period, the ordering cost function and the holding cost function are given and they can be different from period to period. There are no constraints on the quantity ordered in each period and backlogging is not allowed. The objective is to decide when and how much to order so as to minimize the total ordering and holding costs over the finite horizon without any shortages.

Let T be the length of the discrete planning horizon and denote by

                     .

At period t the sequence of the operations is as follows. The inventory level is computed, then the product shipped at period t is received and, finally, the demand at period t is satisfied. Let

                      depends on the quantity through a cost discount function.

The first cost function we study is the modified all-unit discount cost function which is a piecewise linear function which alternates between increasing and flat sections, starting with a flat section. This cost function is studied in Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) and we now formally describe it. The function is depicted in Fig. 1
                     . In Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) the use of this kind of function in practice is explained and motivated with a variety of arguments. The function is defined as follows. For small quantities of ordered product, that is quantities less than

The economic lot sizing problem with modified all-unit discount cost function has been shown to be NP-hard in Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002).

                      the length of any echelon. We also assume that

                      shows the ordering cost function for this problem, that we call the regular modified all-unit discount cost function. A special case is when there is no minimum charge for small quantities, that is when

                           0
                        
                     . We will show that, in this special case, it is never beneficial to order if the inventory is sufficient to satisfy the current demand but that this property does not hold in general for the regular modified all-unit discount cost function.

The second cost function we study is the incremental discount cost function
                     which is an increasing piecewise linear function. An echelon corresponds to a line segment. The number of echelons is equal to the number of segments with positive slope.

The lengths of the echelons may be different and the function is defined as follows:

The incremental discount cost function

                        The objective function (1) expresses the minimization of the sum of the inventory cost and of the ordering cost. Constraints (2) define the inventory levels, while (3) guarantee the relation between the variables y and z and that the selected breakpoint is the largest not greater than the shipped quantity. Constraints (4) ensure that at most one breakpoint is selected. Finally, (5)–(7) define the range for the variables of the problem.

In Croxton, Gendron, and Magnanti (2003a, 2003b) different formulations for nonconvex piecewise linear cost minimization problems are proposed. One class of formulations is called Multiple Choice Models which employ segment variables with the same meaning as the z variables used in Problem 
                           
                              P
                           
                        . This formulation has been compared with other formulations for nonconvex piecewise linear cost minimization problems in Croxton et al. (2003a, 2003b) and Vielma, Ahmed, and Nemhauser (2010) and proved to be effective.

In this section we derive properties of the optimal solution of the economic lot sizing problem with regular modified all-unit discount cost function
                     (ELS-REG) and present a polynomial algorithm for its solution.

We characterize the optimal solution, deriving properties that are fundamental for the design of a polynomial algorithm.

We will use the expression the cost of the last unit of product for a transported quantity x to indicate the difference between the ordering cost of x and the ordering cost of

Let us consider an optimal solution of the ELS-REG. We show that, in case it does not satisfy the claim of the theorem, we can transform it in a solution which satisfies the claim without increasing the cost.

Suppose that the optimal solution has a regeneration interval

We now consider the modified optimal solution. Note that, if the unit of product has been moved backward, then the inventory level in any intermediate period has increased and the solution is feasible. If the modified solution has a regeneration interval with more than one fractional quantity, we repeat the previous procedure. If it has been moved forward, then the inventory level has decreased. We have two cases.

                           Remark 1
                           Given a sequence of regeneration points, an optimal solution can be obtained by finding an optimal solution in each regeneration interval separately.

An optimal solution to ELS-REG can be found by looking for the sequence of regeneration points with minimum total cost. Thus, we can enumerate all the sequences of regeneration points and, for each sequence, thanks to Remark 1, we can determine an optimal solution by optimizing the problem on each regeneration interval separately. An optimal solution on a regeneration interval can be found by looking for an optimal solution with at most one fractional quantity, due to Theorem 1.

We prove that the ELS-REG can be solved in polynomial time by showing that an optimal solution on a regeneration interval can be found in polynomial time and, then, that all the sequences of regeneration points can be explored in polynomial time.

We first show that, given a regeneration interval

                        . The polynomial complexity of the algorithm we present comes from the fact that only the inventory level characterizes a solution in period t. The algorithm avoids the redundant exploration of solutions, keeping track of the best sequence of orders that creates a given inventory level in period t.

We first observe that, in the ELS-REG without minimum charge, one should not order if the inventory available at the beginning of a period t is sufficient to satisfy the demand of t. This is true because, otherwise, a non-worse solution could be found by postponing the order of the quantity ordered at period t.

                            is 0. Then, moving backward, the operation can be repeated on any pair of periods until all the demand of period T is ordered in a single period. We can repeat the operation for the demand of period

                                       1
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           .
                        

Due to Theorem 4, we can assume that an order takes place at period t only if 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       I
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                                 <
                                 
                                    
                                       d
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                              
                           . Then, as from Lemma 1 we know that the demand of t is all ordered in a single period, we can deduce that an order takes place only when 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       I
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                                 =
                                 0
                              
                           . Then, since no order takes place until the inventory level is 0, the claim follows. □

In this section we present the results of computational experiments we made in order to test the efficiency of Algorithm Flat for the ELS-REG, the Algorithm NoFlat presented in Section 4.1 for the ELS-INCand the exact solution of Problem 
                        
                           P
                        
                     . The MILP model can be used for the solution of the ELS-REG and the ELS-INC. We tested instances where all echelons have the same length. Problem 
                        
                           P
                        
                     
                     was solved using CPLEX 12.5. The codes were compiled in release mode with MS Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition – Windows SDK 7.1. The experiments were carried out on a 64-bit Windows machine, with the Intel Xeon processor W3680, 3.33gigahertz, and 12gigabyte of RAM. Note that, when solving the MILP model, we did not consider echelons related to quantities that exceeded the sum of the demands over all periods. This is made in order to reduce the size of the MILP model and to make a fair comparison with algorithms Flat and NoFlat which do not take into account such echelons. Test instances are generated according to benchmark instances proposed by Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002). In particular, inventory cost h is generated according to a uniform distribution in the interval 
                        
                           [
                           0.2
                           ,
                           0.7
                           ]
                        
                     . They proposed 4 classes of instances with different number of periods, different number of breakpoints in the cost function and where demands were generated according to a normal distribution with a specified average and standard deviation. Since the size of the instances they proposed is too small and they were all solved instantaneously by all algorithms (including the exact solution of Problem 
                        
                           P
                        
                     ), we decided to increase the size of instances by increasing the number of periods and the number of breakpoints in the cost function. In particular, we generated two sets of instances: Set 1 with 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           30
                        
                      and 
                        
                           I
                           =
                           20
                        
                      and Set 2 with 
                        
                           T
                           =
                           60
                        
                      and 
                        
                           I
                           =
                           40
                        
                     . As the instances of Chan, Muriel, Shen and Simchi-Levi (2002) had very few breakpoints in the cost function, we extended them by simply replicating the structure of the cost function. In all classes of instances they proposed the size of all echelons was constant except for the first flat part. We changed it by setting it equal to the size of all echelons.

All instances can be found at the following URL: http://www-c.eco.unibs.it/∼archetti/lotsizing.zip.

The obtained results are shown in Table 2
                      for the instances of Set 1 and in Table 3
                      for the instances of Set 2. The tables are organized as follows. For each class, Columns 2–4 give the results obtained for the ELS-REG, Columns 5–7 the ones obtained for the ELS-REG without minimum charge and, finally, Columns 8–11 the results obtained for the ELS-INC. For the ELS-REG and the case without minimum charge we show the computational time in seconds obtained by the algorithm Flat and by CPLEX with a maximum computational time of 1800seconds. Moreover, in the case where CPLEX was not able to find the optimal solution in the given maximum time, we show the percentage error of the best solution found with respect to the optimal cost. For the ELS-INCwe also show the computational time obtained by the algorithm NoFlat.

The results clearly show that the algorithm Flat is extremely efficient to solve instances of any realistic size. On the contrary, CPLEX is unable to solve many of the instances of Set 2 within the allowed time even if the best solution found always corresponds to the optimal one except for one case. For the instances of Set 1, CPLEX requires a much higher computing time than algorithm Flat. Moreover, as expected, the algorithm NoFlat outperforms the algorithm Flat in the case with incremental discount cost function.

The economic lot sizing problem is a problem that has received enormous interest in theory and in practice. While the original model by Wagner and Whitin can be solved in

                     , where T is the length of the planning horizon, with a cost structure that includes linear ordering cost, linear inventory holding cost and an additional setup cost, many cost structures used in practice give rise to NP-hard problems.

In this paper we have presented two cases of the problem with cost discounts. In the first case the cost function is a modified all-unit discount function which alternates flat sections, all with the same length, and increasing sections, all with the same length. The polynomial algorithm presented is based upon the well-known concept of regeneration interval and has complexity
