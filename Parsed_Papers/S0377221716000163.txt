                  In this paper we study two-agent scheduling in a two-machine flowshop. The cost function is the weighted sum of some common regular functions, including the makespan and the total completion time. Specifically, we consider two problems, namely the problem to minimize the weighted sum of both agents’ makespan, and the problem to minimize the weighted sum of one agent’s total completion time and the other agent’s makespan. For the first problem, we give an ordinary NP-hardness proof and a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm. We also analyze the performance of treating the problem using Johnson’s rule and propose an approximation algorithm based on Johnson’s rule. For the second problem, we propose an approximation algorithm based on linear programming relaxation of the problem. Finally, we show that some simple algorithms can be used to solve special cases of the two problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years there has been significant interest in multi-agent scheduling, in which each agent owns a family of jobs and seeks to optimize its own goal associated with its family of jobs. Scheduling problems involving multiple agents competing for a common processing resource often arise in real practice in which negotiation is needed. For example, consider a machine that is subject to preventive maintenance at regular times. A number of maintenance tasks have to be performed on the machine in given time windows, each of which is specified by a release date and a due date. Suppose that the maintenance department (call it agent B) is charged with performing the maintenance tasks on the machine, while the production department (call it agent A) is responsible for scheduling a set of jobs on the machine for processing. The maintenance tasks must be scheduled within their respective time windows, while the jobs are to be scheduled on the machine when it is free (i.e., not undergoing maintenance) to process jobs so that a given objective function is optimized (Leung, Pinedo, & Wan, 2010). In telecommunication services, the problem is to do with satisfying the service requirements of individual agents, which compete for the use of a commercial satellite to transfer voice, image, and text data for their clients (Schultz et al., 2002). The problem is to fulfill the requirements of various integrated services. Two models are distinguished in the extant literature on multi-agent scheduling. One is to deal with the weighted sum problem, which seeks to optimize the weighted sum of the agents’ objectives (see Baker & Smith, 2003). The other is to solve the constrained optimization problem, which seeks to optimize one agent’s objective, subject to the other agent’s objective not exceeding a given limit (see Agnetis, Mirchandani, Pacciarelli, & Pacifici, 2004). In this paper we focus on the weighted sum problem of two-agent scheduling in a two-machine flowshop.

The multi-agent scheduling problem was first introduced by Baker and Smith (2003) and Agnetis et al. (2004). Baker and Smith (2003) study the problem of minimizing a linear combination of the objective functions of two or more agents on a single machine. They consider minimizing an aggregate scheduling objective function under which the jobs belonging to different agents are evaluated based on their individual criteria. Agnetis et al. (2004) study constrained optimization and Pareto optimization of two-agent scheduling in various machine settings. Studying single-machine scheduling with multiple agents, Agnetis, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2007) consider objective functions that are the maximum of regular functions, including the number of tardy jobs and the total weighted completion time. Cheng, Ng, and Yuan (2006) consider multi-agent single-machine scheduling, where each agent’s objective function is to minimize the total weighted number of its tardy jobs. In addition, Cheng, Ng, and Yuan (2008) study multi-agent single-machine scheduling where the objective functions of the agents are of the max-form. Ng, Cheng, and Yuan (2006) study the problem of minimizing the total completion time of one agent, subject to the number of tardy jobs of the other agent cannot exceed a given limit. Leung et al. (2010) extend the models in Agnetis et al. (2004) to the identical parallel-machine setting with two agents, where the jobs of the two agents may have distinct release dates and preemption is allowed.


                     Mor and Mosheiov (2010) discuss the problem of minimizing the maximum earliness cost or the total (weighted) earliness cost of one agent, subject to an upper bound on the maximum earliness cost of the other agent. Nong, Cheng, and Ng (2011) study the problem to minimize the total cost comprising the maximum weighted completion time of one agent and the total weighted completion time of the other agent. Wan, Vakati, Leung, and Pinedo (2010) consider scheduling models with controllable job processing times on a single machine or two identical parallel machines, where the processing times of the jobs of one agent are compressible at additional costs. Liu, Zhou, and Tang (2010) consider two-agent single-machine scheduling with position-dependent processing times. Mor and Mosheiov (2011), Li and Yuan (2012), and Fan, Cheng, Li, and Feng (2013) consider multi-agent scheduling on a single batching machine. Oron, Shabtay, and Steiner (2015) study various two-agent scheduling problems on a single machine with equal job processing times.

Flowshop scheduling has attracted much research attention since Johnson (1954) pioneered this line of research. However, multi-agent scheduling in the flowshop setting has received little research as of now. Agnetis et al. (2004) are probably the first researchers who study two-agent scheduling in the two-machine flowshop. Considering the problem in which both agents seek to minimize their makespan, they show that simple as it is the problem is NP-hard. Lee, Chen, Chen, and Wu (2011) consider two-agent two-machine flowshop scheduling to minimize the total completion time of one agent with no tardy jobs for the other agent. They develop a branch-and-bound algorithm and a simulated annealing heuristic algorithm for the problem. Most recent development of this topic can be found in the first volume of Agnetis, Billaut, Gawiejnowicz, Pacciarelli, and Soukhal (2014) and Perez-Gonzalez and Framinan (2014).

In this paper we study two-agent scheduling in a two-machine flowshop to minimize the weighted sum of both agents’ objectives. We analyze the complexity of the problems under study and provide approximation algorithms for the general cases of the problems. For the intractable problems, we identify some polynomially solvable special cases. It should be noted that the purposes of studying special cases of the problems are two-folds: (i) It is meaningful from a theoretical point of view to give a boundary on the problems in P and those in NP. For example, when certain restrictions are imposed on the processing times of the jobs, a problem becomes polynomially solvable, while when the restrictions are slightly changed, the problem remains NP-hard. (ii) While some of the special cases are hypothetical, some other cases are very practical, e.g., jobs of the same type have the same processing time. This is observed in real practice of semiconductor manufacturing where a facility typically produces fewer than ten distinct circuit types at a time.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce some notation and a dominant structure for all the problems studied in this paper. In Section 3 we consider the problem to minimize the weighted sum of both agents’ makespan. We show that the problem is NP-hard and provide a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. We also provide approximation algorithms based on Johnson’s rule and analyze their worst-case error bounds. In Section 4 we consider the problem to minimize the weighted sum of one agent’s makespan and the other agent’s total completion time. We give an approximation algorithm based on linear programming relaxation of the problem. Furthermore, we prove that some simple algorithms can be used to solve special cases of the two problems. Finally, we conclude the paper and suggest topics for future research in Section 5.

In this section we consider the case with the simplest objective function, i.e., C
                     max . We first analyze the complexity of the problem. We then provide an approximation algorithm based on Johnson’s rule for the problem and analyze its worst-case error bound. Finally, we consider two polynomially solvable special cases.

We first show that even this simple case of the problem is NP-hard by performing a reduction from the following well-known NP-complete problem (Garey & Johnson, 1979).

                     . The corresponding (single-agent) flowshop scheduling problem F2||C
                     max  is well known and polynomially solvable by Johnson’s rule (Johnson, 1954). Johnson’s rule can be stated as follows:


                     Johnson’s rule (JR): Sequence job Ji
                      before job Jj
                      if min {p
                     
                        i1, p
                     
                        j2} < min {p
                     
                        i2, p
                     
                        j1}. If there is equality, either sequence is optimal.

In fact, Johnson’s rule can be implemented in an easier way (Lee, 1999) as shown in the following: Divide all the jobs into two disjoint subsets, namely S
                     1 and S
                     2, where

                           1 is unchanged and the makespan of agent A is either smaller or unchanged. Similarly, the jobs after J
                           
                              σ(k) should be processed according to Johnson’s rule by Lemma 3.3.□

                           Remark 3.6
                           Our approach by partitioning all the jobs into two groups and applying Johnson’s rule to each group is an extension of the classical work of Johnson. This study may serve as a stepping stone for further analysis of larger, more complicated flowshop scheduling problems with this type of objective function. For example, similar to the analysis of the above algorithm for the two-agent problem, the m-agent problem can also be solved in pseudo-polynomial time for a given m. For an arbitrary m, we can show that the m-agent problem is strongly NP-hard by a reduction from 3-Partition (Garey & Johnson, 1979).

We first analyze the worst-case error bound of applying Johnson’s rule to problem

                                 C
                                 max
                                 A
                              
                              +
                              α
                              
                                 C
                                 max
                                 B
                              
                           
                        . Johnson’s rule may generate a schedule for the problem with very poor performance because the objective function consists of two parts that correspond to the two agents. Furthermore, the weighted parameter α plays an important role in the objective function. Consider the following example: There are three jobs

                      immediately implies that our problem is also NP-hard in the strong sense. As a result, we provide an approximation algorithm. First we introduce a very useful property for our problem as follows:

                           the processing sequence of all the jobs on either machine can be made the same as that of the other machine without loss of time.
                        

The proof of Lemma 4.1 is analogous to that of Lemma 3.2, so we omit it. In view of Lemma 4.1, we restrict our attention to the feasible schedules in which each machine processes all the jobs in the same sequence in the sequel.

Note that any feasible schedule should satisfy

                        Based on linear programming formulations with completion time variables, Schulz (1996) presents polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem to minimize the total weighted completion time in various scheduling environments. He also extends this technique to flowshop problems by introducing new linear inequalities

                        The nonnegative variable CB
                         measures the objective value of agent B. Although the number of constraints in the first set of constraints in LP is exponential, there is a polynomial-time separation algorithm for such constrains (Queyranne, 1993). So LP can be solved in polynomial time. Based on the above linear programming relaxation of the problem, we propose the following heuristic for problem
