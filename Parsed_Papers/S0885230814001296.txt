                  A vocal tract model based on a digital waveguide is presented in which the vocal tract has been decomposed into a number of convergent and divergent ducts. The divergent duct is modeled by a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide and the convergent duct by a one dimensional waveguide. The modeling of the divergent duct is based on splitting the volume velocity into axial and radial components. The combination of separate modeling of the divergent and convergent ducts forms the foundation of the current approach. The advantage of this approach is the ability to get a transfer function in zero-pole form that eliminates the need to perform numerical calculations on a discrete 2D mesh. In this way the present model named as a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide model has been found to be more efficient than the standard 2D waveguide model and in very good comparison with it in the formant frequency patterns of the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. The model has two control parameters, the wall and glottal reflection coefficients that can be effectively employed for bandwidth tuning. The model also shows its ability to generate smooth dynamic changes in the vocal tract during the transition of vowels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Human speech production system consists of three main components like lungs, vocal folds and vocal tract. The coordination of these three components results into voiced sound, unvoiced sound or combination of these two. For voiced sound production like that of vowel, the air is pushed out from the lungs into the larynx. In the larynx, there are two identical vocal folds which are initially closed. The closure of the vocal folds causes a sub-glottal pressure. When this pressure rises above the resistance of the vocal folds, the vocal folds open themselves and air is passed through it. As the pressure decreases with the release of airflow, the vocal folds then close themselves quickly. The quasi-periodic opening and closing of the vocal folds continues due to constant supply of the air pressure from the lungs. Thus the vibration of the vocal folds forms a train of periodic pulses that acts as an excitation signal for the vocal tract. A non-uniform acoustic tube which extends from the glottis to the lips is called a vocal tract. The position of the vocal articulators like larynx, velum, jaw, tongue, and lips, forms a particular shape of the vocal tract. The shape of the vocal tract modifies spectral characteristics of the quasi-periodic air flow passing through it, which leads to the generation of voiced speech. In this way different shapes of the vocal tract generate different voiced speeches.

Several approaches have been employed to model the voiced speech system on the basis of physical models such as cylindrical segments (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962; Mullen et al., 2003) and conical segments (Välimäki and Karjalainen, 1994; Strube, 2003; Makarov, 2009) for the vocal tract modeling. In cylindrical approach, each tube segment of the vocal tract is modeled by the forward- and backward-traveling wave components of the solution of the wave equation (Morse, 1981; Smith, 1998) known as one-dimensional waveguide model. It was firstly used in Kelly–Lochbaum model of the human vocal tract for speech synthesis (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962). However, the digital waveguide modeling (DWM), which is an extension of a one-dimensional waveguide, is recently being used in the modeling of the vocal tract (Van Duyne and Smith, 1993a,b; Cooper et al., 2006; Mullen et al., 2006, 2007; Speed et al., 2013). Digital waveguides are very popular for realistic and high quality sound generation in real time, and are successfully employed in physical modeling of sound synthesis.

The greatest advantage of a 1-D digital waveguide model is that it has complete solution to the wave equation which is also computationally efficient for sound synthesis applications. Moving to higher dimensions leads to a number of limitations imposed on DWM models for an optimal solution to all sound synthesis systems. The most important one is the dispersion error, where the velocity of a propagating wave depends upon both its frequency and direction of traveling, leading to wave propagation errors and mistuning of the expected resonant modes. The dispersion error is highly dependent upon mesh topology and has been investigated in (Van Duyne and Smith, 1996; Fontana and Rocchesso, 2001; Campos and Howard, 2005). Another limitation is the restriction on sampling frequency. High sampling rates require high mesh density which corresponds to high computational cost.

A 1D waveguide model is computationally efficient while the standard 2D and 3D waveguide models have better accuracy but heavy computational cost (Murphy and Howard, 2000; Campos and Howard, 2000; Beeson and Murphy, 2004; Murphy et al., 2007). In the present work we propose an efficient two-dimensional waveguide model of the vocal tract that has comparable formant frequencies with the standard 2D waveguide but has efficiency comparable to that of a 1D waveguide model. In the present model we approximate only the divergent part of the vocal tract by divergent ducts and consider two-dimensional volume velocity in it while in the convergent duct that represents convergent part of the vocal tract, we employ conventional one-dimensional approximation of the volume velocity. In this way the accuracy of the current model can never be better than the standard 2D waveguide model which considers two-dimensional volume velocity in the whole of the vocal tract. Therefore, we make it as a reference model for the comparison.

The present results of the formant frequencies from the numerical simulation using area functions for specific vowels (Juszkiewicz, 2014) exhibit good comparison with the standard 2D waveguide model. The computational cost of the standard 2D waveguide is very high while the current approach is much more efficient.

The present section is followed by five more sections. In Section 2, we describe our proposed vocal tract model. In this section, we also develop its mathematical formulation. Section 3 describes how to find a transfer function of the vocal tract. Section 4 is reserved for the numerical simulation of the model. Section 5 is dedicated for the results and discussion and Section 6 is for the conclusions.

We derive a new model of vocal tract with a new transfer function relating it to pole-zero type linear prediction developed on the basis of the procedure given in (Kang and Lee, 1988). Current approach is to propose an efficient two-dimensional waveguide that has formant frequencies comparable with those of the standard 2D waveguide. We consider the vocal tract consisting of concatenated cylindrical acoustic tubes of same lengths but different cross-sectional areas. We define a convergent duct by the concatenation of two cylinders, where a cylinder with larger radius is followed by the one with the smaller radius. The connection of two cylinders in which a narrow cylinder is followed by a wider cylinder in the direction of flow is called a divergent duct. A serial combination of these two types of ducts constitutes the vocal tract. For example, in Fig. 1
                     , the concatenation of the cylinders l
                     1 and l
                     2 forms a divergent duct while that of the cylinders l
                     2 and l
                     3 constitutes a convergent duct. Similarly concatenations of l
                     
                        3
                      with l
                     4, l
                     4 with l
                     5, l
                     5 with l
                     6 and l
                     6 with l
                     7 are labeled as divergent ducts while those of l
                     7 with l
                     8, l
                     8 with l
                     9 and l
                     9 with l
                     10 define convergent ducts.

In the divergent duct, we assume that the volume velocity splits into its axial and radial components as shown in Fig. 2
                     . The modeling of such ducts in the form of axial and radial components may improve the formant patterns of a 1D digital waveguide which are comparable with a 2D digital waveguide. The convergent duct may be represented by the usual 1D waveguide model as there is no 2D splitting of volume velocity at the entrance from a wider cylinder to the narrow one. The vocal tract is divided into cylindrical segments of same length so that the propagating time of sound wave through each cylindrical segment in an axial direction is same, say, τ. However, each of the uniform cylindrical segments may have a different cross-section area or diameter, so that the time taken for the sound wave to propagate through a cylindrical segment in a radial direction may not be an integer multiple of τ. In such a case, the delay in a radial direction will necessarily be a fractional delay (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004). In the current model, it may be noted that in the divergent duct reflection of wave occurs at two different places, one is where impedance changes and the other is at the wall of the cylindrical tube. This leads to the presence of two different types of delays in the modeling of divergent duct. The delay in a transverse direction is formulated as the absolute difference of the radii of the two concatenated cylindrical tubes, which will necessarily be a fractional delay and has been approximated by the Lagrange interpolator (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004).

For the formulation of the model, we consider a divergent duct consisting of two cylindrical tubes of cross-sectional areas 
                        
                           
                              A
                              i
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              A
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      as shown in Fig. 2. When the volume velocity enters from the ith tube into the (i
                     +1)th tube, it splits into an axial component 
                        
                           
                              u
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      along the vocal tract and a radial component 
                        
                           
                              v
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      in a transverse direction. We use local coordinate system in the ith divergent duct. Therefore, the origin for the splitting of volume velocity into the axial and radial directions lays at the junction of the ith and (i
                     +1)th cylinders as shown in Fig. 2. When the volume flow is along the direction of the vocal tract, the acoustic impedance depends on the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. The cross-sectional area of a cylinder is an area in which the volume flow occurs normal to this area. If we consider the volume flow in a radial direction then the volume flow occurs normal to the surface area which leads to the assumption that the impedance of volume flow in a radial direction may depend on the surface area of the cylinder. For this purpose, we can assume an imaginary cylinder of appropriate cross-sectional area intruded into the (i
                     +1)th cylinder shown by dotted line in Fig. 2 in which volume velocity along the vocal tract is 
                        
                           
                              u
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     . A transverse component 
                        
                           
                              v
                              
                                 i
                                 +
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                      may be regarded as the volume velocity coming out of the surface of this imaginary cylinder in a transverse direction so that it may be considered as proportional to its surface area. In this way we can control axial and transverse volume velocity components

                      by changing the radius of the imaginary cylinder. It may be noted that the radius of the imaginary cylinder will necessarily be a fraction of the radius of the ith cylinder because otherwise there can be no transverse component in the (i
                     +1)th cylinder, and may be expressed as

Let 
                        l
                      be the length of any cylindrical tube as all tubes have same length. Under the above assumptions, the acoustic pressure at the junction of the two cylinders forming a divergent duct is identical in either direction and the total volume velocity is preserved. We, then, have the following boundary conditions at the junction of the ith and (i
                     +1)th cylinders.

The time domain representation of the present vocal tract model consists of Eqs. (12)–(15). However, this representation is not computationally convenient for the study of vocal tract formant frequencies. In the next section, we derive another representation of this model in the z-domain using z-transformation.

In this section we derive the transfer function of the above vocal tract model in pole-zero type form by transforming the model from time-domain to z-domain using z-transformation. This representation provides convenient means for studying the model characteristics.

First of all we assume that we have a vocal tract model with N cylindrical tubes of equal length and delay in each tube is considered as half-sample delay, i.e., we sample every

These three equations are not suitable for the derivation of the transfer function and need to be reduced into two equations. For this, we define

Here, we give the numerical solution procedure that was adopted for solving a 2D waveguide model. These results will be used as criteria for evaluating our present a 2D-featured 1D waveguide model.

One of the most significant advantages of a 1D-digital waveguide that makes it a realistic proposition for application in sound synthesis is the computational efficiency which is lost when we move to higher dimensional digital waveguide. A 2D waveguide model is found to give more accurate formant synthesis, producing vowels that give a good match to the real-world targets (Mullen, 2006; Mullen et al., 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007; Rugchatjaroen and Howard, 2012). The current approach has its advantage of better frequency formants than those of a 1D digital waveguide and comparable with a 2D-waveguide while maintaining its computational efficiency comparable to that of a 1D-digital waveguide. In others words, the current approach improves the accuracy without significant increase in the computational cost. Another drawback of the higher dimensional digital waveguide model is the limitation of the sampling frequency being inversely proportional to the travel time between two scattering junctions as may be seen in Eq. (33). The denser the mesh is used in terms of the number of scattering junctions for better accuracy, the higher the frequency and the computational cost. As a consequence, the whole vocal tract model has to be run at the sampling rate which is much higher than necessary for voice synthesis. However, the current approach preserves the sampling frequency of a 1D digital waveguide.

In this work, the length of the vocal tract has been chosen as 17.5cm (Wakita, 1977; Mullen et al., 2006; Mathur et al., 2006). The vocal tract model has been divided into 32 equal cylindrical segments starting from the glottal end in order to gain sampling frequency approximately 32kHz for the speech. In all simulations, boundary reflection coefficients

                      at walls are chosen as 0.97, 0.90 and 1.0, respectively.

The area function at any point is defined to be the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical tube containing that point. In this way the area function becomes piecewise constant as the cross-sectional area changes only on moving from one tube to the other. Moreover, the area function is defined in terms of the diameter of the tube in order to construct the physical structure of the vocal tract. The physical structure of the vocal tract is represented by the waveguide of same impedance. A highly fine rectilinear mesh of 600 nodes is employed along an axial direction and multiple waveguides along a radial direction depending upon the value of the diameter (Mullen et al., 2006; Murphy and Beeson, 2007). This configuration leads to a fixed delay size of 17.5/600=0.02917cm. Due to this fixed delay size, mesh nodes along a radial direction depend upon the maximum value of the diameter in each vowel. Since maximum value of the diameter varies from one vowel to the other, therefore, number of radial mesh nodes will vary accordingly. The cross-sectional areas of the five vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ are listed in Table 1
                      (Juszkiewicz, 2014). In our demonstration of a 2D waveguide, the 4-port rectilinear mesh has been used and the mesh sizes of the five vowels are 600×112, 600×128, 600×128, 600×156 and 600×142, respectively. To make an ideal vocal tract, wall boundary reflection coefficient

                      is set to 1 at each cylindrical segment.

                     where c is the speed of sound approximated by 345m/s, N is the dimension of the mesh and d is the delay size. By Eq. (33), the current configuration of mesh leads to the sampling rates of 1672.8kHz for a 2D waveguide.

For the case of 1D waveguide, Eq. (33) can be written as

Eq. (34) is used for the full-sample delay model in which there is only a forward wave in every other tube at each instant of time and a backward wave in every other. The model is made more efficient when the delay in one segment is half a sample, meaning that two consecutive steps of the full-sample model are combined into a single step which leads to the efficiency of the model. In our presentation, we consider half-sample delay model and Eq. (34) is, then, rewritten as (Mathur et al., 2006; Lim and Lee, 1993)

By taking vocal tract length 17.5cm, each segment length is obtained as d
                     =0.546875cm which leads to the sampling frequency of

As the length of each cylindrical segment is same, the propagating time of sound wave through each cylindrical segment in an axial direction will also be the same say τ. However, since each of the uniform cylindrical segments may have a different cross-sectional area or diameter, the time taken by the sound wave to propagate through a cylindrical segment in a radial direction may not be an integer multiple of τ. In such a case, the delay in a radial direction is necessarily a fractional delay (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004). Since the present model also considers the delay in a radial direction, the transfer function of our model will necessarily contain the fractional delay which has been approximated by Lagrange interpolator (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004), a type of FIR filter. Lagrange interpolation is popular for easy and fast calculation of the filter coefficients. It has very good magnitude and phase response at low frequencies with the magnitude response never exceeding one. For comparison at higher frequencies, we need to retain maximal flatness of the FIR filter up to higher frequencies. This could be done by increasing the order of the filter which depends upon the value of the fractional delay. In our work, we gain maximal flatness of the filter by multiplying 
                        
                           
                              z

                      by the numerator and denominator of the transfer function. This approach does not change frequency and phase responses of the transfer function but increases the order of the filter.

In the present model we approximate only the divergent part of the vocal tract by divergent ducts and consider two-dimensional volume velocity in it while in the convergent duct that represents convergent part of the vocal tract, we employ conventional one-dimensional approximation of the volume velocity. In this way the accuracy of the current model can never be better than the standard 2D waveguide model which considers two-dimensional volume velocity in the whole of the vocal tract. Therefore, we make it as a reference model for the comparison.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we present the accuracy and efficiency of our current waveguide model in the simulation of vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. The comparison of its formant frequencies and efficiency has been made with those of 1D and 2D waveguide models. The parameter k appearing in Eq. (1) determines the size of the imaginary cylinder relative to the ith cylinder that carries an axial velocity component within the (i
                     +1)th cylinder. Its value varies with the variation of the vocal tract length and the number of segments constituting the vocal tract.

We have tested our model for different values of the parameter k in the range 0 to 1. As we increase the value of k from 0, the formant frequencies of the proposed model start to match with that of the standard 2D model. It has been found that the best matching of formant frequencies of the present model with the standard 2D model is achieved at k
                     =1. Therefore, the radius of the imaginary cylinder has been taken to be the same as that of the ith cylinder in all the present simulations which corresponds to the choice of k
                     =1.


                     Table 1 represents cross-sectional areas of the 32 tubes, which constitute the vocal tract for each vowel. These cross-sectional areas have been obtained by the spline interpolation of the cross-sectional areas given in (Juszkiewicz, 2014).

Each vowel requires at least three formant frequencies for its recognition (Mullen et al., 2006). However, we consider all the formant frequencies generated by the 2D, 1D and proposed models in all our demonstrations. Tables 2–6
                     
                     
                     
                     
                      give comparison of the formant frequencies of all the five vowels. In these tables, the columns 2 to 4 show formant frequencies of the 2D, 1D and present models, respectively, the columns 5 and 6 give percent errors of a 1D model and the current model relative to a 2D model and the column 7 presents percent error reduction by the current model relative to a 1D model. Furthermore, the positive and negative signs in the columns 5 and 6 indicate estimation of the formant frequencies of a 2D model from the left side (i.e., under-estimate) and the right side (i.e., over-estimate), respectively. The negative sign in column 7 represents increase in the percent error of the current model relative to a 1D model. Some formant frequencies of a 2D model are estimated by two, i.e., left and right side frequencies of either or both of the 1D and current models which has been indicated in the tables by duplicating the formant frequencies of a 2D model.

It may be noted from these tables that the maximum number of formant frequencies given by a diametric 2D waveguide model with 32 tubes for the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ are, respectively, 19, 19, 19, 17 and 18. However, the 1D and proposed models give 16 formant frequencies for each of the vowels. This indicates that the 1D and present models have not been able to capture some of the formant frequencies of a 2D model that have been shown in the tables as ‘Nil’.

First of all, we discuss the formant frequencies of the 2D, 1D and present models, respectively, for the vowel /a/ up to the maximum frequency of 15kHz given in Table 2. The formant numbers 12 and 14 of the 2D model could not be captured by any of the 1D and current models. However, the formant number 16 has been captured only by the current model with percent error of 2.51 while the formant number 17 has been estimated only by a 1D model with the percent error of 2.33. So the models cannot be compared with each other in these four cases. For the other cases the table shows that the absolute percent error of a 1D model relative to that of a 2D model varies from 1.44 to 12.13 while for the present model it varies from 0.18 to 13.41. Further the current model reduces the error of a 1D model by about 66%, 69%, 89%, 63%, 88%, 80%, 87%, 83% and 75% in the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, 15th, 18th and 19th formant frequencies, respectively, and by about 24%, 46%, 44% and 37% in the cases of 1st, 4th, 8th and 11th formant frequencies, respectively. However, the percent error of the current model is larger than that of a 1D model by about 11% and 41% in the cases of 2nd and 5th formant frequencies. In this way out of the 16 formant frequencies, the present model shows improvement in the 13 formant frequencies in the range 24% to 89%. However, there is error increase in the two formant frequencies of the current model relative to a 1D model as given earlier. The acoustic response of the vocal tract for vowel /a/ has been shown in Fig. 4
                      and those formant frequencies have been considered which are below 12kHz. It may be noted from the figure that the propagation in transverse direction has its effect in the tuning of the formant frequencies in the final output.

Similarly, Tables 3–6 demonstrate comparison of all the formant frequencies of the models under consideration for the vowels /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ up to the maximum frequency of 15kHz. The comparable formant frequencies are 14, 13, 14 and 15 for the vowels /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/, respectively. In the case of vowel /e/, the current model reduces the percent error of a 1D model from 8.69% to 95.57% for formant frequencies F2, F3, F4, F7, F8, F9, F10, F12, F14, F15 and F19, respectively, while it increases the percent error in F1, F5 and F6 by 8.28%, 157.14% and 123.58%. For the vowel /i/, our model reduces percent error from 6.93% to 99.59% for F2, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F12, F16 and F19. However, there is increase in the percent error of the current model by 1.6% and 170.13% for F1 and F15, respectively. Similarly, the current model shows improvement in the percent error from 0% to 68.79% and from 2.29% to 49.49% for the 11 formant frequencies of each of the /o/ and /u/ vowels, respectively. The acoustic responses of the vowels /e/ and /i/ have also been shown in Figs. 5 and 6
                     
                     .

The accuracy of the formant prediction of our model in the above examples is attributed to the consideration of 2D volume velocity in the divergent ducts. As the vocal tract is the combinations of the convergent and divergent ducts, we model only the divergent ducts with 2D volume velocity and leave the convergent duct with 1D volume velocity. This hybrid approach leads to the accuracies of the formant prediction that differ at different formants.

In view of the demonstrations given above, it may be concluded that the current model estimates such kinds of formant frequency differences which are sufficient to be perceptually important in vowel quality.

Now we present variation in the formant bandwidths in response to the variation in the wall boundary reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      and the glottal reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              G
                           
                        
                      as the control parameters. This study will demonstrate how the bandwidth tuning of the formant frequencies of the present model may be carried out by the adjustment of the reflection coefficients. This is the usual way in which bandwidth tuning is achieved in the vocal tract models with tract wall losses by altering the reflection coefficients. In our presentation, we consider first eight bandwidths B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7 and B8 for the three vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/.


                     Fig. 7
                      demonstrates variation in the formant bandwidths against variation in 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      within the range 0.91–1.0 with all other parameters being kept fixed. In the case of vowel /a/, the range of all bandwidths at 0.91 is from 150Hz to 831Hz while it is from 27Hz to 63Hz at 1.0. It may be noted that the bandwidths B1, B2 and B4 have single large step in their profiles as depicted in Fig. 7(a). The bandwidth B1 decreases linearly by increasing 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      from 0.91 to 0.9255. An abrupt decrease takes place in the very short range of 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      from 0.9255 to 0.9286 while it starts to decrease approximately linearly in the range of 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      from 0.9286 to 1.0. Similarly, the bandwidth B2 and B4 show the same behavior of linear decline with sharp sudden jump. However, the bandwidths B3, B5, B6, B7 and B8 are approximately linearly decreasing without sudden jump with the increment of wall reflection coefficient as depicted in the figure. The bandwidths B3, B6, B7 and B8 have approximately same slopes with linear decrease while B5 has significantly different slope.

Similarly in the cases of vowel /e/ and /o/, all bandwidths are approximately linearly decreasing with the increment of wall reflection coefficient except the bandwidth B2 of the vowel /o/ which has sudden jump in its profile as depicted in Fig. 7(c). For vowels /e/ and /o/, the range of bandwidths varies from 166Hz to 269Hz and from 137Hz to 606Hz at r
                     
                        w
                     
                     =0.91, respectively. However, for the same vowels, it varies from 21Hz to 71Hz and 18Hz to 81Hz at r
                     
                        w
                     
                     =1.0, respectively.

We note from the current figure that all the formant bandwidths of each vowel are presenting approximately linear response within the given range of values of the wall reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      except that some have sudden downfall for a very short range of the wall reflection coefficient. This may be regarded as the artifact of our model as there is no apparent reason for this jump in some of the bandwidths for specific values of the wall reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                     . However, the wall reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              W
                           
                        
                      may be adjusted to render better approximation of the desired bandwidth values for a given vowel.


                     Fig. 8
                      shows variation in the formant bandwidths against variation in the glottal boundary reflection coefficient 
                        
                           
                              r
                              G
                           
                        
                      as a control parameter. The variation in the formant bandwidths has been studied for the glottal reflection coefficient varying from 0.9 to 1.0 when other parameters are kept constant. For vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/, all the bandwidths are approximately linearly decreasing with the glottal reflection coefficient with different slopes as shown in Fig. 8(a)–(c). For the vowels /a/, /e/ and /o/, the ranges of the bandwidths are 35Hz to 189Hz, 28Hz to 120Hz and 23Hz to 174Hz at r
                     
                        G
                     
                     =0.9, respectively, while for r
                     
                        G
                     
                     =1.0, these are 7Hz to 54Hz, 12Hz to 48Hz and 4Hz to 78Hz, respectively. From this figure, it may be observed that the ranges of the bandwidths of the glottal reflection coefficient are smaller than those of the wall boundary reflection coefficient. This indicates that wall reflection coefficient has dominant role in the bandwidth tuning of the current model.

The above investigation shows that the two reflection coefficients may successfully be employed for the bandwidth tuning in the current model. Further, the current model has more control on bandwidth tuning because of its two control parameters than a 1D model which has only one parameter for this purpose.

Here, we validate the ability of the proposed model to generate dynamic changes in the vocal tract during speech production. The dynamic change in the area function during transition between two vowels is obtained by linear interpolation. Fig. 9
                      describes typical patterns of transition for various combinations of vowels.


                     Fig. 9(a)–(c) shows transition of first eight formant frequency patterns from vowel /a/ to /i/, /a/ to /o/ and /u/ to /i/, respectively. In all the cases, the transition patterns between their respective formant frequencies are quite smooth and without any abrupt change or discontinuity. Some of the formant frequency patterns have their upward transitions while others have downward transitions.

Now we compare computational efficiency of our proposed model with those of the standard 1D and 2D waveguides. For the computation of a standard 2D waveguide, we used impulse response of length 1000 samples. Table 7
                      gives elapsed time taken by all the three models on a P-IV computer with 2.8GHz processor, 512MB ram and Visual C++ 6.0 as a programming language, for all the vowels considered in the present work. Second, third and fourth columns of the table show actual elapsed times of 1D, current and standard 2D waveguide respectively while fifth, sixth and seventh columns respectively give their values normalized relative to the elapsed time of a 1D waveguide. We note from the table that the current model is highly efficient than the standard 2D waveguide model. We have also carried out the complexity analysis of the algorithms used in 1D, 2D and current models with big-O notation. The optimal algorithms are constructed in these models. The algorithmic complexity of both the 1D and present models is same and is 
                        
                           O
                           (

                      while that of a 2D model is

                           )
                           .
                        
                      Evidently the algorithmic complexity of a 2D model is worse than that of either of the other two models.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a new approach has been presented for the modeling of the vocal tract. The vocal tract has been decomposed into a number of convergent and divergent ducts. A serial combination of these two types of ducts constitutes the vocal tract. The divergent duct has been modeled by splitting the volume velocity into axial and radial components which behaves as a 2D-featured 1D waveguide. However the convergent duct has been simply modeled by the standard 1D waveguide. A new type of pole-zero transfer function has been obtained by combining the above-mentioned separate models of the convergent and divergent ducts. It results in a 2D-featured waveguide that has been found to be in good comparison with a standard 2D waveguide model in generating formant patterns of the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ while it is much more efficient than it. Rather its efficiency is comparable to that of a 1D waveguide. The model has two control parameters, the wall and glottal reflection coefficient, that can be effectively employed for bandwidth tuning. This is similar to the way in which bandwidth tuning is achieved in the vocal tract model with tract wall losses by altering reflection coefficients. The proposed model has shown the ability to generate smooth dynamic changes in the vocal tract during speech production. The accuracy has been achieved by considering the splitting of volume velocity into axial and transverse components within the larger cylinder of the divergent duct and efficiency has been gained because of being able to find the transfer function in the zero-pole form that eliminates numerical computation on 2D mesh.
