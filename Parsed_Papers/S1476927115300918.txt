                  Glucokinase (GK) plays a critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the human liver and pancreas. In the liver, the activity of GK is modulated by the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) which functions as a competitive inhibitor of glucose to bind to GK. Moreover, the inhibitory intensity of GKRP–GK is suppressed by fructose 1-phosphate (F1P), and reinforced by fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). Here, we employed a series of computational techniques to explore the interactions of fructose phosphates with GKRP. Calculation results reveal that F1P and F6P can bind to the same active site of GKRP with different binding modes, and electrostatic interaction provides a major driving force for the ligand binding. The presence of fructose phosphate severely influences the motions of protein and the conformational space, and the structural change of sugar phosphate influences its interactions with GKRP, leading to a large conformational rearrangement of loop2 in the SIS2 domain. In particular, the binding of F6P to GKRP facilitates the protruding loop2 contacting with GK to form the stable GK–GKRP complex. The conserved residues 179–184 of GKRP play a major role in the binding of phosphate group and maintaining the stability of GKRP. These results may provide deep insight into the regulatory mechanism of GKRP to the activity of GK.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Glucokinase (GK) is a dominant glucose sensor for plasma glucose levels, which phosphorylates glucose and triggers its utilization and metabolism in human body (Matschinsky 1990; de la Iglesia et al., 2000). GK expressed in the liver parenchymal cells and the pancreatic β-cells responds to the changes of the blood glucose concentration, and is responsible for modulating the hepatic glucose metabolism and pancreatic insulin secretion (Agius 2008; Slosberg et al., 2001). Dysfunction or mutations of GK can cause hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (Heredia et al., 2006). Accordingly, GK plays an essential role in controlling blood glucose homeostasis in both liver and pancreas (Kamata et al., 2006).

In the liver, besides its substrate glucose, the activity of GK is also acutely regulated by the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) in a competitive manner with respect to glucose (van Schaftingen et al., 1994; de la Iglesia et al., 1999). At low glucose level, GK binds to GKRP and forms an inactive complex which is recruited in the hepatocyte nucleus. Conversely, when glucose level rises, GK dissociates from GKRP and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to participate in glycogen metabolism and facilitate glucose uptake and conversion (Liu et al., 2012). In mammals, glucose itself likely affects the dissociation of GK–GKRP complex. Additionally, different fructose phosphates, such as fructose 6-phospate (F6P) and fructose 1-phospate (F1P), could play a critical role in the dissociation of GK–GKRP complex. It could be shown that the binding of F6P–GKRP increases the affinity of GKRP–GK, thus F6P promotes the formation of the inactive GK–GKRP complex, while the binding of F1P or its analogues to GKRP destabilizes the inactive complex and leads to a shift of equilibrium from inactive state to active state in the cytosol (Toyoda et al., 2001; Pautsch et al., 2013). The crystal structure resolved by (Pautsch et al., 2013) showed that GKRP contains two topologically identical sugar isomerase (SIS) domains, namely SIS1 (residues 45–284) and SIS2 (residues 289–498), which are embraced by a cap region containing an α-helical C-terminal domain named the Lid domain (residues 499–606) and a N-terminal domain (residues 1–44). F1P is completely enclosed within a deeply buried cavity which locates at the junction between the SIS1 and the N-terminal domains, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . The GK–GKRP complex structure also reveals that a protruding loop of GKRP spanning residues 462–470 forms van der Waals contacts with a hydrophobic cleft on GK, and the contacts are enhanced by a H-bond between the backbone carbonyl of Leu464 from GKRP and the side chain of Lys143 from GK. Coulombic interactions are observed involving Arg301 and Arg297 from GKRP. Additionally, a smaller hydrophobic interaction exists in Val441 and Gly442 from GKRP (Supporting information Fig. S1) (Beck and Miller, 2013). It can be seen that the key residues which contact with GK belong to the SIS2 domain of GKRP, and they are important for maintaining the stability of the GK–GKRP complex.

Allosteric activators are able to stimulate the activity of GK and decrease blood glucose level, thereby they have been intensively investigated as potential drugs for type 2 diabetes both in preclinical and clinical phases (Grimsby et al., 2003; Matschinsky, 2009). However, owing to the central role of GK and GKRP in glucose homeostasis, many efforts are made to explore the novel drugs directly targeting the GK–GKRP complex for treating type 2 diabetes. More recently, disrupting the GK–GKRP complex has emerged as an orthogonal strategy for increasing the activity and level of GK in the cytosol (Pfefferkorn, 2013). Although this is a promising conception, the current knowledge about the influence of fructose phosphate on the stability of the GK–GKRP complex is still very limited. Therefore, to understand the regulatory mechanism of the fructose phosphate-dependent GKRP–GK, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been employed to investigate the interactions of GKRP with different fructose phosphates and the structural changes of the interaction interface from the GK–GKRP complex.

@&#METHODS@&#

The crystal structure of human GKRP in complex with F1P (GKRP-F1P) was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org). The PDB code is 4BB9 and the resolution is 1.47Å (Pautsch et al., 2013). This crystal structure was −68 in crystal structure were interpolated using the program modeller v9.11 (Eswar et al., 2006; Marti-Renom et al., 2000; Sali and Blundell, 1993) based on the template of 4LC9 (Beck and Miller, 2013), and the terminal residues (1–5 and 607–633) were not added due to their location in the terminus and distant from the binding site. Because the rat GKRP (PDB code 4LC9) (Beck and Miller, 2013) and the human GKRP (PDB code 4BB9) share 89% sequence identity and possess similar structures (the RMSD of backbones between two crystal structures is only 0.88Å except for N-terminus). Furthermore, the RMSD between the completed model and the human crystal structure is 0.06Å (the RMSD between the model and the rat GKRP is also 0.88Å), therefore, the model is used in the present study (Supporting information Fig. S2). However, there is a little difference in sequence identity between two crystal structures. To compare the structure and interactions of GKRP bound different fructose phosphate, the human GKRP-F6P complex was modeled by docking F6P into the active site of GKRP (PDB code 4BB9) (Pautsch et al., 2013). The human apo-GKRP initial structure was also taken from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB code 4BBA), but phosphate was deleted from the crystal structure, and the missing residues 63-67 were also added using the program modeller v9.11 (Eswar et al., 2006; Marti-Renom et al., 2000; Sali and Blundell, 1993).

All the docking calculations were performed with the program AUTODOCK version 4.2 (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998). Before docking, the protein was firstly treated by adding polar hydrogen atoms and assigning Kollman United Atoms Charges. Subsequently, the protein was kept rigid while the ligand was set to flexible, and the maximum number of active torsions was allowed for each ligand. A grid box was set to 60×60×60 points with a grid spacing of 0.375Å centered on the position of the active site (enclosed Thr104, Ser174, Thr347, His363, Asn368, Lys509 and Arg513) of GKRP. 50 independent docking runs were performed for each ligand. Each docking run was conducted with a population of 150 individuals based on their Lamarckian genic algorithm and empirical free energy function. The parameters for docking were set as follows: the maximum numbers of energy evaluation and generations were 25 million and 27,000. The rate of gene mutation and crossover was set to 0.02 and 0.8, respectively. The pseudo Solis & Wets method was applied for local search using a maximum number of 300 iterations. The docking conformations for each ligand were clustered according to the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.0Å (Baskaran et al., 2012; Shinde et al., 2014). The preferable conformation with the least binding energy in the most-members conformational cluster was selected to serve as the initial structure for MD simulations.

The crystal structures and the docking conformation of GKRP in the absence and presence of fructose phosphates were used as the initial structures for the MD simulations, and they are listed in Table 1
                        . The selected structures were placed in a center of 9.6×9.6×9.6nm3
                        cubic periodic box extending 1.0nm outside the protein on all sides, and solvated with simple point charge (SPC) waters (Berendsen et al., 1981). Na+ counterions were added to satisfy the system electroneutrality condition. As a consequence, each system contains about 86,000 atoms (Table 1). Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method (Darden et al., 1993; Essmann et al., 1995) with a 1.0nm cutoff, and short-range of repulsive and attractive interactions applied the Lennard–Jones potential with a 1.0nm cutoff. All bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the linear constraint solver (LINCS) (Hess et al., 1997) algorithm with a 2fs time step. The cutoff of van der Waals interactions was set to 1.4nm. The protein and other small molecules as well as ions were divided into two groups which were separately coupled to temperature at 300K and pressure at 1.0bar.

Three independent MD simulations were performed with the GROMACS_4.0.7 software (van der Spoel et al., 2005a,b). The GKRP topology was generated based on the united-atom GROMOS96 53a6 force field (Oostenbrink et al., 2004) and the topology files of F1P and F6P were obtained using PRODRG server (Schüttelkopf and van Aalten, 2004). The ionizable residues histidine were set to deprotonated state according to the experimental conditions and the pKa values which were predicted by the PROPKA 3.0 program (Olsson et al., 2011), and the other residues of GKRP were assigned the standard protonation state with the pdb2gmx module by default. Each system was firstly energy-minimized using the steepest-descent method for 50,000 steps. Subsequently, the system was equilibrated for 100ps in constant volume (NVT) and constant pressure (NPT) ensembles, respectively. During this period, GKRP was restrained harmonically using a force constant of 1000kJmol−1
                        nm−2, while fructose phosphates, Na+ and water molecules were relaxed to equilibrate. Finally, each system was subjected to 100ns MD simulations, and the data were saved at an interval of 10ps for further analysis (Natarajan and Senapati, 2013; Doghaei et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015).

Essential dynamics (ED) analysis is also termed principle component analysis (PCA), and it uses the diagonalization of the covariance matrix of Cartesian coordinates of Cα atoms, and calculates a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to study the largely concerted motions (Amadei et al., 1993). The eigenvectors with large eigenvalues are essential for revealing the significant motions of protein. The principle of ED analysis has been described in detail elsewhere (van Aalten et al., 1995a,b).

The root mean square inner product (RMSIP) is calculated to measure the dynamic similarity between subspaces in different systems (van Aalten et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 2010), which is defined by their basis vectors (Amadei et al., 1999):

                         are the ith and jth eigenvectors from the different systems to be compared, and D is the number of eigenvectors for consideration. The RMSIP value of 1 represents the two sets of eigenvectors to be identical, whereas 0 reflects completely orthogonal of them (Amadei et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2010; Papaleo et al., 2009). In the present study, the RMSIP is calculated using the first 10 eigenvectors, and all the molecular figures were generated using Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).

The binding free energies of GKRP with F1P or F6P were obtained by using molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM_PBSA) approach (Homeyer and Gohlke, 2012) which is one of the most widely used methods to calculate the binding free energy of biomolecular complexes. The theory of MM_PBSA approach has been described in detail elsewhere (Homeyer and Gohlke, 2012; Kumari et al., 2014). 20 snapshots for each system were extracted from the MD trajectories for the calculations using g_mmpbsa script (Kumari et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2001). The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) nonpolar model was used according to the equation as follows:

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Molecular docking was conducted to obtain the structures of fructose phosphate binding to GKRP, and the docking results were analyzed to study the binding modes of F1P and F6P with GKRP. The best conformation with least binding free energy from a group of possible conformations (19 for F1P and 20 for F6P) was selected for the study, and the docking conformations are given in Fig. 2
                        .


                        Fig. 2A shows the preferable conformation of F1P with the smallest binding free energy of −8.07kcalmol−1 (Table 2
                        ). F1P exhibits the strongest interactions with the residues to form 16H-bonds, including three H-bonds with Thr109 and Ser258, and four H-bonds with Lys514. Fig. 2B gives the preferable conformation of F6P with the smallest binding free energy of −7.28kcalmol−1. F6P totally forms 15H-bonds with residues, including two H-bonds with Thr109 and Glu348, three H-bonds with Ser258, and four H-bonds interactions with Lys514. It is obvious that F1P and F6P share the same active site of GKRP albeit they show a little difference in the binding mode, and the residues Thr109, Ser258 and Lys514 play an essential role in the binding of fructose phosphate.

To compare the binding modes of ligands in the active sites, a superposition of the docking conformations of F1P and F6P as well as the crystal structure of F1P is also given in Fig. 2C and D. It displays that five-membered ring of F6P is almost perpendicular to the six-membered ring of F1P, however, three fructose phosphates locate in the same active site, especially the position of phosphate group is almost identical. Although the docking conformation and the crystal structure of F1P are slightly different, their binding modes are almost consistent. This result is consistent with the experimental findings by (Pautsch et al., 2013). Accordingly, although the structural changes of fructose phosphate lead to the different binding modes, three ligands locate in the same active sites. These results show that F1P and F6P can bind to the same active site of GKRP, whereas their binding modes are different due to their structural changes.

We have performed three independent MD simulations to obtain the dynamic features of GKRP. The total energy and temperature are calculated for three systems (Supporting information Fig. S3A and S3B), and they fluctuate around the average energy at 300K, suggesting that each system have reached convergence. The root mean square deviations (RMSD) of backbone atoms of GKRP relative to the energy-minimized structure are given in Fig. 3
                        A. As Fig. 3A shows, the RMSDs of GKRP-F1P are higher than those of GKRP-F6P and apo-GKRP, indicating that the structure of GKRP bound F1P is more stable than other two systems, and the structural alteration of fructose phosphate has obvious effect on the structure of GKRP. Analysis of the radius of gyration (Rg) of GKRP in three different states (Supporting information Fig. S3C) displays that Rg of GKRP-F1P and apo-GKRP have no significant change after 20ns, whereas, Rg of GKRP-F6P is close to that of GKRP-F1P before 60ns, after then it decreases and stabilizes at 2.37nm after 70ns. This clearly shows that the structure of GKRP has no taken place any aberrant change like unfolding of protein in the absence and presence of F1P, but the structure of GKRP-F6P changes slightly owing to the structural change of sugar phosphate.

The flexibility of the residue is evaluated by root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) in Fig. 3B. It is noteworthy that the flexibility of GKRP during three MD simulations are larger than that of the crystal structure, however, the residues with high RMSF values are still consistent with those of the crystal structure. In particular, the residues (12–27, 36–44, 122–132 and 544–556) with high RMSF values exhibit distinct difference in flexibility for F1P- and F6P-bound states, indicating that the structural change of sugar phosphate influences on the interactions between fructose phosphate and GKRP. In addition, the residues (61–73, 235–240, 281–288, 375–386, 442–452 and 576–606) also show the high flexibility. These high flexible regions mainly locate in the linker and loop regions of the protein except for the terminus. Taken together, GKRP-F6P exhibits higher RMSF values than other two systems, suggesting that the binding of F6P results in the higher flexibility of GKRP, which is accordance with the results of RMSD and Rg as mentioned above.

ED analysis was conducted to reveal the biological important motions. The eigenvalues with large values and their contributions to the overall motions of the protein are shown in Fig. 4
                        A. It shows that a small number of eigenvectors provide most contributions to the overall motions, and the inset displays that the contributions of the first 10 eigenvectors account for ∼70% for F1P- and F6P-bound states, and about ∼60% for apo-GKRP, especially, the first eigenvector contributes significantly to the overall motions for ∼30%. Accordingly, they are used to evaluate the similarities and motions of the protein. The RMSIP values are 0.4879 between GKRP-F1P and GKRP-F6P, 0.5584 between GKRP-F1P and apo-GKRP, and 0.5235 between GKRP-F6P and apo-GKRP, respectively. These values reveal that the degrees of the protein dynamics similarities for three systems are very low, particularly between GKRP-F1P and GKRP-F6P, thus the structural alteration of fructose phosphate greatly affects the protein motions, which is also demonstrated by the traces of covariance matrix with their values being 41.70, 41.81 and 29.97 for GKRP-F1P, GKRP-F6P and apo-GKRP, respectively.

Two-dimensional projections onto the first two eigenvectors are given in Fig. 4B to compare regions sampled by the essential motions. It is clear that there are notable differences in fluctuations for three states, especially a distinct change of conformational space occurs in apo-GKRP, whereas a partial overlap is observed among three states. This indicates that the conformational distributions of protein are influenced by fructose phosphates. Although the orientation of conformational space of GKRP-F1P is similar to that of GKRP-F6P, only a small overlap in the conformational space is observed, which suggests that the structural change of sugar phosphate also severely affects the conformational distribution of protein.

The protein motion can be better explained by visualizing the superposition of 10 frames from an eigenvector (Fig. 5
                        ). The superposition is drawn from the backbone structures which were extracted 10 frames along eigenvector 1 and 2, respectively. Fig. 5 shows that the structures of GKRP in complex with fructose phosphates have high flexibility, whereas apo-GKRP (Fig. 5C and 5F) keeps the most stable structure corresponding to the smallest motional strength among the three systems. However, taken together, the cap region has high flexibility and motional strength, particularly in GKRP-F1P. Additionally, the motional strength of loop 2 (the residues 462–470) is also very strong. In terms of the motional direction, for GKRP-F1P, Fig. 5A shows the cap region moves downward to close to the SIS2, moreover, a rotating motion between the region and SIS1 as well as SIS2 in Fig. 5D is observed, which facilitates GKRP closing to envelope F1P in the binding site. For GKRP-F6P, the significant motion is that the cap region and SIS2 move apart each other in Fig. 5B, and a twisting motion in Fig. 5E helps GKRP open to bind F6P. Therefore, the presence and structural change of fructose phosphate seriously affect the motional modes and strength of GKRP.

The binding free energy calculations were carried out using MM_PBSA method (Homeyer and Gohlke, 2012), and the corresponding results were summarized in Table 3
                        . The obtained binding energies are −112.742 and −72.930kcalmol−1 for F1P and F6P, respectively. Wherein, the electrostatic energies are −245.844 and −78.459kcalmol−1 for F1P and F6P, however, the polar solvation energies are 155.692 and 32.027kcalmol−1, respectively. It is obvious that the binding energy of F1P is ∼40kcalmol−1 lower than that of F6P. However, for both ligands, the major driving force of binding is contributed by electrostatic interaction, and polar solvation interaction provides negative contribution. Taken together, although F1P and F6P have different structures, the electrostatic interaction provides the major driving force for the binding of ligand, whereas, the polar solvation interaction is unfavorable for the binding process.

Molecular dynamics analysis was performed to investigate the conformational changes of GKRP upon binding fructose phosphates, especially the structural changes of the SIS2 domain interacting with GK. H-bond arrangement in average structure from MD simulations is shown in Fig. 6
                        . Fig. 6A describes that F1P forms H-bonds with the residues 179–184 and Lys514 through phosphate group, in particular, Ser183 plays an essential role in the binding of F1P owing to forming three H-bonds with phosphate group, whereas, the six-membered ring of F1P dose not form any H-bond, which is distinctly different from the docking results in Fig. 2A. Fig. 6B displays that F6P also forms H-bonds with the residues 179–184 through phosphate group, which is consistent with that of F1P. However, three hydroxyls in the five-membered ring of F6P form one H-bond with Thr109, Ser110 and Asn512, respectively. Although these three residues also contacts with F6P in the docking conformation in Fig. 2B, the contacting atoms of F6P in Fig. 6B have changed. The distance profile of some important H-bonds is given in Fig. 7
                        . Fig. 7A shows that the H-bond distances are almost stable after 25ns. Although a deviation in the H-bond distances of GKRP-F1P from 55 to 70ns was observed, and it was transient, thus we ignore the influence of the deviation. We have analyzed the number of H-bonds during the MD simulations (Supporting information Fig. S4), and the result shows the number of H-bonds of GKRP-F1P is mainly stabilized at 8 from 40ns, and that of GKRP-F6P is almost maintained at 9 during the entire MD simulations. The average structures of GKRP-F1P from 55 to 70 and 80 to 100ns MD simulations were superposed, and no notable difference is observed in the binding site of the average structure. (Supporting information Fig. S5). Accordingly, the influence of the deviation has not been taken into account. From Fig. 7A it can be seen that Ser183 forms the strongest H-bond with O3P among these H-bonds, and the other H-bonds also stabilize at 0.3nm or so after 25ns except for the deviation. In Fig. 7B, there are significant fluctuations in the H-bond distance before 60ns, which is caused by the formation of new H-bonds between the five-membered ring and the surrounding residues, then the distances are always stable at 0.3nm. Overall, the residues 179–184 play an important role in the binding of phosphate group and maintaining of the stability of the complex, and these residues belongs to a conserved segment of GKRP spanning Leu181-Gly188, which was previously identified as an important GK recognition element (Baltrusch et al., 2001). The RMSD of 0.382Å generated from the alignment of the segment Ser179-Gly188 also shows that the segment overlaps each other well, suggesting that the structure of this segment is very stable and hardly affected by the binding of fructose phosphate (Supporting information Fig. S6). Although the segment is distant from the contacting interface of the GK–GKRP complex, it is in the active site and could regulate the stability of the complex through binding phosphate group to induce SIS2 to impact the interactions between GKRP and GK. Moreover, the structural change of sugar phosphate alters the binding mode and results in the conformational change of GKRP, especially SIS2, which contains the GK–GKRP interface. Thus, the structural change of the GK–GKRP interface severely affects the interactions of the GK–GKRP complex.

Alignment of GKRP bound sugar phosphates using SIS1 produces an RMSD of 2.667Å, as shown in Fig. 8
                        . On the basis of this alignment, we also analyzed the structural difference between the two structures in detail. Fig. 8A clearly displays that the residues 544–556 produce a small helix in GKRP-F1P while there is a loop with high flexibility in GKRP-F6P, and there is a displacement of 3.945Å in N-terminus. Furthermore, the position of a small helix of the residues 30–44 in GKRP-F1P is obviously different from that of GKRP-F6P. The inset also shows that the five-membered ring of F6P is embedded deeper than the six-membered ring of F1P in the binding site albeit the position of phosphate group is almost identical. Fig. 8B indicates that helix 1 of GKRP-F1P is composed of two small helixes, whereas it contains one helix in GKRP-F6P. Meanwhile, loop2 (residues 462–470) has yielded a large displacement and structural rearrangement, which plays an important role in the formation of hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts with the hinge region of GK (Beck and Miller, 2013). Comparison of loop2 between GKRP-F1P and GKRP-F6P is given in Fig. 9
                        A, and notable differences are observed in Phe466 and Tyr468. As for GKRP-F1P, Phe465 and Phe466 locate in the same side of backbone, and Tyr468 is buried in the structure. Whereas, for GKRP-F6P, Phe465 switches to one side of backbone while Phe466 is on the other side of backbone, and Tyr468 tends to expose to the solvent. Furthermore, the backbone carbonyl group of Leu464, which forms a H-bond with Lys143 of GK from GKRP-F6P, has yielded a displacement of 7.510Å to result in the disruption of the H-bond from GKRP-F1P. The RMSF profile of the residues 462–470 is given in Fig. 9B, which also indicates that the residues 462–470 with large RMSF values have high flexibility, especially the residues 465–470, furthermore, these residues have higher flexibility in GKRP-F6P system. Thus, the protruding loop2 with a large structural rearrangement reinforces the contacts between GKRP and GK. Additionally, from Fig. 8C it can be seen that, compared with GKRP-F1P, the cap region of GKRP-F6P moves downwards to embed F6P in the binding site, whereas, SIS2 also moves away from the cap region, which makes two regions move apart and weakens their contacts, conversely, reinforces the interfacial interactions between GKRP and GK. Taken together, the binding of F6P to GKRP promotes its affinity for GK and enhances the stability of the inactive GK–GKRP complex.

To better understanding the movement of GKRP in three states, the average structures are superposed together in Fig. 10
                        . Fig. 10A and B display the superposition of apo-GKRP and GKRP-F1P. Compared with apo-GKRP, a significant motion of GKRP-F1P is the closing motion. Additionally, it is accompanied with a rotating motion. Two motions lead the cap region and SIS2 to move close to each other. In contrast, besides a twisting motion, the opening motion is the main motional mode of GKRP-F6P (Fig. 10C and D), which makes the cap region and SIS2 move apart. For clearly viewing the structural difference, three average structures are overlapped together (Supporting information Fig. S7), which reveals that the motional modes of the protein are accordance with those mentioned above. This is in agreement with the experimental result and verified by the distance of a backbone H-bond in two domains. Beck et al. have reported that the H-bond between His351 and Arg509 was formed in the GKRP-F1P complex, but it was disrupted in the GKRP-F6P complex (Beck and Miller, 2013). The distances of this H-bond in the three states are calculated during 100ns MD simulations, which are given in Fig. 11
                        . It is clear that the H-bond in apo-GKRP is very stable and always keeps at 0.3nm. The H-bonding distance in GKRP-F1P is almost equal to that of apo-GKRP except for a deviation from 55 70ns. However, the distance in GKRP-F6P increases from 20ns and stabilizes at 0.55nm after 40ns. This suggests that the H-bond do exists in apo-GKRP and GKRP-F1P, but it is broken in GKRP-F6P with the movement of GKRP in the presence of F6P. These results further demonstrate that the binding of F1P promotes the cap region and the SIS2 domain to move to each other and weakens the interactions of GKRP with GK, which makes the GK–GKRP complex unstable and dissociable, whereas, the binding of F6P causes the cap region and SIS2 to move away each other, which in turn enhances the interactions between GKRP and GK to promote the formation of the inactive GK–GKRP complex.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present study, the influence of fructose phosphate on the structure and dynamics of GKRP investigated by using molecular docking, ED analysis and molecular simulations. The docking result reveals that F1P and F6P can bind to the same active site with different binding modes owing to the structural change of fructose phosphates. The residues Thr109, Ser258 and Lys514 of GKRP play a critical role in the binding of fructose phosphate. ED analysis shows that the protein motion and conformational space of GKRP are greatly influenced by the presence of fructose phosphate. For the ligand binding, the electrostatic interaction provides the major driving force, whereas, the polar solvation interaction builds negative contribution. For GKRP-F1P, the closing motion coupled with a minor rotation causes the cap region and SIS2 to move toward each other, which weakens the interfacial interactions between GKRP and GK, leading to the dissociation of the GK–GKRP complex. For GKRP-F6P, an opening motion makes the cap region and SIS2 to move away, and a twisting motion speeds the two regions moving apart, which reversely enhances the interfacial contacts between GKRP and GK and promote the formation of the inactive GK–GKRP complex. This result is further demonstrated by the MD simulations. Besides, the MD simulations verify that the conserved residues 179–184 of GKRP play an essential role in the binding of phosphate group and maintaining the stability of the complex. The structural alteration of sugar phosphate changes the interactions between ligand and GKRP. As a result, notable differences in the structure and the protein motion of GKRP are observed between GKRP-F1P and GKRP-F6P. Accordingly, a series of changes of GKRP resulted from the binding of fructose phosphate impacts the interactions of the GK–GKRP complex, which may offers insight into the regulatory mechanism of GKRP-mediated modulating on GK.
