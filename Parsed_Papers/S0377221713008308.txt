                  The reformulation–linearization technique (RLT), introduced in [Sherali, H. D., Adams. W. P. (1990). A hierarchy of relaxations between the continuous and convex hull representations for zero-one programming problems. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics 3(3), 411–430], provides a way to compute a hierarchy of linear programming bounds on the optimal values of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper we show that, in the presence of suitable algebraic symmetry in the original problem data, it is sometimes possible to compute level two RLT bounds with additional linear matrix inequality constraints. As an illustration of our methodology, we compute the best-known bounds for certain graph partitioning problems on strongly regular graphs.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The term reformulation–linearization technique (RLT) was coined by Sherali and Adams in the seminal paper (Sherali & Adams, 1990) (see also Sherali & Adams, 1994). Thus a hierarchy of linear programming relaxations was introduced, based on a linearization technique studied earlier by these authors in Adams and Sherali (1986) (see also Adams & Sherali, 1990); the subsequent development of the RLT-technique is contained in their monograph (Sherali & Adams, 1999).

The main idea is the following: if there are two valid linear inequalities for a given set

                     An inequality of this type is known as a first-level RLT cut in the variables x and X. This process may be repeated to obtain level two RLT cuts, etc. This type of method has become known as a lift-and-project strategy: the ‘lifting’ refers to the addition of new variables, and the ‘projection’ to projecting the optimal values of the new variables to a feasible point in

                      of the original problem; see Laurent (2003) for a comparison of the RLT with related schemes.

In this paper we will study the RLT for two specific problems, namely the standard quadratic program and the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The first level RLT formulation of the QAP was previously studied in Adams and Johnson (1994) and Johnson (1992). Adams, Guignard, Hahn, and Hightower (2007) considered the second level RLT formulation of the QAP. Numerical results presented in Adams et al. (2007) show that the second level RLT relaxation of the QAP often provides significantly better bounds than the first level RLT relaxation, but that it is computationally very expensive to solve. Recently, the third level RLT relaxation of the QAP was also investigated in Hahn, Zhu, Guignard, Hightower, and Saltzman (2012). The numerical results show that this relaxation empirically provides tight bounds for medium-sized instances (where it is still possible to solve the third level relaxation).

In this paper, we show how one may solve the second level RLT relaxation with additional semidefinite programming (SDP) constraints in the presence of suitable algebraic symmetry in the problem data. As a result we are able to compute the best known bounds for certain graph partitioning problems involving strongly regular graphs. (These graph partitioning problems have QAP reformulations.) Our results are in the spirit of the recent papers (de Klerk & Sotirov, 2010; de Klerk & Sotirov, 2012; Gijswijt, Mittelmann, & Schrijver, 2012; Laurent, 2007; Schrijver, 2005) where improved semidefinite programming bounds were obtained for various combinatorial problems by exploiting algebraic symmetry. Our results may also be seen as an extension of recent results by Ostrowski (2012), who studied symmetry in (pure) linear programming RLT relaxations of symmetric binary integer programs.

We start by describing RLT relaxations of the standard quadratic optimization problem in Section 2, and of the QAP in Section 3. In these sections we also present new results on how the resulting RLT relaxations relate to known relaxations from the literature. This is followed by background material on exploiting algebraic symmetry in the data of SDP problems in Section 4. We apply this methodology to the standard quadratic programming problem in Section 5, and to the QAP in Section 6. Finally, we present numerical results to illustrate the complete approach in Section 7. Throughout, the main (computational) focus is on the QAP, and our treatment of the standard quadratic program serves as a relatively easy introduction to the more complicated analysis of the QAP.

We will use the notation from Sherali and Adams (1999, Section 7.1), (see also (Sherali & Tuncbilek, 1992) for RLT in the context of continuous polynomial programs):

                      is a “linearization operator” that maps a monomial to a new variable. This operator may be extended to a linear map from general polynomials to linear ones by simply replacing each monomial by its linearization.

                     −2) coordinates has to be positive semidefinite. Therefore it is natural to define (stQP
                     
                        SDP+RLT−t
                     ) by adding these linear matrix inequality constraints to the level t RLT relaxation of (stQP).

                        Povh and Rendl (2009) studied a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for the QAP problem (the resulting lower bound coincides with an earlier bound studied in Zhao, Karisch, Rendl, & Wolkowicz (1998)). We will show that this relaxation may be viewed as a first level RLT relaxation of the QAP with positive semidefiniteness constraints added.

In stating and analyzing this SDP relaxation, we will need several properties of the Kronecker product. Recall that the Kronecker product A

We may use Theorem 3 to show that the Povh–Rendl relaxation (QAP
                        
                           SDP

                           RLT−1) with positive semidefiniteness constraints added.

Since the level 2 RLT bound is stronger that the level 1 bound, we have the following corollary of Theorem 4.
                           Corollary 5
                           
                              The bound from (QAP
                              
                                 SDP+RLT−2
                              
                              ) is at least as tight as the Povh–Rendl bound (QAP
                              
                                 SDP
                              
                              ).
                           

In what follows we will show how the RLT relaxations may be reduced in size if the data of the underlying optimization problem exhibits suitable algebraic symmetry. This approach is called symmetry-induced reduction, or symmetry reduction, for short. We will review some basic concepts first.

In practice, this means that we may often replace the matrices M
                     
                        i
                      by block diagonal matrices ϕ(M
                     
                        i
                     ) with block sizes much smaller than the size of M
                     
                        i
                     . This block-diagonal structure may in turn be exploited by interior point solvers.

The following example illustrates the definitions above, and will be used later on.

                           is also optimal.
                        

The result follows immediately from the fact that the optimal set of (QAP
                           
                              SDP+RLT−2) is convex. □

The next result is similar to Lemma 11, and its proof is therefore omitted.

The next lemma is similar to Lemma 12, and shows that – under suitable symmetry assumptions – we may write all the Z
                     [ij] in terms of Z
                     [11]. Once again, we omit the proof, since it is similar to that of Lemma 12.

In this section we will show how the symmetry reduction works for some specific (stQP) and (QAP) problems.

We will first consider maximum stable set problems on symmetric graphs formulated as (stQP) problems, followed by QAP formulations of certain graph partition problems on symmetric graphs.

An important application of (stQP) is the maximum stable set problem in combinatorial optimization. Recall that a stable set of a graph G
                        =(V,
                        E) is a subset of V′⊂
                        V such that no two vertices in V′ are adjacent. The stability number α(G) of G is the cardinality of a maximum stable set in G. By the Motzkin–Straus theorem (Motzkin & Straus, 1965), one has

A similar results holds for the (stQP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound, since it coincides with the bound p
                        (1), defined in (6), if Q
                        =
                        A
                        +
                        I. The reciprocal of this bound was first studied by de Klerk and Pasechnik (2002), and was called ϑ
                        (1) there. To be precise:

The proof is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.□

Consider now the special case where G is the Hamming graph H
                           
                              n,d
                            defined as follows: the vertex set is {0,1}
                              n
                            (viewed as binary words of length n), and two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is less than d. The stability number of H
                           
                              n,d
                            is mostly denoted by A(n,
                           d), and is of fundamental importance in coding theory. Possibly the most famous upper bound on A(n,
                           d) is the linear programming bound of Delsarte (1972), which coincides with ϑ′(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ), as was shown by Schrijver (1979). By Theorem 22, the reciprocal of the (stQP
                           
                              SDP+RLT−1) bound therefore also coincides with the Delsarte bound. Consequently, the reciprocal of the (stQP
                           
                              SDP+RLT−2) bound (i.e. the ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) bound) is at least as strong as the Delsarte bound (and sometimes stronger; cf Table 1
                           ).

Stronger semidefinite programming bounds were introduced by Schrijver (2005), and this has led to further improvements in Gijswijt et al. (2012) and Laurent (2007).

                           , and bases for these algebras are known in closed form; see e.g., Chapter 3 in Gijswijt (2005). Moreover, the Wedderburn decompositions of both algebras are also known in closed form; see (Gijswijt, 2005; Schrijver, 2005) for details.

We were therefore able to compute the bound (stQP
                           
                              SDP+RLT−2) for problem (19) for the graph H
                           
                              n,d
                           , and the reciprocal of the bound (=
                           ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           )) is shown in Table 1 for some values of (n,
                           d). Our purpose was to show the difference between the bounds obtained by level 1 RLT cuts (the Delsarte bound) and level 2 RLT cuts (the ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) bound). Note that a few values of ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) were already reported in the paper (Gvozdenović & Laurent, 2007), namely (n,
                           d)∈{(17,4), (17,6), (17,8)}, but no details were given there on the symmetry reduction. Our goal here is therefore to compare the bounds for more (and larger) values of (n,
                           d), and also to give details on the symmetry reduction via Theorem 14.

Computation was done on a Dell Precision T7500 workstation with 32GB of RAM memory, using the semidefinite programming solver SDPA-GMP (Nakata, 2010).

The column A(n,
                           d) in Table 1 contains the best known upper and lower bounds on A(n,
                           d) as taken from the table maintained by Andries Brouwer at http://www.win.tue.nl/aeb/codes/binary-1.html for n
                           ⩽28. This table is an update of the table published in Best, Brouwer, MacWilliams, Odlyzko, and Sloane (1978); see also (Agrell, Vardy, & Zeger, 2001). For n
                           >28 the bounds were taken from MacWilliams and Sloane (1977, Appendix A).

Note that the ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) bound is stronger than the Delsarte bound (Delsarte, 1972) for all instances in the table where the Delsarte bound is not tight, but not as strong as the best known bound for n
                           ⩽27. For the values (n,
                           d)∈{(28,12), (30,8), (30,12), (30,14)}, ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) coincides with the strongest known bound. (The sources of the strongest bounds for these cases are given in Agrell et al. (2001).) Unfortunately, we were not able to find values of (n,
                           d) where ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) improves on the best known upper bound on A(n,
                           d).

Finally, we wish to emphasize that computing ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) is intractable without the use of symmetry reduction for all but the smallest values of n and d. This is because the number of vertices in the Hamming graph H(n,
                           d) equals 2
                              n
                           , and the size of the SDP matrix variables in the original formulation of ϑ
                           (1)(H
                           
                              n,d
                           ) would therefore be of the order 22n
                           .

In this section we will present results for maximum and minimum k-section problems on graphs, formulated as QAPs.

Recall that the maximum (resp.minimum) k-section problem, for a graph G
                        =(V,
                        E) on n
                        =∣V∣ vertices and with adjacency matrix A, is to partition the vertices V into k sets of equal cardinality m
                        ≔
                        n/k, such that the number of edges between partitions is a maximum (resp.minimum).

The QAP reformulation of these problems works as follows: consider the adjacency matrix, say B, of K
                        
                           m,…,m
                         (with any fixed labeling of the vertices), e.g.
                           
                              (21)

                                 -

                                 )
                                 ⊗

                                       m

If P is a permutation matrix that defines a re-labeling of the vertices, then the adjacency matrix after re-labeling is P

The QAP reformulation of max k-section is therefore given by:

                                 ,
                              
                           
                        and min k-section is obtained by replacing ‘max’ by ‘min’.

An SDP bound for min/max k-section by Karisch and Rendl (1998) is known to coincide with the (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−1) bound considered here, as was shown in Dobre (2011); see also (Sotirov, 2012, Theorem 13). Our goal here is to improve on this bound by computing the stronger (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound.

We will consider min/max k-section problem on strongly regular graphs. Recall that the adjacency matrix A of a strongly regular graph has exactly two distinct eigenvalues associated with eigenvectors orthogonal to the all-ones vector. These eigenvalues are called the restricted eigenvalues, and are usually denoted by r
                        >0 and s
                        <0. A strongly regular graph is completely characterized by the values (n
                        =∣V∣,
                        κ,
                        r,
                        s), where κ is the valency of the graph.

For strongly regular graphs, the Karisch and Rendl (1998) bound has a closed form expression, as shown in de Klerk E., Pasechnik, Dobre C., and Sotirov, (2012). Since the closed form expression was only derived for the maximum k-section bound in de Klerk E. et al. (2012), we state the expression here for the minimum k-section bound as well. The proof is similar to that of de Klerk E. et al. (2012), Theorem 7, and is therefore omitted.

Maximum k-section problems in strongly regular graphs are of interest, since they are related to so-called Hoffman colorings and spreads of these graphs; see (Haemers & Tonchev, 1996) for details and definitions.

We first present results for the Higman–Sims graph (Higman & Sims, 1968), where

The max k-section problem on this graph was studied in de Klerk E. et al. (2012), and the best known upper bound of max 4-section was obtained there. In particular, it is known that the Higman–Sims graph has a 4-section into four components of five 5-cycles each. Thus there is a 4-section of weight 1000, but this is not known to be a maximum; for more information on this graph, see the discussion on the web page maintained by Andries Brouwer: http://www.win.tue.nl/aeb/graphs/Higman-Sims.html
                     

In Tables 2 and 3
                        
                         we compare different bounds on various max k-section and min k-section problems on the Higman–Sims graph respectively.

We computed the bound (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) for the max/min k-section of the Higman–Sims graph for several values of k. In order to do so, we used the symmetry of the Higman–Sims graph described in de Klerk E. et al. (2012). Moreover, we used the symmetry of B as described in Example 8.

Computation was done on a PC with 8GB RAM memory and an Intel(R) Core (TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 processor, using the semidefinite programming solver SeDuMi (Sturm, 1999) under Matlab 7 together with the Matlab package YALMIP (Löfberg, 2004).

The lower bounds in Table 2, and the upper bounds in Table 3 were obtained by using a iterative local search QAP heuristic.

The (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound gave improvements for max 4-section, min 20-section, and min 25-section. Note that the upper and lower bounds for min 25-section coincide, proving optimality.

Moreover, it is worth noting that the computational time required was less than a second for each instance. (The computational time for the Karisch–Rendl bound is negligible, due to its closed form expression in (23).) This shows that it is indeed possible to compute the (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound when the QAP problem has suitable symmetry.

Similar results are shown in Table 4
                        , for min/max 11-section on another strongly regular graph, namely the Cameron graph (Brouwer, 1986) with parameters (n

                        κ,

                        s)=(231,30,9,−3); see also http://www.win.tue.nl/aeb/graphs/Cameron.html for more details on this graph. The column ‘Heuristic’ gives the best heuristic solutions that were obtained with the iterative local search heuristic (i.e. the heuristic solution provides a lower bound for the maximization problem and an upper bound for minimization). For the min-11-section problem, the (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound is strictly better than the Karisch–Rendl bound (23). Once again, the computational time required to compute the (QAP
                        
                           SDP+RLT−2) bound is of the order of a second after symmetry reduction.
