                  Additive multi-attribute value models and additive utility models with discrete outcome sets are widely applied in both descriptive and normative decision analysis. Their non-parametric application allows preference inference by analyzing sets of general additive value functions compatible with the observed or elicited holistic pair-wise preference statements. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the preference inference based on a single preference statement, and sufficient conditions for the inference based on multiple preference statements. In our computational experiments all inferences could be made with these conditions. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the non-parametric analyses of general additive value models are unlikely to be useful by themselves for decision support in contexts where the decision maker preferences are elicited in the form of holistic pair-wise statements.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We consider a decision problem of (partially) ordering a set of alternatives that are deterministically evaluated in terms of n
                     >1 attributes. Preferences of the Decision Maker (DM) are assumed to be representable by an additive multi-attribute value function that is indirectly defined through holistic pair-wise judgments (i.e. alternative a is weakly preferred over alternative b, 
                        
                           a
                           ≿
                           b
                        
                     ). Note that although we consider, for compatibility with the existing literature, only multi-attribute value models, the results also apply directly to multi-attribute utility models with discrete outcome sets. The Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) methodology (Corrente, Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, in press; Corrente, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013; Greco, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2008; Greco, Kadziński, Mousseau, & Słowiński, 2011, 2012; Greco, Kadziński, & Słowiński, 2011; Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012a, Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2012b, 2012c, 2013a) enables non-parametric analyses of sets of preference models compatible with the given holistic pair-wise judgments. ROR methods supply the DM with two kinds of results: possible and necessary preference relations that express whether an alternative is weakly preferred over another one with some or all compatible preference models, respectively. ROR has been implemented initially for the non-parametric analyses of additive value models in UTAGMS (Greco et al., 2008).

The necessary and possible relations are computed in UTAGMS by solving Linear Programs (LPs). However, their computation time can be too high for practical purposes, especially in decision contexts where the problem needs to be solved repeatedly, or with larger problem sizes. Also, it has not been known what exactly can be inferred through non-parametric analyses of additive models when the DMs express preferences as holistic pair-wise statements. Answering this question is relevant for the economical sciences as a whole, because many regression models implicitly assume an axiomatic foundation in terms of value theory (also known as utility theory with riskless decisions), and as the LP based approach seems to be appropriate also for descriptive decision analysis (Graf, Vetschera, & Zhang, 2013).

In this paper, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for single preference statement inference, and sufficient conditions for multiple statement inference (Section 2). We report results of our computational experiments that measured the amount of different types of preference inferences as well as inferences that could not be made using our propositions (Section 3). The paper ends with a discussion of the propositions and the results.

We consider a multi-attribute decision problem where a finite set of alternatives M is evaluated on a set of attributes indexed with S
                     ={1,…,
                     n}. We denote the evaluation of alternative A
                     ∈
                     M on attribute i with A
                     
                        i
                     . Without loss of generality, we assume the evaluations to be cardinal and the alternatives Pareto-optimal. The DM preferences over M are representable with a value function

We performed computational experiments to assess the amount of preference inferences possible using the lemmas and theorems given in the previous section, and the amount of inferences still missing as we did not provide necessary conditions for the multiple statement case. We analyzed problems with 5 attributes, 10, 20, or 50 random Pareto-optimal alternatives and 2,4,…,40 random preference statements. They are generated in such a way that ∀A, B
                     ∈

                     A)∈
                     P). In each parameter configuration we ran the experiment 10 times to assess the effect of different problem structures. Hence, a total of 600 test instances were used to measure the amounts of:

                      presents the amount of transitive inferences as percentages of the maximums, and the percentages of impossible inferences discovered with Lemma 1. The percentages of transitive inferences increase with the amount of preference statements until reaching a saturation (with 10 alternatives this is approximately at 22 preference statements) and afterwards they decrease. With only a few preference statements the percentages of impossible inferences discovered with Lemma 1 are reasonably high, but they rapidly decrease when the number of preference statements included increase. Both of these results were expected. What is more interesting is that none of the 600 test instances contained non-transitive inferences although Examples 1 and 2 show that such instances exist. Also, there were no additional inferences discovered with the full UTAGMS LPs, i.e. all the inferences in all test instances were transitive.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The assumption of mutual preferential independence, which is required for the application of additive value models, has traditionally been considered to seldom hold in descriptive analyses of real-life decisions. This has led to the development and use of more complex models such as the multiplicative and multilinear ones. However, our computational experiments show that there usually exists a set of additive functions that can reproduce the preference information and still be compatible with the assumption of mutual preferential independence (none of the test instances contained 
                        
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 P
                              
                           
                           =
                           ∅
                        
                     ). Therefore, in non-parametric analyses of sets of preference models the choice between additive and non-additive value functions cannot be made based on holistic pair-wise preference statements alone, but additional assumptions that cannot be derived from the observations are required for choosing between the two.

For normative decision analysis (decision support), our computational experiments were representative in size of problems encountered in practice; it would be unrealistic to assume that the DM would be willing to provide more than 40 preference statements for ordering 10 or 20 alternatives. As the tests contained no instances with inferences apart from the transitivity of 
                        
                           ≿
                        
                     , our analysis might completely describe the non-parametric analyses of additive value models using holistic pair-wise preference statements. As the conditions for inference with these models (Theorems 1 and 2) are quite specific, such inferences are unlikely to be made. Therefore, such models are probably too general to be of use in normative non-parametric multiple criteria decision analysis. On one hand, this questions the practical relevance of the robust ordinal regression method UTAGMS (Greco et al., 2008) for decision support, but on the other hand our results justify the later advances for selecting a single representative value function (Greco et al., 2011; Kadziński et al., 2012a, Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013b), the rank-based analyses (Kadziński et al., 2012b, Kadziński, Greco, & Słowiński, 2013a), and the hybrid probabilistic approaches (Kadziński & Tervonen, 2013a, 2013b).

Our results are limited by three factors: (i) we were not able to prove necessary conditions for multiple-statement inference, (ii) the computational experiments were restricted in size to instances representative of real-life decision support problems, but not of revealed preference studies, and (iii) extrapolation of our results is not directly applicable to studies of revealed preferences as they often contain noise. The first limitation should be addressed in further research, and if the necessary conditions become available, the need for more extensive computational experiments stated in (ii) becomes obsolete. To provide a concrete future research problem, we conclude this paper with a conjecture that Theorem 2 contains also the necessary conditions for multiple statement inference.
