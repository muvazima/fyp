                  The stochastic variability measures the degree of uncertainty for random demand and/or price in various operations problems. Its ordering property under mean-preserving transformation allows us to study the impact of demand/price uncertainty on the optimal decisions and the associated objective values. Based on Chebyshev’s algebraic inequality, we provide a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the widely used mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping. The application to mean-preserving affine transformation rectifies an incorrect proof of an important result in the inventory literature, which has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. The application to mean-preserving truncation addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains, and the application to mean-preserving capping sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the study of a variety of operations problems in the presence of uncertainties (including demand, purchase price, and/or lead-time uncertainties), it is often of great interest to assess the impact of the degree of randomness, also known as stochastic variability. However, this could be a challenging task without an easily tractable way of ordering randomness. A useful approach commonly used in the literature is to employ a mean-preserving transformation of the random variable, which not only factors out the effect of the mean, but also parameterizes the variability of the random variable by a single scalar.

In this paper, we provide a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and then apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping. The application to mean-preserving affine transformation rectifies an incorrect proof of a fundamental result in Gerchak and Mossman (1992) that has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. The application to mean-preserving truncation addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains, and the application to mean-preserving capping sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 provides a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under mean-preserving transformations, which is our main technical results. Section 4 discusses in great detail three different applications of our general framework. The paper concludes in Section 5.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Stochastic variability plays a pivotal role in supply chain management because it directly affects the inventory policies and the associated total operational costs. Nyoman Pujawan (2004) studies the order variability in the upstream of the supply chain when the downstream uses different lot sizing rules: one to minimize the average cost per time and the other to minimize the average cost per unit. Garcia Salcedo, Ibeas Hernandez, Vilanova, and Herrera Cuartas (2013) studies a multi-echelon inventory system under both decentralized and centralized controls, and compares their impact on the demand variance amplification (the so-called bullwhip effect) from the end to the beginning of the supply chains. Both Nyoman Pujawan (2004) and Garcia Salcedo et al. (2013) use variance as the measure of stochastic variability. In general, however, variance is not a proper measure of risk (see Gerchak & Mossman (1992); an example is available on page 137 of Levy (2006)). A rigorous way to rank variability calls for theories of stochastic ordering.

The theoretical study of stochastic ordering can find its root in mathematics, and has drawn attention of researchers in operations engineering and economics. The underlying mathematical structure of stochastic ordering is driven by the concept of Majorization (Marshall, Olkin, & Arnold, 2010), which formalizes the intuitive notion that the components of a vector are more spread out than those of another vector. Many basic mathematical inequalities, including a special case of Chebyshev’s inequality, are used to characterize the Majorization. A comprehensive collection of stochastic ordering properties and their applications in operations engineering can be found in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), which dedicates its chapter 3 to variability orders. The convex order of random variables discussed in that chapter is the concept we adopt in this paper. The convex order is closely related to the stochastic dominance, which is a subject studied in economics for decision making under uncertainty (Levy, 2006). In particular, the second order stochastic dominance is equivalent to the convex order when two random variables have equal means. Most of the above-mentioned literature study general stochastic ordering properties. Marshall et al. (2010) is more akin to our paper as it studies families of scalar parameterized distributions, but it limits its attention to a few specific distributions, e.g., exponential, whereas our paper develops a general framework to parameterize stochastic variability ordering for any distribution.

The study of the mean-preserving transformation first appears in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970), which shows that a riskier (stochastically more variable) random variable can be constructed by adding a white noise of zero mean to the original random variable. However, the limitation of this mean-preserving transformation is the lack of a convenient means to assess the impact of stochastic variability. Gerchak and Mossman (1992) overcomes this limitation by constructing a mean-preserving affine transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar. It performs a mean-preserving transformation of a random variable in a linear fashion, and shows that the stochastic order of the transformed variables is monotone in the parameter. The same affine mean-preserving transformation is also used to study the value of inventory pooling in Gerchak and He (2003).

Our paper differs in that we provide a general framework, which not only covers the mean-preserving affine transformation, but also extends to other types of transformations, i.e., nonlinear transformations. These nonlinear mean-preserving transformations of random variables are commonly seen in operations applications. For example, under a scheduled ordering scheme in a supply chain (Chen & Gavirneni, 2010), the demand distribution in the upstream is transformed from the truncation of the downstream demand by a pre-agreed fixed shipment quantity. In procurement with options (Nagali et al., 2008), the purchase price distribution is transformed from the uncertain market price, with a cap on the strike price specified in the option contract. Our unified framework enables us to use a single scalar as the parameter to study the stochastic variability ordering properties of all the aforementioned mean-preserving transformations.

The general framework makes use of a generalized Chebyshev’s Algebraic Inequality (Mitrinović, Pečarić, & Fink, 1993), which is replicated in Lemma 1 below for ease of reference. Note that throughout the text, the terms increasing and decreasing should be taken in their weak sense; e.g., increasing means nondecreasing.

The mean-preserving affine transformation is defined as follows. Let X be a random variable with mean 
                           
                              μ

The mean-preserving affine transformation was first introduced by Gerchak and Mossman (1992) to provide a neat and useful tool for analyzing cardinal effects of the demand randomness on optimal inventory levels and the associated expected costs. Their key findings hinge on Lemma 2. However, their proof of this result, replicated below, is questionable.

The above argument is based on two facts: the right-hand side is increasing in 
                           
                              α
                           
                        ; in addition, it is no less than the left-hand side. Nevertheless, these two facts taken together do not imply that the left-hand side is necessarily increasing in 
                           
                              α

                        .

It is worth noting that (Gerchak & Mossman, 1992) is a well-known work in the inventory literature and attracted a great deal of attention (Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000; Iyer & Jain, 2003; Song, Yano, & Lerssrisuriya, 2000). The same mean-preserving affine transformation together with the fundamental property claimed in Lemma 2 has been adopted by others in a wide range of contexts, including outsourcing logistics (Alp, Erkip, & Gullu, 2003), pricing setting newsvendor problem (Li & Atkins, 2005), and lead-time randomness reduction (Gerchak & Parlar, 1991). Another notable application of this transformation is that it is used in Gerchak and He (2003) to establish the condition under which the benefit of risk pooling increases with the demand variability. Since Lemma 2 lays the foundation of all the aforementioned papers, it is important to supply a proper proof.

Our result in Corollary 1 can be easily used to rectify the problem in Gerchak and Mossman (1992) that has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. It is evident that the two conditions required by the corollary are satisfied by the mean-preserving affine transformation defined in Eq. (5). Hence the claim in Lemma 2.


                        Corollary 1 can also be applied to another different type of mean-preserving transformation (dubbed mean-preserving truncation) defined below.

The mean-preserving truncation can find interesting applications in inventory models dealing with inefficiency associated with supply chain decentralization. In decentralized supply chains, the upstream usually sees a magnified demand uncertainty due to the widely recognized bullwhip effect. To combat the bullwhip effect, Chen and Gavirneni (2010) analyze scheduled ordering policies for a two-stage decentralized supply chain consisting of a single supplier and multiple retailers who face uncertain end-customer demands. They consider the Scheduled Balanced Ordering Policy (SBOP) and the Scheduled Synchronized Ordering Policy (SSOP), both allowing retailers to order from the supplier freely only in one period in an m-period ordering cycle. In other periods, retailers receive fixed shipments 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        . Retailers take turns to order freely under SBOP, while under SSOP all retailers order freely in the same period. To evaluate the performance of the policies, it is crucial to examine the impact of the fixed shipment quantity

                                    T
                                 
                              
                           
                        . It then follows from Lemma 3 that, as expected from intuition, the uncertain demand faced by the supplier becomes stochastically less variable as 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         increases, enabling considerable cost savings.

Since Chen and Gavirneni (2010) is silent on the impact of the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        , we now conduct a numerical study to explore this issue. Our numerical study employs the same system parameters as those in Chen and Gavirneni (2010), and focuses on quantifying the impact of the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         on the optimal ordering decisions and total costs. Similar to Chen and Gavirneni (2010), we consider one supplier with two identical retailers; the cycle length 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              2
                           
                        ; the unit holding cost is 1 for all parties; the backlogging costs are 6 and 9 for the retailer and the supplier, respectively.


                        Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                         plot the impact of the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         on the supplier’s optimal average order-up-to level and total inventory costs with different degree of demand uncertainty. Note that the average order-up-to level is used because the supplier makes order decisions after observing the retailers’ inventory level (see Chen & Gavirneni (2010)). These two figures show that as the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         increases, the supplier’s optimal average order-up-to level and total inventory costs both decrease, which is not hard to predict based on insights from Gerchak and Mossman (1992) and our previous finding that the supplier’s demand becomes stochastically less variable as 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         increases. Notably, Fig. 3 shows that the supplier benefits more from increasing the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         when the end demand has a larger variance. Under favorable conditions, the inventory cost reduction can be as high as one-third.

On the retailer side, as the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         increases, Fig. 4
                         indicates that the retailers’ optimal order-up-to levels decrease, which is intuitive. The retailers’ total inventory cost, however, responds in a different way. In particular, it is convex in the fixed shipment quantity 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        , as illustrated in Fig. 5
                        . This is because when 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         is small, the retailers benefit from the stability of the system enabled by the fixed shipment arrangement. But when 
                           
                              δ
                           
                         grows too big, the over-commitment eventually hurts the retailers.

Our results also apply to a third type of mean-preserving transformation, termed mean-preserving capping, as defined below.

The mean-preserving capping can find important applications in procurement risk management (PRM), especially when option contracts are used. Nagali et al. (2008) reports that Hewlett–Packard (HP) obtained $425 million in costs savings cumulatively over six years by using the PRM approach. This approach hinges upon structured contracts with suppliers to manage the supply chain risks on the procurement side. At the core of the approach are two types of option contracts used to mitigate the risks posed by the volatile spot market price of components (e.g., flash memory): One is fixed price option contract and the other is discount-off-of-market price option contract.

The fixed price option contract puts a cap on the cost and has two parameters: a unit reservation cost paid in advance by HP to its supplier, and a unit execution cost 
                           
                              α
                           
                         paid later if the option is exercised after market price X realizes, i.e., if 
                           
                              x
                              ⩾
                              α
                           
                        . In this contract, HP’s exercising cost is 
                           
                              min
                              (
                              X
                              ,
                              α
                              )
                           
                         because when the market price realizes it pays 
                           
                              α
                           
                         by exercising the option if 
                           
                              x
                              ⩾
                              α
                           
                        , and x by buying from the spot market if 
                           
                              x
                              <
                              α
                           
                        . Note that 
                           
                              α
                              ⩽
                              b
                           
                         (the upper support of the market price) for the contract to be viable, otherwise it will degenerate to simply buying at spot market price.

The discount-off-of-market price option contract differs from the fixed price option contract only in the second parameter. It has a unit exercising cost ratio 
                           
                              β
                           
                        , in place of the unit execution cost 
                           
                              α
                           
                        . In this contract, HP’s exercising cost is 
                           
                              β
                              X
                           
                         when the market price realizes.

The key issue for HP to address in order to optimize its portfolio of contracts is to understand which of the above two option contracts poses smaller risks, if both contracts have the same reservation cost and the expected exercising costs. It turns out that the stochastic variability ordering property proved in Lemma 4 can be used to tell that the fixed price option contract always has less variable exercising costs than the discount-off-of-market price option contract, as shown in the following lemma.

Early papers studying the option contract (e.g., Serel, Dada, & Moskowitz (2001)) typically consider the capacity purchase decision from suppliers under demand uncertainty, but not market price uncertainty. Wu, Kleindorfer, and Zhang (2002) considers market price uncertainty, but not demand uncertainty. Seifert, Thonemann, and Hausman (2004) integrates both uncertainties and shows that with a single supplier, a mixed procurement strategy consisting of a long-term contract and spot market procurement is optimal. Fu, Lee, and Teo (2010) also incorporates both demand and market price uncertainties into the procurement problem using option contracts, but they consider multiple suppliers. Lee, Li, and Xie (2013) further extends (Fu et al., 2010) to account for the fixed procurement costs. However, all these papers study only the fixed price option contract. The discount-off-of-market price option contract that has been used by HP for PRM (Nagali et al., 2008) has not received due research attention. To fill the gap in the literature, we next study the discount-off-of-market price option contract and compare it with the fixed price option contract.

As a benchmark, the fixed price option contract studied in Fu et al. (2010) is described in greater detail as follows: let c denote the unit cost of capacity reservation, D denote the random demand, and X denote the random spot market price. The decision for the buyer firm (e.g., HP) is how much capacity Q to reserve from the supplier. Under the fixed price option contract, the buyer reserves capacity Q at unit cost c upfront. After the spot market price and demand realize, the buyer can buy up to Q at the price

A close look at Eqs. (8) and (9) reveals that the total expected procurement costs of the two contracts closely resemble each other and have similar interpretations. The only difference between them is the unit exercising cost of the reserved capacity: 
                              
                                 min

                                 ,
                                 X
                                 )
                              
                            under the fixed price option, and 
                              
                                 β
                                 X
                              
                            under the discount-off-of-market price option.

As shown in Lemma 5, the unit exercising cost 
                              
                                 β
                                 X
                              
                            is stochastically more variable than 
                              
                                 min

                           . As a result, one might draw a parallel between (Gerchak & Mossman, 1992) and our model, and intuit that the discount-off-of-market price option contract yields a higher total expected procurement cost. However, this intuition is disproved by the following proposition.

                           Proposition 1 makes a nice contribution to the literature. It highlights an important difference between the impact of demand uncertainty and unit exercising cost uncertainty on total inventory (or procurement) costs. In particular, unlike demand uncertainty, unit exercising cost uncertainty in general is not a major driver of the total inventory cost, which is an insight not developed in the prior literature. The fundamental reason behind the difference can be explained as follows: demand uncertainty makes it difficult to match supply and demand, whereas unit exercising cost uncertainty does not.

While the fixed price option contract and the discount-off-of-market price option contract are equivalent for independent demand and spot market price, it remains an open question whether the equivalence remains unchanged when demand and spot market price are correlated (correlation is common in many industries, especially those with a few dominant players). We now perform a numerical study to explore this question. In our study, we employ the same parameters as the those used in Fu et al. (2010): demand and market price are modeled by a truncated bivariate normal distribution with demand D

                            compare the optimal capacity reservation levels and the optimal total expected procurement costs, respectively, of the two contracts. As we can see, the comparison hinges on the correlation between demand and the spot market price. It is worth noting that in both figures, the two curves cross each other when the correlation is 0. In other words, the two contracts have the same optimal capacity reservation decisions and the corresponding optimal total expected procurement costs when demand and spot market price are independent, which corroborates our results in Proposition 1.

However, the two contracts no longer behave the same way when demand and spot market price are correlated. Conceivably, the buyer is most vulnerable when the realized demand and spot market price are both high, which is possible when they are positively correlated. Under such a circumstance, the fixed price option better protects the buyer than the discount-off-of-market price option does, because the unit exercise cost of the former is capped at 
                              
                                 α
                              
                           , whereas for the latter, the unit exercise cost can get out of hand. This explains why in Fig. 7, the optimal reserved capacity for the fixed price option contract is greater than that for the discount-off-of-market price option contract when the correlation is positive, because the buyer can only cash in on the better protection provided by the fixed price option contract if sufficient capacity is reserved. Therefore, the buyer tends to reserve more capacity under the fixed price option contract to reap more benefits from it. The same logic also explains why the total expected procurement cost is lower for the fixed price option contract than for the discount-off-of-market price option contract when the correlation is positive, as can be seen in Fig. 8.

When demand and market price are negatively correlated, the relationship between the two contracts is totally reversed. In the presence of negative correlation between demand and market price, market price tends to be low when realized demand is high. In such a case, the fixed price option contract is not very useful because the low market price reduces the odds to exercise the option. Therefore, the buyer tends to reserve less capacity in order not to waste the reservation cost. In contrast, the discount-off-of-market price option contract is more effective because the buyer can always enjoy the discount within the reserved capacity. As a result, reserving more capacity makes sense. On the other hand, market price tends to be high when realized demand is low. In such a case, the reserved capacity would be low for both contracts – the demand is low to begin with. Overall, when demand and market price are negatively correlated, the fixed price contract is less beneficial to the buyer and results in a lower reserved capacity and a high total expected procurement cost, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8.

In sum, our analysis shows that although the fixed price option contract has a stochastically less variable unit exercising cost than the discount-off-of-market price option contract, the stochastic variability of the unit exercising cost is not really the determinant of the total procurement cost. Instead, the correlation between demand and spot market price plays a more important role.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The stochastic variability measures the degree of uncertainty for random demand and/or price in various operations problems. Its ordering property allows us to study the impact of demand/price uncertainty on the optimal decisions and the associated objective values. However, stochastic ordering of random variables is typically challenging without a tractable approach to capture variability.

In this paper, we provide a unifying framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the widely used mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping.

We first apply our framework to the mean-preserving affine transformation, which is then used to rectify an incorrect proof of a fundamental result in the inventory literature (Gerchak & Mossman, 1992) that has gone unnoticed for more than two decades.

The second application, to mean-preserving truncation, addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains. Specifically, we use it to investigate the effectiveness of using fixed shipment quantity to mitigate inefficiency associated with supply chain decentralization. We conduct a numerical study to complete the work of Chen and Gavirneni (2010), and illustrate that the potential cost reduction could be as high as one-third under certain parametric conditions.

Lastly, we also apply our general framework to the mean-preserving capping, which sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the discount-off-of-market price option contract, which is used by HP to manage its procurement risk. We use our approach to theoretically compare the stochastic variability of the unit exercising cost of two contracts: the fixed price option contract and the discount-off-of-market price option contract. We also conduct a numerical study to assess the relative performance of the two contracts. Surprisingly, we find that the stochastic variability of the unit exercising cost is not really the determinant of the total procurement cost. Instead, what drives the disparity between the two option contracts is the correlation between demand and spot market price.
