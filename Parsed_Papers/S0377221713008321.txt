                  Credit options and side payments are two methods suggested for achieving coordination in a two-echelon supply chain. We examine the credit option coordination mechanism introduced by Chaharsooghi and Heydari [Chaharsooghi, S., & Heydari, J. (2010). Supply chain coordination for the joint determination of order quantity and reorder point using credit option. European Journal of Operational Research, 204(1), 86–95]. This method assumes that the supplier’s opportunity costs are equal to the reduction in the buyer’s financial holding costs during the credit period. In this note, we show that Chaharsooghi and Heydari’s method is not applicable when buyer and supplier opportunity costs are not equal. We introduce an alternate per order rebate method that reduces supply chain costs to centralized management levels.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This note is concerned with a two-echelon supply chain (SC) consisting of a buyer and a supplier. The buyer seeks to fulfill the randomly received orders of its customers while minimizing its inventory holding, ordering, and shortage costs. Many previous studies have proposed models that provide mechanisms for the parties in a two-echelon SC to coordinate their inventory policies. These incentives include quantity discounts, side payments, buyback contracts, and credit options. Li and Wang (2007) published a review of research in this area in the European Journal of Operational Research.

This note addresses the case where the buyer in a two-echelon SC selects an order quantity and a reorder point as policies in a continuous review model. There are a limited number of previous studies that specifically address inventory management in a SC under these assumptions where demand is stochastic. Li and Liu (2006) find analytical solutions for an optimal order quantity given a previously established reorder point when a quantity discount is used to coordinate the SC. Shin and Benton (2007) consider a situation where the buyer uses its economic order quantity but selects a reorder point that minimizes inventory and transportation costs. Chaharsooghi, Heydari, and Kamalabadi (2011) expand the Li and Liu (2006) quantity discount model to a setting where both order quantity and reorder point can be selected to minimize SC costs.

Credit options and per order rebate payments as coordinating incentives in SCs where the buyer operates under a continuous review inventory system will be examined. Demand is a random variable and both the inventory order quantity and a safety stock level will be chosen with the goal of minimizing inventory costs in the SC. A method suggested by Chaharsooghi and Heydari (2010) (hereafter CH) that selects an appropriate credit term to coordinate inventory policies will be evaluated.

To employ the CH technique, the supplier allows the buyer to delay payment for a portion of each order cycle, in exchange for agreeing to establish inventory policies that would be optimal if the SC were centralized. The benefit for the buyer is a reduction in the financial portion of its holding costs during the credit period. The supplier incurs opportunity costs associated with the delay in receiving its payment for the delivered goods.

The CH method assumes the reduction in holding costs for the buyer are exactly equal to the credit incentive costs paid by the supplier. This assumes that the supplier’s opportunity costs of delaying receipt of its payment is somehow determined by the buyer’s inventory level and the buyer’s financial holding cost. A modified inventory cost function for the supplier that considers its true opportunity costs is presented. The range of potential values for the credit term where both parties benefit is narrower than shown by CH and the method is not guaranteed to reduce SC costs. After a study of the CH model, an alternate SC coordination plan is proposed that employs a per order rebate as an incentive for participation.

The remainder of the note is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 define notation and describe the CH credit option model. Section 4 illustrates the application of the credit option model through analysis of an example problem. Section 5 introduces an alternate method that employs a per order rebate to the buyer as a coordinating incentive. Section 6 presents results from three test problems. Section 7 summarizes and concludes the paper.

In the two-echelon SC considered in this note, the buyer randomly receives demand for a product from its customers and in turn places orders for good from the supplier. The supplier receives these orders and ships inventory to the buyer.

A significant portion of the notation from CH has been retained, but since the holding costs in the model will be explicitly divided into storage and financial holding costs, some terminology is slightly different. The notation used for the model is shown in Table 1
                     . Parameters for test problems used by CH are also shown in this table and will be referenced later.

Subscripts b and s will be used to represent results for the buyer and supplier, respectively. Subscripts or superscripts d and c denote results obtained from operating in the decentralized and centralized modes, respectively.

The model under consideration allows a buyer experiencing uncertain demand to select both an order quantity and safety stock factor to minimize its costs. Both decentralized and centralized modes of operation will be considered. In the decentralized mode, the buyer selects optimal values for the decision variables that minimize its own costs without regard for the supplier’s costs. The supplier reacts by selecting its own order quantity based on the number of units ordered by the buyer. In the centralized mode, the buyer and supplier simultaneously select their order quantities and safety stock level to minimize the total SC costs. If the SC is decentralized, a coordination mechanism may entice the buyer to choose the optimal centralized order quantity and safety stock level in exchange for an incentive (a credit option and a per order rebate will be considered).

The model defined in this section is similar to the one defined by CH, except that the problem has been re-stated to explicitly show the financial and storage parts of the holding costs of the buyer and supplier as separate values.

The expected annual cost function for the buyer is

                     The supplier’s cost function is the sum of its ordering costs, holding costs, and the concession made to the buyer to participate in the coordinated model. The coordination incentive, CI, defined in (2) and deducted from the buyer’s cost function is added to the supplier’s cost function.

The next three sub-sections describe the optimal inventory policies in the SC under decentralization, centralization, and coordination.

In the decentralized mode, the supplier does not offer a credit period to the buyer, so the buyer assumes C
                        =0 and sets the optimal policy by finding

In the decentralized and centralized modes, the SC members have not required or pursued an incentive to reduce costs through coordination of optimal policies, so the credit term was equal to C
                        =0. In the coordinated model, the supplier must provide the credit term as an incentive for the buyer to participate in the coordination effort.

                           c+ between the two parties. These results are identical to those shown by CH in their Table 2

In the coordinated mode, the buyer’s overall holding costs on inventory increase due to its larger order quantity, and its shortage costs are slightly higher; however, the increased holding and shortage costs are more than offset by an ordering cost reduction and the coordination incentive.

For the supplier, ordering costs are reduced significantly by 634 but it pays credit incentive costs to the buyer as follows:

                        This amount equals the financial portion of the holding costs of the buyer for the credit term of 0.057years, multiplied by the number of order cycles each year.

The CH-derived supplier credit incentive costs above seem to understate the true cost to the supplier. In the CH model, the supplier’s credit incentive costs, CI, are based on both the buyer’s inventory level and the buyer’s financial holding cost percentage. This is not the true cost of providing this incentive to the buyer.


                        Sheen and Tsao (2007) observe that when offering a credit period in a SC model, the supplier incurs an opportunity cost for the cost of the goods sold to the buyer. Thus, we need to find the actual opportunity cost to the supplier of providing the credit terms in the CH model.

The accurate supplier cost is straightforward to determine. First, the buyer places an order for

                        =0.057 are 1840 and the total SC costs have increased to 3168. In the decentralized mode, total costs are only 2788.

If we replace CI(Q, k, C) in the supplier’s total cost function in (4) with P

                           min
                         is not affected by the supplier’s cost function, this means the two parties could agree on any C in the interval [0.026, 0.032]. The interval for potential negotiation is now much narrower than what the CH method computes.

In summary, use of the CH model requires the buyer and supplier’s opportunity costs to be equal, but we can see from the previous example that this may not always be a valid assumption. The next section offers a per order rebate method that allows the buyer and supplier to divide all the cost savings associated with operating in the centralized mode under any set of cost parameters for the buyer and seller.

To divide cost savings from using the centralized order quantity and safety stock levels, the CH cost functions can be revised to include a rebate per order, V, that is paid by the supplier and received by the buyer. The new buyer cost function is

Our proposed CH cost function modifications reduce costs to the centralized level for any value in the interval [V

                        max
                     ]. The next section will provide additional analysis for three CH example problems.

To further understand the models discussed in the previous sections, results from three CH test problems with parameters in Table 1 are provided in this section. The values are taken from CH, except for the holding cost parameters h
                     
                        b
                     , s
                     
                        b
                     , h
                     
                        s
                     , and s
                     
                        s
                     . These are consistent with the holding costs and the financial holding cost as a percentage of total holding costs provided by CH.

The results for the revised CH model and the alternate rebate model are presented in Table 2. This table shows the optimal values for the decision variables and total costs for each party in the decentralized and centralized modes. The savings from moving to the centralized modes is shown in the TC
                     
                        c+ row. The buyer and supplier can potentially split TC
                     
                        c+ by coordinating policies.

In two cases, there is some improvement gained by implementing the revised credit option as compared to the decentralized case, but in test Problem 2, total SC costs are actually higher. Using the credit option in these problems does not allow a reduction in total SC costs to the centralized levels.

                     . Of course, by using the rebate, we ensure that the supplier’s costs are in no way affected by the buyer’s inventory level or investment opportunity cost. In all scenarios for these test problems, the alternate rebate solution reduces costs in the SC to a greater extent than the revised CH model. In fact, costs are always reduced to the centralized level, as intended in the original CH model.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper has investigated credit options and a per order rebate as coordinating incentives in a SC where order quantity and reorder point are jointly determined. As formulated, the method presented by Chaharsooghi and Heydari (2010) relies on one major assumption: the supplier and buyer opportunity costs due to the credit option are identical.

A more accurate representation of the supplier’s opportunity cost, however, requires that the cost be based on its own investment cost and the purchase price of the inventory ordered by the buyer. When this adjustment is made to the cost function of the supplier, the method loses much of its effectiveness to coordinate the actions of the buyer and supplier.

An alternate method based on a per order rebate paid by the supplier to the buyer was introduced after the analysis of the credit option. This method can be implemented to allow the SC members to divide the SC costs that would be incurred in a centralized mode of operations.

In future research, we would like to apply the per order rebate method as a coordination incentive in a supply chain for consumable military aircraft items involving a common depot servicing multiple maintenance facilities. We would also like to develop a per order rebate method for use in coordinated SCs under other sets of assumptions, e.g., a model where inventory is ordered at fixed intervals.
