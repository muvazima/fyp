                  Having sufficient inventories in the forward or piece picking area of a warehouse is an essential condition for warehouse operations. As pickers consume the inventory in the piece racks, there is a risk of stockout. This can be reduced by the timely replenishment of products from the bulk reserve area to the forward area. We develop and compare three policies for prioritizing replenishments for the case where order picking and replenishments occur concurrently because of time restrictions. The first policy, based on the ratio of available inventory to wave demand, reduces the number of stockouts considerably. The other two more sophisticated policies reduce the number of stockouts even more but require much more computation time, and are more costly in terms of implementation, maintenance and software updates. We present the results of implementing one of these policies in the warehouse of a large cosmetics firm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Warehousing plays a major role in physical distribution and has been researched extensively in the past decades, see Gu, Goetschalckx, and McGinnis (2007, 2010a), and de Koster, Le-Duc, and Roodbergen (2007) for reviews. Among all warehouse activities, order picking has received the most attention. It is estimated that more than fifty percent of operational costs are related to the order picking process (Coyle, Bardi, & Langley, 1996), so that optimizing this process is of utmost importance. Optimization can be achieved by developing (combinations of) order batching, order picking routing and rack assignment strategies.

The increasing popularity of e-commerce has made order picking even more important, as warehouses are faced with later order cut-off times and less time available for picking. In addition, serving end-customers instead of retailers involves dealing with much smaller quantities in the order lines. Warehouses are therefore increasingly picking units (pieces) of products instead of larger handling units, such as boxes or pallets. One of the strategies to speed up order picking and to deal with small quantities in the order lines is to operate a forward area from which the most demanded products can be picked quickly, see Gu et al. (2007, 2010a) and de Koster et al. (2007). Piece picking, as opposed to bulk picking, takes place in this area. The stocks in the forward area are limited and they are replenished from a bulk reserve area at the back of the warehouse.

Due to time pressure, many warehouses perform order picking and replenishment operations simultaneously, and in practice it sometimes happens that an order picker has to pick a product before the replenishment crew has had time to replenish it, and thus faces a stockout (which we will call a 0-pick). We observed this problem in a warehouse of a renowned luxury cosmetics firm. Stockouts or 0-picks reduce the productivity of picking operations, because the missing products can only be picked once the restock has taken place. This causes delays in shipping and unproductive travel of the picking crew, since the orders with missing products are completed outside the optimal picking routes.

The problem of 0-picks can be tackled if the short-term demand of each product is known. This information allows us to identify products which could cause a 0-pick if they are not replenished in time. In the warehouse studied in this paper, this demand information is available because the warehouse uses a wave-picking strategy, in which ‘waves’ of picking orders are released in succession. Namely, at the beginning of each wave, information is available about each order line in the picking wave. However, predicting the exact moment at which the products will run out of stock is difficult, as there can be quite some variation in order picking times and the exact order pick moment depends on the routes taken.

Although there is some literature about the design and operation of forward and reserve areas (Van den Berg, Sharp, Gademann, & Pochet, 1998; Gu et al., 2010a), it mainly focuses on the size of those areas and the quantity of replenishments, but does not consider the sequence in which orders are replenished. Our problem is also similar to inventory-routing problems and our results could be used in that area as well. In this paper, we propose three policies that prioritize replenishment orders based on the short-term demand information mentioned above. These policies aim to minimize the number of 0-picks. We first prove optimality results of these policies, we compare them using simulation, and we present the real life results of implementing one of these replenishment policies in a warehouse of a cosmetics firm.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a detailed description of the problem. In section 3, a short overview of the literature dealing with this problem is given. Next, three replenishment policies are proposed in Section 4. In section 5, these policies are compared by means of simulation. Section 6 contains the results of implementing one of the three stock replenishment policies. Finally, Section 7 states the general conclusions that can be drawn from this paper.

The warehouse studied in this paper has separate areas for order picking and storage activities. The forward area, also called fast-pick area, is used for piece picking, while bulk or mass storage takes place in the reserve area. The main advantage of this configuration is that it reduces the order picking time. Because order picking takes place in this limited part of the warehouse, the pickers only need to travel short distances. The main disadvantage is that the stock of one Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is split into two different zones in the warehouse, thus requiring periodic replenishments from the bulk storage to the fast-pick area.

The warehouse we observed implements three U-shaped piece picking zones. Managers periodically reassess the decision of what quantities of which SKUs are to be stored in these zones to ensure that the capacity of the rack assigned to each item meets its long-term demand. This is done by solving the well-known forward-reserve allocation problem (FRP), which will be further explained in Section 3.

The warehouse uses a wave-picking picking policy. Each picking wave corresponds to a pre-defined shipping schedule, meaning that all picking orders which have to be shipped together are released at the same moment in a certain order. There is no information about when exactly an individual order line will be handled, except for the fact that it will take place sometime between the beginning and the end of the wave. Each picking wave is made up of several batch picking orders. More specifically, the pickers process up to six picking orders in the same picking route using a sort-while-pick process. While the pickers move around in the U-shaped zones, the inventory in the picking racks decreases and replenishment orders are triggered to restock the forward area.

A replenishment order corresponds to one product that is restocked from the reserve to the forward area. Replenishment orders are launched following an 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy, whereby the stock of a product in the forward area is replenished up to level S as soon as the inventory drops below s items. The S denotes the order-up-to level (the rack capacity) and the s is the reorder point (in this case taken as 30% of the total inventory capacity of the rack). The Warehouse Management System (WMS) provides real-time monitoring of the on-hand inventory level in each location, so that an automatic replenishment order is triggered as soon as the stock level of a given product declines below the s level. The rack capacity allocated to each product is based on the long-term demand information for that product.

As soon as the WMS detects a need for restocking a rack, a replenishment order is released and placed at the bottom of the list of pending replenishment orders, following a FIFO (first-in-first-out) queuing discipline. The replenishment orders in the list are then processed by a crew of forklift drivers that groups them in small batches to reduce travel time while respecting the priority marked in the queue. The three new policies proposed in this paper assign a priority to every replenishment order and execute the one(s) with the highest priority in the first replenishment batches. Due to time pressure, there are no idle periods in the warehouse that would allow the forward area to be fully replenished prior to the start of a picking wave. Stockouts could be avoided if order pickers and replenishment workers were to share responsibilities and work together to restock the piece picking area at the beginning of the wave and then to fulfill the order picking tasks. However, in practice, this sharing of responsibilities is not feasible. First, piece picking and forklift driving require very different skills, the workers are not interchangeable in terms of training (and salary) and belong to separate functional units within the warehouse. Second, the number of forklifts dedicated to replenishment is limited. If the picking crew were deployed to perform replenishment tasks, the warehouse would have to invest in an additional fleet of forklifts that would only be in use at the beginning of the wave while remaining idle the rest of the time.

Therefore picking and replenishment operations take place continuously and simultaneously throughout the day. Although the forklift drivers usually carry out the replenishment orders efficiently, a stockout (restricted to the piece picking area) of the most frequently demanded products in the picking wave can occur before the replenishment crew has had time to restock. The main cause of this problem is that for these products, the quantity to be picked per time unit varies considerably, which is because the picking orders involving the same kinds of products are often batched. The rack capacity allocated to each SKU in the forward area is a tactical decision that cannot be modified in each picking wave. Hence the problem of reducing 0-picks needs to be tackled by focusing on operational decisions. Specifically, we try to avoid 0-picks by designing policies which determine which products need to be replenished from the reserve area and the sequence (priority) in which these replenishments should be processed. To our knowledge, existing literature has not yet focused on a replenishment policy aimed at avoiding 0-picks in a forward area where picking and replenishment operations take place simultaneously. In this paper, we propose such a policy.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Hardly any literature addresses the problem described in Section 2. Some more details on the problem and the proposal of one simple priority rule can be found in Carrasco-Gallego and Ponce-Cueto (2009), but no analytical analysis of the performance of priority rules is provided here.

Particularly the combination of wave-picking and replenishing during the order-picking process makes our problem very specific. We only found two papers that can be applied (partly) to our situation.


                     Gagliardi, Ruiz, and Renaud (2008) also consider a warehouse with a forward area, a reserve area, and a pick-to-belt operation. The warehouse faces stockouts during picking and only one technician is responsible for a continuous replenishment. The authors propose four heuristic replenishment policies. Two are based on long-term demand information, while the other two also consider short-term demand information by checking incoming picking orders. They consider only the next product to be replenished, while we consider wave-picking and set priorities for all products to be replenished by several people. Van den Berg et al. (1998) also address replenishment policies. However, they consider replenishment during idle periods and therefore ignore the priorities of replenishment orders. They aim to determine which (unit-load) replenishments minimize the expected amount of labor (picking-time and replenishment-time) during the picking period. While they focus on the costs of picking and replenishment, we concentrate on 0-picks only.

The papers described above focus on the replenishment process. Alternatively, the problem of 0-picks is related to the inventory level of the products in the piece picking area. The problem of determining which products should be stored in the forward area and in what quantities is known as the forward-reserve allocation problem (FRP). There is a trade-off between the savings achieved by reducing the size of the piece picking area and the costs incurred due to frequent replenishments from the reserve to the forward area. Hackman, Rosenblatt, and Olin (1990) were the first to present a heuristic for this problem, aiming to minimize both replenishment and order-pick costs. Later, this research was extended by Frazelle, Hackman, Passy, and Platzman (1994) by including the size of the forward area as a decision variable. Recently, Gu, Goetschalckx, and McGinnis (2010b) have solved this problem to optimality using a branch-and-bound algorithm.

Although the problem originates from replenishment in warehouses, it may also occur in other situations where stock replenishments have to be prioritized, for example when retailers need to be replenished under a vendor-managed inventory scheme and transport capacity is limited. Inventory routing problems (see Moin & Salhi, 2007) combine inventory management (at the retailer) and vehicle routing, so that inventory information is taken into account when planning vehicle routing. The inventory evolution is predicted with deterministic or stochastic models, the latter being much more complex than the first. A prediction is made about whether a stockout will occur and this information is used to prioritize replenishments for multiple days. Next, vehicle routing is planned whereby routing efficiency is considered vs. excess inventories caused by replenishments made earlier than necessary. Vonolfen, Affenzeller, Beham, Lengauer, and Wagner (2011) give an example using simulation optimization. In our case, we have continuous rather than periodic (daily) planning and we take more demand information into account. Next, we do not model the replenishment vehicle routing, as this would make the model very complex. Finally, our approach is analytical with simulation used for performance evaluation.

In this section, we propose stock replenishment policies which aim to minimize the number of 0-picks in a given wave. These policies are based on the following assumptions about the warehouse and its operations:
                           
                              •
                              A1: The warehouse stores SKUs in two separate areas: a forward and a reserve area.

A2: Real-time information about the inventory of each SKU in the piece picking (forward) area is known.

A3: The warehouse uses a wave-picking strategy.

A4: Replenishment orders are executed during the order picking process.

A5: The priority of a replenishment order is set at the beginning of the wave, and is not changed.

The first four assumptions are necessary conditions for this paper to be directly applicable. It is important to notice that A2 provides information about the inventory level in the piece picking area and that A3 provides short-term demand information. These assumptions allow us to identify products with insufficient stock levels to meet demand in a wave. From now on, we will call these products emergency products.

The fifth assumption requires some additional explanation. Replenishment orders and their priorities can be determined either continuously, or periodically. They can be updated continuously by reviewing information about demand and inventory, or they can be set once in a certain period (for example: once in a wave), and then remain unchanged. Although the first approach may be better in terms of 0-picks, it has some major disadvantages. First, it is very hard to implement. Second, this approach may cause many changes of replenishment orders during a wave, which brings about a lot of stress among the replenishment crew.

The three policies we introduce assign replenishment priorities to emergency products. Two of them assume that information is available about the number of different products that can be replenished in a coming wave and about the precise times at which these replenishments take place. Under these conditions, the problem of assigning replenishment priorities to emergency products is equivalent to the problem of assigning emergency products to the replenishments taking place in the wave. Before we explain the replenishment policies that solve this assignment problem, we first give some notations.

In this section, we examine three policies that assign priorities to replenishment orders based on the expected number of 0-picks occurring for a certain product. These three policies differ in complexity as they use different amounts of information and have different underlying assumptions.

The Stock-Needs Rule (SNR) is the least complex of our three replenishment policies. After identifying the emergency products, which is possible because of assumptions A2 and A3, this policy assigns different priority levels to these products based on the following reasoning: the lower the stock level of a given product in the piece picking area

                            is used to assign different replenishment priorities among the emergency products. The emergency product which has the lowest value for this ratio is assigned the highest priority, the one with the second lowest value is assigned the second highest priority and so on. These priorities are set at the beginning of each wave and the replenishment orders are processed in small batches. After all emergency products are replenished, forklift drivers can continue replenishment operations following the traditional replenishment policy (i.e., the (
                              
                                 s
                                 ,

                           ) policy).

Whereas the SNR only considers the stock level compared to the aggregate demand in a wave, the OQBR uses all available short-term demand information. Namely, it models the expected number of 0-picks occurring for a certain product as a function of the time it is replenished by taking all individual picking order lines into account. Given these functions of all emergency products, a Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) can be solved to minimize the total expected number of 0-picks. However, in order to do this, some extra assumptions are required:
                              
                                 •
                                 A6: The duration of a wave is known in advance.

A7: The time at which a picking order line will be handled (pick time), has a uniform distribution between the start and the end time of a wave.

A8: The pick times of the picking order lines containing a certain product are independent of each other.

A9: The way in which replenishment orders are batched is independent of labor costs.

A10: The time at which the ith replenishment order is processed, 
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                t
                                             
                                             
                                                i
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    , can be predicted at the beginning of the wave and is independent of the product that is replenished.

A11: The inventory levels in the warehouse (forward +reserve) are sufficient to complete the picking orders.

A12: After a product is replenished, the inventory level is at least such that it meets demand during the rest of the wave.

A13: If the stock level of a certain product is insufficient to fulfill the requirements of a picking order line, nothing will be picked.

Some of the assumptions stated above (e.g. A6, A8, or A10) may not be met in reality. For example, the duration of a wave and the replenishment times may have to be estimated. However, these assumptions have to be made in order to simplify the problem and to model it.

Generally, there is no information about the exact time an order line is picked. As in the case described in section 2, the only information available is that it is sometime between the beginning and the end of the wave. This means that we have no reason for differentiating “pick-probability” among time units, which explains assumption A7.

Assumption A9 is made in order to continue our focus on 0-picks. If we were to focus on both minimizing the number of 0-picks and reducing the costs of replenishment, the calculations for using the replenishment policy presented next would become too complex. If a warehouse fails to meet assumptions A11–A13, some minor adaptations can be made to the replenishment policy presented next so that these settings are taken into account.

Based on assumptions A1–A13, we can now begin to model the problem of minimizing the total expected number of 0-picks in a certain wave. Because of A10, we know the time at which each replenishment order is processed at the beginning of each wave. This means that the priority of a replenishment order is automatically determined by its replenishment time (the product which corresponds to the replenishment order that has the earliest replenishment time has the highest priority). Observing this, the problem of assigning replenishment priorities to emergency products in order to minimize the number of 0-picks in a given wave is the same as ‘assigning’ emergency products to pre-defined replenishment orders in such a way that the expected number of 0-picks is minimized. Furthermore, notice that the way in which these replenishments are batched is independent of costs (A9), and that 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                    
                                       i
                                    
                                 
                              
                            is independent of the product replenished (A10). Therefore, the problem of assigning optimal replenishment priorities to emergency products can be modeled as an assignment problem:

The binary programming model described in (1)–(4) is an NP-hard problem (Martello & Toth, 1987). Moreover, this kind of problem is difficult to implement in a WMS, because complicated solution tools are required for solving this problem. However, observe the following: given that

                           , which makes (1)–(4) an LSAP again. After the assignment, the products that are assigned to the imaginary replenishments must be erased from the replenishment list.

There are several algorithms that can solve an LSAP very fast, and that are relatively easy to implement. For example, the Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) or the Munkres Algorithm (Munkres, 1957). Alternatively, the problem could be solved by an ordered list heuristic in which, starting with the first replenishment order, sequentially the unassigned emergency product with the highest value for

                            is assigned (see De Vries (2010) for more details). In order to improve the heuristic solution, a local search can be applied afterwards.

As we have already shown, the problem of minimizing the number of 0-picks can be modeled by (1)–(4) under A1–A13. If parameters

                            in (1) are unbiased, solving (1)–(4) will yield the optimal solution under these assumptions. Since formula (6) provides an unbiased estimate of the parameters

                            under these assumptions, we can conclude the following proposition:

Although the OQBR will find the optimal assignment of priorities to replenishment orders if assumptions A1–A13 hold, it has one major disadvantage. Namely, all possible sequences in which the

                            picking order lines containing product h are picked have to be distinguished in (6). The number of sequences increases exponentially as

                            increases, as does computation time. This implies that the OQBR requires a large amount of computation time if certain products are demanded in many order lines. We now present a variant of the OQBR, the Order-Based Rule (OBR), which uses a slightly different formula for calculating

                           , the expected number of 0-picks before replenishment is conditioned on the number of picks before replenishment and multiplied by the probability that this situation occurs. This probability is calculated the same way as in (5). Because of assumption A14, all picking order lines containing product h can be seen as equal. This means that the number of 0-picks before replenishment (

                           , which has to define all possible sequences in which the picking orders containing product h could be picked in order to determine the expected number of 0-picks. Again, A2, A3, A6 and A10 provide all parameters required, and assumptions A11–A13 are taken into account by only counting a 0-pick if it occurs before replenishment and if the stock level is insufficient to meet the demand of the picking order line.

Under A1–A14 the problem of minimizing the number of 0-picks can still be modeled by (1)–(4), which will yield the optimal solution if parameters

In the previous section, we presented three stock replenishment policies, which differ in complexity. Without a doubt, the OBR is more complex than the SNR, and the OQBR is more complex than the OBR. As complexity brings about costs for implementation, maintenance and software updates, it is relevant to examine whether these costs are worthwhile. In this section, we attempt to answer this question and compare the three policies by simulating replenishment operations during a wave.

The idea of the simulation experiment is to apply the replenishment policies presented in this paper to imaginary waves. By determining the resulting number of 0-picks for each policy, we try to reveal the differences among them. However, it makes no sense to draw quantitative conclusions from these results (e.g., policy A performs x percent better than policy B). Namely, the differences between the performances of the policies depend on the characteristics of a wave (De Vries, 2010), and these characteristics differ considerably among warehouses. Instead, the aim of our simulation experiment is to reveal the qualitative differences among the three policies. The choices for the characteristics of the simulated waves presented next are therefore more or less random, and are only meant to reveal these differences. Next to uncovering qualitative differences, the results of the simulation experiments may show us what the quantitative differences could be under certain circumstances.

The simulation model uses the open source software that solves the LSAP (Cao, 2008). This software contains the Munkres Algorithm (Munkres, 1957). In order to check the validity of our program, we compared simulation results with the theoretical performance of the replenishment policies.

The imaginary warehouse meets all features described in the assumptions A1–A13. The imaginary waves are generated based on the following characteristics:

The sub-optimality of the SNR is mainly caused by the fact that this policy rejects part of the short-term demand information. As it only considers aggregate demand, the SNR tends to assign a priority that is lower than the optimal priority to a product for which

Next, we use simulation to assess the performance of these policies. Every time the wave is simulated (5000 times), new order pick times of the order lines are randomly generated based on A7.

                         are known (see the first part of Example 1). This information allows us to determine the number of 0-picks faced in case that the replenishment priorities determined by the SNR, the OQBR, the OBR, or the

                         policy are used. Namely, since we know when the picking order lines are processed and when the replenishments take place, we can simply check whether the inventory level is sufficient to meet demand for each individual order line. In order to add more generality, this simulation is done for 1000 different waves, generating new picking orders and inventory levels for every wave.

                        Table 2
                         shows the results of applying the replenishment policies 5000 times to 1000 randomly generated waves.

The OQBR is modeled based on assumptions A1–A13, which makes it quite logical that this stock replenishment policy performs best in a simulation model that acts based on these assumptions. The OBR only slightly underperforms when compared to the OQBR, which must be due to assumption A14. The OBR and OQBR outperform the SNR, which must be due to the fact that the SNR only uses part of all available short-term demand information. However, the simulation results show only small differences in performance among the three policies, particularly when these differences are compared to the difference with the 
                           
                              (

                              S
                              )
                           
                         policy.

As mentioned before, the results depend on the settings of the imaginary warehouse. However, some factors may indicate to what extent the number of 0-picks will change when one replenishment policy is chosen instead of another. As suggested in section 5.1, variance in

                         causes the difference between the performance of the OQBR and the performance of the OBR, whereas variance in

                         causes the difference between the performance of the OQBR (/OBR) and the performance of the SNR. This raises the question whether there is a correlation between the variance in

                         and the difference between the performance of the OQBR and the performance of the OBR. A second question is whether there is a correlation between the variance in

                         and the difference between the performance of the OQBR (/OBR) and the performance of the SNR. If such correlation exists, decision makers should measure the value of these variances in their warehouse, so that they make a more accurate cost benefit analysis of implementing one of these replenishment policies.

The first correlation can be explained by the fact that the OBR assumes A14. If this assumption is met, there will be no differences between the results of the OBR and the OQBR. However, when the distance between the reality and this assumption increases, which happens when

                         shows more variation, the bias in the calculations made by the OBR will also increase, making the difference larger. The difference between the OQBR (/OBR) and the SNR can be explained by the fact that the first takes

                         into account, while the SNR does not. This causes sub-optimality in the SNR, because

                         is a good indicator of the number of 0-picks that may occur for a certain product. As stated in Section 5.1, this causes that the SNR tends to assign a priority that is lower than the optimal priority to products for which

                         of all emergency products h is almost the same, the SNR cannot make many of these sub-optimal assignment decisions, so that the degree of sub-optimality will be low. This will often be the case when the duration of a wave is very short. In contrast, if there is much variation in this statistic, the difference between the performances of these two replenishment policies increases.

                              . Based on these data, the policies assign the replenishment priorities described in Table 4
                              . The sub-optimality of the SNR is shown by the fact that it assigns a relatively high priority to product 5. Although this product is demanded only once (so that it can cause only one 0-pick), it gets a high replenishment priority because the ratio stock/needs is relatively small (
                                 
                                    0.5
                                 
                              ). The shortcoming of the OBR is shown by the relatively high replenishment priority it assigns to product 8. Namely, because there is much variation in demand for this product, the OBR shows a relatively large bias in the calculation of the expected number of 0-picks for this product. The effect of these sub-optimalities on the performances of our replenishment policies are shown in Table 4.

In short, there are good reasons to assume that the difference between the performance of the OQBR and the performance of the OBR increases when the variance in

                         increases, and that the difference between the performance of the SNR and the performance of the OQBR (/OBR) increases when the variance in

                         increases (so also often when T increases). This is also confirmed in experiments performed in De Vries (2010).

Last, Table 5
                         contains the mean computation times of the process of transforming demand and inventory information into replenishment orders for each replenishment policy. The mean computation times and the variances of the computation times are relatively small. Replenishment orders are generated only once per wave, so that the computation times stated in the table will not lead to a labor time loss due to waiting for replenishment orders to be generated. Because the 
                           
                              (
                              s
                              ,
                              S
                              )
                           
                         policy is a continuous review policy in which replenishment orders are updated continuously, there is no (measurable) computation time for generating replenishment orders for this policy.

At the time of the case study (see also Carrasco-Gallego & Ponce-Cueto, 2009), the SNR was the only available replenishment policy taking short-term demand information into account. We, therefore, chose to implement this policy in the warehouse of a large cosmetics firm. We monitored its performance by measuring the relative number of order lines that caused a 0-pick. Fig. 3
                      shows the effect of implementing the SNR. It was progressively implemented in each of the three piece picking areas in April, May, and June. Before policy implementation in March, there were almost 14 0-picks per 1000 order lines. After implementation, this number had decreased to less than three. This means that the SNR, compared to the (s,
                     S) policy, reduced the number of 0-picks by about 80%. These results are coherent with the results obtained in the simulation study. In the latter, the switch from the 
                        
                           (
                           s
                           ,
                           S
                           )
                        
                      policy to the SNR reduced the mean number of 0-picks per wave by 76.5%, from 53.59 to 12.56.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we presented three new internal stock replenishment policies for warehouses operating with distinct forward and reserve areas, in order to minimize the problem of 0-picks. The unique feature of these policies is that they assign priorities to replenishment orders based on short-term demand information that is available because of the wave-picking strategy used in the warehouse.

The first replenishment policy, the Stock-Needs Rule, assigns priorities to replenishment orders based on the ratio of available inventory to wave demand. The second replenishment policy, the Order-Quantity Based Rule, makes use of all short-term demand information that is available in order to assign priorities to replenishment orders. The problem of minimizing the total expected number of 0-picks is modeled as a Linear Sum Assignment Problem. In this problem, products are assigned to replenishment orders based on the expected number of 0-picks that occurs for a product if it is assigned to a certain replenishment order (i.e., if it is replenished at a certain pre-known time). This value can be calculated exactly based on the assumption we made. However, this policy needs a vast amount of computation time when some products are ordered often. The third policy, the Order Based Rule, does not require a large amount of computation time by assuming that all orders lines containing a given product require the same number of items. By making this assumption, it uses a simplified (biased) version of the formula that calculates the expected number of 0-picks.

Although the OQBR outperformed the other replenishment policies in the simulation experiment, this does not mean that this policy should always be favored. First, both the OQBR and the OBR are relatively costly in terms of implementation, maintenance, and software updates. Secondly, the difference in performance may decrease if the assumptions underlying these policies are not met. For example, simulation experiments in De Vries (2010) have shown that the difference between the OQBR and the other policies becomes slightly smaller when replenishment times are stochastic instead of deterministic. However, even if there is a substantial bias in their calculations, this disadvantage can be outweighed by the great advantage that the OQBR and the OBR take all available short-term demand information into account. Thirdly, the relative performance of a replenishment policy depends very much on the settings of the warehouse. We examined two variables that are correlated with the difference between the replenishment policies in terms of 0-picks: the variance in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                        
                      and the variance in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Q
                              
                              
                                 h
                              
                           
                           (
                           k
                           )
                        
                     . Decision makers should measure the value of these variables in their warehouse, so that they make a more accurate cost benefit analysis of implementing one of these replenishment policies.

Because the SNR was the only replenishment policy that was available at the time of the case study, it replaced the (s,
                     S) policy in the warehouse. Implementation reduced the average number of 0-picks from 13.8 to 2.9 per 1000 picking order lines, which reveals the effectiveness of this stock replenishment policy.
