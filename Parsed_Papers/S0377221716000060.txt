                     -approximation to any continuous single facility minisum location problem for any gauge with asymmetry measure σ, and thus a 2-approximate solution for any norm.
                  On the other hand for any gauge the true minimum point (the 1-median) remains within a bounded set whenever a fixed proportion of less than half of the total weight of the destination points is moved to any other positions. It follows that the distance between the centroid and the 1-median may be arbitrary close to half the diameter of the destination set.

The Fermat–Weber problem, or single facility minisum Euclidean location problem, is probably the most studied and discussed continuous location model, see e.g. the survey (Drezner, Klamroth, Schöbel, & Wesolowsky, 2003). In its modern form it is stated as follows:

It was shown in Bajaj (1988) that no closed algebraic form can solve it in general. Therefore it should be solved through iterative techniques from convex optimisation, the most popular for this particular problem being the almost centenary method developed by Weiszfeld (Weiszfeld, 1937; Weiszfeld & Plastria, 2009), as explained in detail in Plastria (2011).

In 1937, Keefer (according to Eilon, Watson-Gandy, and Christofides (1971)—we were unable to verify this information) introduced the so-called centroid (or centre of gravity) method, stating that the solution would be

                     Since then, till today, many books on Operations Management, including e.g. Weida, Richardson, and Vazsonyi (2001) (note that Vazsonyi=Weiszfeld, see Vazsonyi, 2002) propose this centroid solution as optimal. This is totally wrong. The centroid g minimizes another objective: the sum of weighted squared Euclidean distances, as is easily established, see e.g. Plastria (2011). Attempts to banish this error have been numerous, but seem not to have been sufficiently heard and still continue to be felt necessary, as exemplified by the writings of Eilon et al. (1971); Schärlig (1973); Vergin and Rogers (1967), and others, up to much more recently (Gehrlein & Pasic, 2009).

The difficulty to convince the operations management community of this error should probably be sought for a good part in the fact that in simple examples the centroid seems to give a quite satisfactory approximation of the optimal solution, and, being so much easier to calculate, is therefore preferred. This argument is for example central to the recent paper (Kuo, 2010) that advocates the centroid as a good heuristic solution, and attempts to show so experimentally using randomly generated data, concluding that the approximation grows better and better with increasing number of destinations. This is however no proof of goodness in general at all. In fact it only illustrates the following rather evident fact about the quite exceptional case where the destinations admit a symmetry centre.

Thus, when the random generation of coordinates and weights is done using a uniform distribution (as is not said, but implicit in Kuo (2010)) the sample test data obtained approximates a symmetric destination set better and better as the sample size increases. And therefore it should be expected that both g and the Weber point will converge to the same asymptotic symmetry centre of the destinations.

So, let us have a deeper look at the question how bad the centroid can be for ‘solving’ single facility minisum location problems. As Euclidean distance is a rather restrictive view on modelling real world distances, see e.g. Plastria (1995), we develop our analysis in the much more general setting where distance is measured by an arbitrary finite gauge, the generalisation of a norm that includes possible asymmetry.

A first and most common way to check the fit of a solution is to compare it in value to the optimal.

Given any gauge ν on 
                        
                           R
                           d
                        
                      we consider the following single facility minisum location problem (see e.g. Plastria, 2009 for general properties of norms and gauges).

                     and to see that this bound is reached if and only if A consists of only 2 destinations, in other words, as in Example 1 with

It is an open question if this bound is also valid for any norm, or if an extended version exists for any gauge.

Another way of measuring how good or bad the centroid solution can be, is to look at how far it lies from the real minimum. In other words, how far can g lie from m? For scale invariance this distance should best be compared to the size of the destination set A.

Let us first measure this distance using the gauge ν itself and let dν
                     (A) be the ν-diameter of A, i.e.

                            i.e. when

In more general cases we know also that g always lies in the convex hull of A. On the line or the plane we know that this also holds for the 1-median m in case ν is any norm (Wendell & Hurter, 1973) (Note that in higher dimension d > 2 this can only be ascertained for ellipsoidal norms, i.e. linearly transformed Euclidean norms, see Plastria, 1983). It follows that in these cases the distance 
                        
                           ∥
                           g
                           −
                           m
                           ∥
                        
                      is always smaller or equal to the Euclidean diameter of A.

In what follows we will rather consider the Euclidean distance between g and m and compare it to the Euclidean diameter of A.

In Statistics the second skewness coefficient proposed by Pearson as far back as 1895 was 
                        
                           3
                           (
                           g
                           −
                           m
                           )
                           /
                           s
                        
                      (where division by the standard deviation s is done for scale invariance) as a measure of skewness of a one-dimensional distribution. In location context this seems somewhat strange, since, as we saw in Example 2, in case only two different values are observed at different frequencies the highest values for this coefficient are obtained for the situations closest to symmetry, i.e. with almost the same frequencies! Perhaps for this reason, among others, the Pearson’s moment coefficient of skewness, based on the third order moment is preferred in Statistics.

However, in more recent times, Robust Statistics recognizes a fundamental difference in the properties of the mean and the median in terms of robustness or breakdown point, see e.g. Rousseeuw and Leroy (1987). The breakdown point of an estimator is the (supremum) proportion of incorrect observations (e.g. arbitrary large observations) the estimator can handle before giving an incorrect answer (e.g. arbitrary large). By convention this proportion is at most 0.5, a data set with at least half of the observations erroneous being simply considered as invalid.

The one-dimensional median m is maximally robust with breakdown point 0.5, but the mean g is not robust at all (has breakdown point 0). Indeed, taking any observation and moving it to infinity will always move g along beyond any bound, be it at a slower pace. The median m, however, stays fixed even if all data-points with value strictly greater than it (and this can be any fraction < 0.5) move to (any) higher values.

An even stronger property holds. Moving any subset of less than half (in frequency) of the data to any new position will possibly make the median move, but always to some point(s) of the convex hull of the original data. This follows because any new median cannot be smaller (nor larger) than all the unmoved points, since these have frequency higher than 0.5, which would contradict the definition of the median; so any new median must lie in the convex hull of the unmoved points. Therefore any median will always remain within a compact set, in this case the convex hull of the original data.

We prove below that the 1-median in location theory in any dimension and with any gauge satisfies a similar robustness property with breakdown point 0.5. This result was already obtained for the Euclidean norm by Lopuhaä and Rousseeuw (1991). Our proof is rather technical, having to rely quite heavily on convex analysis in order to make it applicable to any possibly non-differentiable and/or asymmetric gauge. It may be noted that the arguments may be simplified considerably when one assumes that the gauge is differentiable (except at 0) by invoking continuity of the gauge’s gradient at any non-zero vector.

                            would therefore contradict (27) and thus also (25). Thus it will follow that mE
                            must lie in Kτ
                           , proving that this Kτ
                            satisfies the announced claim and thus terminating the proof.

To construct Kτ
                            we use the fact that the subdifferential mapping of any convex function

                            is minimal when choosing u to be the Euclidean centre of A.)

                           which is the claimed property (28). The first inequality (32) stems from triangle inequality for ν°; the second (33) follows from linearity of ν° on the positive cone generated by ∂ν(t) in the first term and sublinearity of ν° in the second term; the third inequality (34) uses in the first term the fact that all subgradients of ν have ν°-length no higher than 1 and in the second term the strict inequality (31) for each c ∈ C.□

One should note that Kτ
                      increases unboundedly in size when τ decreases to 0. Indeed, the size of Kτ
                      is given by its radius U/min { Δ, 1 }, which is inversely proportional to Δ (when this is small enough) and when τ decreases to 0, ε also decreases to 0, so all δx
                      and therefore also Δ decrease to 0.

The ball constructed by Lopuhaä and Rousseeuw (1991) in the Euclidean distance case also has a size proportional with the sample size. We do not know if a uniformly bounded set K might exist in general that would contain all medians for any τ. As observed before this happens in the one-dimensional situation where the convex hull of A may play such a role. We conjecture this is the only case in which a uniform K exists valid for all τ > 0.

Using Theorem 6 we may now show how to construct situations for which the (Euclidean) distance between centroid and 1-median for any gauge approximates half of the (Euclidean) diameter of A as closely as wished.
