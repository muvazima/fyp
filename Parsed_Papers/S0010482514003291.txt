@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A graphical representation of a biological sequence is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing sequences. Many graphical methods have been designed to analyze DNA or a protein sequence. A DNA sequence is composed of four nucleic bases A, C, G and T. Comparing with the 20 amino acids in a protein sequence, four different symbols of the DNA sequence are beneficial to its graphical representation because of less symbol number. Early graphical methods of the DNA sequence include Hamori in 1983 [1], Hamori in 1989 [2] and Jeffrey in 1990 [3]. Afterwards, more graphical representations were well developed by researchers. For example, Nandy in 1994 [4] gave a graphical representation by assigning A, G, T and C to the four directions, (−x), (+x), (−y) and (+y), respectively. Bielinska-Waz [5–7], Liao [8–10], Randić [11–13], Jaklic [14], Li [15] and Qi [16–18] also proposed their graphical representations of the DNA sequence. These proposed graphical methods can provide direct insights into the local and global characteristics of DNA sequences.

Compared to the graphical representation of DNA sequences, the graphical representation of protein sequences is difficult because of the twenty amino acids. However, the advantages of graphical representation of protein sequences attract many researchers to develop different representation methods. The early graphical methods of protein sequences were presented in 2004 by Randić et al. [19,20]. They constructed the graphical representations of protein sequences based on the 64 codons. After that, researchers developed graphical representations of protein sequences in two main directions. One is not related to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. For instance, in 2006 Randić et al. [21] outlined a novel highly compact graphical representation for proteins based on a ‘magic circle’ of unit radius. In 2005 Bai and Wang [22] also proposed a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on nucleotide triplet codons. Recently, He et al. [23] presented a 3D graphical representation of protein sequences built on the Gray code. These methods don’t take the physicochemical properties of amino acids into account.

The other type of graphical representation for protein sequences is closely related to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. The physicochemical properties of amino acids are essential when separating, purifying and studying protein sequence profiles, folding, classifying and functions. The physicochemical properties have strong effects on the pattern of protein evolution. This is also an important reason for connecting physicochemical properties with graphical representations for protein sequences. However, it is difficult to take more physicochemical properties into consideration when graphically representing a protein sequence in 2D or 3D space. In 2007, Randić [24] first presented a 2D graphical representation of proteins built on the partial order of a selected pair of physicochemical properties of amino acids. This is a good contribution. Later, more researchers proposed their graphical representations with two or three types of physicochemical properties [25,26,27] in 2D or 3D space. In [28], Randić gave more comments for the graphical representations considering physicochemical properties. These graphical representations share a common feature that a protein sequence has a corresponding graphical space curve. They contribute to comparing the similarities and dissimilarities of protein sequences. Then, Yao et al. [29] proposed a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on six physicochemical properties of amino acids. Yu et al. [30] presented a new protein map which incorporated ten properties of amino acids. These methods which consider more than three physicochemical properties are difficult to visualize. A protein sequence is likely mapped into a set of graphical curves.

The graphical representation of a protein sequence is confronted with two difficulties, good visualization and more major physicochemical properties. In this article, we propose a protein mapping method based on 12 major physicochemical properties and the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The mapping without degeneracy and loss of information provides good visualization. With the graphical representation, the method is used to analyze the evolutionary relationship of two separate datasets. The results agree well with the known evolution fact and show the efficiency of our method. In addition, how to classify which proteins bind to nanoparticles in a sequence dependent manner is a major issue in medical applications in nanotechnology [31,32]. In [31], Monopoli et al. review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts. If a nanoparticle corona has given evidence of its preference for a protein sequence, here the proposed mapping method can be used to find more candidate proteins. This is a possible application in medical applications in nanotechnology.

Here, we consider 12 major physicochemical properties of amino acids, such as the chemical composition of the side chain [33], the polar requirement [34], the hydropathy index [35], the isoelectric point [36], the molecular volume [33], the polarity values [33], the aromaticity [37], the aliphaticity [37], the hydrogenation [37], the hydroxythiolation [37], the pK1(–COOH) [25], and the pK2(-

                                 H
                              
                              
                                 3

                        ) [25]. The characteristic physicochemical parameters of 20 amino acids are listed in 
                        Table 1. Based on the 12 physicochemical properties, we construct a 2D graphical representation of the protein sequence on two quadrants of the Cartesian coordinate system.

Good visualization is an important characteristic of graphic representation of the protein sequence. A normal resolution is to give a graphic representation for each property when we consider different physicochemical properties of amino acids. Then a protein sequence corresponds to several graphical curves. It is difficult for us to identify similar sequences from various groups of graphical curves, especially for longer proteins. A feasible method is to get the characteristic information from the 12 physicochemical properties, and show the distinguishing information in low-dimensional space. Based on the low-dimensional characteristic information, a protein sequence is easily represented as a graphical curve. The dimension reduction method can help us reach the goal for considering both different physicochemical properties and having good visualization. As for a simple and important dimension reduction method, principal component analysis (PCA) [38] is used to gather feature information from the 12 physicochemical properties.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson [39]). In [38], readers can find the detailed description of this method. This method is a mathematical procedure that uses orthogonal transformation to analyze a data set and reduce it from a set of high-dimensional variables into a few hidden variables while keeping the principal information on its variability. The few hidden variables are known as the principal components. Recently, PCA and its expanded methods have been used to solve many biological problems [40–43]. Here we give a simple description for the PCA method. Let

                           t
                         variables will have fewer dimensions than the original. Such dimensionality reduction can be a very useful step for visualising and processing a high-dimensional dataset.

Now, from the view of space geometry we first map 20 amino acids into a 12D space based on their 12 physicochemical properties in Table 1. Then, given a protein sequence, we need a 13D space to clearly represent it. It is not impossible for us to give its visible curve in the 13D space. To consider both different physicochemical properties and good visualization, we use the PCA method to transform the data to a new coordinate system with the principal components. 
                        Table 2 lists the 12 principal components and their percentages of the 20 amino acids by the PCA method. From the table, we find that the first principal axes account for 98.68% of the total inertia of the 12D space. No other axes account for more than 1.1%. The first principal axes occupied most of the information hidden in the 12 physicochemical properties. Hence, here we choose the first principal component and ignore the other principal components in order to consider both different physicochemical properties and good visualization. Next, founded on the values of the first principal component in Table 2 we can construct a novel 2D curve on the Cartesian coordinate system. We assign positive 
                           i
                         to the x-axis, 
                           i

                           i
                         denotes the index of the amino acid. 
                           N
                         is the length of the protein sequence. Now, let

                        . Connecting the adjacent points one by one, we can obtain the 2D graphical representation of the protein sequence 
                           S
                        .

To illustrate the effective visualization we give an example to show the proposed 2D graphical representation of the protein sequence. Let‘s consider a graphical comparison of several protein sequences belonging to nine ND5, Human (H. sapiens, YP_003024036.1), Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla, NP_008222.1), Chimpanzee (P. troglodytes, NP_008196.1), Fin whale (Balenoptera physalus, NP_006899.1), Blue whale (Balenoptera musculus, NP_007066.1), House mouse (M. musculus, NP_904338.1), Norway rat (R. norvegicus, YP_665639.1), Gallus (G. gallus, NP_006925.1), and the North American opossum (D. virginiana, NP_007105.1).

In 
                        Fig.1, we illustrate the 2D graphical curves of ND5 proteins for nine species. From the figure, we find that the ND5 protein curves of the Human, Gorilla and Chimpanzee are more similar to each other although there exists a little difference. The ND5 protein curves of the pairs, such as the Blue whale and Fin whale; the House mouse and Norway rat, are also more similar. What‘s more, ND5 protein curves of the Gallus and Opossum are much different from the other graphical curves.

Like the graphical representation methods without a loss of information, such as [15,44,45], the proposed graphical representation contains the following important properties.
                           Property 1
                           
                              There is a one-to-one mapping between a protein sequence and its 2D graphical curve.

We can construct the 2D graphical curve of a protein sequence

                               by connecting the adjacent points one by one. Let the adjacent point set be

                           Property 3
                           
                              The proposed 2D graphical curve has good visualization for protein sequences.

Proof. According to Propertys 1 and 2 we can find that the proposed 2D graphical curve is without the loss of information and degeneracy. It builds up a unique 2D graphical representation of a protein sequence. The features, uniqueness, without the loss of information and degeneracy, allows the proposed method to have good visualization for protein sequences. To illustrate the effective visualization, we use it to represent the HA genes of six influenza A (H1N1) isolates. In 
                        Fig. 2 we show the global and local graphical curves of the HA genes. From Fig. 2 (1), it is easy to identify that from the global view the six HA genes are different. Fig. 2(2) illustrates clearly more details. There are two main clusters. The curves 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                         and 
                           c
                         are classified into one cluster. The curves 
                           d
                        , 
                           e
                         and 
                           f
                         are clustered into the other cluster. The curves 
                           a
                        , 
                           b
                         and
                           c
                         are the new infectious influenza isolates including A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (2009/04/09). Here, the proposed 2D graphical method gives good visualization for the sequences.

Comparison of biological sequences is a major problem for biologists. Defining some sensitive invariants from the graphical representation of DNA or a protein sequence is one of the main approaches to perform similarity analysis. Some invariants, such as 
                        E
                      matrix, 
                        M
                        /
                        M
                      matrix and 
                        L
                        /
                        L
                      matrix [46], 7-vector [47], and cumulative distance [48,49], were proposed to perform a comparison of similarities/dissimilarities of different biological sequences. The invariants were proved to be useful in capturing the base composition and distribution of a sequence by a quantitative manner. Here, we construct a 20-dimensional vector 
                        V
                      to represent a protein sequence. The 20-dimensional vector 
                        V
                      is directly extracted from the proposed graphical curve. Then, we give the definition of 
                        V
                      in detail below.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we will give two data sets to illustrate the use of the proposed characteristic vector 
                        V
                      of a protein sequence.

To validate the proposed method, we first give a comparison of protein sequences consisting of nine ND6 proteins, Human (YP_003024037), North American opossum (NP_007106), Gallus (NP_006927), House mouse (NP_904339), Norway rat (YP_665640), Blue whale (NP_007067), Fin whale (NP_006900), Gorilla (NP_008223), and the Chimpanzee (NP_008197). According to the method proposed above, each of nine ND6 proteins is associated with a 20-dimensional vector. Then, we can calculate the distances among the sequences by the proposed distance formula 
                           D
                           (
                           
                              
                                 V
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 V
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        .

In 
                        Table 3, we show the similarity/dissimilarity matrix for the nine ND6 proteins. Observing Table 3, we find that three sets of species are very close to each other among the nine species. The first group of species is the Human, Gorilla and Chimpanzee. The second group of species is the Blue whale and the Fin whale. The third group of species is the House mouse and the Norway rat. The results show these species have a close evolutionary relationship. The North American opossum and Gallus show a strong dissimilarity among the nine species according to the larger entries. They have a further evolutionary relationship with other species.

For comparison, we make comparisons of the Human with the eight other species by different methods, this mapping method, Yao [50], EMBOSS Needle (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle/nucleotide.html) and EMBOSS Water (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_water/nucleotide.html). The results are shown in 
                        Table 4. Observing Table 4, we find that the results by the proposed mapping method are consistent with those by the other three methods though the results by different methods show little diversity. From a statistical standpoint, this small diversity is acceptable.

4.2 Cluster analyses of HA genes of the influenza A (H1N1) isolate from March to April of 2009

Here, we give another application for the cluster analysis of HA genes of influenza A (H1N1) isolates. In April 2009, a new infectious influenza A (H1N1) virus, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, emerged and showed a strong ability to be transmitted from human to human, spreading worldwide [48]. The HA gene sequences of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus from March to April of 2009 are downloaded from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/SwineFlu.html). We get 584 HA gene sequences with full-length. By the proposed method, each of the 584 sequences is associated with a 20-dimensional vector. We can have a vector set with 584 20-dimensional vectors.

For the vector set with 584 20-dimensional vectors, we need a 584×584 matrix to represent their evolutionary distances by the proposed distance formula 
                           D
                           (
                           
                              
                                 V
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                           
                           
                              
                                 V
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        . The matrix is too big for us to find the evolutionary relationship of the 584 HA gene sequences. To easily indicate the evolutionary relationship, we consider their graphical mapping in 2D space. By the PCA method we project the 584 20-dimensional vectors onto a 2D coordinate system by the first and the second principal axes. The first and the second principal axes account for 92.68% and 3.33% of the total inertia of the 20D space, respectively. 
                        Fig.3 shows all isolates are classified into two distinct clusters of the first principal axis. This indicates there was a very different strain of the influenza A (H1N1) isolates from March to April of 2009. The evolutionary fact is that in April 2009 a new infectious influenza A (H1N1) virus, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, emerged and showed a strong ability to be transmitted from human to human [51]. In Fig.3 we show the new cluster with the strain, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). The results are also consistent with the works by Qi et al. [52].

For comparison, we use the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software MEGA 6.05 (http://megasoftware.net/) to build up the evolutionary tree of the 584 HA gene sequences in order to compare with the proposed method in this article. We first use the Muscle module of MEGA to align all the sequences. Then, the neighbour-joining module of MEGA is used to construct an evolutionary tree. 
                        Fig.4 gives the Circle graph of the evolutionary tree which shows all isolates are classified into the two main clusters, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. In Fig.4 the typical strain of Cluster 2, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), is also marked. Then, comparing Fig.3 and Fig.4, we find that in essence the results by the proposed mapping method are consistent with those by the MEGA software though the results have a different representational form.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we propose a new graphical map of a protein sequence based on 12 major physicochemical properties of amino acids and the PCA method. The 20 amino acids when considering 12 physicochemical properties are viewed as the points in the 20D space. By the PCA method these points are mapped into the first principal axis which accounts for 98.68% of the total inertia of the 12D space. The first principal axis occupies most of the information hidden in the 12 physicochemical properties. The proposed graphical map has several important properties. There is a one-to-one mapping between a protein sequence and its 2D graphical representation. There is no circuit in the proposed 2D graphical representation. The proposed 2D graphical representation has good visualization for the protein sequence. Based on the graphical map we use a 20D vector to characterize the protein sequence. Then with the graphical representation, the method is used to perform two separate applications, similarity comparison of nine ND6 proteins, and cluster analysis of HA genes of influenza A (H1N1) isolates from March to April of 2009. The results illustrate the utility of the proposed method.
