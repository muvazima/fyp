                  Rule-of-thumb based design for cutting tools and machining settings in face-hobbing of bevel gears result in cutting tool failures and quality issues. Lack of a virtual machining environment, to efficiently obtain the instantaneous un-deformed chip geometry and predict cutting forces in face-hobbing, causes undesirable production costs in industries. In the present paper, semi-analytical representation of the projection of the un-deformed chip on the rake face of the cutting blades is presented. The proposed approach is drastically fast and more accurate in comparison with numerical methods and can be implemented in a virtual gear machining environment. The cutting system intricate geometry, multi-axis machine tool kinematic chains and the variant cutting velocity along the cutting edge are taken into consideration to obtain the chip geometry efficiently. Then, cutting forces are predicted during face-hobbing by implementing oblique cutting theory using the derived chip geometry and converting face-hobbing into oblique cutting. The proposed methods are applied on two case studies of face-hobbing of bevel gears, and the chip geometry is derived and the cutting forces are predicted.

Face-hobbing is the most productive process to manufacture bevel gears. Due to the high productivity of the process, tool wear is a serious challenge in face-hobbing. The tool wear phenomenon is a result of excessive and varying cutting force distribution along the cutting edges of the blades in face-hobbing. Although face-hobbing is quite widespread, there is little research on cutting force and un-deformed chip geometry in this process. The machining performance (tool wear, deflection, breakage chatter, etc.) are affected severely by machining settings and instantaneous un-deformed chip geometry.

The conventional method to derive the un-deformed chip geometry is to obtain instantaneous in-process model of the workpiece during machining. Nikolaos and Artomenis  [1], Vasilis et al.  [2], Dimitriou and Antoniadis  [3] and Artomenis  [4] implemented CSG (Constructive Solid Ground) method and Boolean operation to simulate hobbing of helical gears. They developed software called HOB3D®  for hobbing simulation. Brecher et al. [5–7] simulated face-milling of bevel gears using ray tracing and STL (triangular mesh) penetration calculation. They implemented their algorithm in face-milling simulation software called KegelSpan®. All the mentioned research works have implemented computationally expensive methods. Moreover, they have not worked on face-hobbing.

Face-hobbing is the most complicated bevel gear manufacturing process because of varying cutting velocity along the cutting edge of the cutting blades. This kind of varying velocity is created due to special geometry of the cutting system and multi-axes machine tool kinematic chains. Therefore, obtaining instantaneous un-deformed chip geometry is a challenging process. The only research work on un-deformed chip geometry in face-hobbing was conducted by Habibi and Chen  [8]. They have proposed numerical methods to obtain the projection of un-deformed chip geometry on the rake face of the cutting blades,

                     , by discretizing the workpiece into two dimensional elements, disks, and intersecting the cutting edge of all blades with each disk. Although their methods are able to obtain the chip geometry and predict the cutting forces in non-generated face-hobbing, the computational cost of the methods is quite high (in scale of hours) and the accuracy of the derived chip geometry severely depends on how fine the workpiece is discretized. In addition, finer discretization means even higher computational cost. Moreover, the method fails to represent the accurate

                      on the rake especially near the tool tip where it is a critical region because the cutting force distribution has the highest value in this area. The method is mainly inefficient due to fact that the approximate workpiece in-process model needs to be obtained numerically prior to derive the chip geometry.

In the present paper, semi-analytical approach is introduced to define

                      mathematically in non-generated face-hobbing. Closed form formulations of boundaries and the area of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 Ch
                              
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                      are obtained. Since the boundaries are piecewise, the curve parameter range of each piece is derived numerically by solving constructed equations. Since the un-deformed chip geometry is defined semi-analytically, the computational cost is reduced drastically from hours (using numerical method presented in Ref.  [8]) to scale of few seconds. In addition, the accuracy of the chip geometry is quite high in comparison with the results of Ref.  [8]. Since the cutting velocity varies along the cutting edge, the differential undeformed chip geometry is defined locally at each point on the cutting edge considering the corresponding cutting velocity.

In order to derive the chip geometry, the mathematical representation of the cutting edge and the cutting surfaces needs to be obtained. Based on homogeneous matrix transformation method, many research works  [9–15] have represented the cutting surfaces in face-milling or face-hobbing mathematically. They used either Gleason Works’ cutting systems  [10,11,13–15] or Klingelnberg’s [9,12]. Habibi and Chen  [15] re-designed the conventional design of Gleason TRI-AC®  cutting system to improve tool wear characteristics of the cutting blades. In the present paper, their representation of cutting edge and surfaces are used.

In order to derive the cutting forces during face-hobbing, the method presented in  [16] (which is known as “unified mechanics of cutting” method) is applied on face-hobbing. The method is capable of predicting cutting forces for any cutting processes as long as the chip geometry, cutting velocity, rake and inclination angles along the cutting edge are defined. The oblique cutting theory is applied to the process. The cutting edge of the blades is converted into many small elements. Each differential element represents a scenario of oblique cutting. In other words, face-hobbing is transformed to the oblique cutting concept. The total cutting forces is calculated by integrating differential cutting forces associated with all oblique elements along the cutting edge.

In the present paper, Gleason TRI-AC®  cutting system, non-generating kinematic chains and workpiece geometry are described in Section  2. In Section  3, the projection of un-deformed chip geometry on the rake face of the cutting blades,

                     , is derived. The cutting forces are predicted in Section  4. Finally, in Section  5, two case studies are presented which for both, the in-process model of the workpiece and the un-deformed chip geometry are derived and the cutting forces are predicted.

In face-hobbing, a cutter head and groups of cutting blades make a cutting system (Fig. 1
                     ). In the concept of half profile blades, one inside and one outside blade create a blade group. Each blade is mounted inside a cutter head slot with a special orientation. In the present paper, the mathematical representation of the cutting edge and cutting surfaces of outside blades are mentioned. However, in case of inside blades, all the formulations can be used easily since the inside blade is a symmetry of the outside blade.

The cutting edge, rake and relief surfaces are the most important features of the cutting blades. Three coordinate systems are needed to construct the blade model, Se, Sb and St.
                        ZeXe and ZeYe planes of the coordinate system Se are parallel to the blade front and side planes, respectively. The origin of Se is at the pitch point 
                           
                              P
                           
                        . The coordinate system Sb is created by a rotation of Se about Xe by a hook angle, 
                           
                              
                                 η
                              
                              
                                 b
                              
                           
                        . The coordinate system St is just a translation of Se to the tool tip, TT (see Fig. 2
                        ).

In non-generated face-hobbing, the cutting system rotates (
                           θ
                        ) and translates (Feed) towards the workpiece as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3
                        .

In order to find the effects of each cutting blade on the workpiece, the cutting surfaces are formulated in the workpiece coordinate system, Sw. In other words, the cutting blade motion should be seen by an observer connected rigidly to the workpiece. In order to do so, a series of matrix transformations are formulated as follows:

                         Eq. (12) is a formulation of a unique surface called the cutting surface in terms of two independent variables, 
                           s
                         and 
                           θ
                        . Fig. 4
                         shows cutting surfaces of a single outside blade for five rotations of the cutting system. As it can be imagined, taking into account the cutting surfaces of all the blades considering the process kinematic and their interaction with the workpiece makes a very complicated scenario to be simulated. Detailed descriptions in this matter can be found in  [8] in which face-hobbing is simulated numerically.

In this paper, the geometry of the workpiece in face-milling is represented by the bevel gear geometric parameters (pitch angle,

                           b
                        ). Fig. 5
                         shows the axisymmetric section of the workpiece with the parameters.

The most important significance of the proposed method is that the workpiece in-process model is integrated semi-analytically in the boundary theory of the chip provided in the present paper. In other words, the in-process model is implemented in the boundaries of the chip formulations. Boundaries of the chip are

                      is derived from the boundary surfaces of the workpiece. Therefore, using the proposed method, the need for updating in-process model is eliminated by integrating it into the boundary theory of the chip derivation. Obtaining the in-process model was the core of the conventional methods to derive chip geometry in such a way that at every time instant during machining this model must be updated (most of the times using computationally expensive numerical methods such as STL penetration, Boolean operation or Z-buffer representation).

                      can be obtained easily using Green’s theorem. However, in order to find the area of the un-deformed chip, the varying cutting velocity along the cutting edge must be taken into consideration. In addition, the mechanistic model of cutting forces needs the differential area of undeformed chip geometry at any point on the engaging cutting edge. This concept is discussed in the following section.

In the present research, the cutting forces in face-hobbing are predicted using a method developed by Habibi and Chen  [8]. The method transforms face-hobbing to many infinitesimal oblique cutting cuts (Fig. 7
                     ).

                      in Fig. 7 is the projection of the undeformed chip geometry on the rake face of the cutting blade for a small oblique cut.

                      is the area of the undeformed chip of the differential oblique cut.

For each oblique elements along the cutting edge, the corresponding differential cutting forces are calculated as follows:

In order to have accurate predicted cutting forces, cutting force coefficients must be estimated accurately experimentally. To do so, experimental orthogonal cutting tests (turning operations) are carried out by different feed rates, spindle speeds (which define cutting speed) and rake angles. The obtained orthogonal cutting parameters (estimated using turning experiments),

However, Eqs. (37)–(39) are still valid to transform orthogonal cutting parameters to oblique cutting parameters. Integrating the differential forces formulated in Eqs. (34)–(36) leads to the total cutting force,

                         shows the predicted total cutting forces for case study I by semi-analytical method (present work), numerical method (Habibi and Chen  [8]) and finite element analysis. The chosen outside blade passes through the same slot only four times (cycles a, b, c and d in Fig. 9 top).

In order to validate the predicted cutting forces, the corresponding cutting forces are obtained using the commercial finite element machining software, Third Wave AdvantEdge®, for several sample locations of the blade at different cutter head rotation angles, 
                           θ
                        . The workpiece and blade material are selected from the software library as

                         and Carbide-Grade-P, respectively. Maximum and minimum element sizes for the tool are assigned to 1 and 0.03 mm, respectively. Minimum element size is assigned to the cutting edge. Minimum chip element is set to 0.01 mm and initial temperature is 20°C. The workpiece and tool CAD models are modeled in CATIA™ and then, STEP models of them are imported in Third Wave®. When STEP models of the tool and workpiece are imported to the software, it requires assigning boundary conditions on both models. All nodes on the assigned boundary surfaces are fixed. In the simulations, the back face of the cutter and peripheral surfaces of the workpiece which are not engaged in the cutting process are set as boundaries.

The tool-workpiece material pair is the same as the material pair used to derive orthogonal cutting parameters (Eq. (41)). The selected blade locations, or cutter head rotation angles, are chosen in such a way that represents the shape of the cutting force diagrams properly in Fig. 9. Since the complex blade path in space with respect to the workpiece coordinate system cannot be modeled in ThirdWave®, therefore, the machining is assumed to be a straight cut at each selected location. Thus, the workpiece is modeled using the geometry of derived

                         at each chosen location, and the blade is mounted with respect to the workpiece using the corresponding average cutting velocity vector along the cutting edge. Fig. 10
                         shows an example of conducted FE analysis at

The predicted total cutting forces and Third Wave®  results have less than 21% difference. The predicted cutting forces, in feed direction, show less than 11% difference. Reasons for these differences are explained in Ref.  [8] extensively.

The semi-analytical cutting force results are in good agreement with numerical results from Habibi and Chen  [8]. However, the obtained chip is more accurate in the semi-analytical approach than the numerical method. In some locations, the numerical method overestimates, as in 
                           θ
                           =

                         (Fig. 9(a)). If the workpiece is discretized by a finer step size, the numerical results converge to semi-analytic results theoretically.

                      is piecewise, the curve parameter range for each piece is obtained numerically by solving constructed equations.

At each point on the cutting edge, the un-deformed chip geometry at an infinitesimal vicinity of the point is obtained. Face-hobbing is converted geometrically along the cutting edge of the blades into many small oblique cuts. The differential cutting forces, for each cut, are formulated at each point on the cutting edge using oblique cutting theory. Normal rake and inclination angles, and the un-deformed chip thickness are derived at each point on the cutting edge at each moment of face-hobbing machining and plugged into cutting force formulations. The chosen orthogonal cutting parameters are assumed to be in terms of normal rake angle and un-deformed chip thickness.

Gleason TRI-AC®  cutting system is selected and the semi analytical approach is applied on two case studies on non-generated (Formate™) process. For the first case study, the predicted cutting forces are compared with the obtained cutting forces using a numerical method as well as a commercial finite element machining software, Third Wave AdvantEdge®. The predicted cutting forces are in good agreement with the results of the numerical method. The comparison shows less than 11% difference between the predicted cutting force by the semi-analytical method and the results of ThirdWave®  in feed direction. In addition, regions of the local tool wear (the tool corner) are predicted with a good agreement with experimental reports using the obtained cutting force distribution along the cutting edge.

The present work opens new doors for future studies on the cutting system design for face-hobbing of bevel gears based on cutting force prediction rather than just trial and error. In addition, the machining settings such as feed rates and cutter head rotary speed could be estimated and optimized prior to real machining based on the predicted cutting forces. Optimization of cutting forces, machining settings and cutting blade geometry is the topic of the future research of the authors. Since the cutting forces can be predicted computationally efficiently (using the proposed method represented in the present paper), optimization problems with different objective functions and constraints can be solved. Since for solving optimization problems many iterations should be calculated to finally reach to the solution for the problem, using an efficient method presented in the present paper is essential. In the optimization problem, the plunge feed (acceleration) and angular velocity of the cutter head are adjusted to reach the desired cutting force curves while minimizing machining time. In other words, an optimization problem is defined in such a way that machining time is minimized subject to an inequality constraint which is

Moreover, the simulation of generated face-hobbing could be the topic for further studies since the present work was conducted on non-generated process. In generated process, closed form equations of cutting surfaces are complicated to represent. Therefore, the semi-analytical representation of the un-deformed chip geometry would be a challenging issue. However, the basics presented in this paper could be applied on generated process as well.
