                  We provide a simple, efficient technique for computing μ-bases for quadric surfaces from their rational quadratic parametrizations. Our major innovation is to simplify the computations by using complex parameters, even though all the surfaces we treat have only real coefficients in both their implicit and parametric representations. In addition to the theory, we provide several examples to illustrate our method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     μ-Bases are a powerful tool for analyzing the algebraic and geometric properties of rational curves and surfaces. For example, μ-bases for rational planar curves can be used to easily retrieve both the implicit and parametric equations of these curves as well as to locate and analyze their singular points (Chen and Wang, 2003a; Chen et al., 2008; Jia and Goldman, 2009, 2012).

Straightforward, efficient techniques are known for computing μ-bases for rational curves of arbitrary degree in arbitrary dimensions (Song and Goldman, 2009), but computing μ-bases for rational surfaces of arbitrary degree in just 3-dimensions is, in general, notoriously difficult (Chen et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2005). Currently the only exception to this seemingly intractable problem for high degree surfaces is constructing μ-bases for rational ruled surfaces from parametrizations of bidegree 
                        (
                        1
                        ,
                        n
                        )
                     , which essentially can be reduced to computing μ-bases for rational curves (Chen and Wang, 2003b; Chen et al., 2001).

In contrast, for surfaces in 3-dimensions with rational quadratic parametrizations there do exist straightforward techniques for finding a μ-basis. A method for computing μ-bases for quadric surfaces with rational quadratic representations is presented in Chen et al. (2007). The construction involves solving two systems of linear equations, each with 12 unknowns, to generate three moving planes that follow the surface. The implicit, parametric, and inversion equations for the surface can all be retrieved from these three moving planes. Analogous techniques for finding μ-bases for cubic and quartic surfaces with rational quadratic parametrizations are presented in Wang et al. (2008), Wang and Chen (2012).

Here we shall concentrate on developing novel, efficient methods for computing μ-bases for non-ruled quadric surfaces. The non-degenerate quadric surfaces in affine space can be grouped into seven distinct types: ellipsoids, elliptical paraboloids, hyperbolic paraboloids, hyperboloids of one and two sheets, elliptical cones, and cylinders over conic sections. The cylinders, cones, hyperbolic paraboloids, and hyperboloids of one sheet are ruled surfaces. Thus we are left with three distinct types of non-ruled quadric surfaces: ellipsoids, elliptical paraboloids, and hyperboloids of two sheets.


                     The primary goal of this paper is to provide a simple, efficient technique for computing μ-bases for these three types of non-ruled quadric surfaces — the ellipsoids (including spheres), elliptical paraboloids, and hyperboloids of two sheets — from their rational quadratic parametrizations. We shall then use these μ-bases to compute the implicit equation and inversion formulas for these non-ruled quadric surfaces. We shall see too that our method also works for finding the implicit equation for the ruled quadric surfaces from their rational quadratic parametrizations. Our major innovation is to allow complex parameters in these computations, even though all the surfaces we treat have only real coefficients in both their implicit and parametric representations. Using complex parameters allows us to solve fewer equations with fewer unknowns than

                     . The motivation for using complex parameters is that quadric surfaces that are not ruled in real affine space are nonetheless ruled in complex projective space (
                     
                        Pedoe, 1988
                     
                     ).

This paper is structured in the following fashion. In Section 2 we review the notion of μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces. We explain our method and why it works in Section 3, and we provide examples of our techniques in action for both non-ruled and ruled quadric surfaces in Section 4. We close in Section 5 with some observations about the strengths and weaknesses of our method.

To fix our notation and terminology, we shall briefly review here the notions of syzygies, moving lines, moving planes, and μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces.

A μ-basis for ruled surfaces can be constructed from two moving planes that follow the surface, since the intersection of two moving planes that follow a surface is a moving line that lies on the surface. Our problem is that in real affine space the ellipsoid, the elliptical paraboloid, and the hyperboloid of two sheets are not ruled. Nevertheless, and this is the key insight, all quadric surfaces are ruled surfaces in complex projective space. Therefore to construct these non-ruled quadric surfaces from two moving planes, we need to invoke complex parameters.

Consider then a moving plane

                      This equation leads to 10 conditions: the coefficient of all the monomials up to degree 3 must vanish. These constraints are non-linear, so the solutions are, in general, complex numbers. We could solve these 10 non-linear equations in 14 unknowns, but there is a simpler way.

                      must vanish on the surface. Thus this determinant is either identically zero or this determinant represents the implicit equation of the quadric surface. We shall see in Section 4 that this determinant does indeed represent the implicit equation of the quadric surface, even though the quadric surface may have only real coefficients and some of the parameters

                      may be complex numbers.

We can also recover the parametric equations of the surface from these two moving planes. Since these moving planes are complex valued, each moving plane splits into one real and one imaginary moving plane that must also follow the surface. In this way we actually generate four real moving planes that follow the surface. Since each of these moving planes is orthogonal to the surface, only three of these moving planes can be independent. Moreover the outer product of any three linear combinations of these moving planes must be orthogonal to each of the constituent moving planes and therefore parallel to the parametrization of the quadric surface. Thus we can recover the parametrization of the quadric surface from the outer product of three of these moving planes.

Finally, this method can also be applied to find inversion formulas for the parameters

We shall now provide examples to flesh out our methods. In these examples we use homogeneous parametrizations with homogeneous parameters 
                        (
                        s
                        ,
                        t
                        ,
                        u
                        )
                     , since the base points of these parametrizations often occur at infinity (i.e. where 
                        u
                        =
                        0
                     ). But we must take special care when using homogeneous parameters because the syzygy module of the homogeneous parametrization of a rational surface is not a free module. Therefore when we want to retrieve the parametrization from the μ-basis, we need to dehomogenize both the μ-basis and the parametrization.

To show how to find a complex μ-basis for a non-ruled quadric surface and how to use this complex μ-basis to recover the implicit, parametric and inversion equations of the surface, we will illustrate our methods in action with three non-ruled quadrics: a sphere, a hyperboloid of two sheets, and an elliptical paraboloid.

                           The hyperboloid of two sheets


                           The hyperboloid of 2 sheets has essential the same parametrization as the sphere, but with the equations for the z and w coordinates reversed. Thus the hyperboloid of 2 sheets has the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrization

Our method can also be used to find the implicit equation of any ruled quadric surface with a rational quadratic parametrization. But there are some differences when we apply the method to ruled quadrics. For non-ruled quadric surfaces, the base points are complex, but for ruled quadric surfaces the base points are real. Thus for non-ruled quadrics we generate two complex moving planes that follow the surface, which decompose into four real moving planes. But for ruled quadrics, we generate only two real moving planes that follow the surface, so for ruled quadrics the method is not as powerful: we can compute the implicit equation from these two moving planes, but the method fails to retrieve either the parametric equations or the inversion formulas because we no longer have a basis for the syzygy module of the parametrization. Below we illustrate this method for ruled quadric surfaces with the hyperbolic paraboloid and the right circular cone.

                               Notice that since the moving planes are real, we have only two moving planes, not four, that follow the hyperbolic paraboloid, and we cannot retrieve the parametric equations from these two moving planes. Moreover, we do not get inversions formulas. Indeed in this case if we try to solve the equations

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The use of complex parameters and complex moving planes that follow a rational surface works nicely for finding complex analogues of μ-bases for non-ruled quadric surfaces. But this method is not a panacea. We have seen that the same method, without complex parameters, can be used to find the implicit equation of a ruled quadric surface with a rational quadratic parametrization, but in general for ruled quadric surfaces this method fails to retrieve either the parametric equations or the inversion formulas.

Moreover, different parametric representations for the same algebraic surface may have different syzygy modules. Thus the method can fail even for higher degree parametrizations of non-ruled quadric surfaces. For example, there is a biquadratic parametrization of the sphere given by
