                  Many of the methods which deal with the reduction of dimensionality in matrices of data are based on mathematical techniques such as distance-based algorithms or matrix decomposition and eigenvalues. Recently a group of likelihood-based finite mixture models for a data matrix with binary or count data, using basic Bernoulli or Poisson building blocks has been developed. This is extended and establishes likelihood-based multivariate methods for a data matrix with ordinal data which applies fuzzy clustering via finite mixtures to the ordered stereotype model. Model-fitting is performed using the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, and a fuzzy allocation of rows, columns, and rows and columns simultaneously to corresponding clusters is obtained. A simulation study is presented which includes a variety of scenarios in order to test the reliability of the proposed model. Finally, the results of the application of the model in two real data sets are shown.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

An ordinal variable is one with a categorical data scale which describes order, and where the distinct levels of such a variable differ in degree of dissimilarity more than in quality (Agresti, 2010). This is different from nominal variables which vary in quality, not in quantity, and thus the order of listing the categories is irrelevant. For example, Likert scale responses in a questionnaire might be “disagree”, “neither agree nor disagree” or “agree”. In his seminal paper, Stevens (1946) called a scale ordinal if “any order-preserving transformation will leave the scale form invariant”. Although the collection and use of ordinal variables is common, most of the current methods for analyzing them treat the data as if they were nominal (Hoffman and Franke, 1986) or continuous data (Agresti, 2010). On the one hand, treating an ordered categorical variable as ordinal rather than nominal provides advantages in the analysis such as simplifying the data description and allowing the use of more parsimonious models. The nominal approach ignores the intrinsic ordering of the data and thus the statistical results are less powerful than they could be. On the other hand, models for continuous variables have similarities to those for ordinal variables although the use of them with ordinal variables has disadvantages such as the treatment of the output categories as equally spaced, which they may not be (see Agresti, 2010, Sections 1.2–1.3 for a list of advantages from treating an ordinal variable as ordinal rather than nominal or continuous).

Categorical data analysis methods were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s (Bock and Jones, 1968; Snell, 1964), including loglinear models and logistic regression (see the review by Liu and Agresti, 2005). An increasing interest in ordinal data has since produced the articles by Goodman (1979) and McCullagh (1980) on loglinear modeling relating to ordinal odds ratios, and logit modeling of cumulative probabilities respectively. Recently, new ordinal data analysis methods have been introduced such as the proportional odds model version of the cumulative logit model, and the stereotype model with ordinal scores (Agresti, 2010, Chap. 3 and 4) from which new lines of research have developed. Two recent examples of these are the application of a stereotype model in a case-control study by Ahn et al. (2009), and a new methodology to fit a stratified proportional odds model by Mukherjee et al. (2008). In particular, the stereotype model is a paired-category logit model which is an alternative when the fit of cumulative logits and adjacent-categories logit models in their proportional odds version is poor. Anderson (1984) proposed this model as nested between the adjacent-categories logit model and the standard baseline-category logits model (see the review by Agresti, 2002, Chapter 6).

In the research literature, multiple algorithms and techniques have been developed which deal with the clustering of data such as hierarchical clustering (Johnson, 1967; Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990), association analysis (Manly, 2005) and partition optimization methods such as the 
                        k
                     -means clustering algorithm (Jobson, 1992; Lewis et al., 2003; McCune and Grace, 2002). There has been research on cluster analysis for ordinal data based on latent class models (see Agresti and Lang, 1993; Moustaki, 2000; Vermunt, 2001; DeSantis et al., 2008; Breen and Luijkx, 2010; McPartland and Gormley, 2013 and the review by Agresti, 2010, Section 10.1). There are a number of clustering methods based on mathematical techniques such as distance metrics (Everitt et al., 2001), association indices (Wu et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011), matrix decomposition and eigenvalues (Quinn and Keough, 2002; Manly, 2005; Wu et al., 2007). However, these do not have a likelihood based formulation, and do not provide a reliable method of model selection or assessment. A particularly powerful model-based approach to one-mode clustering based on finite mixtures, with the variables in the columns being utilized to cluster the subjects in the rows, is provided by McLachlan and Basford (1988), McLachlan and Peel (2000), Everitt et al. (2001), Böhning et al. (2007), Wu et al. (2008) and Melnykov and Maitra (2010).

The simultaneous clustering of rows and columns into row clusters and column clusters is called biclustering (or block clustering or two-mode clustering). Biclustering models based on double 
                        k
                     -means have been developed in Vichi (2001) and Rocci and Vichi (2008). A hierarchical Bayesian procedure for biclustering is given in DeSarbo et al. (2004). Biclustering using mixtures has been proposed for binary data in Pledger (2000), Arnold et al. (2010) and Labiod and Nadif (2011), and for count data in Govaert and Nadif (2010). An approach via finite mixtures for binary and count data using basic Bernoulli or Poisson building blocks has been developed in Govaert and Nadif (2010) and Pledger and Arnold (2014). This work expanded previous research for one-mode fuzzy cluster analysis based on finite mixtures (McLachlan and Basford, 1988; McLachlan and Peel, 2000; Everitt et al., 2001) to a suite of models including biclustering. Finally, Matechou et al. (2011) have recently developed biclustering models for ordinal data using the assumption of proportional odds and having a likelihood-based foundation. The main difference with our work is that we use the assumption of ordinal stereotype model which has the advantage of allowing us to determine a new spacing of the ordinal categories, dictated by the data.

In this article, we present an extension of the likelihood-based models proposed in Pledger and Arnold (2014) by applying them to matrices with ordinal data by using finite mixtures to define a fuzzy clustering. We use the ordered stereotype model introduced by Anderson (1984) in order to formulate the ordinal approach, which has rarely been used so far. Two possible reasons for this lack of use might be the absence of standard software for model fitting and its unusual structure including the product of parameters in the linear predictor (Kuss, 2006). The plan of the article is as follows. Section  2 has definitions of the models and its formulation including fuzzy clustering via finite mixtures. Model fitting by using the iterative EM algorithm is described in Section  3. Section  4 presents a review of several model comparison measures and a comparison of eleven information criteria performance. Two real-life examples and simulation studies are given in Section  5, and we conclude with a discussion in Section  6.

In this section, we give the standard definition of the ordered stereotype model (Section  2.1) followed by a modification to include clustering (Section  2.2). The likelihood for the suite of basic models is provided next (Section  2.3).

                        Greenland (1994) showed that the stereotype model is appropriate when the progression of the response variable occurs through various stages. Agresti (2010) (see Chapter 4) showed that the stereotype model is equivalent to an ordinal model, such as the proportional odds version of the adjacent-categories logit model, when the scores

                         are a linear function of the different categories of the response variable. An advantage of the stereotype model is that it is more parsimonious than the baseline-category logit model or the multinomial logistic regression model. In addition, the ordered stereotype model is more flexible than the models including the proportional odds structure such as the version for the cumulative logit model (Agresti, 2010, Section 4.3.4) as a result of the

The main problem with the model in (4) is that the specific row and column effects in this suite of models over-parametrizes the data structure. This model is not parsimonious and it requires a lot of parameters for describing all the effects. A way to reduce the dimensionality of the problem is to introduce fuzzy clustering via finite mixtures. Hence, we obtain the following model formulation including row clustering, column clustering or biclustering.

In this section, we summarize the likelihood functions for the cases of row clustering, column clustering and biclustering. The formulation of the complete data log-likelihood is given in each case.

As we noted in the previous section, the unknown data in the case of the row-clustered model is the actual membership of the rows among the 
                              R
                            row-clusters. Thus, the incomplete data likelihood only sums over all possible partitions of rows into 
                              R
                            clusters:

                            We estimate the MLEs from this expression by using the EM algorithm. In the E-step, the expected value of the first term is approximated using the variational approximation employed by Govaert and Nadif (2005) (see Appendix C for details). With the aim of ensuring a solution avoiding approximations, we use the resulting MLEs from the EM algorithm as starting points to numerically maximize the incomplete-data log-likelihood (12) (or (13)). We note that during the maximization a convenient transformation for the row and column membership parameters

In this section, we develop a model fitting procedure using the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). One of the most common uses of the EM algorithm is in the case of the estimation of the parameters for a finite mixture-density model with incomplete data which in this case is the actual unknown cluster membership of each row and/or column. This method performs a fuzzy assignment of rows and/or columns to clusters based on the posterior probabilities. In this section, we develop this in detail for the case of clustering the rows but not the columns. It has a easy interpretation which helps explain of our methodology. The development for other two cases: clustering the columns but not the rows and biclustering are described in the Appendices B and C.

We apply the E-Step in the EM algorithm by considering the

                         as latent variables. In this manner, we use their a priori probabilities

                         A disadvantage of mixture modeling is that the associated likelihood surface may be multimodal. A comprehensive search over different starting points is used to avoid finding only a local maximum. Particularly in our case, the iterative process is repeated 10 times with random starting points and the best MLE (those that lead to higher log-likelihood value) are kept. We have run experiments testing up to 100 random starting points and it was sufficient with 10 repetitions to avoid convergence to local optima.

Finally, we have implemented the EM algorithm for the ordered stereotype model including clustering via finite mixtures and set up the simulation study by using the statistical package R 2.15.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010). The maximization was carried out by using the quasi-Newton method provided as an option in optim().

There are two main approaches to the comparison of a set of candidate likelihood-based models once they are fitted, in order to decide which one (or group of them) best approximates the (unknown) true model. One approach is to carry out a hypothesis test by using the likelihood ratio as a test statistic (LRT). Another approach uses information criteria which are based on a penalized form of the likelihood function where the penalty increases as the number of parameters in the model increases. Some of the most common information criteria measures are Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike, 1973), its small-sample modification (

Unlike the LRT, information criteria quantify the differences in goodness of fit between a set of candidate likelihood-based models (comparative measure of fit), but give no absolute measure of fit. The use of LRT is more computationally demanding than the information criteria because the LRT requires bootstrapping to obtain the 
                           p
                        -value. This quantification of the significance is not assessed with the information criteria. However, the LRT does not lead to a suitable significance test in our approach. This occurs because regularity conditions do not hold for

                         to have its usual asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for mixture densities. Thus, model selection by LRT tends to overestimate the number of clusters (Stahl and Sallis, 2012). There has been a lot of published research to formulate theoretical results on the null distribution of the LRT for finite mixture model through simulation and bootstrapping studies (see the review in McLachlan and Peel, 2000, Section 6.5). One of the most common way may be using randomization tests (McLachlan, 1987; Manly, 2007; Gotelli and Graves, 1996) to obtain the asymptotic null distribution. However, there is a lack of research on this topic focused on mixtures based on densities from ordinal variables and it might be a field to explore for future research.

We set up a simulation study to empirically establish a relationship between our likelihood-based methodology for ordinal data and the performance of eleven information criteria in order to determine which was most reliable.

The results we are interested in are the percentage of simulated experiments where the eleven information criteria correctly determine the true number of row/column clusters in a set of diverse scenarios. The scenarios are determined by varying the sample size/subjects (
                           n
                           =

                           10
                        ). In addition, we made variations in the number of row clusters (
                           R
                           =

                        . The five scenarios for 
                           
                              {

                         may be described by: equal spacing between any pair of adjacent score parameters (Scenario 1), one pair of adjacent score parameters are very close in value (Scenario 2), one of the mixing cluster proportions is close to zero (Scenario 3), one pair of adjacent score parameters have the same value (Scenario 4), and the same as the first scenario but increasing the number of measures to 
                           m
                           =
                           10
                         (Scenario 5). All the parameters for each scenario in the row clustering and biclustering cases are shown in Tables D.10 and D.11 in Appendix D.

For each scenario, we drew (
                           h
                           =
                           100
                        ) data sets, and selected the best model for each data set using each information criterion. Therefore, we worked with a total of 4500 and 6000 data sets for row clustering and biclustering respectively. The EM algorithm to obtain the estimators is repeated 10 times with random starting points and the estimates with the highest likelihood are kept.

                         is a histogram displaying the percentage of cases in which each information criterion determines the true number of row clusters across the five scenarios and the factors used in the experimental control. The best performance was AIC (correctly selecting the number of row clusters in 93.8% of cases), followed by

                         (82.4%). In the case of biclustering, the results are very similar as AIC also performs the best, although with a lower percentage of correctly selecting the number of row and column clusters than the row clustering case (86.1%). 
                           
                              
                                 AIC

                         also perform very well with percentages close to AIC: 85.6% and 84.2% respectively. BIC is underestimating the number of clusters (incorrectly selecting a smaller number of clusters in 56% and 63.2% of cases in row clustering and biclustering respectively). A very poor performance is obtained by ICL-BIC (correctly selecting the number of clusters in 33.1% and 31.3% of cases in row clustering and biclustering). Our results are in accordance with Fonseca and Cardoso (2007) for the categorical case.


                        Tables 2 and 3
                        
                         show the best 5 information criteria performances in the case of row clustering and biclustering respectively. In both cases, we can observe that AIC is the best measure over the 5 scenarios and the ranking positions are exactly the same over the 5 scenarios. The best performance is scenario 5 which has the largest number of measures 
                           m
                        . On the other hand, the worse achievement is scenario 3 which has one of the mixing cluster proportion close to zero and, therefore, the percentage of underestimated number of clusters is higher. Regardless of this challenging scenario configuration, the AIC and 
                           
                              
                                 AIC
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                         performances are still quite satisfactory (over 75% of fitted cases in row and biclustering).

Our conclusion is that AIC is the best information criteria when dealing with ordinal data and we fit likelihood-based finite mixture models with the ordinal stereotype model as the components in the mixture. It is important to remark these results are just evaluating the fact of obtaining the right number of clusters in the mixture, but it does not imply that they are the best clustering structure for the data.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, the reliability of estimation of the stereotype model parameters is demonstrated in a simulation study (Section  5.1). In addition, we illustrate the stereotype model and our likelihood-based clustering method with two real-life examples (Section  5.2). In order to do model selection, the two best information criteria (AIC and 
                        
                           
                              AIC
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                     ) according to the comparison study (Section  4) are computed together with the most commonly used BIC and ICL-BIC. Thus, their performances can be compared.

We set up a simulation study to test how reliably, in a diverse range of scenarios, we were able to estimate the parameters of stereotype models using the EM algorithm. We are not testing model selection here (that was tested in Section  4): we simulate data sets and then fit the correct model to those data.

The simulation program was written in 
                           
                              R
                           
                        , wrapping the likelihood function which was written in

                        . The design of the study refers to an ordinal response variable with four categories and we varied the sample size (

The simulation scenarios including the interaction factors for row clustering and biclustering version are shown in Tables E.12 and E.13 in Appendix E. In each case the tables show the mean of the MLEs and of their corresponding standard errors over the 100 replicates.

                        , which restricts the estimates to the upper left triangle of the plot. This sequence of plots shows that the estimation process consistently returned MLEs for the score parameters 
                           
                              {

                         close to their true values (the diamond point in each plot) with reducing standard error as the sample size increases. Figs. E.11 and E.12 in Appendix E show similar results for the column clustering model with 
                           C
                           =
                           2
                         clusters and the biclustering model with 
                           R
                           =
                           2
                         and 
                           C
                           =
                           2
                         clusters respectively. However, the column clustering model has the drawback that the number of 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    α
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         parameters is large when the sample size 
                           n
                         is increased (e.g., 156 parameters with 
                           n
                           =
                           50
                        , 
                           q
                           =
                           4
                         and 
                           C
                           =
                           3
                        ) and therefore estimators would be poor with large sample sizes in that case. The consequences of this are that the standard errors are slightly higher than for row clustering and biclustering even as the number of columns 
                           m
                         increases.

In addition, we have observed that the EM algorithm converges to a point far away from the true value. We do not notice this problem in the row clustering and biclustering versions but we detected it in approximately 5% of cases with column clustering when the sample size is 
                           n
                           =
                           50
                        . This problem is apparently caused by the large number of individual row parameters 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    α
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         in column clustering. Another inherent drawback in finite mixtures is that the likelihood has a multimodal surface.

Our initial results described above are encouraging in their ability to estimate parameters correctly. However, we were interested to test the success of the estimation in challenging situations where it might be expected that estimation might be difficult. We chose two particular scenarios. The first case is when two of the score parameters 
                           
                              {
                              
                                 
                                    ϕ
                                 
                                 
                                    k
                                 
                              
                              }
                           
                         have equal values and, therefore, from the point of view of detecting clustering, we could merge their corresponding response categories. A second scenario is to set a very small a priori membership probability, e.g.  
                           
                              
                                 π
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           =
                           0.015
                        , and, consequently, few data units will be classified in the related cluster. The chosen probability must not be related to the first or last response categories because there is a relationship with the score parameters (see (18)) and their corresponding score parameters are set to 
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                              
                                 q
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                         to avoid identifiability problems. Therefore, it is more interesting to test a free score parameter.

We have simulated these two specific scenarios for the row clustering, column clustering and biclustering models and Tables E.14–E.16 in Appendix E summarizes the simulation results. These are very satisfactory because our approach can identify these particular scenarios and get back values close to the true score parameters 
                           
                              {

                         and, therefore, the variability is reduced (e.g., row clustering model with

                         (Table E.14) is (0.262, 0.298) when the true value is 0.23). In addition, we have observed the same drawbacks described above in the column clustering version.

The example is corresponding to a data set with the responses of 70 students giving feedback about a second year Applied Statistics course at Victoria University of Wellington. The responses were collected in feedback forms through 10 questions (e.g. “The way this course was organised has helped me to learn”), where each question had three possible ordinal response categories: “disagree” (coded as 1), “neither agree or disagree” (coded as 2) and “agree” (coded as 3). Each question was written so that “agree” indicates a positive view of the course. The whole data set is shown in Table F.18 in Appendix F.

In that way, the dimensions of the data matrix 
                              Y
                            with the responses are 
                              n
                              =
                              70
                            rows (students) and 
                              m
                              =
                              10
                            columns (questions) where each observation can take one of the three possible categories. Therefore, we can represent the data in a matrix as shown in Fig. 3
                           .

The main goal is to select the model which best represents the data, including determining the number of different groups in the data. We have fitted a suite of models from the null model (no clustering) to the main effects model and their versions including row clustering, column clustering and biclustering. For each model, the information criteria AIC,

                           Figs. 4 and 5 respectively show two and three clearly distinguished groups. The histogram from Fig. 4 presents two modes and Fig. 5 shows two clear modes and one small mode located in the right-tale. However, Fig. 6 where four groups are fitted shows that the fourth group only includes two students and they are not clearly distinguished from the other three groups. These graphs illustrate the conclusion from AIC/

                            (Eq. (5)). We might conclude that the students classified in the first group correspond to those with lowest opinion regarding the course, the ones in the second group have a more moderate opinion about the course and the students in the third group are those with more positive (though still heterogeneous) set of opinions.

We use a real data set from community ecology as a second example to illustrate our likelihood-based clustering method. The data set is regarding the distribution of 41 different tree species along 12 different site stations located at altitudes between 3500 and 4500 ft and sorted by moisture level (wetter to drier). The observations consist of percentage of total tree species present at each station and was presented in R.H. Whittaker’s study of vegetation of the Great Smoky Mountains (Whittaker, 1956, Table 3). The data set is reproduced in Table 8
                           .

The data include cells with a low but nonzero detection, at levels <0.5%. This missing data cause that the effective distances between the values do not reflect their interpretative distance. Thus, transformations may be required (Hennig and Liao, 2013) and that presents an appropriate opportunity to replace numerical data with an ordinal scale. In order to apply our model approach, we transform the original data 
                              
                                 {

Apart from the first category, which is for sites and tree species without presences recorded, the categories with the highest frequencies are 2 and 3 (tree presence percentages between 0.5% and 8%).

Here it is important to remark that we defined another ordinal scale with six categories in the beginning of the data analysis. The current category 3 was split in two subcategories (from 1% to 2% and from 2% to 8%) in that former ordinal scale. However, models fitted to these data indicated that the corresponding estimated score parameters

                            This implies that the relative frequencies in these two categories are independent of the clustering structure. Therefore retaining the distinction between 
                              k
                            and

                            is not informative about the clustering structure. In that case, the model still holds with the same scores if the ordinal scale is collapsed by combining those two adjacent categories into one single response category. Since we regard the 
                              
                                 {

                            as nuisance parameters, this collapsing does not limit our inference in any way. However, they should not be collapsed if keeping the original ordinal categories entails an ecological interest. Therefore, the dimensions of the data matrix

                            show the profiles for the three resultant row clusters. For instance, Fig. 9 depicts that the highest probability for the row cluster number 3 (showed with a line with diamond symbols) is in ordinal category 3 and Fig. 10 shows a first set of bars where the highest probabilities are in the categories with tree presence below 1%. Therefore, tree species classified in the first row group are those with a lower level of presence.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

We have introduced a set of likelihood models based on the ordinal stereotype model and have introduced fuzzy clustering via finite mixtures in order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and simplify the interpretation. Furthermore, we have described a procedure to derive the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the suite of developed models by using the EM algorithm. Computation can be slow in this stage, though we have substantially reduced the time required by calling 
                        
                           C
                        
                      from 
                        
                           R
                        
                     . In addition, we have tested model comparison setting up a simulation study conducted a study in which the results show that AIC, 
                        
                           
                              
                                 AIC
                              
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                      and 
                        
                           
                              
                                 AIC
                              
                           
                           
                              u
                           
                        
                      are consistent information criteria to score fitted models based on our likelihood-based finite mixture model approach for ordinal data sets. In particular, AIC performs best among the tested information criteria to select the model with the correct number of clusters in a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we have demonstrated our approach by means of two examples with real data and have tested the reliability of our methodology through a simulation study. We have detected that there is an indication of multimodality of the likelihood surface in the column clustering model. A strategy to deal with this is to implement a convergence strategy where several starting values are tested over the parameter vector in order to obtain the global maximum.

There are numerous applications for these likelihood-based clustering models in fields where multivariate techniques are necessary. The advantage of our approach is its likelihood-based foundation because maximum likelihood theory provides estimators and model selection.

Many count or percentage data sets have extreme variabilities, for example very high counts and very low counts in ecological community data. Replacing these high counts with “medium” and “high” ordinal categories makes the actual counts less influential in the model fitting, giving broad categories which enable us to detect major overall patterns.

This approach can be enriched adding covariates if they are available. As the mixture models have an unknown number of components, a Bayesian approach implementing a reversible jump MCMC sampler is also feasible (cf. Arnold et al., 2010). Another possible future interesting development might be to assume random effects for indicated row and column effects (
                        
                           
                              α
                           
                           
                              i
                           
                        
                      or 
                        
                           
                              β
                           
                           
                              j
                           
                        
                     ) to reduce the number of unknown parameters.

We have considered the case where responses in each column have the same number of ordinal response levels. This could be varied but may require a separate set of parameters 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 μ
                              
                              
                                 j
                                 k
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      and 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 ϕ
                              
                              
                                 j
                                 k
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                     .

An important future development would be new data visualization methods for finite mixtures models based on the stereotype model. In Figs. 7–10 we have displayed the different group profiles using 
                        
                           {
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       ϕ
                                    
                                    ¯
                                 
                              
                              
                                 
                                    (
                                    i
                                    
                                       .
                                    
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                           }
                        
                      from the data. New visualization tools may lead to the generation of new hypotheses in data exploration and the identification of patterns in the data. Output from these models allows us to determine a new spacing of the ordinal categories, dictated by the data. This will lead to more informative visualization, for example with the equal spacing of categories along the 
                        x
                     -axis in Figs. 9 and 10 replaced with the more appropriate spacing determined by the fitted parameter values. The estimation of the spacing among ordinal responses in our methodology is an improvement over other ordinal data models such as proportional odds model and continuation-ratio model although more research in performance comparison with others equivalent methods is needed. Finally, another research direction to explore would be to compare clustering structures resulting from our methodology with those with binary, count or continuous data. In particular for data sets which original data is not ordinal and we apply transformations like in the Example 2 (Section  5.2.2).

The variational approximation presents several drawbacks (see e.g. Keribin et al., 2012 for a discussion on this topic). In our work, we have not employed the variational approximation for the ultimate MLEs. Instead, we have used an alternative procedure with the aim of ensuring a solution avoiding approximation. Thus, the MLEs from the EM algorithm are used as starting points in order to numerically maximize the incomplete-data log-likelihood (12) (or (13)).
