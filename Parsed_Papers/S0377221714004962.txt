                  Process improvement plays a significant role in reducing production costs over the life cycle of a product. We consider the role of process improvement in a decentralized assembly system in which a buyer purchases components from several first-tier suppliers. These components are assembled into a finished product, which is sold to the downstream market. The assembler faces a deterministic demand/production rate and the suppliers incur variable inventory costs and fixed setup production costs. In the first stage of the game, which is modeled as a non-cooperative game among suppliers, suppliers make investments in process improvement activities to reduce the fixed production costs. Upon establishing a relationship with the suppliers, the assembler establishes a knowledge sharing network – this network is implemented as a series of meetings among suppliers and also mutual visits to their factories. These meetings facilitate the exchange of best practices among suppliers with the expectation that suppliers will achieve reductions in their production costs from the experiences learned through knowledge sharing. We model this knowledge exchange as a cooperative game among suppliers in which, as a result of cooperation, all suppliers achieve reductions in their fixed costs. In the non-cooperative game, the suppliers anticipate the cost allocation that results from the cooperative game in the second stage by incorporating the effect of knowledge sharing in their cost functions. Based on this model, we investigate the benefits and challenges associated with establishing a knowledge sharing network. We identify and compare various cost allocation mechanisms that are feasible in the cooperative game and show that the system optimal investment levels can be achieved only when the most efficient supplier receives the incremental benefits of the cost reduction achieved by other suppliers due to the knowledge transfer.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

This paper considers knowledge transfer in an assembly system composed of one assembler and multiple component suppliers. Knowledge sharing networks have been proposed as a mechanism to increase learning in organizations. Dyer and Nobeoka (2000) describe how Toyota helps its suppliers learn faster by creating knowledge sharing networks. Toyota implements a knowledge sharing network with the objective of creating a strong network identity, motivating the suppliers to engage in knowledge sharing and process improvement, and preventing free riders. One approach followed by this car manufacturer is to organize meetings with its suppliers and share knowledge about best practices with them. Toyota does not charge for these seminars, but the company expects suppliers to reduce their wholesale prices to the company once they achieve lower production costs (so the gains are eventually shared). Another method for sharing knowledge consists of having groups of suppliers visit the facilities of one of the suppliers in the group and learn from this supplier’s best practices and make suggestions for improvement. These activities create a collaborative environment to foster multi-directional knowledge transfer. These groups typically consists of networks of 5–8 suppliers.

We model the assembly network as follows. The assembler faces a deterministic production rate and sources components from a set of suppliers. Suppliers’ components are complementary and the assembler requires parts from all suppliers for the final product (i.e., the assembler’s parts are single-sourced
                        1
                        This is generally consistent with the practice of several companies, including Toyota.

                     ). Each supplier incurs inventory holding costs and a fixed production cost. For a given set of cost and demand rates, each supplier determines its optimal production lot size. We model the sequence of decisions as a two-stage bi-form game (Brandenburger & Stuart, 2007). In the first stage, suppliers invest in process improvement activities, which have a direct impact on their fixed production costs. Investments in cost reduction activities are costly and this cost increases at an increasing marginal rate. We model the first stage as a non-cooperative game, in which suppliers determine the amount of investment in effort to reduce their fixed costs. In the second stage, the assembler establishes a knowledge sharing network to enable transfer of knowledge related to process improvement among suppliers. We model knowledge exchange as a cooperative game among suppliers, in which, as a result of cooperation, all suppliers achieve a level of fixed cost reduction equal to that of the most efficient supplier(s), i.e., the one(s) with the lowest fixed cost.
                        2
                        In Section 5 we discuss other functions describing the change in cost structure as a result of knowledge sharing.
                     
                     
                        2
                      In the non-cooperative game that precedes knowledge sharing, the suppliers anticipate the cost allocation that results from the cooperative game in the second stage by incorporating the effect of knowledge sharing in their cost functions. Based on this model, we investigate the costs, benefits and challenges associated with establishing a knowledge sharing network.

We model process improvement by considering reductions in the fixed costs (similar to Porteus, 1985). All suppliers incur an ex-ante fixed cost associated with their production activities. The fixed cost may correspond, for example, to the time spent and the cost incurred to carry out set-ups for production. Set-up times and costs are usually listed as one of the seven forms of waste (muda) in Lean Production System principles, and are commonly the target of any process improvement initiatives under the umbrella of Lean and Six Sigma programs. Suppliers can individually reduce their fixed costs by investing in cost reduction initiatives. We model the cost of such investments as a direct function of the target fixed cost each supplier desires to achieve. We must note that process improvement may also be due to learning-by-doing, which suggests that costs decrease as a function of the total production volume. Hatch and Mowery (1998) show that learning in the early stages of manufacturing is a function of the engineering resources allocated rather than the production volume in their empirical analysis of the semiconductor industry. Papers studying other aspects of cost-reduction initiatives include Mekler (1993) and Denizel, Ereng, and Benson (1997).

We investigate the impact of knowledge sharing on the investment process and the resulting cost structure for the assembly system. As a result of knowledge sharing, all suppliers indirectly benefit from the process improvement initiatives instituted by the most efficient suppliers in the network. In particular, we explore the design of a cost-allocation mechanism that efficiently assigns the gains from knowledge transfer to all parties. To that end, we first compute the system optimal level of cost reduction, taking into account the benefits from knowledge sharing that are collectively accrued by all suppliers. An ideal allocation scheme should encourage participation of the suppliers and, at the same time, establish proper incentives for investments in the cost reduction activities prior to knowledge sharing. Specifically, we characterize (a) the conditions under which all suppliers participate in a knowledge sharing network and (b) how the total cost should be allocated to the members of this network (through the creation of the appropriate transfer payments) to achieve a level of cost reduction commensurate with that which arises in the centralized system. To this end, we model the transfer of knowledge among suppliers that takes place in the second stage as a cooperative game, which we refer to as the knowledge sharing game, or KS-game. We prove that KS-games are totally balanced – i.e., the core of every subgame is non-empty. We interpret a non-empty core as a setting in which knowledge sharing is feasible, in the sense that there are possible cost transfers that make all suppliers better off by cooperating (i.e., by sharing knowledge). In its implementation, each element of the core corresponds to a certain cost allocation mechanism among suppliers in the network. We identify various allocation mechanisms that may arise in the core of KS-games. In particular, we discuss two important classes of allocation mechanisms. A so-called altruistic allocation allows the non-efficient suppliers to keep the entire benefit of cost reduction achieved due to learning from the efficient supplier. The so-called tute allocation mechanism benefits a supplier by transferring the incremental benefit generated by the inclusion of an efficient supplier into the network. We find that the system optimal level of cost reduction is achieved in an extreme point of the core and, specifically, under the “tute” allocation rule. In other words, the “altruistic” allocation never achieves the system optimal minimum cost, even though it is always in the core of the KS-games. This suggests that the assembler needs to carefully design a system of transfer payments that rewards suppliers for their efforts to reduce cost. The “altruistic” mechanism – based on the suppliers’ willingness to engage in knowledge sharing activities without a proper accompanying reward – will result in a higher cost structure for the entire assembly system.

Various aspects of cost reduction have been studied in the context of decentralized assembly networks and production systems. Gupta and Loulou (1998) study vertical integration decisions under endogenous cost reduction. Gilbert and Cvsa (2003) study outsourcing decisions in a similar setting. Heese and Swaminathan (2006) examine the impact of cost reduction on a product line with component commonality. Chang, Ouyang, Wu, and Ho (2006) study lead time and ordering cost reduction in a single-vendor single-buyer setting. Bernstein and Kök (2009) study dynamic supplier cost reduction decisions and compare alternative contract structures employed by assemblers. Kim and Netessine (2013) study incentives for collaborative cost reduction in supply chains with a single supplier. Iida (2012) studies cost-reduction coordinating contracts in a supply chain with a single manufacturer and multiple suppliers. These papers employ a non-cooperative game framework to study cost reduction in production systems. On the other hand, papers that study cooperative cost allocation games in decentralized networks include Guardiola, Meca, and Puerto (2008, 2009), Meca, García Jurado, and Borm (2003), Meca, Timmer, García Jurado, and Borm (2004) and Meca (2007). Meca and Sosic (2014) introduce a class of cost-coalitional problems based on a priori information about the cost faced by each agent in each group that it could belong to. They study the effects of giving and receiving when there are players whose participation in an alliance always contributes to the savings of all alliance members (benefactors), and there also exist players whose cost decrease in such an alliance (beneficiaries). This stream of papers takes the cost structure as given and does not consider the system externalities that arise when firms invest in cost reduction. The present paper incorporates both the non-cooperative aspects of cost reduction by modeling decisions related to process improvement and the cooperative nature of knowledge sharing networks in assembly systems. Papers using cooperative game theory to study decentralized networks are scarce. Nagarajan and Sosic (2008) review and extend the problem of bargaining and negotiations in supply chain relationships. Recent surveys of applications of cooperative game theory to supply chain management include Meca and Timmer (2008),Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011), and Dror and Hartman (2011). For theoretical issues and a framework for more general supply chain networks we refer to the book by Slikker and van den Nouweland (2001).

We consider an assembly system consisting of an assembler that procures components from n suppliers from the set 
                        
                           N
                           =
                           {

                           ,

                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                        
                     . Suppliers produce different, complementary components.
                        3
                        According to Dyer and Nobeoka (2000), “direct competitors are not in the same [knowledge sharing] group.”
                     
                     
                        3
                      Each unit of the finished product requires, without loss of generality, one unit of the component produced by each supplier. Production of the final product is deterministic and occurs at a rate 
                        
                           λ

                     . Because all suppliers produce components used in the end product, they are subject to the same demand level. Supplier i’s holding cost per item per unit time is

                     , its initial (ex-ante) setup production cost is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       K

                     , and the fixed setup cost it incurs after investment in process improvement – a decision of supplier i – is 
                        
                           
                              
                                 K
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                     .

The sequence of events is as follows: (1) Each supplier decides its level of investment in process improvement activities – as a result, its fixed setup cost is reduced correspondingly; (2) suppliers participate in knowledge-sharing activities; (3) each supplier in a knowledge-sharing group adopts the best-practices shared within the group, reducing its cost to the level of the most efficient supplier in its group; and (4) suppliers produce and ship to the assembler, incurring the fixed setup cost that results from their investment in process improvement in the first stage and the learnings achieved through knowledge-sharing in the second stage.

In this paper, we assume perfect information regarding the suppliers’ fixed costs. This assumption is, in fact, consistent with the practice in many knowledge sharing networks. For example, according to Dyer and Nobeoka (2000), one of the conditions to participate in the learning network at Toyota is “to openly share valuable knowledge with other network members.” Further, this article goes on to say that “suppliers are motivated to participate [and openly share knowledge] because they quickly learn that participating in the collective learning processes is vastly superior to trying to isolate their proprietary knowledge.” Moreover, many of the activities surrounding the process of knowledge sharing involve visits to suppliers’ plants, so information is naturally revealed during those visits. In general, the repercussions of misreporting information in a knowledge-sharing network may be very costly, such as losing the assembler’s business or not benefiting from future knowledge-sharing activities. Thus, truth telling is ensured as part of the long-term relationship.

In the first stage, suppliers may invest in process improvement to reduce their fixed cost down from

This section presents the analysis of the second stage KS-game. Suppliers make their investment in cost reduction decisions in the first stage and initiate knowledge sharing activities with fixed costs

                     . We model the KS-game as a multiple-agent cooperative game where each supplier (agent) faces an EOQ inventory problem. All suppliers in a knowledge sharing group (coalition) learn from the most efficient supplier(s) in the coalition (i.e., the supplier(s) with the lowest fixed cost). As a result, all suppliers in the coalition reduce their fixed costs to a level that equals that of the most efficient supplier. Any supplier outside the knowledge sharing network does not benefit from this cost-reduction learning opportunity. Although we introduce all the game-theoretic concepts we use in this paper, we refer to González-Díaz, García-Jurado, and Fiestras-Janeiro (2010) for more details on cooperative and non-cooperative games.

Cost allocations in the core satisfy a set of coalitional stability conditions and therefore they are usually called stable cost allocations. An element of the core identifies an allocation of total cost among the suppliers under which the grand coalition N is stable.

                      in the definition of the core. That is, no supplier incurs a cost higher than its initial cost before cooperation and the lowest cost a supplier may incur after cooperation equals its marginal contribution to the grand coalition. If the core is non-empty then, because it is a polyhedron, it has a finite number of extreme points (and any point in the core can be described as a convex combination of its extreme points).

The following result shows that KS-games have a non-empty core (i.e., KS-games are balanced). Actually, KS-games are totally balanced (i.e., the core of every subgame is non-empty). We interpret a non-empty core as corresponding to a setting where knowledge sharing is feasible, in the sense that there are possible cost transfers that make all suppliers better off (or, at least, not worse off) by sharing knowledge. The totally balanced property suggests that knowledge sharing is consistent, i.e., for every group of suppliers knowledge sharing is always feasible.

                      which allocates to every supplier i its contribution to its predecessors according to a particular ordering. Drieseen (1988) shows that if a marginal vector is in the core, then it is an extreme point of the core. The proof of Theorem 1 is based on the fact that there exists a marginal vector that belongs to the core.

                     . As suggested by its name, this allocation is based on an altruistic behavior on the part of the suppliers, in the sense that every efficient supplier pays its own individual cost, while the other (inefficient) suppliers pay their corresponding reduced costs achieved from knowledge sharing in the grand coalition. Hence, inefficient suppliers keep all the benefit associated with cost reduction (based on knowledge transfer from the efficient suppliers) to themselves. The efficient suppliers do not see any benefit by sharing their knowledge with the network. Notice that this allocation coincides with the rule that allocates the value of the grand coalition proportional to the cost of each player in the grand coalition. One can show that the altruistic allocation is an extreme point of the core of the KS-game. (In a setting with

Using the altruistic allocation as the starting point, one can increase or decrease allocations to specific suppliers as long as the allocations remain efficient and do not increase the distance between the grand coalition and any of its subsets that exclude supplier j.

This characterization suggests a relatively simple way of computing the elements of the core. We will use Proposition 1 in the analysis of the core of the KS-game. The next result shows that the core of a multiple KS-game reduces to the altruistic cost allocation.

As discussed above, the altruistic cost allocation is always an extreme point of the core of a KS-game. In a multiple KS-game, the efficient suppliers compete away their cost allocation to establish their position as efficient suppliers in a way that leaves them with no additional cost savings beyond those achieved by their investments in the first stage. This is not the case in a simple KS-game: the altruistic cost allocation can be modified in such a way that the cost of every non-efficient supplier increases by

                     , and the unique efficient supplier benefits from a cost reduction equal to the sum of those amounts. That is, a non-efficient supplier i incurs the cost

                        Tute is a Spanish card game of Italian origin. In the variant most widely played in Argentina and Uruguay (Tute Cabrero), players collect points and the players with the most and least points win the round, while the second player with the most points loses the round. See http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tute_cabrero.

Notice that the above KS-network has only one efficient supplier and the core of the associated KS-game involves multiple stable cost allocations, because all the inefficient suppliers are willing to learn from the single efficient supplier. However, the next example shows quite a different behavior for the case of a multiple KS-game. In this example, the KS-network has two efficient suppliers and the core of the associated KS-game reduces to a single point – the altruistic cost allocation – as demonstrated in Theorem 2.

In this section, we analyze the non-cooperative game that arises in the first stage. Suppliers decide the extent to which they invest in reduction of their fixed costs in anticipation of the allocation of cost savings that results from the second stage KS-game. To simplify notation and analysis, we focus on the case of symmetric suppliers (in Section 5 we comment on how results might change for the case of asymmetric suppliers). In settings with symmetric suppliers, all holding and initial fixed costs are equal across suppliers, i.e.,

Before proceeding to the analysis of the equilibrium of the first-stage game, we characterize the first-best or centralized solution, denoted with a “∗”. In this setting, we assume that all suppliers jointly select their investment levels in the first stage to minimize their total cost, in anticipation of the ensuing knowledge-sharing activities. As a result of cooperation in the second stage, each supplier i will be allocated a portion of the cost

                        . We assume perfect information (see Section 2 for a discussion regarding this assumption) and consider equilibria in pure strategies. We first establish an important result which states that the largest cost reduction (which corresponds to the lowest attainable fixed cost) that can be achieved in an equilibrium of the first-stage game arises from an extreme allocation of the core of the associated second-stage cooperative game.
                           Theorem 3
                           
                              The lowest equilibrium fixed cost that arises in the first-stage investment game can always be achieved from an extreme allocation of the core of the second-stage KS-game.
                           

Because our goal is to demonstrate that there exists a core allocation that induces a level of investment equal to that which arises in the centralized system, Theorem 3 suggests that it is sufficient to focus on the extreme allocations of the core. As discussed in Section 3, the altruistic and tute allocations are always extreme points of the core. We therefore first study the non-cooperative game that arises under each one of these two extreme core allocations.

                                 , i.e., the altruistic allocation does not achieve the same level of investment as that which arises in the centralized system.
                              

Under the altruistic allocation, the efficient supplier gives away all benefits associated with knowledge sharing. As a result, only one supplier invests in equilibrium and that level of investment is not enough to achieve the level of system efficiency that arises under centralized control. We next turn attention to the tute allocation.

Consider a given vector of fixed costs

                            denotes the lowest fixed cost value in this vector and that

                            is the set of all efficient suppliers. If the vector

                            is such that multiple suppliers achieve the lowest fixed cost – i.e.,

                            – then, by Theorem 2, the only allocation in the core is the altruistic allocation. As a result, each supplier’s cost function under such a vector is given as in (2). Suppose now that the vector

According to Proposition 3, in any equilibrium of the first-stage game under the tute allocation exactly two suppliers invest in process improvement. Let us examine this result. Under the tute allocation, the efficient supplier receives all the benefit from knowledge sharing – that is, its allocation is equal to its marginal contribution to the grand coalition. The remaining suppliers receive an allocation equal to the cost incurred by the second most efficient supplier, i.e.,

In equilibrium, it is optimal for that second most efficient supplier to invest in cost reduction up to

                           . To see this, we explore the suppliers’ best response functions. If

                            suppliers decide not to invest and one supplier invests a moderate amount in cost reduction, then the remaining supplier has all the incentive to invest as much as economically optimal to reduce its fixed cost. In that way, the latter supplier benefits substantially by receiving an allocation equal to its marginal contribution to the network.

To conclude, the tute allocation rule induces an equilibrium of the two-stage game in which one supplier invests in process improvement to achieve a fixed cost equal to

                           . This fixed cost is, in turn, replicated by all other suppliers as a result of the second-stage knowledge-sharing network. This level of cost reduction coincides with the optimal level achieved in the centralized system, although the equilibrium investment vector is not equal to the first-best solution. Indeed, in the equilibrium derived from the tute allocation, two suppliers invest in equilibrium (one achieving a fixed cost

                           ), while only one supplier invests in the centralized solution. Knowledge-sharing activities become more effective with a larger number of suppliers – as shown earlier, the larger the number of suppliers participating in knowledge-sharing activities, the higher the level of fixed cost reduction that results in an equilibrium under the tute allocation (and, also, under the centralized solution) since

                            is decreasing in n. This is because, under the tute allocation, the efficient supplier earns its marginal contribution to the grand coalition in the KS-game. As a result, the more suppliers in the system, the higher is the efficient supplier’s contribution to the network (as more suppliers are able to reduce their fixed cost through the learning activities in the second stage). A similar dynamic applies in the centralized system.

We have so far examined the first-stage investment game under two extreme points of the KS-game, namely the altruistic and tute allocations. The number of extreme points for the general case of n suppliers can be exceedingly large. Our goal in this paper is to show that there exists a core allocation of the KS-game that induces the centralized optimal level of investment in cost reduction – we have shown that this is achieved under the tute allocation. We conclude this section by providing comments on the cases of 
                           
                              n
                              =

                         and 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              3
                           
                         – in these cases, we can fully characterize all the extreme points of the core. To begin, for the case of two suppliers, the core of the second-stage cooperative game has two extreme points, the altruistic and the tute core allocations. From the result in Theorem 3 and the preceding analysis of the altruistic and tute allocations, we conclude that for the case of 
                           
                              n

                              2
                           
                        , the centralized optimal level of investment is only achieved under the tute allocation. We next explore the case of three suppliers. The following result provides a characterization of the core of the KS-game for the case of three suppliers.

                               is 4/9 (the same as under the tute allocation). Comparing the results, we conclude that the altruistic allocation is the least efficient among the extreme allocations of the core, while the tute allocation induces the same level of cost reduction as that achieved in the centralized system.

In the model analyzed in this paper, we assume that reducing the setup costs to the level of the most efficient supplier as a result of knowledge-sharing activities comes at no additional cost. In practice, there may be a positive cost associated with the implementation of changes to improve the process in the desired way. We suspect that this cost is negligible in many cases, as illustrated by two examples discussed in Dyer and Nobeoka (2000). The first alludes to the fact that Toyota provides free consulting hours to implement projects. The second example cites a manager from Kojima Press, a supplier of spoilers and body parts, stating that “Last year we were able to reduce our paint costs by 30%. This was possible due to a suggestion to lower the pressure on the paint sprayer and adjust the spray trajectory, thereby wasting less paint.” (Ref. page 356). This is a simple and fairly inexpensive change that, at the same time, allowed the supplier to reduce paint costs. These examples suggest that the know-how (or consulting effort) is the major component of the cost associated with an operational improvement. This know-how is at the core of knowledge transfer in knowledge-sharing activities. Therefore, in many cases, the additional implementation cost of an operational improvement is relatively small and the results in the previous sections apply. Nevertheless, in this section, we demonstrate that our model can be generalized to explicitly incorporate implementation costs (when these are significant). We explore this generalization for the case of two suppliers.

Consider the following modification to the cost function in the KS-game. Suppose that, after the original cost reduction investments take place in the first stage, supplier 1 is the efficient supplier. The cost of reducing supplier 2’s setup cost from

To summarize, the analysis for this specific function describing the cost of implementation suggests that when such costs are present, the investment dynamics are similar to those that arise in the original model (without implementation costs) – i.e., the tute allocation induces an equilibrium that matches the fixed cost performance of the centralized system.

On a different note, the analysis of the first-stage (non-cooperative) game in Section 4 has assumed symmetric suppliers. However, in general, some supplier characteristics may not be symmetric. It is reasonable to expect that the investment cost function 
                        
                           g
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                      is similar across suppliers because the cost of investment mainly depends on consulting rates and engineering hours, and those are relatively consistent within firms in the same industry. Nevertheless, there may be cases in which the investment cost functions do differ across suppliers, as the suppliers may be at different stages of technological or managerial sophistication. On the other hand, the holding cost rate 
                        
                           
                              
                                 h
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      is most likely different across suppliers as this cost is typically proportional to the value of a supplier’s component. The generalization to suppliers with non-identical holding cost rates is a relatively straightforward extension to the analysis in Sections 3 and 4 – non-identical holding cost rates would only change the size of the benefits achieved from a particular setup cost vector. In such setting, the altruistic (tute) allocation also leads to an equilibrium under which only one firm (two firms) invest in cost reduction. Our finding regarding the performance of the first-stage equilibria under the altruistic and tute allocations vis-à-vis the optimal investment in the centralized system is similar to that under equal holding costs. Although we conjecture that the qualitative results would remain unchanged in a system with fully asymmetric supplier characteristics, a formal analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.

Finally, we note that we have not explicitly modeled the potential intangible benefits associated with the participation in knowledge sharing networks or those that result from being an efficient supplier. In practice, efficient suppliers may enjoy a better relationship with the assembler or receive more favorable contract terms. Similarly, suppliers that consistently fail to invest in process improvement stand the risk of receiving less favorable contract terms or altogether losing the contract with the assembler. Incorporating these and other long term benefits is outside the scope of the paper. In such cases, all suppliers would have stronger incentives to investment in process improvement and cost reduction initiatives. Therefore, the investment levels under all core allocations would lead to lower equilibrium fixed costs.

In this paper, we consider the implementation of knowledge-sharing activities in a decentralized assembly network. We propose a model in which component suppliers engage in a cooperative knowledge-sharing game following a non-cooperative game in which they invest in process improvement initiatives to reduce their own costs. Each component supplier incurs fixed and variable costs and determines the optimal production batch size according to the EOQ model. In the first-stage, non-cooperative game, suppliers can make costly investments to reduce their fixed production cost. In the cooperative game that follows (modeling knowledge-sharing activities), the knowledge generated as a result of investments in cost reduction is shared by all suppliers (i.e., the fixed costs of all component suppliers are reduced to the level of the most efficient – lowest cost – supplier). The cooperative game suggests ways in which the benefits of knowledge sharing are allocated among suppliers. We examine the dynamics of knowledge-sharing activities in the context of symmetric suppliers (i.e., suppliers have ex-ante identical cost structures), and then discuss the implications of this assumption.

In order to understand the incentives for investment induced by knowledge-sharing, we study the core of the cooperative knowledge-sharing game. The complete characterization of the core is, in general, difficult. We show that the lowest fixed-cost equilibrium is achieved in an extreme point of the core. We study two particular extreme points of the set of core allocations: the altruistic allocation and the tute allocation. Under the altruistic allocation, the least efficient suppliers benefit from knowledge-sharing while the efficient suppliers do not gain anything by participating in those activities. Under the tute allocation, the most efficient supplier receives the incremental benefit that it generates for the entire network. Based on the results of the cooperative game, we characterize the equilibrium investment levels for the supplier network, which depend on the allocation rule used in the cooperative stage. There are generally multiple equilibria in the first-stage investment game. We find that the tute allocation mechanism induces suppliers to achieve a level of cost reduction equal to that which arises in the centralized setting. This is not the case under the altruistic allocation. This suggests that the benefits associated with knowledge sharing activities need to be carefully allocated among suppliers in the network to induce the proper level of investment in cost reduction.

From an implementation perspective, the altruistic allocation is the simplest, as suppliers keep the benefit of the learning activities to themselves. Implementing the tute allocation, or any other similar allocation, requires the assembler to take a more active role and reward the efficient suppliers by instituting a set of transfer payments from the other suppliers. Indeed, an internal transfer mechanism is necessary to achieve a higher level of investment and involvement from suppliers. This is consistent with the practice at Toyota, as evidenced by the Dyer and Nobeoka article: “To encourage suppliers to participate and openly share knowledge, Toyota has heavily subsidized the network (with knowledge and resources) during the early stages of formation to ensure that suppliers realized substantial benefits from participation.” In addition, there are intangibles and long term benefits from sharing process knowledge with other firms – such as earning new and larger contracts and receiving more free consulting projects. In sum, our results suggest that Toyota and its suppliers may benefit from implementing explicit reward/transfer mechanisms for suppliers that share knowledge – beyond the associated intangible benefits.

The size of the network has a significant impact on the outcome of knowledge-sharing activities. As we have demonstrated, the equilibrium investment levels in the centralized system and under the tute allocation increase with the network size (implying a reduction to lower levels of the suppliers’ fixed costs). On the other hand, a larger network induces free riding from a larger subset of suppliers. In that respect, the number and size of networks need to balance these counteracting forces – higher efficiency versus the free rider problem. Indeed, Dyer and Nobeoka (2000) identify the free rider problem as one of the major dilemmas associated with knowledge sharing activities. The article states that knowledge-sharing groups at Toyota consist of five to eight suppliers. Toyota recognizes that effective learning takes place within relatively smaller learning activity-centered nests. They create these nests within the larger network to increase the learning effectiveness and to reduce free riding by the suppliers.

In this paper, we have proposed a stylized model of knowledge sharing – all suppliers can achieve the fixed cost of the most efficient suppliers through knowledge sharing activities. By analyzing a biform game, we explore the equilibrium behavior of suppliers and its implications on the design of appropriate incentives for knowledge-sharing. Our model uncovers the forces at work in the process of knowledge-sharing activities and evidences that the appropriate incentives have to be in place (e.g., in the form of transfer payments) to achieve levels of cost reduction commensurate with those that would be achieved under centralized control.
