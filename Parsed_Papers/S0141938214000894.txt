                  New chiral compounds of the steroid type, namely, 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone, were synthesized and exhibited high helical twisting power (HTP) in nematic liquid crystals E63 and LC-1289. The peculiarities of the molecular structure of chiral compounds (CCs) and their high degree of chirality were discussed. Quite small concentrations of chiral compounds in both nematic solvents were needed to obtain a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure with the selective light reflection in the visible range of the spectrum. The insignificant temperature dependence of the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection obtained on the whole cholesteric range for all studied liquid crystalline (LC) systems could be related to relatively rigid molecular structure of the chiral compounds. The cholesteric LC mixtures comprising 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone were characterized by the phase stability and the stability of reflective characteristics in time that makes it possible to consider this series of dopants as appropriate for development of bistable cholesteric reflective LC displays.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Chiral compounds are widely used as dopants in liquid crystals to investigate the phenomenon of chirality and to search for new liquid crystalline states and properties [1–5]. The development of chiral compounds possessing a certain set of characteristics is necessary and important for many practical applications such as different electro-optical devices, LC displays, and polymer films [6,7].

Nowadays bistable cholesteric reflective LC display (ChLCD) technology has growth potential since such displays consume low power and can be flexible [8–10]. A recent study revealed that cholesteric displays can be used according to the need for static as well as video images [11]. For this type of display the cholesteric material preferably should consist of a nematic LC and a chiral dopant. To obtain the effect of selective light reflection the chiral dopant must induce a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure in the nematic LC (the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection, λ
                     max, is in the visible range of 400–800nm). To fulfil this requirement the chiral compound should have a high HTP or high amounts of the chiral compound are needed to be used. A high concentration of the CC influences undesirable functional characteristics of the nematic, such as, the temperature range of the mesophase, threshold voltage, viscosity and others. A highly chiral dopant should be expected to confer a high helical twisting power that allows one to reduce its concentration in the LC system. Besides chirality as a prerequisite, the molecular structure of a chiral compound usually undergoes synthetic modifications by introduction of ligands of different kinds to achieve the highest possible value of helical twisting power in nematic LCs [12–16]. To predict the increase of HTP value becomes more complicated in the case of using multicomponent nematic solvents. Different theoretical methods have been suggested for estimation of helical twisting power of chiral compounds [for example, [17] and references therein], but calculation of all types of intermolecular interaction, especially, for multicomponent systems is still a very difficult task.

To retain the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection and, correspondingly, the reflected color unchangeable in the wide range of ambient temperature (dλ
                     max/dT
                     ≈0) is another crucial condition, in particular, for development of ChLCDs. Different modifications of molecular structure of chiral compounds with the aim to obtain high HTP values often result in an undesirable shift of λ
                     max with temperature. Inconsiderable in number, investigations do not determine to the full extent the features of molecular structure of CCs that influence the dλ
                     max/dT parameter. In many cases two or more chiral dopants are used in order to compensate the temperature dependence of λ
                     max.

High solubility of chiral compounds in nematic solvents and, correspondingly, the phase stability of LC mixtures, that provides the stability of mentioned characteristics (HTP value, dλ
                     max/dT parameter) in time, is one more problem under study. In general, to trace the origins of low solubility of chiral compounds is difficult. Usually, the solubility of chiral compounds in LC solvents depends on temperature, as it was discussed, for instance, for dicinnamate isosorbide [18]. Good solubility was obtained for chiral compounds possessing low melting enthalpy [19]. Besides, it has been suggested that in case of the presence of polar fragments in the molecular structure of CCs, the phase instability of LC systems can be observed [20].

In this work we discuss characteristics of cholesteric LC systems comprising of new highly chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone as dopants in accordance with the requirements for ChLCDs and consider the effect of rigidity of the molecular structure of the estrone derivatives on the temperature behavior of cholesteric short pitch.

The synthetic methods for the preparation of the new chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are shown in Scheme 1
                        .

The synthesis of estrone derivatives 8a–c as well as 8d–i consisted of two stages.

For the preparation of estrone derivatives 8a–c in the first stage of synthesis estrone was condensed with the veratryl aldehyde in an alkaline medium. The second step consisted of acetylation of the phenolic hydroxyl group at the third position of the obtained and unknown before 16E-veratrylidenestrone (2) under the influence of anhydrides of corresponding acids in pyridine. The products of the reaction are 3-alkanoyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone 8a
                        –
                        c.

For the preparation of estrone derivatives 8d
                        –
                        i the sodium salt of estrone underwent alkylation using an excess of the corresponding alkyl iodide in the medium of absolute ethanol. After that the obtained ethers of estrone (3–7) were condensed with the corresponding aldehydes in an alkaline medium. The conditions of the reaction were analogous to those known in literature, for instance, for benzaldehyde [21] or its substituted derivatives [22,23]. The products of the reaction are 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone 8d–i.
                     

The structures of the new compounds were proved by IR (Perkin Elmer RX1 FT-IR, in KBr), NMR spectroscopy (Varian Mercury-200 or Varian Mercury-400). Mass spectra were recorded on a Varian 1200L GC–MS instrument, ionization by EI at 70eV. The specific optical rotation, [α]D, was measured at 20°C using a Perkin Elmer-343 polarimeter. Elemental analysis was carried out on an EA 3000 Eurovector elemental analyzer. Melting points were determined on a Kofler hot bench. The progress of reactions and also the purity of the obtained compounds were monitored by TLC on Silufol UV-254 plates with chloroform/acetone (2:1) or (9:1) as an eluent. The synthesized compounds are at least 95% pure according to GC–MS and elemental analysis. Commercially available reagents and solvents were used without further purification. The obtained compounds have the following characteristics:

The commercial multicomponent nematic liquid crystals E63 (Merck) and LC-1289 (NIOPIK, Moscow) were used. Both nematics are characterized by the wide temperature range of the mesophase: (−20)–83°C for E63 and (−20)–62°C for LC-1289.

The texture analysis of LC systems was performed using a polarizing optical microscope equipped with a heating stage within the accuracy of 0.5°C. The helical pitch, P, was measured using a wedge-like glass sample by the conventional Grandjean–Cano method [1]. HTP values of CCs 8 in nematic LC mixtures were calculated according to Gottarelli and Spada [2] as

The cholesteric helix handedness (twisting sign) was determined according to Adams–Haas method [26]. For cases when the cholesteric helix handedness was not determined, HTP values are given as absolute values.

The selective light reflection spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 UV/VIS spectrometer. The planar texture of LC samples was used; the thickness of the LC layer was 15μm. The P values for short-pitch N

                        max/dT parameter (correlation coefficients are 0.95–0.99).

Testing of solubility of CCs 8 in LC solvents was performed by the way of repeat recordings of spectra of the selective light reflection of LC systems during the next 3months using commercial cells with ITO surface layers (from Instec, Inc., USA).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

As seen in Table 1
                     , HTP values of CCs 8a–i in nematic LC-1289 are high and almost the same order. The variation of the position of OCH3
                      groups in the arylidene fragment of CCs does not significantly influence the HTP. Some higher values of HTP are observed for chiral compounds with more extended terminal 3β-acetoxy or 3β-hydroxy substituents (CCs 8b, 8c, 8h, 8i).

As illustrated in Fig. 1
                     a, the central core of estrone derivatives 8 contains, typical for the class of steroids, four trans–trans fused rings with the axial methyl group. The molecular structure of estrone derivatives 8a
                     –
                     i can be characterized as highly chiral due to the presence of several single chiral centres of R or S configurations in the steroid core. Besides, the fixed s-cis-enone group of spiral chirality yields an additional contribution to the total chirality of CC molecules. The benzene ring in the steroid core and the arylidene fragment should be expected to confer enhanced dispersion forces between molecules of the chiral dopant and the nematic. In most cases, the presence of π-electronic fragments in molecular structures of different chiral compounds results in high values of helical twisting power [14,16,27,28]. Thus, we believe that due to mentioned structural features, estrone derivatives 8a
                     –
                     i promote effective chirality transfer in LC systems and exhibit high HTP.

Chiral compounds 8a
                     –
                     i can induce a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure with the selective light reflection in the visible range in nematics LC-1289 and E-63. As represented in Table 2
                     , to obtain the selective light reflection in red, green and blue visible ranges quite small concentrations of CCs (4.7–7.4mol.%) in nematics are needed. CC 8h exhibits a high value of HTP in nematic E63, expressed in mass fractions, almost equal to that obtained for CC 8h in nematic LC-1289.

As seen in Table 2, the shift of the maximum of the selective light reflection with temperature is negligible for all studied LC systems (dλ
                     max/dT
                     =0.01–1.8nmK−
                     1). Such behavior of λ
                     max implies the stability of reflected colors with temperature. Examples of spectra of the selective light reflection are shown in Fig. 2
                     .

There is a lack of information in the literature about the dependence of the dλ
                     max/dT parameter on CC concentration. As can be seen for the example of CC 8h, the dλ
                     max/dT parameter depends on CC concentration only slightly at low concentrations.

To analyze the dλ
                     max/dT parameter we consider the origins responsible for this characteristic. Since

                      (T) dependence of different nematics is insignificant.

The change of elastic constants of the nematic with temperature affects the character of P(T) [29], and, correspondingly, λ
                     max(T) and gives the certain additional contribution. Strong influence of nematic matrixes on λ
                     max(T) has been observed when using multicomponent nematic solvents [20].

But we believe that the dP/dT parameter and, correspondingly, dλ
                     max/dT depends primarily on the molecular structure of the CC. The different types of aromatic ligands or mesogenic moieties in the structure of the CC can produce a very strong shift of the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection with temperature. One of the less discussed in literature and researched factor, that also determines λ
                     max(T) behavior, is the possibility of conformational changes of molecules of the chiral dopant with temperature, if it takes place or, contrary, relative molecular rigidity of the CC.

It is known that the presence of flexible fragments or flexible linking groups in the molecular structure of chiral compounds results in significant diversity of conformational states of molecules of the chiral compound. The estimation of concentration ratio of low energy stable conformers at different temperatures in the certain LC medium with the HTP value of each stable conformer is a very difficult task. The results of theoretical calculations for relatively rigid and flexible CCs, in particular, for α,α,α′,α′-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolan-4,5-dimethanol (TADDOL), binaphthyl and helicene derivatives have been reported in Ref. [17]. It follows as a logical consequence that, the greater the degree of rotational freedom for a flexible CC the more difficult to conserve the weighted mean value of HTP unchangeable with temperature and, correspondingly, to obtain dλ
                     max/dT
                     ≈0. Thus, some increase of λ
                     max with temperature growth (dλ
                     max/dT
                     >0) or decrease of λ
                     max with temperature (dλ
                     max/dT
                     <0) can be observed with a certain degree of flexibility of the chiral compound (here we do not discuss extreme cases of cholesteric helix inversion [30,31]).

For example, a strong (in some cases, nonlinear) temperature dependence of λ
                     max has been observed for TADDOL derivatives with variation of alkoxy spacer length in their ligands [32]. The gradual elongation of terminal alkyl or alkyloxy substituent in the structure of (S)-1-phenylethylamine N-arylidene derivatives results in slow change of the dλ
                     max/dT parameter to higher values in absolute value [33]. The same effect is observed for 6,6-disubstituted-binaphthol derivatives [34]. However, a wavelength shift with temperature is observed for isosorbide derivatives with different terminal substituents but without traceable correlation [35]. On the other hand, some flexibility of the chiral compound is needed to achieve high solubility of the CC in the nematic. The different degree of solubility of TADDOL derivatives was explained by the odd–even effect of the alkyloxy linkage in their molecular structure [32].

As seen in Fig. 1a and b, estrone derivatives 8 in some measure have similar peculiarities of the molecular structure to (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and their acetates described by us earlier [36,37]. Acetates of (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one exhibited HTP values from 45 to 61μm−1
                     molfr.−
                     1 in nematics E63 and LC-1289, which are close to those obtained for estrone derivatives 8a
                     –
                     i. The LC systems comprising acetates of (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one also showed relatively weak temperature dependence of λ
                     max 
                     [37]. The molecular structures of both series of dopants are characterized by inflexible highly chiral steroid cores. The cinnamoyl group in molecules of both series of steroids has the Е-configuration confirmed by the results of nuclear overhauser effect experiment as well as semiempirical AM1 calculations [36–38]. Only the presence of terminal 3β-acetoxy or 3β-hydroxy substituents and rotation around C(20)–Ar bond in the arylidene fragment (the torsion angle φ
                     Ar) impart some flexibility to the molecular structure of the dopants.

The detailed AM1 calculations for (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and their acetates revealed a set of rotamers at the arylidene group [36]. The most energetically stable rotamers are characterized by the torsion angle φ
                     Ar from −35.2° to −27.8° irrespective of the type and the position of substituents in the arylidene fragment. The difference in energy for this group of rotamers in comparison with the other rotamers is 0.6–2.1kcal/mol [36]. It allows one to consider (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and their acetates as relatively conformationally homogeneous with the preponderance of –synclinal conformation with respect to the C(20)–Ar bond. Since (E)-16-arylidene derivatives of 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one and their acetates and estrone derivatives 8a-i have similar molecular structures, it should be expected that the most energetically stable rotamers of the arylidene group for estrone derivatives 8a–i will be characterized by the same torsion angle φ
                     Ar
                     ≈−35°–(−28)°. Even if takes into account the possibility of the presence of energetically stable and less stable rotamers in LC solvents in a certain proportion, it can be concluded that such degree of mobility of the arylidene fragment does not influence the temperature behavior of λ
                     max.

Thus, the molecular structure of CCs 8a
                     –
                     i in general can be characterized as relatively rigid. The rigidity of molecules of CCs 8a
                     –
                     i, associated mainly with the rigidity of the chiral steroid core, can be the major cause of the insignificant temperature dependence of λ
                     max.

It is known that E–Z-isomerization of α,β-unsaturated ketones takes place under the influence of UV irradiation [39–41]. This effect can result in changes of characteristics of the cholesteric LC system. However, the investigation of derivatives of 5α-androstan-17-one, androstenone and estrone revealed their high degree of photostability under UV irradiation tests. The results of this study will be published elsewhere.

Chiral dopants 8a
                     –
                     i exhibited a high degree of solubility in both nematic solvents LC-1289 and E63. The testing of samples after their keeping during 3months showed the phase stability of LC mixtures. The positions of maxima of the selective light reflection do not change and the reflected colors of LC samples are conserved.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

New highly chiral 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are effective dopants for development of bistable cholesteric reflective LC displays. The presented series of steroids is characterized by high helical twisting power in nematics E63 and LC-1289. The introduction of a low concentration of chiral compounds in LC solvents (4.7–7.4mol.%) produces a short-pitch cholesteric helical macrostructure with the selective light reflection in red, green and blue spectral regions. The LC systems comprising 3-alkanoyl- and 3-alkyl derivatives of 16-arylidene estrone are characterized by the stability of reflective characteristics with temperature and time. The insignificant temperature dependence of the maximum wavelength of the selective light reflection can be attributed to the relatively rigid molecular structure of chiral compounds due to the rigidity of the steroid core as well as a low degree of conformational mobility of chiral compounds in general.
