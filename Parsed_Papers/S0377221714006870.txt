                  This paper examines the relation between dividend policy, managerial ownership and debt-financing for a large sample of firms listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. In addition to standard parametric estimation methods, we use a semi-parametric approach, which helps capture more effectively non-linearities in the data. In line with the alignment effect of managerial ownership, our results support a negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends when managerial ownership is at relatively low levels. However, this negative relationship turns into a positive one at very high levels of managerial ownership. We also find that the nature of the relationship between managerial ownership and dividends may be more complex than it has been previously thought, and it also differs significantly across firms with different levels of debt/financial constraints. The results are consistent with the view that agency theory provides useful insights but cannot fully explain how firms determine their dividend policy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The separation between ownership and control in large corporations creates fundamental conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, which are commonly referred to as agency conflicts (Fama &#38; Jensen, 1983; Jensen &#38; Meckling, 1976). The main agency conflict centres around the use of free-cash-flow by managers; that is, the cash flow in excess of that required to fund all projects that have positive net present values (Jensen, 1986). The problem stems from self-serving managers who divert cash flow to benefit themselves (e.g. by increasing firm size to justify higher salaries, lavish expenses and excessive perks) at the expense of shareholders.

Various mechanisms have been proposed as potential solutions to the free-cash-flow problem.
                        3

                        See Denis (2001) and Gillan (2006) for a comprehensive review of the literature on the different types of mechanisms available to firms.
                      Dividends, debt-financing and managerial ownership are three of the most important ones. Dividend payments have been interpreted as a “bonding” mechanism to resolve the conflict between managers and shareholders (Easterbrook, 1984; Jensen &#38; Meckling, 1976; Jensen, 1986; Rozeff, 1982). This is because the payment/non-payment of dividends causes the firm to undergo a third-party audit (i.e. from equity markets), which results in lower agency costs. Debt-financing also works as a monitoring force for reducing agency-related problems (see Ross, 1977 and Stulz, 1990). The issuance of debt gives debt holders the option to take the firm into bankruptcy if managers default on their debt obligations.

                        4
                        The “disciplinary” role of debt has been questioned by several researchers showing that debt facilitates expropriation when capital market institutions are ineffective (see e.g., Bunkanwanicha, Gupta, &#38; Rokhim, 2008).
                      Managerial ownership (at low levels) has been suggested as a third mechanism that helps align the interests of managers with those of shareholders. This is because managers who own equity in the firm will act as owners and reduce the degree of expropriation from outside investors (Jensen &#38; Meckling, 1976) (alignment effect). At higher levels of managerial ownership, however, managers may exert insufficient effort, collect private benefits and entrench themselves at the expense of external shareholders (entrenchment effect).

                           Demsetz and Lehn (1985), Stulz (1988) and Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988), among others, have identified offsetting costs associated with high levels of managerial ownership. For example, by accumulating a large block of ownership and voting rights, a manager may have enough voting power and influence to guarantee his/her employment with the firm at an attractive salary (Morck et al., 1988). In an attempt to protect a managerial position, a manager may also impede the market for corporate control (e.g. act against a potentially beneficial acquisition for shareholders) by requesting a high takeover premium (Stulz, 1988). High levels of managerial ownership also give management greater ability to control the board and undertake “manager-specific” investments, which makes it costly for shareholders to replace them (Shleifer &#38; Vishny, 1989). Such manager-specific investments often involve opportunistic and risky projects that target to increase the size of the assets under their control, i.e., empire building (Stulz, 1990).
                     
                  

This paper examines the relation between dividend policy, managerial ownership and debt-financing for a large sample of listed firms on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. We build upon a large body of research showing that these mechanisms are not independent but are strongly related to each other, usually in complex ways (e.g. Aggarwal &#38; Kyaw, 2010; Belghitar &#38; Khan, 2013; Chen &#38; Steiner, 1999; Farinha, 2003; Jensen, 1986; Jensen, Solberg, &#38; Zorn, 1992; Lee, 2011; Schooley &#38; Barney, 1994). However, there is no consensus on whether these mechanisms work as substitutes or complements in reducing free-cash-flow problems. The purpose of this study is to provide further insights into this issue by adopting a semi-parametric perspective for examining how these mechanisms relate to one another. Our analysis contributes to the literature in the following three ways. First, in contrast to previous studies, we employ a semi-parametric approach, which helps capture more effectively non-linearities in the data. The implementation of semi-parametric estimation methods enables us to provide comprehensive evidence on the shape of the dividend–ownership curve and, in particular, to capture possible complex non-linear structures. Secondly, we examine whether the nature of the relationship between managerial ownership and dividends differs across firms with different levels of leverage/financial constraints. The fact that the latter investigation is conducted within a semi-parametric framework facilitates a better understanding of whether ownership, dividends and debt are substitute mechanisms in reducing agency costs of free-cash-flow. Thirdly, we re-assess the dividend–ownership relation under the prism of a large sample of US firms from 2001 to 2007, an interesting period followed by a sharp decline of dividend payments in the US. For example, Fama and French (2001) shows that firms paying cash dividends fell from 66.5 percent in 1978 to 20.8 percent in 1999, even after conditioning on firm characteristics. Our sample period also covers the 2003 dividend tax cut,
                        6
                     
                     
                        6

                      which increased dividend activity (mainly) through dividend initiations (see Brown, Liang, &#38; Weisbenner, 2007).

Our analysis reveals a number of interesting findings. First, in line with the alignment effect of managerial ownership, our findings support a negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends when managerial ownership is at relatively low levels (i.e. <10 percent). This negative relationship turns into a positive one at very high levels of managerial ownership (i.e. >60 percent). This can be interpreted as evidence supporting the entrenchment effect of managerial ownership. However, the critical “entrenchment” level of managerial ownership estimated in our study (at around 60 percent) is significantly higher than the ones estimated in earlier studies by Schooley and Barney (1994) and Farinha (2003). Given that managers with equity stakes that exceed 60 percent are more likely to hold an underdiversified portfolio, the positive relation between dividends and managerial ownership is open to alternative interpretations. For instance, managers with undiversified wealth tied up to their own firm may place additional value on dividends for liquidity reasons (see Brown et al., 2007).

Second, our semi-parametric results suggest that there are more than one turning point in the managerial ownership–dividend relation. This does not support the U-shaped relationship suggested by previous literature and our parametric results. As explained below in more detail, such “complex” relationship cannot be adequately explained by any single theory, such as agency theory. In fact, one has to go beyond agency considerations and to consider signalling and tax clienteles theories to explain how firms determine their dividend policy (see e.g., Allen, Bernardo, &#38; Welch, 2000; Anderson &#38; Kanatas, 1995; Lang &#38; Litzenberger, 1989; Miller &#38; Scholes, 1978). A close comparison between our parametric and semi-parametric results suggests that the semi-parametric model is more powerful to uncover the true link between dividends and ownership, and it is strongly preferred to the parametric non-linear model, which reflects a strict U-shaped relation.

Third, our findings suggest that the relation between ownership and dividends for high-leverage firms is different from that for low-leverage firms. Interestingly, we find that the substitution effect between dividends and managerial ownership is only observed in high-leverage firms. This goes against the notion that the negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends should be more pronounced in low-leverage (or all-equity) firms, since they have greater free-cash-flows and lack a mechanism (i.e. debt) for controlling agency costs (see Agrawal &#38; Jayaraman, 1994). We interpret this as further evidence that dividend policy cannot be fully explained in the context of agency theory.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Section 3 outlines the semi-parametric approach employed in this study. Data and variables are discussed in Section 4. The empirical findings and their interpretation are provided in Section 5. Section 6 presents some robustness checks while Section 7 concludes.

Agency problems related to the use of free-cash-flow are commonplace in public firms. They arise from conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders (Jensen &#38; Meckling, 1976). In an attempt to maximize their own welfare, managers may be tempted to build empires, collect private benefits, undertake manager-specific investment projects

Dividend payments, debt issuance and managerial ownership have been proposed as three of the most important mechanisms that can mitigate the free-cash-flow problem. Despite a large body of research that looks at the effectiveness of these mechanisms in resolving agency problems (see Denis, 2001 and Gillan, 2006 for comprehensive reviews of the literature), there is still no consensus on how these mechanisms relate to one another and whether they “work” in substitute or complementary ways. Furthermore, several studies demonstrate the existence of non-linearities of ownership structure with respect to debt and dividends (see e.g. Farinha, 2003; Florackis &#38; Ozkan, 2009; Schooley &#38; Barney, 1994). In particular, Jensen (1986) argues that debt and dividends are substitute mechanisms for reducing the discretionary resources under managers’ control, which implies a negative relationship between the two. Several studies report evidence that supports a negative relationship between debt and dividends (see e.g. Chen &#38; Steiner, 1999; Jensen, Solberg, &#38; Zorn, 1992). However,Eckbo and Verma (1994), De Miguel, Pindado, and de la Torre (2005) and Aggarwal and Kyaw (2010) find a significant positive relationship between leverage and dividend payout ratios.

Dividends also relate to managerial ownership in a statistically significant way. If dividends and managerial ownership are substitutes for reducing free cash flow-related agency costs, then their relation should be negative (see e.g. Chen &#38; Steiner, 1999; Jensen et al., 1992; Lee, 2011). Several authors, however, have argued that the dividend–ownership relation may not be strictly negative; it may actually turn positive above a certain ownership level due to entrenchment. Entrenched managers do not treat dividends and debt as substitutes at high ownership levels, and thus increase dividends as ownership levels increase. This suggests a U-shaped dividend–ownership relation, which captures both the alignment and entrenchment effects. Empirical studies, have found evidence of this shape for US and UK firms (see Schooley &#38; Barney, 1994 and Farinha, 2003).

Regarding the relationship between debt and managerial ownership, the evidence is mixed too. Several studies document a positive relationship between debt and managerial ownership (e.g. Kim and Sorensen, 1986). Such a positive relationship is justified by managerial preferences to maintain their control within the firm and avoid the agency costs of external equity (see Florackis &#38; Ozkan, 2009). Another strand of research reports a negative link between debt and insider ownership (see Chen &#38; Steiner, 1999; De Miguel et al., 2005; Friend &#38; Lang, 1988). De Miguel et al. (2005) interpret the negative relationship as evidence of managerial risk aversion; that is, managers diversify away their (excessive) risk exposure to their own firm by selling their holdings when the probability of default is high. There have also been some studies that provide evidence for a non-linear relation between debt and managerial ownership (see, Brailsford, Barry, &#38; Pua, 2002; Florackis &#38; Ozkan, 2009).

From a theoretical standpoint, one can go beyond agency theory to explain the drivers of corporate dividend policy and its relation to managerial ownership and debt. The pecking order theory of Myers and Majluf (1984) predicts that firms prioritize their sources of financing as follows: first they raise internal financing, then they issue external debt and finally they issue equity. This prioritization implies a positive relationship between debt and dividends. This is because a high dividend payout reduces the level of free-cash-flow (internal resources) and, as a result, increases the need for raising external debt in order to maintain an optimal capital structure (see also Aggarwal &#38; Kyaw, 2010). Firms that pay dividends are also expected to have easier access to external capital (see Harford, Klasa, &#38; Maxwell, 2014). The positive relationship between debt and dividends goes against Jensen's (1986) prediction of a trade-off between debt and dividends.

Companies also pay dividends for signalling purposes. Bhattacharya (1979) and Miller and Rock (1985) develop signalling models that account for asymmetric information between managers and shareholders. The role of a dividend payout in an imperfect information setting is to release private information to the market. Debt issuance (mainly in the form of short-term financing) may be also used as a signalling device (see Flannery, 1986; Ross, 1977). This implies that debt and dividends may be used as alternative signalling mechanisms by firms. However, several additional factors influence the propensity to signal quality through dividend payments as well as the overall propensity to pay dividends (e.g. a firm's life-cycle which determines the need to distribute or retain free-cash-flow (see DeAngelo, DeAngelo, &#38; Stulz, 2006)).

Finally, following the studies of Miller and Modigliani (1961), Miller (1977) and Miller and Scholes (1978), there are several tax-related explanations for debt and dividend policies. Elton and Gruber (1970) find that a change in dividend policy affects shareholder wealth. In their framework, shareholders in higher tax brackets prefer capital gains over dividends relative to those in lower tax brackets. More recently, Allen, Bernardo, and Welch (2000) develop a theory based on the assumption that institutional investors have a tax advantage relative to individual investors. This induces “dividend clientele” effects (e.g. the increase the propensity of institutions to invest in dividend-paying stocks).

                        9
                        On the empirical side, there are several studies supporting the existence of tax-based dividend clienteles, both for the case of institutional and retail investors. For example, Desai and Jin (2011) show that institutional investors do care about the tax consequences of firm payout policy and, as a consequence, firms adjust their payouts based on their investors’ tax preferences. Graham and Kumar (2006) confirm the existence of tax-induced dividend clienteles for retail investors.
                      An important implication of Allen et al.'s (2000) model for our study is that debt and dividends play a similar monitoring role but they cannot be treated as perfect substitutes. This is because institutions that hold equity (and hence receive dividends) can influence management through exit (e.g. selling their equity stakes) or through formal involvement in the corporate governance process. However, institutions that hold firms’ debt instruments have limited influence over manager until a company files for bankruptcy.

Prior studies consider dividend policy, denoted by DIV, to be a function of managerial ownership, MAN, and a set of other control variables collected in vector X. A common representation of this relationship is the following linear parametric model:

This parametric specification is quite restrictive and it is not based on solid theoretical foundations. To the contrary, we allow for a non-parametric dividend–ownership relationship to be estimated from the data.

                        The fundamental advantage of non-parametric estimation methods over parametric ones is that they do not require the specification of a functional form for the relationship between the variables under examination.
                      These methods let data determine an appropriate model rather than imposing a specific parametric assumption on the data generating process. In this way, non-parametric methods are not subject to severe misspecification problems (see Racine, 2008).
                        11
                     
                     
                        11
                        It is also important to recall that testable theories typically indicate the direction (sign) of a relationship between two or more variables rather than the exact functional form of the relationship (see Beck &#38; Jackman, 1998, for a critical overview of this issue). Therefore, relying solely on parametric techniques could prove inappropriate to test such hypotheses.
                     
                  

Misspecification is a particularly important concern when the examined relationship is non-linear. To address this concern using parametric techniques, power transformations of the variables are typically used (e.g., quadratic models). Apart from the difficulty in choosing the correct power transformation, these are global rather than local fits. Using a global fit, one assumes that the relationship between DIV and MAN does not vary over the entire range of MAN. This is again a rather strict assumption, since the relationship between these two variables can be specific to local regions of MAN. Non-parametric techniques avoid this issue as they are flexible enough to provide local estimates of the relationship (see Keele, 2008).

Local fit is particularly desirable when the examined relationship is highly non-linear, exhibiting multiple turning points. Parametric techniques try to capture such a relationship using piecewise regression models or adding higher order polynomials in Eq. (1) above.

                        See, for example, the studies of McConnell and Servaes (1990), Hu and Izumida (2008) and Guedri and Hollandts (2008) and Sueyoshi, Goto, and Omi (2010).
                      However, this approach is suboptimal as one has to exogenously impose the turning points of the relationship and then estimate these models. Non-parametric techniques avoid this problem, as the local fit endogenously produces these turning points.

While non-parametric estimation methods are much more flexible than parametric ones, they become rather computationally intensive as the number of regressors increases. Estimating multidimensional non-parametric models is a cumbersome task. The solution to this problem is the use of semi-parametric techniques that combine a non-parametric estimation with respect to the variables for which we suspect a highly non-linear relationship while assuming a parametric approach for the rest control variables (see Keele, 2008, for an overview of semi-parametric estimation methods).

To this end, we also use a semi-parametric model, which relaxes the functional form on MAN but still controls for the other variables that determine dividends in a parametric way. In this case, the conditional mean of the model is given by:

                     where α + β'X represents the parametric component and f(MAN) the non-parametric one. The non-parametric component, f(MAN), is estimated using splines with optimal basis functions, a method discussed analytically in Keele (2008). The logic behind a spline is to estimate separate regression lines that are joined at the corresponding knots. An important advantage of the splines methodology, in comparison to the commonly used piecewise regressions, is that it does not pre-specify ad hoc cutoff points. The employed methodology in this study minimizes the following objective function:

                        Eq. (3) is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals in the case of ordinary least squares (OLS). The main difference here is the presence of the term λJ.
                        
                     
                  

The previous expression describes the trade-off between fitting perfectly the data (i.e. minimizing the squared residuals) and having the smoothest possible approximating function f. This trade off is controlled by parameter λ. As λ → ∞, the penalty assigned to the roughness of the function is so high that the optimal function, f , is of linear form, since, by definition, a linear function has zero roughness for the whole range of the dependent variable values. In this case, the minimization problem becomes identical to least squares. On the other extreme, if λ → 0, then this methodology will provide a very rough approximating function f that essentially fits each individual observation.

                        We minimize the expression in Eq. (3) and subsequent equations with respect to i) the parametric coefficients α and β; ii) the optimal smoothing parameter λ and iii) the determinants of the spline f(MAN) (e.g. slopes of piecewise regression lines, location of knots).
                     
                  

Previous studies that employ a non-parametric approach use smoothing splines (e.g. Engle, Granger, Rice, &#38; Weiss, 1986). In this study, instead of smoothing splines we employ penalized regression splines. Even though these two approaches yield similar results in practice, penalized regression splines use fewer parameters and, therefore, are computationally more efficient. This choice implies that the objective function becomes:

                     where f(MAN) is a thin plate regression spline and f
                     '' stands for the second derivative of f. This spline is constructed by starting with the basis for a full thin plate spline and then truncating this basis in an optimal manner to obtain a low rank smoother. Details of this procedure are provided in Wood (2006). The roughness of the function f(MAN) is captured by its curvature ∫f''(MAN)d(MAN).

                        The logic behind the use of the integrated squared second derivative of f(⋅) is fairly intuitive. The second derivative measures the rate of change of the slope for a function or curvature. A large value for the second derivative means high curvature and vice versa. Through the use of the squared integral, the term sums a measure of curvature along the entire range of the nonparametric estimate, in essence giving us a measure of curvature along the range of the nonparametric estimate. When it is large, f(⋅) is rougher, and when it is small, f(⋅) is smoother.
                     
                  

The above methodology essentially refers to a penalized likelihood maximization problem solved by Penalized Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (P-IRLS) (see Keele, 2008, chap. 5, for a description of the procedure). The selection of the optimal smoothing parameter λ is integrated in this procedure using the Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) criterion. According to this criterion, the optimal λ minimizes the following expression:

Furthermore, this methodology enables us to test the statistical significance of the non-parametric component in the specified semi-parametric model. This is done via an F-test that compares the sum of squared residuals (RSS) of the semi-parametric model (unrestricted) with the RSS of the restricted model that excludes the non-parametric component altogether. The corresponding F-statistic is given by:

Similarly, we are also able to test whether the semi-parametric model has superior explanatory power in comparison to a fully parametric model. Since we employ P-IRLS, a Likelihood Ratio test can be used as follows:

The dataset employed in the present study covers the period 2001–2007 and it is carefully compiled from different sources. Data on dividends, leverage (external debt) and other accounting and market variables are collected from Thomson DataStream. For managerial ownership, board structure, and several other board and director characteristics (see Table 1
                     for the complete list of variables), information is obtained from Board Analyst. We match Board Analyst data at the company level with accounting and market data obtained from Thomson DataStream. We impose several screening criteria to our dataset. First, we exclude firm-year observations with missing values. Second, we exclude firm-year observations that lie outside the 1st and 99th range for each variable. Third, we remove from the dataset all non-US firms that are listed on NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX, and also exclude ADRs, REITs, subsidiaries and OTC firms, because of their different regulatory, reporting and administrative regimes. Data for all variables are reported in financial year end. These criteria lead to a final sample that comprises of 7376 firm-year observations.

Following Michaely and Roberts (2012), the dependent variable in our study, dividends, is defined as total dividends to total assets. We also use the ratio of dividends to profits to ensure the robustness of our results.

                        17
                        Similar definitions have been employed by other authors (see e.g. Farinha, 2003; Farinha &#38; Foronda, 2009 ; Khan, 2006). All unreported results are available upon request by the authors.
                      The main explanatory variable is managerial ownership defined as the percentage of shares held by the management and directors, as reported in the company's most recent proxy statement. A set of controls is used in our empirical models to “partial out” the effect of other variables on dividends. For instance, earlier research has shown that dividend payout is significantly associated with firm size, profitability, leverage and investment ratios (see Benito &#38; Young, 2003; Fama &#38; French, 2001 and Michaely &#38; Roberts, 2012). Accordingly, our list of control variables includes commonly used accounting measures (investment, cash holdings, leverage and firm size) and a performance measure (Tobin's Q).

                        18
                        Our list of control variables does not include cash flow and sales growth due to the high correlation of these variables with Tobin's Q.
                      We also control for governance quality through a series of corporate governance measures (board structure, board size and a plethora of other board and director characteristics). Controlling for the impact of governance is important because earlier research has shown that (i) governance quality significantly affects critical corporate decisions such as dividend policy (see Jiraporn, Kim, &#38; Kim, 2011) and (ii) the relation between payout and corporate governance is contingent upon the relative sizes of agency and external financing costs (see Chae, Kim, &#38; Lee, 2009).

                        19
                        Our specification controls for corporate governance through a series of board- and director-specific characteristics rather than through the indexes GINDEX and OINDEX as in Chae, Kim, and Lee (2009). An advantage of our approach is that our governance proxies are updated yearly while data on GINDEX and OINDEX are not available on a yearly basis.
                      Industry dummies have also been used as explanatory variables. Our complete list of control variables with their respective definitions is provided in Table 1. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all variables used in our analysis.

                        Table 3
                        
                        and Fig. 1 present the parametric and the semi-parametric findings based on the full sample of 7376 observations. The parametric estimation reveals that both the managerial ownership and the squared managerial ownership terms are statistically significant. Thus, the parametric findings support a U-shaped relationship between dividends and managerial ownership. In addition, control variables that are also significant include firm size, leverage, Tobin's Q, board size, the percentage of independent directors and outside directors (among others). The R-squared is equal to 0.11 and the GCV score is 0.000617.

Turning to the semi-parametric results, we observe that nearly all of the control variables that are found to be statistically significant under the parametric model are also significant under the semi-parametric model, including the corporate governance indicators. The R-squared (equal to 0.112) is marginally higher than the one under the parametric estimation, and the GCV score, defined in (5), is now lower. On the basis of the F-test, defined in (6), the non-parametric term is strongly statistically significant (p-value <0.01). Importantly, the p-value of this F-test is lower than the p-value of the test for the significance of the ownership squared term in the parametric specification. Comparing the parametric and the semi-parametric specifications using the LR test, defined in (7), we obtain a test statistic with p-value of 0.00. This finding suggests that the semi-parametric model has superior explanatory power in comparison to the fully parametric model and thus, the former is preferred to the latter.

The relation between managerial ownership and dividends, which is obtained from the semi-parametric specification, is illustrated in Fig. 1 along with the 95 percent confidence bands. This figure reveals that the relation is likely to have more than one turning point, as it would be the case under the U-shaped hypothesis. Two obvious turning points are at 10 percent and 60 percent levels of managerial ownership. Therefore, the relation is non-linear and the nature of non-linearity is more complex than has been previously considered. In particular, in line with the alignment effect of managerial ownership, our findings support a negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends when managerial ownership is at relatively low levels (i.e. <10 percent – see Region A of Fig. 1). For ownership levels between 10 percent and 60 percent, the relation appears to be largely flat with possibly minor turning points (see Region B). The relationship turns into a positive one at very high levels of managerial ownership (i.e. >60 percent – see Region C). As discussed below in detail, these findings suggest that one need to go beyond agency theory to explain the relation between dividend policy, managerial ownership and debt-financing.

We next consider two groups, namely the low-leverage and the high-leverage firms. Companies are assigned into each group according to their (industry-adjusted) leverage ratio using the 33th and 67th percentiles as cut-off points.

                           20
                           The results remain qualitatively similar when the 45th and then 55th percentiles are used as cut-off points.
                         This analysis allows testing for potential interactions between dividends, managerial ownership and debt financing.

Panel Aof Table 4
                        and Fig. 2
                        a report the results for low leverage firms as obtained from the parametric and the semi-parametric specifications. The parametric results reveal that the ownership and ownership squared terms are now insignificant, suggesting that for this group of firms, there is no significant relation between managerial ownership and dividends. On the basis of the F-test, the semi-parametric specification reveals that ownership is statistically significant (F-test = 2.00, p-value = 0.04). In addition, the R-squared of the semi-parametric specification is larger than that of the parametric model. Thus, for low-leverage firms, the semi-parametric model is capable of revealing a significant dividend–ownership relation which is not detected by the parametric approach. The significant relation is likely to be driven by the positive relationship between dividend and managerial ownership for ownership levels greater than 60 percent. The relation between managerial ownership and dividends that is obtained from the semi-parametric specification is illustrated in Fig. 2a.

Panel B of Table 4 and Fig. 2b contain the corresponding results for the group of high-leverage firms. The parametric results reveal evidence of linearity only, since the coefficient of the squared ownership term is not significant. The semi-parametric specification indicates that the non-parametric term is now not significant (F-test = 1.27, p-value = 0.28). In addition, the R-squared and the GCV score of the semi-parametric model are very close to the corresponding statistics of the parametric model. The LR test fails to indicate the semi-parametric model as superior to the parametric one. These results are markedly different from those obtained for all firms and for the group of low-leverage firms. They suggest that for high-leverage firms the dividend–ownership relation is much simpler, in the sense that the non-parametric term is not needed. More specifically, the results suggest a negative relationship between dividends and managerial ownership, which holds only at low levels of managerial ownership and is not followed by any turning point.

Given the potentially important implications of this finding, we carry out further tests to shed light into the nature of the relation. In particular, we seek to examine if a decay function specification better characterizes the relation and to compare the linear specification with the decay specification. We parametrically transform the ownership variable using the function exp(−MAN), where MAN is the managerial ownership variable, and estimate the following model:

The results reported in Table 5
                        reveal that the DECAY specification is superior to both the LINEAR and to the SQUARED specification. The latter finding suggests that for the high-leverage group of firms, there is no turning point in the relation. This presumption is reinforced by the illustration of the relation in Fig. 2b. The noteworthy difference between Fig. 2a and b is that dividends are not increasing at high levels of managerial ownership for the case of high-leverage firms.

The U-shaped relationship between dividends and managerial ownership supported by our parametric results can be interpreted through the managerial entrenchment hypothesis. According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), when managers hold little equity and shareholders are too dispersed to take disciplining action, insiders deploy corporate assets to obtain personal benefits. As insider ownership increases, managers bear a larger share of agency costs. However, according to Demsetz (1983) and Fama and Jensen (1983), managers holding a substantial portion of equity obtain enough voting power to ensure that their position is secure and thus, they become insulated from external disciplining forces. This entrenchment hypothesis has important implications for the dividend–ownership relation, suggesting a U-shaped relation. Specifically, below a certain ownership level, dividend and ownership are substitutes and thus, they are negatively related. However, this negative relation may be reversed due to the fact that in higher ownership firms dividends do not play an important role in mitigating agency problems. Rather, managers with significant ownership stakes are more likely to be entrenched, which significantly increases their propensity to pay dividends (see Hu &#38; Kumar, 2004; Jo &#38; Pan, 2009). Empirical evidence of this hypothesis has also been reported by Schooley and Barney (1994) for US firms, and Farinha (2003) for UK firms.

Our semi-parametric estimates support a more complex relation between managerial ownership and dividends, which is characterized by more than one turning point. Two obvious turning points are at 10 percent and 60 percent levels of managerial ownership. In particular, at low ownership levels (below 10 percent approximately), there is a negative dividend–ownership relation. This is in line with the hypothesis that managerial ownership and dividends are substitute mechanisms for reducing agency costs. For ownership levels between 10 percent and 60 percent, the relation appears to be largely flat (with possibly minor turning points that cannot be identified for certain due to the large confidence bounds observed in the curve). The flat relationship may be explained by the existence of multiple clienteles (e.g. managers holding a substantial amount of shares vs. large institutional investors), which may be subject to heterogeneous dividend tax rates and differential preferences for free-cash-flow (see Eckbo &#38; Verma, 1994).
                           22
                        
                        
                           22
                           In support of this view, Garcia-Cestona and Surroca (2008) show that outside and inside shareholders of Spanish saving banks have materially different goal priorities.
                         It may also be explained by the fact that managers with relatively large ownership stakes (>10 percent) may refuse to further cut dividends for diversification purposes. A high ownership stake in their own firm usually renders managers’ portfolios under-diversified (see Florackis, Kostakis, &#38; Kanas, 2014). These managers may place additional value on dividends for liquidity reasons, an action stemming from their inability to hedge their portfolio positions by selling short their own firm's stock.
                           23
                        
                        
                           23
                           Hedging through selling shares is costly (or even prohibited) due to regulatory and reputational issues associated with insider trading (see Florackis, Kostakis, &#38; Kanas, 2014
;
Leland, 1992)
                         A third, although not mutually exclusive explanation, is as follows. A relatively high level of managerial ownership (>10 percent) works by itself as a signal of good quality and governance. This may attract large, activist, institutional, tax-exempt shareholders, who are especially reluctant to cut dividends (see Allen, Bernardo, &#38; Welch, 2000). This is consistent with the presence and stickiness of dividends. The flat relationship between managerial ownership and dividends turns into a positive one at very high levels of managerial ownership (i.e. >60 percent). This seems consistent with the entrenchment hypothesis of Hu and Kumar (2004) and Jo and Pan (2009), suggesting that managers with very large shareholdings become entrenched and increase their propensity to pay dividends. However, the second turning point is observed at particularly high ownership levels (at around 60 percent). This suggests that alternative interpretations are also possible. For example, managers who have undiversified wealth with large company stock ownership (>60 percent) are likely to place additional value on dividends for liquidity reasons (see also Brown et al., 2007). As a result, they are willing to retain or even increase dividends to satisfy their liquidity needs. Taken together, our semi-parametric results reject the strict U-shaped non-linearity suggested by previous literature (see Farinha, 2003; Schooley &#38; Barney, 1994). It seems that dividend policy of US firms over the period 2001–2007 cannot be adequately explained by agency theory. In fact, one has to also consider alternative and possibly complementary theories such as signalling and tax clientele.

Our findings on therelation between dividends and managerial ownership for high/low leverage firms lead to several interesting inferences. The substitution effect between dividends and managerial ownership is only observed in high-leverage firms (i.e. only at low levels of managerial ownership). This finding in accordance with Crutchley and Hansen (1989), who concluded that there exist substitution effects between dividend payments and two other control mechanisms, namely managerial ownership and leverage. However, this is inconsistent with Agrawal and Jayaraman's (1994) view that the negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends should be more pronounced in low-leverage (or all equity) firms, since they have greater free-cash-flows and lack a mechanism (i.e. debt) for controlling agency costs. This constitutes further evidence that one has to go beyond agency theory, and consider signalling and tax clientele theories, to adequately explain dividend policy.

Another interesting finding that emerges from the analysis of high-leverage firms is that there is no upward sloping relation, indicating that entrenched managers fail to pay more dividends at high levels of ownership, supporting the “entrenchment irrelevance hypothesis”. Conversely, dividends are an increasing function of managerial ownership at ownership levels exceeding 60 percent for the case of low-leverage firms. In other words, our results suggest that there exists a link from debt to managerial ownership, as was also supported by Friend and Lang (1988). This finding suggests that high leverage exercises a negative effect upon entrenchment-related agency costs which are consequently largely mitigated. This is in line with the view that leverage may negatively affect entrenchment and mitigate entrenchment-related agency costs through monitoring. High debt increases the level of monitoring by capital markets, and higher monitoring possibly entails reduced entrenchment-related agency costs (see Easterbrook, 1984; Rozeff, 1982). This is also in accordance with Jensen's (1986) argument that leverage reduces agency costs. According to this argument, debt commits firms to disgorge cash and constrains managers from driving ‘free’ cash flow to pursue personal goals.
                           24
                        
                        
                           24
                           This argument underlies models by Grossman and Hart (1982), Stulz (1990) and Hart and Moore (1990).
                         Furthermore, according to Zwiebel (1996), debt increases the likelihood of bankruptcy, which in turn reduces entrenchment effects. In such an environment, paying dividends reduces cash holdings thereby leaving the firm more vulnerable to takeovers and further increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy and the effects of entrenchment. Thus, our result for high leverage firms is in line with Zwiebel (1996), who argues that debt restricts managerial empire-building.

To examine whether these results are driven by the definition of leverage, we alternatively classify firms into different groups according to their degree of financial constraints. After controlling for industry effects, we use the index of financial constraints proposed by Kaplan and Zingales (1997) (KZ-index) and divide firms into two groups, namely a group of firms that are more financially constrained and a group of firms that are less financially constrained.
                           25
                        
                        
                           25
                           See Table 1 for details on how the KZ-index is constructed.
                         Since high levels of debt are related to severe financial constraints, we seek to examine whether the relation for the group comprising of firms with high KZ-index values is similar to the relation documented for high-leverage firms. The corresponding results are reported in Table 6.

As shown in Panel A of Table 6, the non-parametric term is strongly statistically significant for the group of the least constrained firms. Furthermore, the R-squared (GCV score) of the semi-parametric model is much higher (lower) than the R-squared (GCV score) of the parametric model. The LR test suggests that the semi-parametric model is superior to the parametric one, in line with the results reported for low-leverage firms. For the most constrained firms (Panel B), the non-parametric term is not significant, and the semi-parametric model is not superior to the parametric, a result also obtained for high-leverage firms. The corresponding graphs illustrating the dividend–ownership relation are reported in Fig. 3
                        a for the least-constrained firms and in Fig. 3b for the most-constrained firms. Although for the least constrained firms the relation is likely to contain more than one turning point, for most constrained firms the relation is very similar to that for high-leverage firms.

As a second robustness check, we use a system-based semi-parametric approach. Aggarwal and Kyaw (2010) and Jensen et al. (1992) considered a simultaneous equations framework consisting of a system of structural linear (parametric) equations to model the relation between dividend and financial policies. Here, we consider the approach proposed by Smith and Kohn (2000), which is a non-parametric system approach and can be seen as a system generalization of the semi-parametric model (2). This approach uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework where each regression function is represented as a linear combination of a large number of basis terms and ensures increased efficiency. We consider the following system of structural equations:

                           These estimations were conducted using the VGAM package in R.
                         These results are similar to the benchmark results previously discussed. In particular, it seems that the alignment effect of managerial ownership is only present for firms that are subject to monitoring by debt holders, i.e. high leverage or most constrained firms, while the entrenchment effect disappears for these firms. Overall, our findings are robust to a system-based semi-parametric approach.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study examines the relation between dividend policy, managerial ownership and debt-financing using a semi-parametric estimation approach. The semi-parametric approach brings flexibility and helps capture more effectively non-linearities in the data. Our analysis is based on a large sample of firms listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. To examine whether debt also plays an important role in mitigating agency problems, we also examine whether the impact of managerial ownership on dividends differs across firms with different levels of leverage/financial constraints. This analysis is an important step in our evolving understanding of whether dividends, managerial ownership and debt are substitute mechanisms in reducing agency costs of free-cash-flow.

In contrast to the results based on parametric methods, which suggest a U-shaped relation between dividend and managerial ownership, our semi-parametric result supports a more complex relation that is characterized by more than one turning point. In particular, we find a negative relationship between managerial ownership and dividends when managerial ownership is at relatively low levels (i.e. <10 percent), which is consistent with the alignment effect of managerial ownership. We also find a positive relationship between dividends and managerial ownership at very high levels of managerial ownership (i.e. >60 percent). This can be interpreted as evidence supporting either the entrenchment effect of managerial ownership (see Hu &#38; Kumar, 2004; Jo &#38; Pan, 2009) or the existence of strong managerial preferences over dividends for liquidity reasons (see Brown et al., 2007). Interestingly, the relationship appears to be largely flat for ownership levels between 10 percent and 60 percent, which contradicts previous evidence by Schooley and Barney (1994) and Farinha (2003) and can only be explained in the context of signalling and tax clientele theories. Furthermore, we find that the relationship between managerial ownership and dividends differs significantly across firms with different levels of debt/financial constraints. In particular, we find that that dividends and ownership are substitute mechanisms to reduce the agency costs of free-cash-flow, but this argument holds only for firms that are subject to monitoring by debt-holders (e.g. high-leverage/most constrained). We also find that low leverage firms, which lack an additional mechanism (i.e. debt) for controlling agency costs, may be exposed to entrenchment problems at higher levels of managerial ownership. Last but not least, our analysis shows that semi-parametric methods are very effective in capturing complex non-linear relations and, as a result, may prove particularly useful for subsequent studies on the subject.
