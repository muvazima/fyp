                  The study evaluated several lid design characteristics (diameter, height, top shape, side shape, and surface texture) by means of controlled laboratory testing with older women with hand function limitations. A subjective evaluation process was applied to examine main effects and interactions of lid design characteristics on usability, determined by participants' perceptions of effort and discomfort. Results showed that lid height was the most important design characteristic associated with usability. For 42 mm diameter lids, designs perceived as best were ones with taller height, hexagonal top shape, and convex side shape. For 28 mm diameter lids, the best designs were ones with taller height and hexagonal top shape. Additionally, when the smaller lid's side shape was flat, a serrate surface texture provided some advantages, particularly for subjects with more severe hand dysfunction. This information could be used by package designers to improve jar lid usability for a growing sector of consumers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Aging and chronic diseases, for example hand osteoarthritis (OA), hand rheumatoid-arthritis (RA), or Parkinson's disease, have been found to be key factors associated with significant decline in hand function, including weaker muscle strength and impaired mobility, in older populations (Hunter et al., 1998; Carmeli et al., 2003). Langley et al. (2005) proposed the term “Openability”, e.g. “how easy it is for the consumer to access a product”, when discussing human hand capabilities in packaging design research. While many older individuals with hand use limitations lack some independence in activities of daily living (ADL), opening a new jar or bottle has been determined to be one of the most difficult everyday tasks (Bellamy et al., 2002).

The association between human hand performance and jar lid design characteristics, for example diameter, height, surface texture, and shape, has been studied previously. For example, Yoxall et al. (2006) examined maximum voluntary torque (MVT) for 235 people (age range 8–95 years) when turning a 75 mm diameter jar lid. They determined that the mean opening torque required for 75 mm diameter jars in the market exceeded the MVT of 75-year-old females; overall, 40% of the women in the study produced a MVT less than the mean jar opening torque. Crawford et al. (2002) examined associations between lid size, height, and shape with MVT in healthy people (20 in the age range of 20–40 yrs and 20 in the age range of 60–81 years). They found that torque increased with lid height and diameter, for 20 and 50 mm diameter circular lids. Height was not a factor for the largest circular lid (80 mm). Subjects produced higher torque with a square 50 mm lid than with the circular 50 mm lid; torque produced with the square lid was also not affected by lid height. Imrhan and Loo (1988) investigated the MVT of older people when opening circular jar lids with different diameters (31, 55, 74, and 113 mm) and surface textures. They found that for lids with a smooth surface, the 74 mm diameter lid was the best for generating torque. However, when turning rough texture lids, participants' MVTs monotonically increased as lid diameter increased.

Given that jars and bottles come in different diameters, lids will continue to also come in different diameters. As such, it is useful to explore which lid design characteristics are important to improve usability for different lid diameters. In prior work a wide range of novel lids was assessed, based on subjective preference ratings (Flinn et al., 2013; Yen et al., 2013). The primary goal of the current study was to examine specific design characteristics based on the more favorably rated lids from that prior study. Lid design characteristics evaluated explicitly in the current study were top and side shapes, height, and texture for two representative lid diameters.

The primary user population of interest in the current study was older women with some degree of hand impairment. Females, particularly girls and older women, are known to have problems opening jars (Yoxall et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2008; Voorbij and Steenbekkers, 2002). This is related, in part, to hand anthropometry and strength (Crawford et al., 2002), but in older women this may also be associated with discomfort or pain associated with a health condition, such as OA. Hand OA was reported by Dahaghin et al. (2005a) to affect 67% of women and 54.8% of men in the population over 55 years of age. Important for jar lid opening, symptomatic joints often include those in the thumb (Dreiser et al., 2000). Yet, hand health of participants in prior jar lid openability studies has either not been reported or people with hand symptoms have been explicitly excluded from study participation (Crawford et al., 2002). The current study, therefore, addresses an important void in the knowledge base by featuring, as study participants, older women with hand impairment.

Lastly, the study evaluates lid design characteristics based on usability, rather than maximum torque exertion. As discussed by Carse et al. (2011), jar opening is a complex activity and alternatives to assessing maximum voluntary torque can provide valuable information and insight. Further, because subjects in the current study had some degree of hand impairment, repeated testing at their maximum level of exertion was deemed problematic. Repetitive testing within a short period of time would likely cause fatigue, discomfort, or even pain. As such, an alternative protocol which utilized submaximal exertions was developed for the study.

Participants were recruited from retirement communities in the Central Ohio area. Similar to the participant recruitment and eligibility assessment processes used in the prior study (Yen et al., 2013), the initial eligibility criteria included being female, at least 65 years of age, and having self-reported difficulty in opening jars or bottles with twist-off lids. In addition, a hand function assessment method developed by Yen et al. (2013) was applied to determine each participant's hand dysfunction level. The assessment included two short surveys and six short performance tests to measure difficulty in performing ADL, chronic pain, sensibility, dexterity, pinch strength, anatomical integrity, and mobility of the thumb (Table 1
                        ). Participants received a total weighted score from 0 to 10, where 10 was defined as the worst hand function level and 0 was defined as no hand problems. The hand assessment was performed at the time that informed consent was obtained from the participant, and in advance of the lid testing sessions. The hand assessment was not conducted on the day of the test session because of concern for tiring the participants, physically and/or mentally, given their age and hand condition. The hand assessment served to verify that all participants had some hand dysfunction.

Eighteen older women (mean age: 85.4 years; s.d.: 5.4 years) participated in the study. According to the self-report survey, all the participants used their right hand to turn lids when performing jar opening tasks, and 89% experienced hand discomfort or pain in the month prior to the study. Overall, the mean hand dysfunction score of the participants was 5.8 out of 10 (s d.: 1.8) (distribution is presented in Fig. 1
                        
                        .). Participants whose scores exceeded 5.5 were categorized into the more severe hand-dysfunction group (n = 11), and participants with lower scores were categorized as the hand-healthier group (n = 7).

There were thirty-two lid designs tested in the study, including two diameters (28 mm and 42 mm), two heights (9 mm and 17 mm), two top shapes (circular and hexagonal), two side shapes (flat and convex), and two surface texture of sides (smooth and serrate). The selections of lid shapes and surface texture tested in the study were based on results from Yen et al. (2013). Heights and diameters represented smaller and medium sizes of common beverage bottles, water bottles, and sauce/dressing containers currently in the market. Images and dimensional information are provided in Table 2
                        . The lids were made using a 3D CAD/rapid prototyping system; they were all white plastic and were attached to identical bottles in order to minimize any subjective preference based on appearance.

Usability of the lid design features was based on the participants' subjective ratings of perceived effort and discomfort when trying to open the lids (which were glued in place). The process required participants to perform only two or three repetitions of their MVT at the beginning of the experimental session, using the taller, circular lid with flat sides. The remaining exertions in the session were all performed at 70 percent of that reference maximum voluntary torque (Fig. 2). The perceived effort levels were verbally reported by participants using the Borg CR10 Scale (Borg, 1998). The discomfort ratings were on a five-level scale: “Not uncomfortable”, “Somewhat uncomfortable”, “Pretty uncomfortable”, “Very uncomfortable”, and “Painful”.

The activities of evaluating each lid design were performed with the subject seated facing an oscilloscope and two response scales; the jars were positioned on a table to the right of the subject (see Fig. 3
                        ). A testing lid was mounted on a bottle held in a closure torque sensor (STBA50, MARK-10, Copiague, NY; Capacity: 570 Ncm; Resolution: 0.5 Ncm) prior to the evaluation process. The participants were encouraged to position each lid (along with the bottle) onto the torque sensor by themselves, especially for the non-circular shaped lids, so that it felt most comfortable for their hands as they applied a twisting force.

Participants were given instruction to “Lift the flashing line to the red line by twisting the lid”. They were instructed to apply a twisting force to turn the lid so that their applied torque (i.e. flashing line or analog signal line) matched the target torque (i.e. 70% of RMVT, which was marked with thin red tape) on the display of the oscilloscope (2245A, Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) positioned in front of them. The exertion was isometric, because lids were glued to bottles. The more torque the participants applied to the lid, the farther the flashing line moved upward. The participants were asked to match the flashing line with the red line and then hold the applied torque for four seconds.

After the four-second exertion participants were asked to evaluate the lid they just experienced. They were asked (1) “According to the scale, how difficult was it for you when turning the lid?”, and (2) “How uncomfortable did your hand feel?” A replica of each scale was presented on a board in front of the subject, as a visual prompt to aid subjects in rating their effort and discomfort. A researcher pointed to the corresponding display board when asking each question.

Participants were tested one at a time. Lid-twisting exertions were performed while seated, using the dominant hand, which was the right hand for each subject. The relative height of the testing lids was adjusted according to the participant's elbow height. The participants were required to sit comfortably upright with their feet on the floor, shoulder adducted, elbow flexed about 90°, forearm pronated, and wrist in a neutral position. No specific lid grasp type was suggested during the experiments. Participants were instructed to adopt any grasp type they used normally for opening jars or bottles.

Each participant's diameter-specific MVT was tested at the beginning of the test session by turning a prototype model that reflected common, current jar lid design (17 mm ht, circular top shape, flat side shape, smooth surface texture), matched in diameter to the lids that would be tested in that session; all the lids of one diameter (medium or small) were tested in a single session. During the MVT measurements, participants were specifically instructed to ramp up to their peak capacity, sustain the effort for a brief time, and then gradually ramp down. No verbal encouragement was given during the tests. In addition, 2 min breaks were allowed between at most three trials – if the first two trials were within 10% of each, the third one was not collected. Out of the two or three consecutive measurements, the maximum reading was defined as the participant's reference MVT for lids of that diameter. Accordingly, 70% of the participant's reference MVT was calculated for use as the target torque for testing all the lids of that diameter.

Next, a customized transparency card that fit the oscilloscope's screen was made and marked with two horizontal lines for the specific participant: (1) baseline, which represented the location of the analog signal line when zero N-cm was applied, and (2) target line (with thin red tape), which represented the location of the analog signal line when the target torque was applied.

The participants practiced the evaluation process before testing began. During the evaluations, a minimum 30 s break was given between torque exertions. The participants were encouraged to request more rest if any symptoms of fatigue were felt at any point during the experiment.

In order to minimize any possible fatigue and discomfort associated with hand conditions of the participants, a complete block design was adopted which allowed for testing the blocks on two different days with at least three days between test sessions. Lid diameter was the block factor. In each block, sixteen lid designs, composed of two top shapes, two side shapes, two heights, and two surface textures, were tested. Testing order was randomized within each block. The testing order of the two testing blocks was randomized between subjects.

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows (version 19, IBM, Armonk, New York). Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test was applied first to test the normal distribution hypothesis for the data sets. Linear Mixed Model Analysis (Dependent variable: perceived effort ratings based on Borg CR10 Scale; Fixed factors: all other factors; Random factor: subject; Repeated covariance type: compound symmetry) was applied after that to test the fixed effects of the jar lid design characteristics (main effects and interactions). Associated pairwise comparisons (e.g. comparing estimated marginal means) were made if any significant effects were found; Tukey's test was used. The relationship between perceived effort and discomfort ratings was examined by Spearman Correlation Coefficient.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The MVTs given by the participants are shown in Fig. 4
                        . When turning the medium lids (42 mm dia), the MVTs between the hand-healthier and hand-dysfunctional groups were significantly different (ANOVA test, p = 0.015). When turning the smaller lids (28 mm dia) their MVTs were not significantly different (p = 0.092). As a point of reference, removal torques required to open current jar products in the market (Reliable Caps LLC, 2011) are also provided in Fig. 4.

According to the experimental design, the testing results of fixed effects of lid design characteristics on perceived effort are discussed separately by the block factor, lid diameter. The lid design characteristics that had significant effects on perceived effort ratings are summarized in Table 3
                        . Differences between hand function groups are included in the table.

Overall, lid height played the most important role in affecting perceived effort, for both medium and small lid groups. The medium lid designs that received the lowest perceived effort ratings were the ones with a tall height, a hexagonal top shape, and convex side shape, which were especially beneficial to the hand-dysfunctional group. Lid texture (smooth or serrate) did not appear to affect participants' perceived effort.

In the small lid group, the best designs for the hand-dysfunctional participants were the ones with a tall height and a hexagonal top shape. There was no significant difference between the side shapes (flat or convex). However, if the lids had a flat side shape, the serrate surface texture appeared to provide some advantage. For the participants with healthier hands, a taller lid height was also important, except for lids with a hexagonal top shape and flat side shape. A hexagonal top shape was beneficial to tall-convex lids only; otherwise, no significant effect was found. Effect of lid texture was not significant for the participants with healthier hands.

The relationship between the perceived effort and discomfort ratings were monotonic, for both lid diameters for both hand function groups. Spearman correlations for the medium lids for the hand healthier and the hand dysfunction groups were 0.78 and 0.50, respectively; for the small lids for the hand healthier and the hand dysfunction groups correlations were 0.45 and 0.53, respectively; all at p < 0.0001. It was observed that for both medium and small lids, lid height had a significant effect on participants' perceived discomfort ratings for both hand health groups (p < 0.001), which is consistent with the perceived effort ratings. There were fewer significant effects of the other design characteristics on perceived discomfort (see Table 3), in comparison to effects on effort.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The objective of this study was examining the effects that several jar lid design characteristics might have on a particularly sensitive group of users who had not explicitly been studied previously, that is older women who report experiencing pain when opening jar lids. Thirty-two lid designs that consisted of two diameters (28 mm and 42 mm), two heights (9 mm and 17 mm), two top shapes (circular and hexagonal), two side shapes (flat and convex), and two surface textures of sides (smooth and serrate) were examined through a subjective evaluation process. Lid height was identified as the most important design characteristic. Among the tested 42 mm dia. lids (which represented containers for sauce and dressing products), the designs that received the lowest perceived effort ratings were the ones with a tall height, a hexagonal top shape, and a convex side shape, which was particularly beneficial to participants with more severe hand dysfunction. For the hand-healthier group, shorter lids with convex sides were more uncomfortable and required more effort than shorter lids with flat sides or taller lids with convex sides. In the 28 mm diameter lid group (which represented containers for drink products), the better lid designs were ones with a tall height and a hexagonal top shape features. For small diameter lids with a flat side shape, a serrated surface texture could provide an advantage for older people with greater hand dysfunction. For the smaller diameter lids, the shorter lids with convex sides were more uncomfortable and required more effort than shorter lids with flat sides or taller lids with convex sides, for both groups of participants.

This study showed the importance of examining interactions between lid design characteristics, as well as how their impact may vary with different user groups. As opposed to Yen's research (Yen et al., 2013) which studied the similar group of participants but only examined lid design characteristics' main effects, the current research findings were mostly conditional. For example, a hexagonal top shape was concluded to be more preferred than traditional circular design in the previous study (Yen et al., 2013); whereas in the current study, the hexagonal top shape was only beneficial in conjunction for medium lids with a convex side shape or a tall height. For small lids, a hexagonal shape was mainly beneficial to the participants with more severe hand dysfunction, though subjects with healthier hands were not disadvantaged by this design. As for subjects with healthier hands, a hexagonal design was better only on tall-convex lids; otherwise, no significant effect was found. The conclusion with regards to the importance of lid height is generally consistent with the study by Crawford et al. (2002), in which those results showed an increase in maximum torque production as lid height increased, and this was true for all three lid diameters, though not necessarily for each group of subjects (based on visual inspection of their Fig. 1). Lid height was not significant when Crawford et al. (2002) compared square to round lids. Height was also not included in the list of six key factors presented by Rowson and Yoxall (2011). However, in the current study, a main effect from height was the single most consistent effect and made the greatest difference in both dependent measures and for both participant groups.

The effects of lid design characteristics on perceived effort ratings were examined via Mixed Model Analysis and estimated marginal means comparison. However, it is important to consider whether or not effects are meaningful from a practical perspective, as well. Mean differences in perceived effort ratings for the statistically significant effects in Table 3 are listed in Table 4
                     . For example, if we apply a criteria of 1 or greater on the Borg CR10 Scale to define a “practically meaningful” effect (Bonner et al., 2013), two highlighted design recommendations for 28 mm and 42 mm diameter lids would be: (1) Regardless of the lid diameter, a taller lid height (17 mm) is strongly suggested, and (2) Regardless of the lid diameter, for shorter lids (9 mm), a flat side shape is more favorable than a convex design.

From a practical perspective, no specific grasp type was prescribed for participants in the current study. The participants were asked to adopt any grasp types they used normally for opening jars or bottles. This free choice approach has been used previously (Crawford et al., 2002; Yoxall et al., 2006; Voorbij and Steenbekkers, 2002). The primary advantages this approach offers are 1) improved face validity in that participants' grasps will resemble their behavior when interacting with real products, and 2) in addition to the evaluation ratings given by the participants, their grasp types observed during the experiments also provide data that may reflect the ways in which people with various types of hand limitations use their hands to interact with products.

By design, only older females were recruited and the lid designs were tested with their right hands only. MVTs of the hand-healthier participants in the current study were similar to results from a group of older healthy females reported by Berns (1981), 0.86 Nm (0.16) v. 0.83 Nm (0.32), though methods differed in lid diameter (28 mm v. 27 mm), height (17 mm v. 18 mm), surface texture (smooth v. rough), and bottle location (fixed v. moveable) between the current study and Berns', respectively. Other studies that have assessed MVT differ in more ways from the current study, thereby precluding comparison. This comparison provides some degree of external validation of the hand function classification in the current study, as does a modest correlation of −0.67 between the reference MVT for the 42 mm lid and the hand function score. In spite of these, misclassification error was possible, because hand function was assessed only once, and not on the day that either size of lid was tested.

Consistent with previous research, the current study found that a significant portion of the participants are likely to experience difficulty opening jars, given the strength they displayed in comparison to the opening torque requirements of products in the market (Fig. 4). Participants in the more severe hand-dysfunction group would be predicted to be able to open only about half of the current container products with medium diameter lids, whereas hand-healthier participants would seem to have the requisite strength. However, regardless of hand dysfunction level, the prediction would be that all of the study participants would have significant difficulties opening most of container products with small diameter lids. Future studies should include left-handed and male participants to examine whether the current research findings are applicable to other user populations.
