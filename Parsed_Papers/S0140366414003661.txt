                  Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) traffic streaming over vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) challenge could be distinguished by the frequent VANETs topology change, paired with real-time streaming of IPTV traffic which requires high bandwidth and strict performance service quality. For VANETs to deliver better quality IPTV traffic, the network must satisfy the compelling Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of real-time traffic streaming, such as jitter, bandwidth, delay, and loss. There are numerous metrics defined in the literature for evaluating multimedia streaming traffic QoS such as: video quality metric, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio, moving picture quality metric and many more. However, these metrics relied upon the objective approach of quality evaluation that requires the original signal as reference, and cannot isolate the impact of network impairments on the video quality. Therefore, fail to provide any mapping between the network QoS parameters and the respective deteriorated quality of the multimedia traffic. Similarly, such procedures are not practically applicable to VANETs whose network characteristics make it practically impossible to access the reference video sequence. Hence, in this paper, we conduct an experiment to determine the feasibility of delivering a qualitative IPTV service over VANETs. We derived analytical model to quantify the IPTV QoS influencing parameters, where we establish relationships between the variables of each parameter and their impacts on the IPTV traffic QoS. Through extensive experiment, we evaluate the IPTV transmission QoS parameters, to assure a priority for handling bandwidth allocation, delay and loss control to a negligible level.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The advances in mobile ad hoc and wireless communication have presented a new potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Increasing attention has been centered on developing these technologies on vehicles in order to utilize them for improving driving conditions. By introducing short range communication means to vehicles, an ad hoc network of vehicles known as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is formed, allowing vehicles to communicate with one another, thereby exchanging vital information’s regarding road conditions. VANETs is a unique type of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), it differs from infrastructure based networks such as cellular networks on its demanded equipment to form a transportable network [1]. VANETs makes use of the wireless technology such as 802.11p wireless standards, General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), as well as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) to communicate with surrounding vehicles [2–4]. Based on VANETs technology, a large number of safety related applications and non-safety applications have been implemented. Safety applications offer relevance traffic safety information to drivers while on the road, some good examples are: Intelligent Road Traffic Signalling System (IRTSS), collision warning, incident management cooperative, speed violation detection, and many more [5–8]. While non-safety application offers information and entertainment for both drivers and passengers, e.g., Internet access, multiplayer games, multimedia applications, etc. A variety of relevant data such as weather information, tourist information, gas prices and parking space information can also be spread using this same procedure. These services, also known as infotainment, can offer unlimited opportunities for vehicle internet applications that can make the driver and passengers experience more pleasant. In this paper, we focused our attention on the infotainment aspect of VANETs application, where we proposed the deployment of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) over VANETs. However, to successfully deploy IPTV over VANETs, it’s imperative to first overcome the major challenge faced by VANETs, which are the issues of Quality of Service (QoS) and its operation. Unlike other mobile network, VANET has certain unique characteristic (i.e., high node mobility and frequent link break) [9], that poses several difficulties in supporting a quality IPTV service transmission. Consequently, streaming IPTV traffics which by nature are multimedia traffic that requires on time information delivery, huge bandwidth and strict performance service quality, possess a greater challenge. Multimedia communications generate traffic at an inconsistent rate and in general require that the network supports the rate at which the traffic is being generated. Unfortunately, VANETs resources are finite, as such; there are sections of the network in which resources may not be available to meet the multimedia application requirements. Therefore, requires QoS mechanisms to control the allocation of the network resources to the application traffic such that will meet their end-to-end quality service requirements.

QoS in any network, be it local area network, wireless network, mobile ad hoc network or vehicular network cannot be overemphasised. In computers and all packets switched networks, the term QoS does not refer to the achieved service quality. Rather, it refers to the resource reservation control mechanisms, which is the capability of a network to provide dissimilar priority to diverse applications, users, or to ensure a certain level of performance to informations flows [10]. Quality of service therefore, is the measure of service availability of a network and its transmission quality. The availability of service in a network environment is a crucial fundamental element of QoS. Network Qos metrics are used to collect information regarding network status. And using the collected information from these metrics, actions or decisions can be taken to alter or adjust network parameters or configurations in a way that can guarantee better quality delivery. To provide a minimal level of IPTV quality in VANETs, VANETs must satisfy the compelling QoS requirement of real-time traffic streaming. It was deduced from literatures [11], that the transmission quality of IPTV network is determined by four major factors namely: minimum bandwidth, packet loss, delay and delay variation. For VANET to deliver better quality IPTV services, the network has to meet certain requirements for bandwidth, jitter, delay, and loss. There are many metrics defined in the literature for the evaluation of multimedia streaming traffic QoS such as: video quality metric (VQM), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) [12], Reduce-Reference Image Quality Assessment (RR-IQA) [13], Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [14], V-factor [15], to name only a few. Nevertheless, all these methods depended upon the immanent and the intrusive approach of video quality evaluation that involves a reference picture or video, and as such, not suitable for use in monitoring real-time traffic in a complex environment such as VANETs. Whose network characteristics make it practically impossible to access the reference image or video sequence, and so requires a measurement approach that evaluates the multimedia traffic quality blindly.

The primary objective of this paper is to experiment via simulation to determine the feasibility of delivering a qualitative IPTV service over VANETs, by evaluating the IPTV transmission QoS determinant parameters (loss, throughput, and delay). To achieve this objective, we developed analytical models to quantify the VANETs QoS influencing parameters; where we established a relationship between the variable of each parameter and their impacts on the IPTV traffic QoS. In addition, through extensive simulation, using network simulator NS-2, we evaluate the IPTV transmission QoS determining parameters (loss, throughput and delay), to assure a priority for handling bandwidth allocation, delay and loss control to a negligible level. Furthermore, we adopted an objective QoS evaluation metric known as the Media Delivery Index (MDI) scheme [16], to identify, locate and address the loss or out-of-order packet. MDI is a set of measure that can be used to monitor IPTV streaming quality and to show the margin for IPTV services with no requirement for reference video or images. MDI has the potential to provide a holistic IPTV approach that gives detailed information about jitter, packet loss and delays at any instance in the network and could detect instantly when there is a problem with the packet delivery. MDI provides accurate measurement for identifying delay and packet loss at a network level, identifying and quantizing these parameters is the key to sustaining high quality IPTV delivery over VANETs.

The rise of IPTV has brought about potential to transform digital TV entertainment. Streaming multimedia traffic across a high extensive wireless networks bring about easy access to personalized digital entertainment. IPTV being one of the existing home wireless network application which is aimed at streaming digital television over wireless internet and its ability to do so has made digital television content easily available for a wide range of users. It allows for portability and flexibility in terms of space control for personal amusement. The importance of acquiring an understanding of IPTV QoS over wireless network has been highlighted in several recent works. Previous work in [17] proposed an effective model to study statistical QoS guarantees, based on efficient bandwidth and delay-bound violation probability for multi-layer video conveyance across a fading wireless channels. However, only the separate queues manage the multi-layer video arrival process in their evaluation and so does not take into account the statistical characteristics of the video traffic. Study in [18] proposed an extended two-dimensional Markov-chain model for IEEE 802 multi-hop wireless network, throughput analyzing and taking into consideration the error-prone channels, non-persistent traffic, post-back off stage and finite retry limit. The analysis of the throughput provides the upper-bound throughput performance of the streaming video. Nevertheless, traffic being considered lacks a description of the characteristics of video because it is generally non-persistent traffic. A seamless cross-layer interworking between broadcasting network and 802.11 WLAN network for delivery adaptive and interactive mobile TV was proposed in [19]. They evaluate the packet losses and the TV quality perceived services using an experimental test-bed. Though, the test-bed results validated their proposed algorithm. But then, the test-bed base performance realization, consumed allot of time and the setup is too complex. Study in [20] investigates the performance of IPTV loss packet that can be caused by overflow buffer, in various scenarios of home networks, which include constant rate data wired link, multi-hop wireless path and variable data rate for single-hop wireless link. An on–off traffic sources was used for the arrival process to characterize the video source, for the service process, an exponential distribution was presumed for the service time distribution of the data linked examined. However, using on–off arrival model for exponential service time and video source distribution for the protocol behavior of complex network like IEE 802.11 MAC protocols considerably limits the feasibility of the analytical results. Although, there are many metrics defined for providing QoS for audio and video traffic streaming over VANET such as the one proposed in [21,22], where they concentrate on monitoring video quality based on human perception (human judgment) subjective, however the scheme, lack monitoring as well as solution to fixed jitter, delay nor loss problem, in a network and these are the major parameter that call the shots as to whether a network can convey good quality IPTV services or not. Subsequently, the most recent works in [23], suggested a novel architecture for ensuring QoS for seamless mobile IPTV services in heterogeneous access networks. The architecture was designed to account for three technical issues, which are: the network to client conditions, the communication signalling between client and servers, and the adaptive streaming based on the network conditions. Their proposed architecture was evaluated using two approaches, that is, the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP in application layer and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in the transport layer. These two protocols were then compared through the operational rating (i.e., performance evaluation). Likewise, authors in [24], proposed a novel adaptive MAC protocol with QoS support for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, their proposes QoS-aware MAC protocol was designed to provide for efficient traffic prioritization such that can guarantee high channel utilization in wireless sensor network. However, due to the unique resource constraint and application requirements, standard QoS protocol developed for wireless could not be applicable to VANETs. Ideally, QoS-aware protocols should provide guarantee level of performance, which is achievable through resource reservation with adequate infrastructure. However, in an ad hoc network such as VANETs, it is difficult, if not impossible to furnish a guarantee service QoS. The challenge lies in the fact that there is no infrastructure to rely upon for bandwidth assurance, and the high dynamic nature of the network, makes a resource reservation almost impossible. Since, the valuation of any arrangement that provides QoS is application specific because quality is application dependent. The monitoring of bandwidth, delay, loss or jitter requirements of applications could be studied via simulations or experimental test bed, where QoS parameters can be employed to assess the quality demanded of these applications. Because, the ability of an application to adapt its behavior to changing network conditions, strongly depends on the connectivity availability of the network, which is influenced by the throughput, packet loss and delays in the network path (see Table 1
                      for list of acronyms).

Our work in this paper is limited to Medium Access Control (MAC) layer QoS implementation. In contrast to previous studies, our objective in this study does not include proposing a new MAC protocol, nor does it include adapting existing MAC scheme, but rather we intend to demonstrate how QoS can be undertaken to support real-time multimedia traffic such as IPTV over an arbitrarily network such as VANETs, through efficient modelling and analysis of the existing protocols. Focusing on the Mac layer aspect enabled us to effectively assess and model VANETs capacity in terms of connection-level QoS metrics such as delay, packet loss ratio, and throughput. In this context our work extends the concept and models of existing literature [22,25], by the following contributions:
                           
                              •
                              First, we derived analytical model to quantify the VANETs QoS influencing parameters, where we established a relationship between the variables of each factor and their impacts on the IPTV traffic QoS.

We outline a method for adequate buffer memory size, configuration, using the Delay Factor (DF) component of the MDI scheme. Considering VANETs characteristics as regard to its frequent link instability. In order to reconnect the broken links, vehicle need to catch up with another vehicle ahead, and this takes time. During the catch up period, the routing protocols employ a strategy known as Cary-and-forwarding, a situation where node forwarding packets hold the packet for a next optimum hop yet to be available [26], by buffering the packets and transmit it in a later available opportunity. However, the buffer memory needs to be sized accordingly. For example; a small sized buffer may result in frequent loss of packets, when there is network congestion. Consequently, a relay node may experience frequent buffer overflow when there is no reachable node to convey packets being sent to it from the uplink node. Furthermore, large buffer could also affect the quality of the IPTV traffic, as packets may miss the delivery deadline due to large buffer size. As such, the network buffers need to be sized accordingly to be able to accommodate these inconsistent VANETs situations. Using the DF component of the MDI scheme one could deduce the length of time that will be required to buffer a stream packet to avoid packet loss.

Through extensive simulation in NS-2, we evaluate the feasibility of the underlying VANETs in terms of the network’s ability to deliver qualitative IPTV traffic. Where we characterized the connection between throughput, delay, loss and the IPTV traffic degradation as a function of node density and node speed. Most VANETs simulation results show that the time by which VANETs communication channels stay connected is limited, this means that nodes connectivity experience frequent interruption. In spite of these evidences (i.e., the uncertain events that randomly interrupt the node connectivity and alter their distribution in VANETs); most previous works in VANETs real-time multimedia traffic QoS assessment ignored these phenomena. However, this phenomenon (i.e., VANETs characteristics in terms of its link instability due to node density and node speed) has a significant effect on the quality of multimedia traffic across the network.

Through simulation, we also demonstrate that MDI: DF is an effective metric that could be used to effectively monitor and fix VANETs intrinsic QoS problems.

IPTV technology is one of the rapidly developing technologies, aimed at facilitating access to audio visual entertainment. It enabled the delivering of broadcast digital Television and other interactive multimedia services across a secure internet protocol medium, from the point of transmission to the user’s computer or Television set. IPTV uses an internet protocol (IP) over a broadband connection to provide services along side with the internet connection of the user or subscriber. This is made possible by utilizing the same network root, but over a dedicated bandwidth distribution. Thus, IPTV can be defined as a system in which multimedia services such as: live TV, video, voice, pictures, graphics, text and other related services are delivered to different subscriber across a broadband connection adopting the internet protocol [27]. IPTV over VANETs is aimed at gaining an extension of IPTV and other related services available to drivers and passenger while travelling on the road. This objective calls for an efficient management of available VANETs channel resources to support the adaptive nature of the network. In order to supply the needed quality IPTV services to users regardless of their location and their preferences. This task is very challenging, the fact that IPTV uses IP to transmit multimedia signal over a network, and IP designed to be a best effort network protocol does not guaranty QoS provisioning [28]. IPTV streaming, requires a constant, steady flow of information and has a time limit for packet delivery, any packet that fails to reach the destination on or before the time limit is considered a loss packet and such packet is dropped. If too many packets are missed as a result of delay, there will be no sufficient packet left for re-construction, since these packets are needed at the receiver end for successful reconstruction back to its original form. Therefore, it becomes impossible to reconstruct the same video as the original, this result in poor video quality at the receiving end.


                        Fig. 1
                        . Described a typical IPTV over VANETs architecture design for the model use in this paper. It’s a hybrid VANETs architecture (i.e., using both V2V and V2I communication) in a highway VANETs scenario, where base stations are deployed over the highway such that their signals overlap to avoid coverage blackout on the road. All the base stations are connected to the Internet (Fig. 1). The internet connects the IPTV generator server and a channel changing video on demand server (VOD) which in turn is connected to the IPTV stream generator server. The original IPTV video as broadcasted by the television station or satellite receiver are formatted, encoded and compressed using some sets of H.264 encoder, all this takes place at the super head level as shown in Fig. 1. The encoded, compressed data, are then packetised utilizing the RTP/UDP/IP protocols and forward to the stream server of the IPTV generator, which in turn forward the stream video packet to the internet and distributed throughout the access network to the destination vehicle(s) (see Fig. 1). All vehicles within the radio range of the road side unit (RSU) will be able to receive the IPTV stream signal directly in a one-hop communication mode, thereby forming a V2I kind of communication. Similarly, vehicles within the RSU communication range can also act as a source node, thereby relaying the IPTV traffic to those vehicles outside the RSU radio communication range (as shown in Fig. 1). The existence of vehicle to relay the IPTV traffic to other vehicles that are not within the RSU signal coverage range is critical, as this will maximize the packet delivery ratio, maximize throughput and minimizing the rate of packet loss for better quality IPTV delivery. The VoD server uses a special file format, for example AVI, QuickTime, Real Media and so on to store the data which can later be streamed across the network to a destination vehicle based on demand. In this arrangement, RSU acts as the source node that relays the IPTV traffic signal to the whole vehicles within its signal reach. Other Vehicles within the RSU signal range, can also act as source nodes by relaying traffic to those vehicles outside the RSU transmission range (as shown in Fig. 1).

Quality of service is the measure of service availability of a network and its transmission quality. In order to successfully implement quality of service in any network environment, the network infrastructure must be designed in a way that it will be highly available for users. For real-time multimedia traffic such as IPTV, the ultimate QoS objective is to provide a minimum level of restriction over the prevailing “best-effort” service guaranteed by conventional IP networks. However, QoS management for digital TV transmission over the Internet is an overwhelming task, due to the lack of data transfer speeds and delivery time guarantees. The difficulties increased in mobile wireless networks such as VANETs, as resource availability such as bandwidth are scarce and vary immensely over time. QoS is not only limited to the physical aspects of transmission, as the overall quality of the session is greatly influenced by the encoding parameters, the error and congestion control. IPTV streaming over VANETs strongly depends on the encoding technique, and the connectivity availability of the underlying VANETs resource. These two major constrain could introduce errors that could significantly degrade the quality of the video being delivered. IPTV end-to-end traffic streaming may experience two phases of quality degradation as the signal propagates from the source (transmission point) to destination (receiver end), see Fig. 2
                     . These two phases are [29]:
                        
                           •
                           The encoding phase: the encoding phase involves the encoding, compression and packetization of the raw IPTV signal, which is later broadcast across the underlying network. At this phase, the transmission quality of the IPTV traffic strongly depends on the method of encoding and the degree of compression. Generally speaking, an increase in multimedia compression results in lower video quality, but a smaller data stream. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the network bandwidth and the degree at which the video is being compressed. Currently, there are numerous compression algorithms in use for encoding and decoding multimedia data stream such as: MPEG-2, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, to mention just a few.

The transmission phase. The transmission phase is the phase after the encoding phase. This phase involves the distribution of the encoded and packetised IPTV signal (i.e., the output data from the encoder(s)) over the underlying network, which in this case is VANETs. In order to transmit IPTV signal over an IP network, the raw IPTV signal is first encoded and compressed into a series of frames, which are later fragmented into packets before being transmitted across the network. Under this phase (i.e., IPTV packet transmission phase), many factors can contribute to the degradation quality of IPTV packet traffic. Issues such as congestion in the underlying network, noise, bandwidth limitation, link failure (as in the case of VANETs where links experience frequent disconnection and reconnection due to high node mobility), and many more.

The quality degradation at the encoding phase strongly depends on the selected encoding parameters and the adopted coding procedure which are codec dependent. In this study, we assumed that quality degradation that might arise as a consequence of bad IPTV encoding is well taken care of. The quality degradation at the transmission phase are degradation that takes place during the service transmission over the network, and are network dependent. This is the aspect that concerns us in this paper, since our interest is to evaluate VANETs in terms of its capacity to convey qualitative IPTV traffic given the changing state of the VANETs channels. Presently the assessment of multimedia quality deterioration resulting from the network QoS is determined either subjectively or objectively when decoding at the receiver’s terminals [30]. From a network point of view, this process does not isolate the effect of the network distortion on the quality of video being transmitted, as it fails to provide any mapping between the network QoS parameters and the corresponding deterioration of the video quality resulting from the effect network channel characteristics. Therefore, the procedure is not strikingly relevant to network operators, who may want to observe the manner in which the network QoS conditions is affecting the multimedia traffic quality. Providing QoS guarantee over VANETs will require a comprehensive understanding and quantification of the interaction between traffic source, the VANETs links and the underlying network link-layer error control mechanism. In this paper, we account for such interaction in the analytical model that we use to investigate the distribution delay and packet loss rate over a VANETs channel. In contrast to previous studies, our investigation takes into consideration the inherent VANETs channel error characteristics.

There are many standardized metrics used for assessing the quality of IPTV service delivery, such objective metrics like the V-factor, VQM, PSNR, MPQM, SSIM, MDI, to mention but a few. No matter the optimization metric used, the touchstone for assessing streaming media quality can be grouped into three approaches; Full Reference, Reduce Reference and No Reference.
                           
                              •
                              Full Reference approach: the Full Reference (FR) requires a complete copy of the undistorted video alongside the distorted one in order to assess the QoS. Some examples of the FR are the popular Peak Signal to Noise Ration (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [12].

Reduce Reference approach: the Reduce Reference (RR) is an objective video quality assessment method that requires part of the original video. In the RR metric, a limited feature is extracted from the original video, which is used to evaluate the quality of the distorted video. Reduce-Reference Image Quality Assessment (RR-IQA) proposed in [13,31], Video Quality Assessment by Reduce Reference proposed in [32], are some few examples of the RR metric.

No Reference approach: the No Reference (NR) evaluates the multimedia quality blindly with no requirement of neither full nor part of the original video content. This feature makes the NR quality assessment metric more suited for usage in realtime video streaming environment, and can also be used anywhere, in any existing compression system and transmission network where the original TV signal is not accessible. Some good examples of the NR are the Media Delivery Index (MDI) [16], and V-Factor [15].

The demand for Internet to support real time video and television service such as IPTV, has posed a great challenge for test engineers. Whose major concern is to evaluate network performance and equipment in order to provide a deep understanding of the network’s ability to handle real time multimedia traffic. The desire for a measurement metric that will provide information about good delivery, rather than seeking to analyse delivered video quality, which alone indicate the nature of the video, but fail to prove or establish what went wrong that result in such degraded quality. There is a need for metrics that can provide information regarding loss packets, jitter and delay in a way that can easily be assessed and measured. If the video is properly encoded, the most important concept to consider is how well it is being delivered across the network to the user, which is the primary objective of implementing the QoS in the first place. As proposed in [16], MDI scheme is considered to be the appropriate metric that is capable of providing the necessary information needed to assess network problem that affect the quality of multimedia streaming traffic. MDI provides detailed information on how different streaming can affect the network, as its values are based on the streaming video bitrate. Similarly, MDI could provide information on how the network QoS parameters are affecting the quality of the multimedia service as it is being delivered. MDI is made up of two components namely; the Media Loss Rate (MLR) and the Delay Factor (DF) [16]. Collectively, the two provide vital insight into what might have happened to any video data stream as it propagate through the network. This information is vital, because it enabled network engineers to easily detect the cause of a poor video quality.

QoS support for quality IPTV deployment over VANETs demands for a simple and accurate channel model. Unlike wire networks, whose channel capacity is constant, VANETs uses wireless infrastructure whose channels relies upon arbitrary factors such as: co-channel interference, multipath fading, and so many more [33,34]. Significant research performed on real-time multimedia traffic over high speed vehicular networks [35], showed that in order to sustain high quality delivery of real-time rich multimedia traffic, it is necessary for the underlying networks to support high data rate and better connectivity. An accurate estimate of VANETs link connectivity will ensure that QoS provisioning of IPTV traffic over it link is optimal with respect to the channel properties. By understanding these properties of VANETs link connectivity, one can appropriately manage traffic to ensure that specific QoS targets on packet delay are met. In this context, we account for the fundamental influence factor that affect the radio propagation in a VANETs; such as path loss, and multipath fading. By gaining a comprehensive mathematical formulation of numbers of relevant factors that define the dynamic connectivity of vehicular ad hoc networks. Our analysis, pave way for us to model the transmission probability, the connectivity, the capacity per flow (throughput), packet loss and packet delay and to demonstrate how IPTV QoS can be undertaken in an arbitrarily connected VANETs to support qualitative IPTV services. Table 2
                     , contains all relevant information regarding the meaning and definition of all the symbols employed in the analytical model.

                        The most obvious effect of attenuation is path loss which relates to the interval between a transmitter and a receiver.

Let d be the interval between the sender and the receiver i.e.,

                         is the wavelength. Note however that, Eq. (6) is only valid if the distance d is in the far-field of the transmitting antenna.

To account for a situation in which parts of the wave front are reflected or absorbed as a result of obstacles, we adopted the long distance path loss model in [37,38]. Reckoning, the shadowing component such as vehicles and other surface that could reflect wave in a VANETs environment make this model suitable to be used in vehicular networks. Therefore, Eq. (6) can then be extended by introducing a path loss exponential

Consequently, a pair of nodes is either connected or not; therefore we define the connection probability obtained from the channel model as the average over an infinite amount of realization:

However, contrary to a fixed network, where individual links may be technically realized as dedicated links, VANETs due to its broadcast nature, allows a sent message to be picked up or received by all neighboring nodes at the same time. Therefore, when studying vehicular ad hoc network connectivity, it is vital that we consider their representation as a hypergraph H, i.e., a generalized graph in which edges are arranged as pairs of sets (hyperarcs), rather than tuples (as in Eq. (15)).

                              Each individual sender has a set of receiving nodes, which can be represented by an associated hyperarc from the one sender to sets of recipients. Thus, the set of sender hyperarcs A is given by:

                              Each receiver has a set of senders that it receives from, this can be represented by an associated hyperarc from the set of senders to the receiver denoted as

In VANETs, the channels in the network are known to be shared between all the vehicles (i.e., nodes) in the network (as Wireless networks share a common medium). Thus, it will be relevant to recognize that there exist segments of the network that are determined with nodes that are in range with one another, which uses the different network segments. As a rule, we define the vehicular wireless network segments according to the sets of receiving hyperarcs

The QoS parameters throughput, packet loss and packet delay are dimensions that depend not only on the physical layer implementation of the vehicular wireless technology, but more so, on the MAC layer implementation: the manner in which the wireless nodes actually access the channel has a significant impact on these parameters. All MAC protocols have to make a tradeoff between maximum throughput, ease of implementation, fairness and so on. The actual performance of a protocol may depend on a number of further parameters such as size of nodes that share the medium, the message length, the message prioritization, resource allocation, and susceptible to interference. However, the key factor that determines the performance of a MAC protocol is the possibility that a packet sent from a source (i.e., a transmitter) to a receiver(s) is successfully delivered. Aside the protocol dependent parameters mentioned above, the most influential parameter is obviously the cumulated load (i.e., the totality of the individual offered traffic) in a collision domain (see Eq. (29)).

In order to calculate the average throughput offer by the vehicular networks, we assumed that the capacity per flow of data (a flow is as defined in [40], is a set of IP packets going through network during a certain time interval), is proportional to the ratio of the network capacity to the concurrent rate of flows (i.e., underlying network cumulative load). The throughput (

The delay that a packet experiences is determined by two factors: (1) the amount of time that the packet has to queue before the MAC literally gets to access the channel, (2) the number of necessary retransmission until successful delivery, as every retry adds to the delay that the packet experiences. Let us denote the average time until the channel is accessed as 
                              
                                 τ
                              
                           . Then, we can determine the delay

                            plays a major role in the IPTV QoS assurance, as it associates the network capacity with the QoS performance and shows the rate at which QoS violation probability degrades. A large

                            results in a lesser delay, that is to say a rigorous QoS assurance can be insured guaranteed and vice versa. To be more specific, as

                           , implies that the network can no longer tolerate any delay, likewise as

To determine the feasibility of our proposed model, we simulate our model using the network simulator NS2 [44]. In order to generate IPTV traffic analogous to the one transmitted over real IP network, we use the MPEG-4 video traces data which is freely available on the Internet (the trace file is created by group of researchers at the Technical University Berlin in the year 2000) [45]. Similarly, to simulate IPTV scenario as realistic as possible (i.e. IPTV real scenario where different users watch different TV program simultaneously), we concurrently stream a combination of four different video traces (Formular 1, Jurassic Part 1, ARD News, Soccer) of YUV:MP4 format (the four video traces are simulated to be movies and TV program), to generate an aggregated IPTV traffic (see Fig. 3
                        ), each video clip starts at a random selected time of 0.3s. All relevant information regarding the four video traces as used in the simulation is detailed in table 3
                        . Each frame in the MPEG-4 trace file used in this simulation is break down into multiple packets fragments equal to 552Mb, and transmit into the network following the RTP/UDP/IP packetization guideline and the MTU constraint as stated in [46], though, we did not use any built-in RTP services. We run each simulation for 200s, and the traffic source uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for transferring Constant Bit Rate (CBR) flow IPTV application without acknowledgement. The architecture proposed in Fig. 1, is simulated through a simple scenario where base stations were deployed over a specific section of the highway within the coverage area of 1000m by 1000m to ensure that their signals are overlapping. The base stations were connected to a central router which in turn linked to an IPTV generator server and a channel changing Video-on-Demand server (VoD) that is connected to the IPTV stream generator server. To make our work simpler, we referred to both RSU and vehicle as nodes, with RSU label as a stationary node at a fixed position and vehicles as mobile nodes. In this system we assumed that all vehicles on the road are equipped with wireless capability that complies with IEEE 802.11e standard, for V2V and V2I communications. The underlying network is built purely as an ad hoc network and the communication mode is a hybrid VANETs communication. Due to the mobility of vehicles and the limited transmission range of the RSU, we employed a hybrid VANETs scenario (see Fig. 1), where vehicle within the RSU transmission range act as a relay node by relaying traffic to vehicles outside the RSU transmission range via V2V communication, and those vehicles within the RSU transmission range connect directly in a one-hop manner. All vehicles are capable of supporting computational and storage resources. In the simulation we considered a two lane homogenous traffic highway, where we considered a variable speed of 0 when the vehicles are stationary to 20m/s (m/s). Three traffic density situations we considered: sparse mode with 6 vehicles, medium mode with 13 vehicles and dense mode with 20 vehicles. The wireless access standard used is the IEEE 802.11e. DSRC PHY and MAC layer were implemented using standard set by ASTM and the data rate set to 1Mbps. All other parameters as used in the simulation are detailed in Table 4
                        .

In this experiment, the considered assumptions were as stated below:
                           
                              •
                              All necessary encoding and decoding have been properly executed.

Each node has buffer capability to buffer packets when packets need to wait for transmission.

No packet is lost in the expanse of the wired segment of the network connection path

Vehicles on the road are mobile nodes with wireless ability capable of supporting large computational and memory resources.

The power supply was considered not to be a problem because the engine of the vehicle should be able to supply adequate power for computation and whatever should need power to operate effectively.

Advance on demand vector routing protocol (AODV) was utilized for the routing between nodes and the MAC used for the node is IEE 802.11Ext. We investigate the system performance based on three key performance factors which are throughput, latency or packet delay and packet loss rate. To accomplish our design as realistic as possible, we evaluate the IPTV transmission QoS parameters through a series of simulations. In each simulation, we investigate the impact of each individual metric as it affects the quality of IPTV packet delivery.

In this experiment, our aim is to ascertain that the underlying VANETs, given its characteristics, has the capacity to support IPTV traffic at higher speeds under different traffic scenarios. Using NS-2, we define the capacity per flow of vehicular network by measuring the network throughput along a uniform unidirectional traffic stream. To measure the throughput, we estimate the network capacity via three network scenarios ((a) scenario with 6 nodes in sparse mode (b) scenario with 13 nodes in medium mode and 20 nodes in dense mode). In order to estimate the maximum available throughput, we allowed a VBR traffic flow in the network to ensure that the whole available bandwidth along the route between the origin and destination is dedicated to the transmission. Fig. 4
                           , shows the average throughput with respect to speed for the three vehicle density scenario. It could be observed that throughput is higher in the scenario with the lowest vehicle density scenario (i.e., node 6) in all the speed level; This implies that the average rate by which quality IPTV traffic can be delivered is greater with low vehicle density than high density. Through our observation, the throughput dropped as the vehicle speed increases and it is higher in the denser scenario (20 nodes) compared to the sparse or medium scenario. This also implies that the higher the vehicle density the greater the throughput dropped with increased vehicle speed. The dropped in throughput as a result of vehicle speed and density is caused by VANETs broadcast storm issue and the frequent link instability. As the vehicle density increases, so also is the amount of broadcast messages. However, impact of such excessive broadcasts originating from vehicles as the density increases are bound to have increased contention on communication links resulting in signal contention, collision, interference and signal impairment, in consequence downgrade the capacity per flow of the network. Consequently, the increased in vehicle speed causes’ link instability and rapid signal level fading. Thus, causing the drop in throughput, and so the higher the velocity, the greater the impact of fading on the amount of data transferred. In conclusion, throughput is greatly impressed by speed and vehicle density, with a lower vehicle density leading to higher data rate, which is greatly reduced by vehicle speed.

It could be observed from the graph that the packet loss, increase as the speed and the number of the vehicle increases. Though, at speed

                           ). This could be attributed to fewer link disconnection as a result of even nodes distribution at that speed, and so buffer overflow or buffer underflow is less. However, at the speed >10m/s the packet loss can be observed to increase significantly, with the 20 nodes can be observed to be higher than all the other density scenarios. This is because as the vehicle speed increase, the rate at which nodes moves away from the transmission range increases rapidly, and as the density increases, the number of nodes competing to access the channel and the amount of transmissions increase, thereby, increasing the packet loss probability due to collisions. This result conformed with Eq. (6), in our proposed model which illustrate that the received power deteriorates equilaterally with the distance. Thus, the drop in signal strength results in an increasing packet loss. Furthermore, the result in Fig. 5A, satisfy our loss model (see Section 4.2.2). As the node density increases, the number of transmissions in a collision domain also increased correspondingly, thus increasing the cumulative load W (i.e., as more traffic is being injected, the source vector 
                              s
                            increases and an increase in

                            result in W being increased, see Eq. (29)). Consequently, an increase in W is an indication that the number of nodes relaying messages have increased, which signifies the increasing number of nodes competing to access the available channel, thus, increasing collision. The increase in collision decreases the success probability

                            intensifies the rate of packet loss, and an increase in packet loss decreases the possibility of reproducing IPTV traffic streaming with reliable quality as the probability of transporting packet successfully decreases. Thus, the data in Fig. 5A suggested that quality of IPTV traffic streaming over VANETs is influenced by both node (vehicles) density and node speed and that the speed of 10m/s can be presumed to be the critical speed. Therefore, the quality of IPTV traffic will deteriorate if vehicle speed exceeds the critical speed of 10m/s, and the rate of deterioration increases linearly with increasing node density. This implies that within the speed

                            where the aggregate packet loss ratio is below 2.1% (see Fig. 5B
                           ), PTV service can be deployed with packet loss that can support enough video rate with reliable quality. However, at vehicle speed higher than 10m/s, some problem will occur while reproducing an IPTV stream without any special technique (special technique such as: buffering, error concealment) due to the high packet loss rate.


                           Fig. 6
                           , illustrate the average delay for three different vehicle scenarios with regard to speed. It could be observed that packet delay increases as the vehicle speed increases, and in some cases the packet delay decreases even when the speed increased. This is due to the number of handoff. Packet delay depends on the number of handoff, as can be observed in Fig. 6, the scenario with 20 nodes was affected more, this is due to the fact that the scenario contained more nodes, as such, more handover were expected to occur. Depending on the number of handover, the packet delay can increase or decrease as the speed increases. The increase in end to end delay as the vehicle speed increases can be attributed to high propagation delay. As the vehicle speed increases, so also is their distance apart. And as the inter vehicle gaps widen, the stability of the link is affected (as the higher the gap between vehicles the lesser the transmission range and the higher the probability of link disconnection). In order to reconnect a broken link that might be caused as a result of the enlarge inter vehicle gap, vehicles will need to catch up with other vehicles ahead to reconnect, and this takes time. During the catch up period in VANETs, the routing protocols employ a strategy known as Cary-and-forwarding, a situation where node forwarding packets hold the packet for a next optimum hop yet to be available [26], by buffering the packets and transmit it in a later available opportunity. However, for real-time traffic such as IPTV, there is a specific needed time (threshold time) by which these packets must be buffered. And so, depending on the stability of the link, the threshold time can decrease or increase. With an increase in threshold time, resulting in the decrease in the delay probability and decrease in the threshold time given rise to high delay probability (see Eq. (37) Section 4.2.3). Consequently, in Fig 6, as the vehicle density increases, the delay can be observed to have intensified. The reason could be attributed to the increasing number of transmissions competing to access the limited available network link (As higher vehicle density implies increase in the number of nodes relaying messages). Thereby increasing the amount of time required for packets to queue before the MAC to literally get to access the channel. Thus, increasing the likelihood of a delay exceeding the maximum delay constraint (see Eq. (38), Section 4.2.3). The result in Fig 6, implies that the average delay of IPTV services increases as the traffic load and node mobility increases. However, depending on the inter vehicle distance and the number of nodes involved in the communication, the delay could decrease slightly even when the vehicle speed increases (this situation could be observed in Fig 6, between the speed 5m/s and 10m/s). In Fig 6, it could be notice that within the speed ranging from 5m/s to 10m/s, the scenario with the node density of 13 experiences a slight reduction in delay even when the vehicle speed increases, while the 6 node scenario experience a stable with an insignificant increase in delay within the same speed limits (i.e., speed ⩾5m/s and speed=10m/s). This situation can be said to conform with our delay model in Section 4.2.3 Eq. (37). Consequently, at this same speed limit (i.e., speed

                           10m/s), in Section 4.3.2 (packet loss experiment) a minimal packet loss was also observed. Thus, it will be fair to conclude that the threshold speed in which IPTV services with reliable quality can be feasible, is the speed limit 
                              
                                 ⩽
                              
                            0m/s. As long as this speed limit of 10m/s is not exceeded, reliable IPTV quality can be assured.

With the simulation result obtained, a series of computation was conducted using the interval of one second each, and using the three different density scenarios of the vehicle nodes going with the speed of 20m/s. To obtain MDI: DF, eight different measurements each, of the three density vehicle scenarios were taken. The values were used to determine the loss or out-of-order packet over the time interval of one second, to obtain the relationship between MDI: DF and loss, as shown in Fig. 7
                           . It could be observed that as the packet loss increases, so also was the DF value. And for a small loss of 25.56 packets per second, the increment of the DF was moderate for all density scenarios, but when loss exceeded 25.56 packets per second the DF value could be seen to be very high. This means that larger buffer will be needed at the point where the DF value is high, in order to provide an acceptable quality IPTV service. High DF value, is an indication of buffer underflow or buffer overflow and degree of packet loss. However, for a known equipment, the buffer size if fixed, a small sized buffer may result in frequent loss of packets when there is congestion. Similarly, a large size buffer could introduce unnecessary delay, as packets in the buffer could miss playback deadline. The DF component of the MDI pinpoints the length of time at which a streaming packet must be buffered to avoid packet loss, as it provide evidence for the minimum and maximum buffer size that can be contained at the downstream node. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, the stage where the loss was 25.56MB and the DF value was 0.025s. To obtain these values, the initial packet sent was 552Mb and at the end of one second, 526.44Mb was delivered at the receiving end, this means that 25.56MB packet were lost. In order to avoid packet loss of the jitter observed, the receiver virtual buffer would have to be about 25.56MB or 25,560kb to inject 0.025Mb/s or 25ms of acceptable delay that will assure a good quality IPTV service delivery. The DF component of the MDI as demonstrated in this experiment, indicates the length of time a streaming multimedia packet needs to be buffered to avoid situations that might lead to a buffer overflow or under flow at the receiver end.

MDI does not analyse the video signal decoding, but it detailed how well a video is being delivered, which is the most important outcome, if the video was properly encoded in the first place. Although, good MDI results do not necessarily mean the quality of the video being delivered is good, for MDI is not dependant from the quality of the video signal. Nevertheless, MDI-DF as a metric, can be used to specify the network nodes and links which have congestion any time and in any part of the network. Such results are very useful for network providers, because they can easily determine whether the buffer settings on the different devices can provide the required bit rate needed to deliver qualitative IPTV service. MDI values are a realistic expression of video transmission problems over an IP network. Though, many other video measuring metrics have been proposed in literatures, such as VQM, SNR, and PSNR. However, in this research, we use the MDI metric because of the detail information it can offer and the advantages it delivers over the aforementioned objective metrics. Some of these advantages are listed as follows:
                              
                                 •
                                 MDI does not require any symbolic real time processing power, as it does not carry out any kind of stream decoding to accomplish its metrics.

MDI does not depend upon any character of multimedia encoding method, as such, can comfortably be scaled to monitor the quality of multimedia traffic on numerous channels simultaneously.

The reliance of MDI on transport layer metrics, makes it an effective tool for setting out network merging. As it can directly relate mutually to network impendence problem, with regard to the quality of the multimedia traffic.

Unlike VQM, PSNR and other objective metrics, MDI do not require original video signals or clip as reference, this attribute makes it best suited to be employed as a metric for evaluating real-time video traffic such as IPTV.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this report, we describe the QoS parameters that could be applied to characterize the performance of IPTV traffic over vehicular network, and how these metric particularly relates to quality IPTV service guaranteeing. We derived analytical model to quantify the IPTV QoS influencing parameters, where we establish relationships between the variables of each parameter and their impacts on the IPTV traffic QoS. Through simulation using NS-2 the IPTV QoS determinant parameters (loss, throughput, delay and jitter) were evaluated based Media Delivery Index (MDI) scheme. Accordingly, we outline how MDI-DF as a metric can be used to identify network nodes and links which cause congestion in any portion of the network, and how, such result can help in shaping network constraints to optimize data flows across the given network. In addition, we evaluate the feasibility of our proposed model, through extensive experimentation in NS-2. Our simulation results show how delay, and packet loss can be minimized to a degree that can assure good quality IPTV delivery. This implementation opens the possibility that loss and delay can be minimized in a manner that can guarantee good quality IPTV delivery over VANETs.
