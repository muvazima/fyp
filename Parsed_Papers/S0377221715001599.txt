                  Blending biofuels into fossil fuels allows for emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, biofuels are not yet competitive due to high production costs and investments and thus, legal requirements like blending quotas or emission thresholds must be issued if biofuels are to contribute to European CO2-reduction goals. Thereby, the aim is to establish Pareto-efficient long-term legal requirements. Against this background, we develop an optimization model for simultaneously minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value in order to analyze the overall system of biomass cultivation, (bio)fuel production and blending. The applied ε-constraint approach allows to calculate Pareto-efficient solutions. The model is applied to the German (bio)diesel market. We show that current and past European Union directives are not Pareto-efficient and cause unintended side effects. As results, information about trade-offs between the two objectives (minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and maximizing discounted net present value) as well as recommendations on the design of the regulation is derived.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The transportation sector consumes 26 percent of global delivered energy (EIA, 2013) and emits 22 percent of global CO2 emissions, 75 percent of them resulting from road transportation (IEA, 2012). In the future, the usage of fossil fuels must be reduced in order to ensure supply security as well as projected emission savings within the transportation sector. One option for achieving these targets is the substitution of fossil fuels by biofuels (Dinh, Guo, & Mannan, 2009). Accordingly, global production of biofuels is expected to grow from 54 bln in 2005 to 222 bln of biofuels in 2021 (OECD, 2012). However, high investments are necessary, and until now production costs of biofuels (BMU, 2011) are higher than those of fossil fuels. Thus, stipulation by political regulation is necessary (as is for instance intended by the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC)). Against this background, the paper focusses on the analysis and design of legal regulations for production, import and blending of biofuels for road transportation.

Each type of fossil fuel (or fuel blend) can be substituted by different kinds of biofuels. Thereby, biofuels can be classified into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation biofuels (IEA, 2011). Where 1st generation biofuels are mainly produced from raw materials which can also be used within the food and fodder industry like e.g. corn or sugar can, 2nd generation biofuels are mainly produced from residual materials like e.g. straw or residual wood. Biofuels of the 3rd generation on the other hand are produced from non agricultural materials like e.g. algae. Since 3rd generation biofuels are still not market-ready, they will not be discussed further. To date, political decision makers as well as investors have to decide, whether and to what extent 1st or 2nd generation biofuels should substitute fossil fuels in the future. 1st generation biofuels have disadvantages like low compatibility with engines, competition with food production and limited emission reduction potential. For 2nd generation biofuels, very high investments and production costs are needed (IEA, 2011). Production of 1st as well as 2nd generation biofuels might lead to land use change, e.g. if agricultural areas that have been used for cultivation of biomass for food or fodder are rededicated to cultivation of biomass for biofuels. Additionally, trade-offs occur with regard to life cycle emissions and costs. Thus, a thorough ex-ante analysis of the complex and interacting system of (bio)fuel production is a prerequisite for the design of long-term political regulations that are Pareto-efficient with regard to economic and environmental objectives. However, this was disregarded in the past and as a result, political regulations for the promotion of biofuels in the European Union (EU) changed repeatedly within the last years.

Thus, we conduct an ex-ante analysis of the (bio)fuel production network in order to design and evaluate Pareto-efficient legal regulations. Thereby, the complete system of biomass cultivation, biofuel production as well as import of biomass, biofuel and fossil fuels has to be regarded, and all fuels that can be blended to fulfill total fuel demand (fossil fuels, 1st, and 2nd generation biofuels) must be considered. Capacities of agricultural areas and potential land use change effects have to be taken into account in order to avoid unintended side effects. The system has to be evaluated regarding emission reduction and total costs simultaneously.

Against that background, we develop a bi-objective, multi-period optimization model, considering cultivation of biomass, production of biofuels, import of biofuels and biomass, as well as blending of fuels. Our aim is to identify Pareto-efficient solutions and to derive trade-off information for political decision makers regarding profit maximization and emission minimization. The paper is organized as follows. First, the planning problem is presented in Section 2, and a literature review is given in Section 3. In Section 4, the optimization model is developed, and applied to a case study in Section 5. Finally, conclusions and outlook on further research are given in Section 6.

In this section, the planning problem is characterized, followed by an overview of political regulations of the biofuel sector. Model requirements are derived as a result of this analysis.

The production system of the (bio)fuel sector (Fig. 1
                        ) consists of three phases: (1) cultivation of biomass, (2) conversion of biomass into biofuels and (3) blending of biofuels and fossil fuels into final fuel blends sold at the market.

In phase one the cultivation of biomass takes place. Several kinds of biomass may be used for biofuel production (IEA, 2011). These characteristics differ with regard to energy density, prices, availability, region of cultivation, and emissions during cultivation. The polluted emissions also depend on the type of land used for the cultivation, and on transportation distances between cultivation and fuel production. The capacity of the different types of agricultural land is limited. If biomass for biofuels is cultivated on land that was not used for the cultivation of energy crops so far, land use change appears (SWD(2012) 343). This results in accessory emissions that depend on the climate, soil type, land cover, and land management (2010/335/EU). However, it is still discussed how land use change can be integrated in legal regulations. If biomass is imported from other countries, emissions of biomass cultivation and land use change arising in the supplying countries must also be accounted for.

In phase two, biomass is transformed into biofuel using fuel-specific production technologies. These production technologies differ with regard to permitted biomass, processes, degree of centralization, economies of scale, production capacities, conversion efficiencies, resulting by-products, investments and production costs. The polluted emissions during production of biofuels vary depending on used biomass and production technology. Decentralized plant concepts convert biomass into an intermediate product in the proximity of biomass cultivation, and afterwards this intermediate is transported to a centralized synthesis facility (Trippe et al., 2013). In centralized plant concepts, all production steps are carried out within one production facility (Blades, Rudloff, & Schulze, 2005). Currently, there already exist plants for production of fossil fuels and 1st generation biofuels, whereas only pilot plants exist so far for 2nd generation biofuels (SWD(2012) 343). Biofuels and fossil fuels can also be imported from other countries, and costs, emissions as well as land use change have to be regarded for these fuels as well.

Within phase three the final blending of fuels takes place. Thereby, the final blend depends on total demand for fuel blends, legal requirements regarding certain biofuel quotas and CO2 reduction goals, technical blending restrictions, and production costs. The final fuel blend may be pure in quality or can be blended from different kinds of fossil fuels and biofuels. Blending of 1st generation biofuels is limited (2009/30/EC) due to restricted compatibility with car engines. Blending of 2nd generation biofuels is not restricted, since synthetic biofuels have the same (or even better) quality as fossil fuels. Besides, the specific energy contents of the fuels have to be considered in the blending process. The total life cycle emissions of the sold fuel blend correspond to the average emissions of all (bio)fuels included in the blend (2009/28/EC).

As can be seen in Fig. 2
                        , legal regulations may be implemented at all life cycle phases of the fuel, i.e. biomass cultivation, biofuel production, biofuel distribution or to the total biofuel life cycle.

Political instruments can be grouped into three different types of measures: a) regulatory measures (e.g. market share quotas, emission thresholds) providing specific minimum or maximum threshold values that have to be fulfilled by the market players, b) market based measures (e.g. taxes, subsidies) providing financial incentives for favorable technologies or products (or a financial burden for undesired ones), and c) suasive measures (e.g. information, promotions) aiming at a change of the behavior of the market players in a voluntary way. Legal regulations can contain only one of these political instruments (e.g. tax exactions for biofuels), but may also combine a set of different political instruments (e.g. biofuel tax exactions together with subsidies for the construction of new biofuel production plants and emission thresholds). An overview of political instruments for the (bio)fuel market applied in different countries around the world is given in Fig. 2. The different political instruments are classified regarding the three fuels’ life cycle phases and types of measurement.


                        Fig. 3
                         illustrates the legal measures implemented in the EU since 1997. As can be seen, quotas for market shares for biofuels changed between 1997 and 2009. In 2009, unintended side effects like the food vs. fuel debate (OECD, 2011) and land use change effects resulted in a modification of the type of regulation, and 2nd generation biofuels were granted double to quadruple weight in the calculation of the required biofuel market share. Furthermore, minimal emission savings have to be fulfilled. Since 2009, emissions resulting from land use change are integrated in the emission calculation (2010/335/EU, 2012/0288 (COD)). A bonus that had been provided for biomass cultivated on restored degraded land (2009/28/EC) was eliminated in 2012 (COM(2012) 595).

Over time, a broad range of legal regulations for the (bio)fuel market was implemented. However, these regulations lead to unintended side effects and non-efficient results. The resulting changes of the regulatory framework lead to a lack of planning reliability for potential investors. Therefore, there is a need for long-term stable political regulations, which are Pareto-efficient and avoid unintended side effects.

Based on the analysis of the biofuel production network and the current and potential regulations, requirements for the optimization model can be derived. The production network is characterized by potential material flows, technologies, and capacities. At the input side, availability of biomass, i.e. agricultural area for biomass cultivation as well as import capacities for biomass and biofuel, must be considered. Additionally, land use change considerations have to be regarded in order to avoid unintended side effects. At the demand side, total fuel demand should be considered, i.e. fuel blends composed of fossil as well as 1st and 2nd generation biofuels with related blending restrictions. In order to account for Pareto-efficient regulations, economic and environmental objectives have to be regarded. Since long term investment decisions have to be taken, a multi-period model is necessary. In the next section, existing studies are analyzed considering the derived requirements.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

A multitude of papers covering biofuel planning problems can be found in the literature, e.g. regarding bi-objectives (e.g. Bernardi, Giarola, & Bezzo, 2013), multi-periods (e.g. Avami, 2013), different plant concepts (e.g. Walther, Schatka, & Spengler, 2012), capacity classes (e.g. Zhang, Osmani, Awudu, & Gonela, 2013), and import aspects (e.g. Gunnarsson, Rönnqvist, & Lundgren, 2004). However, none of these studies considers all of the requirements. To evaluate ecological impacts, emissions have to be considered within the objective including life cycle emissions of all blended fuels as well as environmental effects of land use change. Existing planning models either neglect land use change (e.g. Bai, Hwang, Kang, & Ouyang, 2011) or integrate it as a constraint (e.g. Akgul, Zamboni, Bezzo, Shah, & Papageorgiou, 2011; Andersen, Iturmendi, Espinosa, & Diaz, 2012; Osmani & Zhang, 2013; Zamboni, Shah, & Bezzo, 2009). However, this does not allow accounting for unintended side effects of political regulations as the available biomass is being restricted right from the start. As an exception, Panichelli and Gnansounou (2008) integrate land use change in the objective function. However, they do not consider a complementary economic objective, and thus, it is not possible to analyze eco-efficiency trade-offs. Therefore, a model that is able to account for impacts of land use change is still missing.

Additionally, most planning models do not consider the whole fuel sector, but regard biofuels only, i.e. biofuels of the 1st generation exclusively (e.g. Elia et al., 2013; Kim, Realff, & Lee, 2011; Santibañez-Aguilar, González-Campos, Ponce-Ortega, Serna-González, & El-Halwagi, 2011) or 1st and 2nd generation biofuels without fossil fuels (e.g. Akgul, Shah, & Papageorgiou, 2012b; Giarola, Shah, & Bezzo, 2012). Thereby, the biofuel demand is modeled as fixed quota of total fuel demand. As a result, blending restrictions are neglected, and optimal blending quotas of the different kinds of (bio)fuels in the final fuel blend are not derived, but have to be given as external parameter. Thus, these models neglect the complex interaction and market competition between fossil fuels as well as 1st and 2nd generation biofuels. Furthermore, limited substitution potential of fossil fuels by biofuels because of restrictions on biomass cultivation or biofuel import is not considered adequately. Additionally, only a share of the emissions and costs of the fuel sector is considered, which may lead to local optima.

For the design of long-term stable Pareto-efficient political directives without unintended side effects, legal regulations have to be included in the optimization model. Thereby, existing planning problems for biofuel supply chains focus on market based mechanisms like taxation (e.g. Akgul, Shah, & Papageorgiou, 2012a; Giarola, Zamboni, & Bezzo, 2011; Marufuzzama, Ekşioğlu, & Hernandez, 2014) or incentives (e.g. You & Wang, 2011), which are integrated in the economic objective function. However, regulatory mechanisms like biofuel quotas or emission thresholds have to be considered as well.

Concluding, there is lack of models that regard the total fuel demand that can be fulfilled by blending biofuels and fossil fuels. Also, land use change considerations are so far not adequately considered, and the design of Pareto-efficient political directives is not emphasized. To overcome the identified research gaps, a hybrid (biofuel/fossil fuel), bi-objective, multi-period, technology, import and blending optimization model for the whole fuel sector, including fossil fuels as well as 1st and 2nd generation biofuels is developed optimizing economic as well as ecological objectives simultaneously, and regarding land use change as well.

In this section, the bi-criteria optimization model will be presented followed by an overview of solution procedures.

The system encompassing biomass cultivation, biomass supply, biomass/biofuel import, transportation, production, blending and demand is modeled as network flow problem. Biomass and intermediate products are classified as input materials (i ∈ I), which can be transformed into biofuels and by-products as output materials (m ∈ M). Biomass can be cultivated on different kinds of agricultural areas (a ∈ A), either on the home market or in supplying countries (s ∈ S). Only selected types of biomass i can be cultivated on agricultural area a (a ∈ Ai
                        ; Ai
                         ⊂ A; a ∈ Ais
                        ; Ais
                         ⊂ A). The transformation takes place at production plants of different technologies p (p ∈ P) and capacity class c (c ∈ C). Technologies can transform selected inputs i (biomass and intermediate products) into biofuels of different types m (p ∈ Pim
                        ; Pim
                         ⊂ P) or into intermediate products i' (p ∈ P
                        
                           ii'; P
                        
                           ii' ⊂ P). Finally, produced biofuels, imported biofuels and fossil fuels are mixed into different fuel blends k (k ∈ K) in order to satisfy total fuel demand. The planning horizon is set to T periods (t ∈ T).

Considering the network structure, decisions can be taken regarding the installation of production facilities of a certain technology p and capacity c in a period t (ypct
                        ) and the number of production facilities of technology p and capacity c that are used in period t (

                        ). Additionally, allocation decisions are taken in each period t regarding cultivated biomass in the home market (

The demand for final fuel blends k in period t (Dkt
                              ) is fulfilled by blending several kinds of fuels m (xmkt
                              ). Thereby, coefficients (ωmk
                              ) represent the blending of fuel m into final fuel blend k according to the energy densities of the blended fuels have to be considered.

Area types a can be e.g. forest, grassland, crop land for food production, crop land for biofuel production etc. Biomass for biofuel usually grows on area type “crop land for biofuels”. However, biomass i might also be cultivated on other area types (like forest, crop land for food production, etc.). In this case, land use change results, and land use change emissions have to be accounted for. Accordingly, land use change emissions are set to zero (

A solution is Pareto-efficient (Ehrgott, 2006) if it is not possible to improve the solution in perspective of one objective by not decreasing the value of another objective. The approach of Pareto-efficient is regularly applied to eco-efficiency planning problems (Huppes & Ishikawa, 2001; Quariguasi Frota Neto et al., 2009). A-priori, interactive as well as a-posteriori methods can be used for solving bi- (or multi-) objective optimization models (Hwang & Masud, Abu Syed Md, 1979). For our model, a-posteriori methods have advantages in that the utility function of the decision maker is not necessarily known in advance, and the decision maker might not be available during the decision making process. In order to search for non-dominated solutions, the weighting method as well as the ε-constraint approach can be applied (for an overview, see Ehrgott, 2006). There are several drawbacks of the weighting method, like e.g. redundant runs or the impact of the scaling of the objective function on the results (Mavrotas, 2009). The ε-constraint approach, first introduced by Haimes, Lasdon, and Wismer (1971), generates efficient solutions by converting all but one objective function into constraints of the model. The augmented ε-constraint approach (AUGMECON) developed by Mavrotas (2009) can be used in order to remove weakly efficient solutions generated when applying the classical ε-constraint approach. Thereby, weighted slack or surplus variables are inserted in the objectives which are converted into constraints. The method is extended by Mavrotas and Florios (2013) in order to identify alternative optima by using a kind of lexicographic optimization and by Zhang and Reimann (2014) integrating early exit and bouncing steps to improve the optimization efficency.

In the following, the augmented ε-constrained method (AUGMECON) developed by Mavrotas (2009) is implemented in order to solve the mixed integer bi-objective optimization model. Thus, all efficient solutions are obtained and the calculation of weakly efficient solutions is avoided.

                        2 is the slack variable of the second objective function. The efficient solutions are obtained by parametrical variation of ε2.

The model is applied to the case study of (bio)diesel production in Germany. First, input data is presented followed by the results of the case study and a discussion on implications.

In order to fulfill total diesel blend demand, fossil diesel, 1st generation biodiesel (biodiesel), 2nd generation biodiesel (Biomass-to-Liquid – BtL) as well as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) can be blended with varying quotas. There is one technology for production of biodiesel, and another technology for HVO, whereas two alternative technologies (Carbo-V and bioliq) are available for production of BtL (Blades et al., 2005; Trippe et al., 2013). Depending on the technology and the final diesel product, different kinds of biomass can be used. For biodiesel, it is assumed that rapeseed is cultivated in Germany, soya beans in Argentina and palm oil in Malaysia. Rapeseed can also be used for HVO production. BtL can be produced from straw or residual wood, both cultivated in Germany (statistical data, BEMEL, 2011; BIOGRACE). Costs (BMU, 2011; Schatka, 2011; RENEW, 2006; APEC, 2010; IFEU, 2004) and emissions (2009/28/EC; BIOGRACE; RENEW, 2006) are determined depending on fuel type, conversion technology, and biomass. Emission coefficients for land use change are adapted from EU regulations 2010/335/EU and 2012/0288 (COD). Information on total diesel demand (MWV, 2011) and prices (statistical data) are also derived. The planning horizon is 20 years starting in 2013.

The optimization model contains 3587 constraints and 68,867 variables of which 315 are integer. The CPLEX 12.4 solver was used for solving the model. An optimization time of approximately 2300 seconds is needed for the calculation of the efficient frontier using the augmented ε-constrained method presented in Section 4.2.

We first present the efficient frontier and discuss results and implications. Then, we compare result of the different EU regulations, and analyze unintended side effects.

The Pareto-efficient frontier of the German (bio)diesel market with regard to discounted net present value and life cycle emissions is shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, a trade-off exists between emissions and net present value, i.e. either a maximization of economic results or a minimization of environmental impact can be achieved at the ideal points. If the net present value is maximized disregarding emissions, 100 percent of fossil diesel is used for the final diesel blend, and the cheapest 1st generation biodiesel is used to fulfill remaining biodiesel demand. If the aim is to reduce emissions disregarding economic impact, as much fossil fuel as possible is substituted by BtL. Total substitution cannot be achieved due to limited capacities of agricultural land. In this case, land use change occurs to a large extent due to BtL-production.

In Fig. 5, detailed information is given on results and decision variables for three Pareto-efficient solutions lying in close vicinity. As can be seen, different decisions (import, technology choice, etc.) lead to nearly the same overall results regarding emissions and net present value. This shows that political requirements concerning emissions or quotas can be fulfilled by different production and blending strategies. Thus, there is flexibility for investors and producers in terms of the implementation of technical alternatives for fulfillment of political requirements.


                        Fig. 6
                         presents the results of an evaluation of the EU regulations on biofuels implemented between 1997 and 2012. Legal requirements were implemented as constraints of the optimization model (for an overview on parameters of the different regulations see Fig. 3), and the optimization model was solved using lexicographic order. The constraints were fixed over the complete planning horizon in order to determine long-term effects of the regulations (despite regulations changed repeatedly). As result, it can be stated that there is always a gap to the Pareto-efficient frontier. The highest emission reductions over the planning horizon could have been achieved implementing the directive with the highest biofuel share of all EU directives (COM(2000) 769). For all other regulations, long-term results with regard to net present value and emissions show only marginal differences. Thus, the constant changes in these regulations over the last years mainly caused confusion and uncertainty of investors, but had very limited impact on Pareto-efficiency of the overall system.

The regulations 2009/28/EC, COM(2012) 595, and 2012/0288 (COD) not only claim biofuel market shares and emission saving goals, but also prefer 2nd generation biofuels in that BtL accounts two to four times as much as 1st generation biodiesel for calculation of legally required biofuel market shares. If the BtL eligibility is omitted (regulations without the eligibility of BtL are marked with “-w/o” in Fig. 7
                        ), overall emissions of the (bio)fuel market would decrease as presented in Fig. 7. However, the higher weighting of BtL allows for better economic results of the overall system, as lower investments are necessary in BtL plants and production costs are lower as well.

One unintended side effect of biofuel production – for 1st as well as for 2nd generation biofuels – is the resulting land use change. In order to analyze the influence of land use change, we prohibited land use change by adding a corresponding constraint to the optimization model, and re-calculated the Pareto-efficient frontier. In Fig. 8
                        , the Pareto-efficient frontier of solutions allowing land use change [with_LUC] is compared to the Pareto-efficient frontier prohibiting land use change [w/o_LUC]. As can be seen, total emissions are much higher if land use change is prohibited as compared to emissions if land use change is allowed. This also holds comparing EU regulations with/without adding land use change constraints to the model. The reason for these results is that life cycle emissions of biofuels are lower than emissions of fossil fuels even though emissions of land use change are regarded in the objective function. Thus, there is an incentive to rededicate areas to the production of biomass for biofuels. If social effects like land use change were regarded independently (which is currently not the case), a trade-off with the ecological and economic objective would occur. Thus, these interactions should be taken in consideration when developing Pareto-efficient political regulations and social impacts of land use change might have to be explicitly regarded within the derivation.

Another unintended side effect is that a de-installation of biofuel production facilities occurs during the planning horizon, as can be seen in Fig. 9
                         for the example of the EU regulation 2009/28/EC. First, pyrolysis production facilities of the bioliq technology are installed up to a maximum of seven facilities in 2020. However, two of these facilities have to be closed until 2033. The reason lies within the required relative market share quotas of the EU regulation. Because of this relative quota, total biofuel demand depends on required market share and on total diesel demand. Until 2020, required market share of biofuels increases, while total fuel demand remains stable. After 2020, total diesel demand is expected to decrease due to more efficient conventional drive train technologies and increasing market shares of electric vehicles. Thus, a decrease in total fuel demand leads to a decreased biodiesel demand despite constant legal biofuel market share quotas. Such a situation is very unattractive for investments into biofuel production facilities. To generate an attractive planning situation for potential investors of biofuel production facilities and to face the increasing demand, absolute volumes of blended biofuel could be required. Additionally, it becomes obvious that the interaction with other political regulations (e.g. EU regulations on fuel efficiency of cars (e.g. (EC) No 443/2009) and (EU) No. 333/2014) have to be considered if Pareto-efficient regulations are aimed at.

Summing up, the case study reveals non-efficient regulation and unintended side effects. The permanent changes of the regulation had only small impact on the efficiency of the regulation, while rousing high confusion and uncertainty among investors. Also, the requirement of relative biofuel quotas instead of absolute biofuel volumes might lead to installation of over-capacities.

Recommendations for political decisions makers are derived based on the results of Section 5.2.

First, the goal of the political decision maker is to design political regulations for emission savings within the transportation sector, and to provide economical reasonable and long-term stable planning situations for investors. In order to fulfil these goals, the regulations should be located close to the Pareto-efficient frontier with regard to both objectives, which is best done with trade-off information as provided by the developed bi-criteria model (Fig. 4).

Second, many solutions (technologies, import decisions, etc.) lead to similar ecological and economic objective values (see Fig. 5). Thus, high flexibility can be provided without prescribing specific technologies or biofuels. This allows investors to take their own decisions on how to achieve the required legal objectives.

Third, political regulations of the EU since 1997 often showed a gap to the Pareto-efficient frontier, e.g. they could be improved with regard to ecological and/or economic objectives (see Fig. 7). Thus, regulations should be designed more carefully, and long-term as well as combinatorial characteristics of the planning problem should be considered. As results show, severe changes of legal measures for investors (see Fig. 3) often resulted in only marginal changes of the achievable overall objectives (see Fig. 6). Consequently, such changes should be avoided, since they lead to a reduction of planning reliability and a high degree of uncertainty for investors instead of improved Pareto-efficiency of the regulation. The double weighting of BtL reduces emission savings that can be achieved in the transportation sector and can also lead to over-capacities of biofuel production plants. Thus, these kinds of “repair” regulations should be avoided.

Fourth, the regulation of the EU results in unintended side effects (see Fig. 8), like land use change. Overcapacities might result in the future (Fig. 9). Thus, interdependencies to other sectors (food/fodder sector, fuel efficiency of cars) must be observed.

In this paper a bi-objective, multi-period technology, capacity choice and blending optimization model for the (bio)fuel sector is developed and applied to the case study of the German (bio)diesel market to deduce recommendations for political decision makers. The results allow to evaluate the Pareto-efficiency of current and past legal requirements of the EU. It became clear that political regulations have to be carefully analyzed ex-ante regarding unintended side effects in order to provide long-term stable regulations and planning reliability for investors. Results show, that with the current and proposed EU regulations unintended side-effects like LUC and overcapacities appear. Correspondingly, Pareto-efficiency must be considered, and information on trade-offs to all objectives should be derived. This holds especially, since the proposed EU regulations do not lead to Pareto-efficient solutions. The interaction of the developed regulation with other regulations and other sectors must be carefully regarded in order to avoid unintended side effects.

For further research, the model can be extended in order to account for other important aspects. As a trade-off between land use change and emissions as well as net present value became apparent in the case study, the model should be extended in order to consider this trade-off information. The interaction of the optimization model with a Geographical Information System (GIS) seems promising in order to regard biomass growth and land use change effects in more detail. In order to take into account uncertainties respectively ambiguities, the model can be extended as robust optimization model. Another promising approach might be the separate consideration of the different actors of the fuel sector in order to provide information for political decision makers on incentives or penalties.
