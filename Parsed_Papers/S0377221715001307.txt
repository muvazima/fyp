                  Firms maintain a capital charge to manage the risk of low-frequency, high-impact operational disruptions. The loss distribution approach (LDA) measures the capital charge using two inputs: the frequency and severity of operational disruptions. In this study, we investigate whether or not capital charge could be combined with process improvement, an approach predominantly employed for managing high-frequency, low-impact operational disruptions. Using the categorization of events defined by the Basel Accord for different types of operational risk events, we verify three propositions. First, we test whether classification of operational disruptions is warranted to manage the risk. Second, we posit that classification of operational disruptions will display different statistical properties in manufacturing and in the financial services sector. Finally, we test whether risk of operational disruptions can be managed through a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy. We obtained data on 5442 operational disruptions and ran Monte Carlo simulations spanning both these sectors and seven event types. The results reveal that process improvement can be a first line of defense to manage certain types of operational risk events.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The impact of operational disruptions for a firm includes high costs, quality failure, delay in delivery and reduced customer service levels. All of these factors may negatively influence the firms’ operating and financial performance (Hendricks & Singhal, 2005; Wagner & Bode, 2008). Examples include external events such as the 2011 earthquake in Japan that disrupted global supply chains of large firms (e.g., Toyota) and internal events like the implementation failure of an ERP system that delayed shipments at Nestle (Barker & Frolick, 2003). The risk of such operational disruptions, formally termed “operational risk” has been defined by the Basel Committee as “the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events” (BCBS, 2001). Fig. 1
                      elaborates on this definition and shows a simplified linkage between triggers, events and impact of operational risk. As noted in the definition of operational risk, the triggers are associated with raw materials, people, technology or external events. These triggers can create operational disruptions which can cause large operational losses.

At the outset, firms can improve processes to mitigate the negative impact of operational disruptions (Wang, Gilland, & Tomlin, 2010). However, since most of these operational disruptions are infrequent and since some firms may not have experienced such failures first-hand, process improvement can occur by collecting data on operational disruptions from other firms in the industry. Alternatively, firms can also maintain a capital charge to cover losses arising from potential operational disruptions. Such a strategy involves the use of loss distribution approaches (LDAs) to measure operational risk within a certain confidence level. A common approach is the parametric LDA. Two inputs in LDA are the frequency with which operational disruptions occur and the severity of the operational disruption (i.e., the monetary amount of loss suffered). Firms can also choose to employ either one or both strategies—improving their processes (process improvement) or maintaining a capital charge (capital adequacy). However, it is unclear under what event types of operational disruptions, firms would resort to one or both of these strategies. Thus, the research objective of this paper is to examine the event types and provide insights into which event types of operational disruptions should be mitigated and diversified through process improvement and for which event types firms should keep a capital charge.

To explicate this research objective, please reconsider Fig. 1. We focus on operational disruptions, specifically on event types highlighting whether a firm should keep a capital charge and/or invest in process improvement to mitigate the impact of the operational loss. Table 1
                      provides simple examples of three firms (Firm 1, Firm 2, Firm 3) undergoing two types of operational disruptions: (i) a failure resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes that falls under the event type Execution, Delivery and Process Management and (ii) fraudulent action carried out by customers or external parties that falls under the event type External Fraud. We have used the classification of event types of operational disruptions as prescribed by the BCBS. In Appendix A we elaborate on each event type.

To manage the event type Execution, Delivery and Process Management in banks, Firm 1 can invest in process improvement and keep a low capital charge in case operational losses still occur. Such investments may involve costs such as cost of implementing new systems, hiring additional employees or using quality control processes (Wang, Plante, & Tang, 2013). Conversely, rather than investing in process improvement, Firm 2 can keep a capital charge aside in case a loss occurs from such type of operational disruption. Moreover, Firm 3 can invest in process improvement as its first line of defense and also keep a high capital charge in case operational losses still occur. We speculate that for this type of operational disruption, process improvement, the strategy adopted by Firm 1 as a first step will ensure better management of operational risk.

The second type of disruption, External Fraud, consists of fraudulent action carried out by customers or external parties, for example trying to obtain wrongful benefit through providing fake information. To manage this type of operational disruption, Firm 1 focuses on capital adequacy and keeps a capital charge, Firm 2 on process improvement and Firm 3 on both. We speculate that for External Fraud, the strategy adopted by Firm 3 of combining both process improvement and capital adequacy as a first step will ensure better management of operational risk. In this instance, we speculate that firms should keep a capital charge or have other contingency plans in case the risks of such operational disruptions materialize since the benefits of internal process improvements may be minimal in mitigating External Fraud. Given both these examples, our study shows the appropriate strategy, that is, process improvement and/or capital adequacy given different event types of operational disruptions.

We also contend that the cost invested in process improvement (for mitigation and diversification) for the relevant event type (Execution, Delivery and Process Management) should be lower than the reduction in expected loss. Similarly, for event types where keeping a capital charge would be the appropriate strategy (External Fraud), we conclude that the cost of raising capital for that particular charge should be lower than the reduction in expected loss. In this regard, our research aims at providing answers as to why a firm should choose one strategy or both. Since the investments in process improvement should translate into lower costs and/or higher revenue, we postulate that events with relatively higher frequency and lower impact lend themselves to process improvement. Conversely, event types that display random occurrence and/or higher impact should be considered in the firm’s capital planning process. More technically, the mean value of the distribution of the losses can be reduced by investments in process improvement and be viewed as a mechanism for long-term cost reduction and revenue enhancement. For the remaining unexpected losses, firms should estimate a capital charge. We propose a methodology to identify event types that can be managed through either strategy or a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy strategies.

Moreover, research identifying whether or not firms in the manufacturing sector and service sector would choose different strategies for the same event type remains sparse. Our study answers this question and contributes to the literature in at least three ways. First, we elaborate on empirical loss distributions by examining different categories of operational disruptions. We employ the event type classification of operational disruptions as prescribed by the BCBS. Second, we not only examine these distributions in the service industries in the finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE) sector but also include industries in the manufacturing sector. By examining the two distinct sectors, FIRE and manufacturing, our findings suggest if the strategy adopted for process improvement or maintaining a capital charge differs in these sectors. We fit actual loss data spanning over 13 years for every event type to the theoretical distributions (Frachot, Moudoulaud, & Roncalli, 2007). The frequency of the occurrence of the hazard events can be modeled as a Poisson or negative binomial distribution. The stochastic loss amount (the severity) of a hazard event can be modeled as a lognormal or a combined lognormal and generalized Pareto distribution (GPD, see Vanini and Leippold, 2005). We estimate parameters of these distributions and compare the results with respect to different model specifications. Third, research has delineated operational disruptions that occur with high frequency but have low impact from disruptions that occur with low frequency but have high impact. This distinction is understandable since the strategies to manage both types of disruptions are inherently different. This study concludes that the conceptual underpinnings of these strategies can be used once firms start measuring and managing low-frequency events at an industry level.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on operational disruptions and develops the propositions. In Section 3, we describe the data used. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the results of the data analysis and numerical simulations. We discuss our findings in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we identify the limitations of this study and discuss future research paths.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Examining measurement, mitigation and management of operational disruptions has emerged as an area for interdisciplinary research in finance and operations management. The primary interest in finance focuses on modeling the probability of losses and/or the severity of losses. The modeling of risk of low-frequency, high-impact operational disruptions is not only recognized by businesses and researchers but also by regulation. For example, in the financial services industry, BCBS (2006) outlines three methods for measuring operational risk depending on the sophistication of the methods used by individual banks. These methods are the basic indicator approach, the standardized approach and the advanced measurement approach (AMA), which is the most sophisticated. These approaches differ in their level of data collection and depth of analysis. The sub-approaches of AMA are the internal measurement approach, the loss distribution approach (LDA) and the score card approach. The Basel Committee defines LDA as “an estimate of the distribution of operational risk losses for each business line/event type, based on assumptions of frequency and severity of events.” Similarly, in the chemical processing industry, regulation suggests developing disruption assessment analysis following approaches similar to LDA (Becker, 1997; Meel et al., 2007). These ways of quantifying losses due to operational disruptions suggest that firms should maintain adequate capital to combat future losses. In contrast, in operations management (OM), the management of losses due to operational disruptions has been viewed as continuous learning through process improvement.


                     Choi and Liker (1995) document that orientation toward continuous process improvement in an incremental fashion has positive implications for a firm. Most of the studies in OM on process improvement are focused on high-frequency, low-impact events with tools such as six sigma, fishbone analysis, and statistical process control (Linderman, Schroeder, Zaheer, & Choo, 2003; Stewart & Chase, 1999). However, research has also gradually examined low-frequency, high-impact operational disruptions (Kleindorfer & Saad, 2005). Ebnöther, Vanini, McNeil, and Antolinez (2003) propose a selection method based on the risk contribution of workflows in a bank’s production unit. In line with Fig. 1 that shows that such operational disruptions emanate from different sources, we conjecture that classification of operational disruptions will enable its management.

Specifically, we develop three propositions. The first highlights that operational disruptions display different statistical properties. Second, this difference is not only within an industry sector but also across sectors. Third, the classification of operational disruptions provides direction in its management through the combination of mitigation strategies.

We posit that developing an integrated operational risk management approach requires classification or categorization of operational disruptions by event types. According to the definition of operational risk, the risk of disruption emanates either from internal sources such as systems, processes or employees or from external events. Beroggi and Wallace (1994) outline a process of managing operational disruption as the identification of the event, an assessment of its consequences and the decision to change the planned course of action. Lewis (2003) went further, conceptualizing operational risk as the risk of operational loss events arising from a mismatch between operational capability and market requirements. He identified three levels of risk control as (1) ex ante or risk prevention, (2) in-process or risk mitigation and (3) ex post mechanisms or risk recovery. Kleindorfer and Saad (2005) provided a model for mitigation of operational risk through designing and developing management systems.

More recently Tang (2006), and Stecke and Kumar (2009) review the literature and specify the sources more granularly that contribute to disruptions in operations and supply chains. In particular, they identify external sources as suppliers, customers and logistics and internal sources as employees, equipment and processes. Hendricks and Singhal (2003) also showed that the negative stock market effects firms experience as a consequence of disruptions may vary by source. Studies have also examined these sources separately. Upton and McAfee (1998) investigate the association between advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) and operational disruptions in paper processing plants. Stewart and Chase (1999) highlight the role of human error in delivering quality. Hora, Bapuji, and Roth (2011) document that defects related to suppliers create quality issues in a product, prompting firms to announce product recalls. Wagner and Bode (2008) show the relationship between supply chain risk sources and supply chain performance. The sources of risk triggering operational disruptions have also been formalized as different typologies (for example, see Chopra and Sodhi, 2004).

Therefore, the distinct types of operational disruptions may display different frequency and severity of losses (Kleindorfer & Saad, 2005). Accordingly, we propose that operational disruptions after classification along distinct event types empirically display different loss properties in terms of frequency and severity. In short, it is important to recognize the categorization of event types because in an integrated operational risk management approach the countermeasures to manage such risks may be contingent upon the type of operational disruption. This leads to our first proposition.

                           Proposition 1
                           
                              Types of operational disruptions (event types) display different statistical properties and the countermeasures are contingent upon the event type.
                           

In developing this proposition, we conjecture that besides event types, categorization of operational disruptions (event types) must be specified at the level of industry sectors. At the firm level, industry affiliation may explain 17–20 percent of variance in financial performance (Rumelt, 1991; Schmalensee, 1985). While firms in different sectors may quantify losses due to operational disruptions in similar ways, they may use industry-specific approaches to risk avoidance and management. Companies within an industry sector share a supplier base, belong to the same organizational consortia and follow the same regulators (Wagner, Bode, & Koziol, 2009). Therefore, Kleindorfer and Saad (2005) state that industry and sectoral level analysis should be done on an “on-going basis for understanding the sources of major disruption” (p. 59).

To elaborate, a critical challenge for firms in managing operational disruptions is to understand the inherent complexity and dynamism of their own industry. Knowledge transfer within some industries to manage operational disruptions occurs through a host of operational and technical approaches, including environmental, health and safety management systems. Hora and Klassen (2013) examine operational disruptions in two different sectors, financial services and chemical processing and assert that for management of disruptions knowledge sharing occurs “through informal networks, such as casual conversations between risk managers, and also through formal networks such as task forces and risk workshops that meet periodically to review and exchange experiences” (p. 54). Regulation also plays a part in providing guidance and in some instances distinct classifications of operational disruptions (Chernobai, Rachev, & Fabozzi, 2008). Industries show different levels of dynamism, outsourcing arrangements and growth so their collective view of the risk of operational disruptions may be different.

Therefore, management of operational disruptions should begin by identifying the event types which display different statistical properties and specifying them at the level of industry sectors (manufacturing and FIRE). By doing so, organizations can increase the transparency and control of processes which correspond to a given event type and can be compared at the industry level. This leads to our second proposition.

                           Proposition 2
                           
                              Operational disruptions (event types) display different statistical properties across industry sectors (manufacturing and FIRE).
                           

As established in the finance literature, capital adequacy enables managing risk of operational disruptions. We posit that certain event types can be managed through a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy strategies. In other words, under appropriate conditions a mixed (integrated) strategy, the combination of process improvement and capital adequacy, dominates each of the two separate alternatives. Grundke (2010) discusses ways to estimate capital and investigates the assumptions of copulas during crises (Grundke & Polle, 2012). Extreme value theory (EVT), by definition, highlights extreme events that have not been experienced or if experienced have occurred with low frequency. This notion is based on probabilistic theory assuming the process of operational disruption events is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and the modeling can be conducted by employing the probability and severity of losses due to operational disruptions (Cornalba & Giudici, 2004; Embrechts, Furrer, & Kaufmann, 2003; Klugman, Panjer, & Willmot, 2012). A bottom-up framework for estimating bank’s total capital is proposed by Bellini (2013).

An alternative approach to hedge against operational disruptions in supply chains can be achieved through real option-based contracting as in Xia, Ramachandran, and Gurnani (2011). To reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions, Talluri, Narasimhan, and Chung (2010) propose that manufacturers should cooperate more closely with suppliers. Craighead, Blackhurst, Rungtusanatham, and Handfield (2007) investigate the antecedents to such disruptions while Tomlin and Wang (2011) present different strategies to combat operational disruptions including diversifying the supply base, managing demand and strengthening the supply chain. Hora and Klassen (2013) find that risk and operations managers can also improve their processes and mitigate the impact of operational disruptions in their own firms by observing disruptions of other firms. Fragnière, Gondzio, and Yang (2010) propose to use stochastic programming models to allocate human expertise to hedge operational risk. In examining continuous improvement, Choi and Liker (1995) differentiate a firm’s orientation toward process and outcome. They suggest that continuous improvement with an orientation toward process rather than outcome will have a persistent and more effective impact on performance (as measured by productivity, quality, and inventory). Another approach to risk mitigation, which is increasingly important due to the regulatory pressures to improve bank’s capital adequacy can be achieved through insurance (Bazzarello, Crielaard, Piacenza, & Soprano, 2006; BCBS, 2010).

Therefore, in this proposition, combining the aspects of capital adequacy and process improvement from both the above-mentioned research streams, we extend the earlier two propositions highlighting that the breadth of events categorized under operational disruptions in different industry sectors should not be managed in a similar manner. Instead, some of these event types may lend themselves to process improvement and contingency planning as a critical first step. Stecke and Kumar (2009) suggest strategies such as proactive mechanisms, early warning signals and building redundancies in processes. Proposition 3 follows.

                           Proposition 3
                           
                              Certain event types can be managed through a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy strategies.
                           

Algorithmics, Inc., a risk consulting company, captures operational disruptions in its database OpVar. The data have been collected from public sources worldwide (news bulletins, court filings, SEC filings) since 1978. The company manually verifies that these failures are operational and whether the other reported information is accurate. As of 2006, OpVar contained more than 10 000 publicly reported operational disruptions. Moreover, OpVar consists only of those operational disruptions where losses exceed $1 million. The database reports the firm name, type of disruption, description of disruption, the year in which the disruption occurred, and the loss amount of the disruption. The operational disruptions in the database span multiple industries and countries. Researchers validated the credibility of this database by comparing competing databases of operational disruptions and found no significant difference in the data and the classification scheme of the events (De Fontnouvelle, De Jesus-Rueff, Jordan, & Rosengren, 2006).

Firms as per the standard industrial classification (SIC) codes are categorized into 11 sectors. These sectors depict the broad industry level. We selected two sectors – finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), and manufacturing – for the following reasons. First, these sectors are well represented in the dataset of operational disruptions. Both sectors contain a sufficient number of firms and operational disruptions in every industry to conduct a meaningful longitudinal analysis. The excluded sectors have fewer firms and a correspondingly lower number of operational disruptions. Second, by examining the manufacturing and FIRE sectors, generalizability of the results can be expected.

The research distinguishes the manufacturing from the FIRE sectors on five characteristics: intangibility, heterogeneity, simultaneity, perishability, and customer participation (Fitzsimmons & Fitzsimmons, 2011; Roth & Menor, 2003; Sampson & Froehle, 2006). Though these characteristics are neither unique to any of the sectors nor are “defining characteristics”, due to these characteristics, the sectors may respond differently to operational disruptions. For example, an error in a financial transaction may be difficult to rectify if the transaction has already expired. Because of this perishability attribute, a new transaction may be required. Conversely, in manufacturing, the response to a product defect may be different.

From the OpVar database, we created a dataset in several steps. In step one we filtered for operational disruptions for firms registered in the United States. Limiting the data analysis to a specific country avoids contamination of data by country-level differences. In step two we limited the dataset. The OpVar database has historical events from 1978 through the present, covering a number of industries. However, 75 percent of the failure events in the database fall between 1994 and 2006. Rigorous recording procedure can be ascertained only since 1994, when the provider acquired the database. Because of ambiguity in rigor and relatively few data points available before this date (due to poor data recording practices or other reasons), we limited the dataset to operational disruptions from 1994 to 2006. Additionally, we selected only those losses that exceeded $1 million expressed in real terms using the 2002 level of the Consumer Price Index. In step three, we aggregated the dataset created in step two to have annual operational losses at an industry level in both the manufacturing and the FIRE sectors. Ultimately, we obtained 5442 distinctive observations that we used for the analysis.

Seven types of disruptions in OpVar are of interest. Currently, there is no conceptual classification for the different types of operational disruptions. In such scenarios, researchers may use regulatory or data-driven classifications schemes. Regulation-based classifications are common in studying risk of failures and hazards. Similarly, we use the classification scheme prescribed by regulation (as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission). This regulatory-based classification is of interest because it creates consistency in reporting and analysis of operational disruptions. The disruptions are classified in Appendix A.

The notion “Loss Distribution Approach” (LDA) was formulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, 2006). Under Basel II this is the most advanced approach for financial institutions for computing the capital charge for bank-specific risks, e.g., operational risk. Under this regime, banks estimate for each business line or risk type the probability distribution of the impact of a loss event and the frequency using their internal data.

With these two distributions the aggregate loss distribution of the specific operational risk type or business line can be calculated. The respective Value at Risk (VaR) gives the regulatory capital charge. Although this bottom-up approach is very popular and established in actuarial sciences, it is relatively new in the area of operations management. Manufacturing firms are not obliged to hold capital for the risk exposure but also for supply chain risk management purposes this approach seems to be promising. As such, we build on recent re- commendations to borrow methods from other fields such as finance or insurance in order to better address contemporary challenges in operations and supply chain management (Sanders & Wagner, 2011).

To begin with, we present the theoretical concepts and notation for the mathematical formulation. Later, in the empirical section, we describe the data and the methodology for the parameter calibration. Note that the canonical way for estimating the aggregate loss distribution of a firm is the use of internal, therefore firm-specific data since many of the operational risk events are endogeneous, i.e., they depend on the organizational structure, business continuity management and the like. A common problem is the shortage and the inferior quality of this data. Therefore, firms also use external data providers to complement a conclusive statistical analysis. Another important issue in data analysis is the scaling of operational losses and size of the firm. We concur with this stream of literature (Chernobai, Jorion, & Yu, 2011; Cope & Labbi, 2008; Shih, Samad-Khan, & Medapa, 2000) that there is no clear pattern in the data, which would support the hypothesis that firm size has a direct moderating effect on the frequency or severity of losses.

A first step is to identify potentially disruptive hazard events for each firm in the sample. The finite set 
                        
                           E

The other element of computing the loss distribution is the severity or the loss amount of the specific hazard event ei
                     . We assume that these losses are given by the family of i.i.d. random variables

                     . Here we also have to check which theoretical distribution best fits our empirical data. Often, the severity of a hazard event is modeled as a lognormal or a combined lognormal and generalized Pareto distribution. The accumulated losses of hazard event ei

@&#RESULTS@&#

The results are presented as follows. In Subsection 5.1, we provide basic descriptive statistics to acquire initial insights about the differences between operational disruptions across different event types and in both industry sectors. Then, in Subsections 5.2 and 5.3 we apply the LDA to estimate parameters of the underlying loss distributions. This approach will help us identify the main distributional characteristics of the event types in both sectors. In Subsection 5.4 we present the results of the Monte Carlo simulations, based on the parameter estimates from Subsections 5.2 and 5.3.

The results obtained through simulation will aid in interpreting, which types of events should be covered by process improvement and for which event types companies should hold a capital charge. Finally, in Subsection 5.5, we introduce a method for optimal capital allocation that can be used by organizations in their decision making process on how much capital to allocate to each event type of operational disruptions.

Our empirical analysis begins with the descriptive statistics as shown in Tables 2
                         and 3
                        . In line with proposition P1, event types display different statistical properties. Moreover, as suggested in proposition P2, we observe differences between the two sectors with respect to the event frequency. In manufacturing, Business Disruptions and System Failures is the rarest event type (rated second in the FIRE sector); Damage to Physical Assets is the event type with the lowest frequency in the FIRE sector (third most frequent in the manufacturing sector). This can be attributed to financial firms’ lower reliance on physical assets compared to manufacturing firms. Interestingly, in the FIRE sector this category generates the highest mean losses.

On the other side of the spectrum, Internal and External Fraud are the event types with the second highest frequency of occurrence in the FIRE sector. In the manufacturing sector they are less frequent. Several possibilities of fraud exist in the FIRE sector including a disproportionately high rate of cybercrime and a high human interaction in various lines of business. The relative importance of the event type External Fraud in the manufacturing sector is much lower than in the FIRE sector (1.1–14.1 percent). In terms of severity, Internal Fraud generates relatively higher mean losses in the manufacturing sector than the FIRE sector. Clients, Products and Business Practices is the event type with the highest frequency of occurrence in both sectors. The mean value of losses in the manufacturing sector ($104.10 million) is almost double the value in the FIRE sector ($66.34 million), even though the highest loss in our sample comes from the External Fraud in the FIRE sector ($17401.79 million). The majority of operational disruptions falls into the event type Clients, Products and Business Practices in both sectors. We expect the best goodness of fit for this category of operational disruptions. From these descriptive statistics we can see substantial differences among distinctive event types, but also between the two sectors.

The yearly occurrence of disruptions is presented in Tables 4
                         and 5
                        . The high value of standard deviation and the empirical distributions of frequency and severity reveal evidence of non-stationarity and extreme values, as often documented in the literature (Abbate, Gourier, & Farkas, 2008). The frequency of disruptions in both sectors does not show any significant trends and fluctuates over time. The distributions of severity exhibit evidence of fat tails.

The high value of variance compared to the mean across all event types indicates that our data sample exhibits overdispersion. Calibrating Poisson distribution to overdispersed data is not appropriate since it cannot accommodate the excess variation. Therefore, we fit both Poisson and negative binomial distributions as they are commonly applied in the operational risk literature and give a reasonable fit (for the discussion of assumptions and scaling properties, see Dahen and Dionne, 2010). The Poisson probability mass function is given by:

                         . We fit the intercept-only Poisson model and give a point estimate and 95 percent confidence interval for the Poisson parameter λ. The parameter estimates are described in Tables 6
                         and 7
                        . Nevertheless, due to lack of data points we were unable to fit the λ parameter for the event type Business Disruption and System Failures. We therefore exclude it from the rest of the analysis.

Supporting proposition P2, we see differences across industry sectors. In the manufacturing sector, the highest estimated intensity of failures can be observed in event type Clients, Products and Business Practices with λ = 101.31. Execution, Delivery and Process Management follows with λ = 22.85. External Fraud in the manufacturing sector as well as Damage to Physical Assets in the FIRE sector have the lowest estimated intensities.

As an alternative approach, we assumed the frequency is distributed according to the negative binomial distribution, where the negative binomial mass function is given by:

                        . We fit the intercept-only negative binomial model and estimate the parameters, p and k, and the mean and dispersion of the negative binomial distribution.

In Tables 8
                         and 9
                         we report the coefficients of the negative binomial distribution. As mentioned, in all cases our data exhibits positive dispersion, which means that the sample is overdispersed. Negative binomial distribution is therefore an alternative choice to model the occurrence of operational disruptions. The values of goodness of fit criteria show the advantage of using negative binomial over Poisson fit (Appendix B).

The time-series of the cumulative severity of different event types of operational disruptions are characterized by high non-stationarity and several extremely high values (as summarized in Tables 4 and 5). As suggested in proposition P2 the event types display markedly different behavior between industry sectors. In the manufacturing sector most of them belong to the event type Clients, Products and Business Practices. In the FIRE sector they are spread among several event types, thus indicating differences in classification of operational disruptions between the two sectors. Internal Fraud and External Fraud remain stable over time in the manufacturing sector, whereas in the FIRE sector they fluctuate greatly. The first step is to show the evidence of the skewness of data. For that purpose we use the Q–Q plots (Figs. 2
                         and 3
                        ). The parameters of the reference line are estimated from the data, where we assumed a lognormal distribution.

We observe very heavy tails in the severity distributions as seen from the Q–Q plots. Even the lognormal distribution is decaying too fast to correctly capture the losses with biggest impact. The method which we utilized for the estimation of parameters of the underlying distribution is called Extreme Value Theory (Embrechts, Klüppelberg, & Mikosch, 1997; Gençay, Selçuk, & Ulugülyagci, 2001). It suggests that losses exceeding a high threshold (tail of the distribution) can be approximated by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). The Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem states that for large threshold value u the limiting distribution of x as u tends to infinity is given by the following probability density function:

                        where x ≥ 0, β > 0. Parameter ξ is called the shape parameter or tail index, taking positive, negative or zero values, whereas β is the scaling parameter. The tail index ξ gives an indication of the heaviness of the tail of the distribution, the larger ξ, the heavier the tail. The analytical expressions for VaR and Expected Shortfall (ES) can be found in Gilli and Küllezi (2006). Based on the analysis of the sample mean-excess plots, we set the threshold value u = $100 million. Another approach commonly used is to set the threshold at the 90th percentile of the empirical distribution, which we conducted as an additional test for robustness. We then model the excess data with a GPD and estimate parameters using maximum likelihood method.

                         and 5
                        . Surprisingly, we see that the manufacturing sector is characterized by heavier tails than the FIRE sector. It implies that the risk of extreme losses from operational disruptions for firms in the manufacturing sector is relatively higher than for firms in the financial sector. The parameter estimates and the 95 percent confidence intervals are summarized in Table 10
                        . Especially the estimated value of the upper bound of the confidence interval is extremely high for firms in the manufacturing industries. The occurrence of disruptions, although with very low probability, has the potential to induce extremely high losses.

Next, we concentrate on smaller losses. We fit the body of the distribution (below the threshold) to the lognormal distribution, described by the following probability density function:

                        for x > 0, where μ is the expected value, and σ is the standard devi- ation of the logarithm of x. We present all estimated parameter values in Tables 11
                         and 12
                        . We will use them as an input to the Monte Carlo simulations of the compound loss distributions.

We conduct a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with n = 40 000 iterations. Analog to Subsections 5.2 and 5.3, we identify for both sectors six event types 
                           
                              E
                              =
                              {
                              
                                 e
                                 1
                              
                              ,
                              ⋯
                              ,
                              
                                 e
                                 6
                              
                              }
                           
                        . As described in Section 4, we simulate in each iteration for each event type the number 
                           
                              N
                              t
                              
                                 e
                                 i
                              
                           
                         of operational risk events and the respective severity 
                           
                              ξ
                              k
                              
                                 e
                                 i
                              
                           
                        . Eq. (4) gives the accumulated loss up to time t. We use parameter values from Tables 11 and 12. The parameters correspond to a one-year time horizon.

For each event type we generate losses from a mixture of lognormal and GPD. For the body of the severity distribution, i.e., interval [0, u], we use lognormal distributed losses, whereas the tail is fitted by GPD (see Subsection 5.3). If the GPD fit was not available, we used lognormal distribution for both body and tail. As a test of robustness, we use two methods for threshold estimation. In the first case, the threshold value is set to u = $100 million, in the other case the value corresponds to the 90 percent quantile of the severity distribution. In the former case we determine the percentage proportion π of losses which exceed the threshold u (Table 13
                        ). The lognormal-GPD-distributed random variable is then GPD-distributed with probability π, and lognormal otherwise. The results obtained in the latter case are presented in Appendix C. As we see in Table 13, the proportion of losses exceeding u is almost equal in the two sectors. Major differences can be seen in Employment Practices and Workplace Safety, where π = 6.78 percent in the FIRE sector is twice as high as in the manufacturing and Execution, Delivery and Process Management, where π in the manufacturing sector is three times as high as in FIRE. In the event type Damage to Physical Assets in the FIRE sector six events lied below and six lied above the threshold.

We obtain a distribution of yearly losses for each event type and the whole sector. Next, we determine the Value at Risk of the whole sector VaR
                           α
                         for an increasing sequence of confidence intervals. Then, we accumulate the losses of each event type up to this VaR
                           α
                         and express the amounts relative to each other in percentage terms. This loss contribution

The loss contribution (LC) of different event types of operational disruptions to the total VaR for a given sector is plotted in Figs. 6
                         and 7
                         (Poisson frequency distribution) and in Figs. 8
                         and 9
                         (negative binomial frequency distribution) for the case where u is set to $100 million. We focus on the latter figures since the same event types are depicted. We observe that

                         the LC of the first event type Clients, Products and Business Practices displays a markedly different behavior, is monotone increasing in α up to 70 percent (50 percent) for the manufacturing (FIRE) sector. Starting with an α around 8 percent (13 percent), this category dominates all other groups in the manufacturing (FIRE) sector. In the manufacturing sector all other event types contribute less than 20 percent when the confidence interval is higher than 80 percent. In contrast, Internal Fraud seems to be an important risk source in the FIRE sector. The LC is relatively stable at around 30 percent. Employment Practices and Workplace Safety exhibits an interesting behavior in the manufacturing sector. Its LC is stable in all confidence levels, when using negative binomial frequency distribution. In the Poisson case, however, it fluctuates at the highest confidence levels.

In the manufacturing sector, we see in Fig. 6 that the LCs up to α = 10–15 percent of the event types Execution, Delivery and Process Management, Internal Fraud and Damage to Physical Assets are very pronounced and decreasing. The event type Internal Fraud, however, suddenly gains importance in the high quantile levels, thus indicating a more severe impact on the tails of the loss distribution. A similar behavior can be observed in the event type External Fraud in the FIRE sector.

As depicted in our introductory example and in line with proposition P3, operational risk in different event types can be managed through capital adequacy and process improvement. Additionally costs should be considered while deliberating either of these strategies to manage operational risk. As we infer from our simulations in Section 5.4 the event types can be prioritized, based on their LC to accurately estimate the initial capital charge.

We extend the reasoning of Ebnöther et al. (2003) and observe that a monotonically decreasing (increasing) LC function indicates a decreasing (increasing) impact of the respective category on the total VaR. By integrating the area under the corresponding LC function up to a given α it is possible to quantify and compare the absolute LCs to the total VaR. By doing so, risk managers can prioritize and more optimally assign resources to different event types.

Our findings suggest that a monotonically decreasing LC function in the whole confidence level spectrum is an indicator of the risk category where in the first step process improvement is the appropriate managerial action. A monotonically increasing LC function, which dominates the LC functions of the other event types is an indicator for a risk category against which companies should hold the capital charge. At higher confidence levels the unexpected losses dominate and therefore the event types with higher LC at this confidence level lend themselves to holding a capital charge. Thus, as proposition P3 suggests, a monotonically decreasing LC function indicates the risk category where process improvement is desirable. Additionally, if the LC function of a selected event type crosses the LC functions of other event types at the lower confidence levels, the mix of the two strategies is appropriate to manage this event type. If the crossing occurs at higher confidence level, the capital adequacy strategy is more appropriate. In practice, however, the chosen level of α is set at the highest confidence level (95–99.97 percent). Therefore, we focus on the behavior of the LC functions in the entire confidence level spectrum.

We summarized the appropriate strategies for each event type in Table 14
                        .

The LC function of the event type, Clients, Products and Business Practices crosses the LC functions of other event types at relatively low confidence levels, but is monotonically increasing and clearly dominates the LC functions of all other event types at the higher confidence levels when using both Poisson and negative binomial frequency distributions in both industry sectors. Therefore, for this event type we suggest the capital adequacy strategy. The LC functions of Execution, Delivery and Process Management and Damage to Physical Assets are decreasing in the whole confidence spectrum, therefore we suggest using process improvement for these event types in both industry sectors. For the three remaining event types, the conclusions are not straightforward. The respective LC functions are crossing the LC functions of other event types at low confidence levels, are slowly decreasing and suddenly increasing at the highest confidence levels. Therefore, for these event types we suggest a mixed strategy approach contingent on the industry sector.

In general, process improvement can reduce the frequency and/or severity of operational disruptions. Our results empirically indicate that for event type, Execution, Delivery and Process Management firms should invest in process improvement. For example, the firm can incur a one-time implementation cost

                        . For certain event types process improvement can to a large extent mitigate the extreme losses in the tail of the distribution. For instance, introduction of a back-up server for a critical internal process eliminates the system’s breakdown and ensures business continuity. In cases where the condition 11 is not fulfilled, we postulate that the firm should cover all materializing losses with the initial capital charge. The costs in Eq. (11) should be estimated by the project managers and updated in each period t.

So far we discussed the distributional properties of different event types of operational risk and industries, in particular the tails of the distributions and the LCs. We also proposed to reduce the capital required to cover losses of certain event types by process improvement.

We now discuss the allocation of capital to the different event types (see the extensive summary by Dhaene, Tsanakas, Valdez, and Vanduffel, 2012). We assume that loss absorbing capital K in the firm is given endogenously. This capital should be allocated such that for each loss category the allocated capital and loss are sufficiently close to each other. In contrast to the capital requirements of financial institutions where the tails of the loss distributions have to be covered completely with capital, the decision problem can be formulated in a more general way. With the notation, introduced in Eqs. (4) and (5), the total loss up to time t of the firm is given by:

                         (for the details of the formulation of this objective function, please refer to Dhaene et al., 2012). The capital is allocated to the different event types such that the exposure weighted sum of expected deviations of the losses from their respective allocated capitals is minimized.

Operational disruptions, if not appropriately managed, can have negative performance consequences for the firm (Hendricks & Singhal, 2005; Wagner & Bode, 2008). Given the low frequency of occurrence of these operational disruptions at a firm level, identifying recurring patterns can be challenging for firms which in turn makes it difficult to measure, mitigate and manage risk of such disruptions.

In this article, we draw on literature from operations management and finance that suggests different mechanisms of managing operational risks: process improvement or holding a capital charge. In particular, we posit the importance of categorizing operational disruptions and show that a combination of both these mechanisms is warranted to manage such risk. Specifically, using the categories defined by regulation on large real-time dataset of operational disruptions spanning 13 years and 5442 observations in proposition P1, we present that different types of operational disruptions (event types) display different statistical properties. Using seven types of operational disruptions we elaborate on empirical loss distributions by examining different categories of operational disruptions. We employ the classification event type of operational disruptions as prescribed by the BCBS. In proposition P2, we expand on the event types of operational disruptions and posit that event types will display different statistical properties across different industry sectors. Taken together, propositions P1 and P2, suggest that management of disruptions needs to be viewed by their (a) categorization and (b) the sector affiliation of the firm. In line with both these propositions, we provide empirical evidence that disruptions in the services and manufacturing sector should not be generalized. Based on the analysis of the tails of the distributions, we provide evidence that broadly operational disruptions in the manufacturing sector may trigger higher losses than in the services sector. In other words, while the models used in two distinct industries such as financial services and chemical processing may be similar, the way of managing operational disruptions even in the same event type may be different.

In proposition P3, we focus on management of operational disruptions and conjecture that certain event types can be managed by deploying a combination of process improvement and capital adequacy strategies. In line with proposition P3, management of operational disruptions can occur through process improvement if firms collectively view operational disruptions at an industry level rather than at a firm level. Currently, approaches such as LDA utilize data at an industry level, but only to determine capital adequacy requirements. We show that the potential of process improvement also exists in certain event types. Even though these findings at an industry level understandably cannot suggest the causes that trigger operational disruptions in these categories, but nonetheless can be used as a qualitative guidance to improve processes to mitigate the impact of such disruptions.

Viewing the results of the propositions together, the findings (as summarized in Table 14) suggest that risk managers in firms should not homogeneously view operational losses of different event types. As posited by regulation and research, the results confirm that for all event types firms should analyze losses at an industry level. However, contingent on the event type, the management of operational risk should employ different strategies (proposition P3). For example, our analyses suggest that the event type, Execution, Delivery and Process Management lends itself to process improvement in both industries. Moreover, as this event type captures losses arising from disruption in operations due to failed process design or process management, we propose that process improvement at a firm should be the first line of defense. In the second step, it approximates the capital adequacy required to manage such future losses. Firms can discuss best practices at meetings organized by industry associations to trace the cause–effect of operational losses that fall under Execution, Delivery and Process Management and have occurred in a particular firm in their industry. In contrast, our findings for the event type, Clients, Products and Business Practices suggest that process improvement may play a minimal role and firms should emphasize on a capital charge in this category.

Our study is not without limitations. First, our categorization of event types – although accepted for examining operational risk in financial services – is not developed in the literature but through regulation and is actively followed in practice. Moreover, this categorization in the current format is not consistently utilized in the manufacturing industry. For example, the chemical industry with a focus on process safety does not exactly follow these categorizations but at a firm level creates its own categorizations of operational disruptions. Thus, while we recognize this limitation, we believe that this categorization aids capital charge or process improvement at an industry level.

Second, the event types are broad and can be made granular. However, since as Tables 2 and 3 depict the sample size for operational disruptions in certain event types are low to begin with, any further sub-categorization will make it challenging to run meaningful analyses.

Third, we are aware of the shortcomings of our modeling approach, and especially that the i.i.d. assumption may not hold for the yearly counts of operational events. However, we performed the robustness tests to confirm that different model specifications do not affect the generalizability of our results. Nonetheless, we recognize this limitation.

Fourth, related to the previous limitation, dealing with scarcity of data is another major challenge of using LDA. For example, for event type Business Disruption and System Failures there are not sufficient observations to perform an analysis. At the outset, mean frequency and severity of these losses is relatively small compared to other event types, and hence we conjecture this event type may lend itself for process improvement at an industry level. However, we suggest future research to delve further into Business Disruption and System Failures either by collecting more data or including the small sample of events into another category.

Finally, we caution that the interpretation of our results is limited to which event types (in what sectors) can employ process improvement. This investigation is a critical step in taking the research further. We suggest future work to extend and analytically or empirically gauge what proportion of resources firms should allocate to process improvement and how much capital charge should be maintained for managing operational disruptions. In other words, process improvement is a way of reducing operational risk that should be used as long as it is cost-effective, and capital reserves can be used to manage the residual risk. Further development of the optimization problem (14) which includes costs is another interesting research path for future investigations. This focus will be an important topic for managers and researchers alike.
