                  With the growing understanding of complex diseases, the focus of drug discovery has shifted from the well-accepted “one target, one drug” model, to a new “multi-target, multi-drug” model, aimed at systemically modulating multiple targets. In this context, polypharmacology has emerged as a new paradigm to overcome the recent decline in productivity of pharmaceutical research. However, finding methods to evaluate multicomponent therapeutics and ranking synergistic agent combinations is still a demanding task.
                  At the same time, the data gathered on complex diseases has been progressively collected in public data and knowledge repositories, such as protein–protein interaction (PPI) databases. The PPI networks are increasingly used as universal platforms for data integration and analysis. A novel computational network-based approach for feasible and efficient identification of multicomponent synergistic agents is proposed in this paper. Given a complex disease, the method exploits the topological features of the related PPI network to identify possible combinations of hit targets. The best ranked combinations are subsequently computed on the basis of a synergistic score. We illustrate the potential of the method through a study on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The results highlight its ability to retrieve novel target candidates, which role is also confirmed by the analysis of the related literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past decade, there has been a significant decrease in the rate of translation of new drug candidates into effective clinical therapeutic agents. Many reasons have been argued for such decline of productivity in pharmaceutical research. The assumption of the current approach is that safer, more effective drugs will result from designing very selective ligands for a good target. Ideally, a good target would regulate the pathway of interest: thus, blocking the target would result in effective medical treatment. The rationale for this strategy is that the specificity to the selected target leads to reduced side effects that may be caused by undesirable, non-therapeutic off-target binding. Recently it has been appreciated that many effective drugs (in therapeutic areas as diverse as oncology, psychiatry and antiinfectives) act on multiple rather than single targets, a phenomenon known as polypharmacology [1].

Searching for multi-target drugs is a novel and emerging drug discovery paradigm based on the idea that improved therapeutic efficacy and safety can be achieved by designing new individual chemical entities that can simultaneously target different molecular aspect of a given disease [2]. A multi-target approach to discover innovative medicines is necessary given the multifaceted nature of several complex diseases. In fact, the multidimensional view of diseases is replacing the linear causality model based on the “one disease, one gene, one target” and the “one single-target drug” paradigms. A first step toward this change is the multi-target strategy, where different targets at different key points within the same or concurrent pathogenic pathways are carefully chosen for their potential additive or synergistic effects.

However, the rational design of multi-target drugs faces considerable challenges. These mainly arise from the need for new methods to validate target combinations and to identify preliminary hit compounds.

One of the fundamental advantages of multicomponent therapeutics is the production of “synergy”, that is, the combinational effect must be greater than the sum of the individual effects. Although some experimental methods have been proposed to screen favourable drug combinations by disease-relevant phenotypic assays, the high-throughput identification of synergistic agent combinations arising from numerous agents remains an unresolved issue. In this context, computational approaches that take advantage of the rapid accumulation of massive data may provide a more promising and desirable strategy for multicomponent drug studies.

Based on the theory that complex disease arise from a change of the equilibrium of a system, we need multi-targeted drugs capable of modulating the balance of the system in an attempt to minimise this change.

In order to develop drugs that meet those standards it is essential to design the system (i.e. network) best describing the complex “omics” interactions (i.e. nodes) of the underlying disease. In particular, a network-based representation and analysis seems the elective strategy to deal with multicomponent therapeutics in complex diseases, as it “naturally” offers new therapeutic views and recommendations for drug repositioning [3,4]. This approach is very powerful when networks are coupled with data collected with -omics technologies (proteomics and genomics) for uncovering dynamic correlations within targets and drug actions. Moreover, it can provide efficient tools to better define the global picture of disease status and dynamic interactions of pathological targets at the molecular network level; likewise, all of these informations can be used for drug design based on network targeting [4].

A number of recent studies have been performed to analyse multi-target drug discovery with a network-based approach [4,5]. In particular, many works revealed that protein and ligand promiscuity is a phenomenon much more common then previously hypothesised. Yildirim et al. applied network analysis to drugs and their targets by integrating publicly available drug data [6]. The resulting network of polypharmacological interactions was dense in nature and revealed not only that a single target can often bind multiple drugs, but also that it is far more common than expected that single drugs modulate several different molecular targets, which may be involved in multiple diseases.

Li et al. have proposed an integrated network model, which is aimed to transfer correlations between drugs to the interactions among their molecular target [7]. The authors computed a score based on two elements, a Topology Score (TS) and an Agent Score (AS), which were used for assessing agents interactions with the biological targets. The TS is derived from the topological features of the background network related to certain disease condition, while the AS is used to quantify the effect of two agents on disease phenotype, as derived by applying text mining on the OMIM disease descriptions. The score was calculated multiplying TS and AS. The higher the score, the greater the probability of synergy of the drug combination.

Li et al. used a biological network-based multi-target computational estimation scheme to screen anticoagulant activity of a series of argatroban intermediates and eight natural products based on affinity predictions from their multi-target docking scores and on a network efficiency analysis [8]. This scheme has been derived from the traditional single agent virtual screening method, which relies on evaluating binding affinity targets. Li et al. built a network by using the Reactome repository and designed a method for selecting targets that can be applied only to the proteins whose virtual screening is known.

We hereby propose a novel computational approach for a efficient identification of multicomponent synergies that relies on a network-based representation of the complex disease.

Our work differs from the papers described above. In particular, instead of performing a drug–drug and a drug–target network as described in [6], our approach focuses on disease-specific protein networks to find new target candidates.

The network is created by integrating different data sources to represent the disease efficiently. In this way, the prediction of the targets also includes the proteins for which a virtual screening is unknown or infeasible, differently from [8]. Although a number of computational approaches have been developed to integrate data from multiple sources to propose new drug candidates, relatively few of them focus on identifying and ranking potential targets, as our investigation suggests. Our work was inspired by the paper of Zhang et al. [9], which ranked potential targets for a specific drug, thus limiting the target discovery to a drug, instead of focusing on a specific disease. The authors also built a network whose nodes were genes. In our case, we build a protein–protein interaction network in order to increase the number of possible associations retrieved, i.e. the physical interaction between proteins and their binding type.

A detailed description of the proposed approach and the results obtained for the selected disease is reported in the following of the paper. Given the social impact, the scientific interest and the high number of available data sets, we chose to test our methods on type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), a noteworthy example of multi-factorial and complex disease [10].

@&#MATERIAL AND METHODS@&#

As mentioned in the previous section, we developed a network-based method that aims at extracting the core disease causative pathways and then at proposing possible combinations of targets suitable for a multicomponent therapy.

The main steps of the methods are described in the following sections.

The first step involved the creation of a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network for the disease under study, by integrating different databases and high-throughput datasets. In the resulting biological network, the nodes are proteins and the edges represent various biological associations among them.

The PPI network was built by first retrieving the proteins involved in the Reactome disease pathways [11] and then, on the basis of the proteins retrieved so far, by retrieving the human PPI data in the STRING repository [12]. We selected only the relationships derived from experimental data and with a confidence score
                        >0.7, corresponding to high confidence for the association predicted by STRING [13]; this allowed us building a network with weights on the edges: the weights are equal to the confidence of the association.

Starting from the PPI network, the next step was to find out which proteins are differentially expressed in the disease state. Considering that such proteins correspond to the nodes of the network, we called them disease proteins (DP). To identify the DP, we used human microarray data downloaded from Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) [14] and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [15]. This selection was computed on the basis of the fold change (FC) obtained from case-versus-control comparisons with a cutoff of 2. Then, we matched these genes with the genes that encode the network’s proteins in order to identify the over- or under-expressed nodes. This step clearly has limits, as it does not take into account post-translational proteins modification and regulation.

Once DPs had been identified, the next step consisted in network targeting. Instead of selecting all the network nodes as possible targets, we decided to introduce some constraints that allowed restricting the nodes space. We called these proteins Source
                           
                              T
                            
                           S
                           
                              T
                           , because they are the sources of a potential synergistic pharmacological effect.

First, we decided to discard hub nodes, i.e. highly connected nodes. Besides the special topological and functional significance in a network, hubs have also special biological properties: they tend to be more essential than non-hub proteins, since they are found to play a central role in modular organisation of the protein interaction network and they are used in traditional pharmacology as standard targets [16]. Given their high number of neighbours, acting on hubs might provoke a large number of side effects. To identify the hubs we used a method proposed by Vallabhajosyula et al. [16]. The method grounds on the different topological properties of hub and non-hub nodes: hubs form subgraphs which are loosely connected to each other, while non-hub nodes may play the role of connecting hubs subgraphs [16]. Vallabhajosyula et al. identify hubs by first constructing a node list ranked by their decreasing degree. Then, following an iterative process, the first nodes in the ranked list are extracted and the relative connectivity of their subgraphs
                              1
                              Computed as the ratio between the size of the maximum connected component and the number of nodes of the subgraphs.
                           
                           
                              1
                            is calculated. It is expected that the relative connectivity will initially decrease by adding nodes from the ordered list, since the hub nodes, which are highly ranked, are not connected to each other. The process is repeated until the relative connectivity increases; this, in fact, is assumed to mark the transition between hub and non-hub nodes [16].

The second constraint involves bridging centrality, a centrality measure proposed by Hwang et al. [17]. Unlike common centrality measures, bridging centrality can discriminate bridging nodes, i.e. the nodes that are crucial to dispatch information to the network topological structures: such nodes are typically located between highly connected regions. The bridging centrality BR(i) of a node is the product of the betweenness centrality (B) and the bridging coefficient (BC), which measures the global and local features of a node, respectively [17]. The bridging centrality of a node i is defined by the equation:

                                    )

                                    )

                                    (

                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        


                           B is a measure of the centrality of a node in a network, and is usually calculated as the fraction of shortest paths between node pairs that pass through the node of interest.

                                 where n is the total number of vertices in the network. B is thus a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network [18].

                            By counting only the shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along the shortest paths. Differently from [17], we resorted to Random Walk Betweenness Centrality (RWBC), as proposed by [18]. The main idea is that, instead of taking into account shortest paths only, it considers all possible paths between two nodes. In particular, given R the matrix which (s,
                           t) th element R

                            contains the probability of a random walk from s to t, passing through the node i. Then, the Newman’s betweenness centrality RWBC(i) of node i is defined to be

The other term of the Eq. (1) is the bridging coefficient BC, a measure that assesses the local bridging characteristics in the neighbourhood and penalises nodes that have a high degree of connectivity. The bridging coefficient evaluates if a node is located between high degree nodes, and it is defined as:

We selected as bridging nodes those in the highest quartile of bridging centrality values. This threshold has been suggested by Hwang et al. and it has been also confirmed by empirical studies on several real world network systems [17].

The last constraint on the S
                           
                              T
                            nodes is related to their druggability, a term used in drug discovery to describe a biological target such as a protein that is known or is predicted to bind to a drug with high affinity. To classify a protein as druggable, we introduced two parameters.

First, the proteins had to be included in STITCH [19], a data repository that allows to explore known and predicted interactions of chemicals and proteins. Since we were interested only in the associations with drugs and not with all the chemical compounds, the target proteins selected were only the ones with a known interaction with a compound already classified in Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System. In analogy with what we did for the interactions retrieved from STRING, we selected only the associations with high confidence (here confidence score
                           >0.9).

Second, the localisation of the proteins was restricted to be in the extracellular space or in the cell membrane. In these areas, an efficient interaction or binding with a drug candidate is more probable.

Therefore, the proteins with a drug association stored in STRING and corresponding to the localisation constraints mentioned above were selected as druggable nodes.

The nodes in the network with the previously described features (i.e. non-hub, with high bridging centrality and druggable) were identified as possible targets (S
                           
                              T
                           ). It should be noted that a S
                           
                              T
                            could be a generic protein in the network as well as a disease protein (DP).

The following step concerned the selection of the S
                        
                           T
                         combinations that are more interesting for a polypharmacological approach. To this aim, we introduced a score called Topological Score of Drug Synergy (TSDS), a function that assigns a score to each combination of S
                        
                           T
                         on the basis of the target topological features. The TSDS was calculated in 3 steps.

                                 Synergistic effect. The TSDS score was calculated by combining the previous ones, in order to simulate simultaneous actions of multiple-agents which potentially could act on different targets. For computational and therapeutic compliance reasons, the multi-target approach has been restricted to triplets of targets. The proposed TSDS score is given by:

The final goal was the selection of the most significant TSDS, leading to the identification of the best target combinations for a polypharmacological approach. In order to validate the robustness of our constraints, a null distribution of TSDS values was built by computing the TSDS for 50,000 combinations of 3 proteins randomly selected from the complete set of nodes.

A measure of the significance of the results was assessed by evaluating the null distribution area to the right of each TSDS observed. The combinations were considered significant when they had a p-value<0.01.

The resulting targets were further analysed from a pharmacological and therapeutic point of view, with particular focus on the biological pathways involved and the modulation (inhibition or activation) required to restore the equilibrium. Finally, the availability of standard drugs showing the desired pharmacological profile was verified.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The network built for the T2DM case, following the method described in Section 2, was made of 587 nodes (proteins) and 3683 edges (PPI). The weights distribution of the network’s edges is shown in Fig. 1
                     (a).

The over- or under- expressed nodes in the network were identified from 19 and 6 data sets available in SMD and GEO, respectively, so that 87 disease proteins DP were selected (61 down-expressed and 26 up-expressed). The disease network is shown in Fig. 1(b). The nodes S
                     
                        T
                      extracted (see Section 2.1.2) were 47 in total. They were selected out of 14 hub proteins (discarded), 314 druggable nodes (209 of them annotated in STITCH) and 147 bridging proteins.

The TSDS

                      for each possible combination of 3 S
                     
                        T
                      was calculated using Eq. (7). The distribution of the resulting TSDS
                     
                        norm
                      values is shown in Fig. 2
                     (a). Then, the null distribution (Fig. 2(b)) was carried out to find the significant TSDS scores. The most significant S
                     
                        T
                      triplets with p-values <0.01 resulted in 88 combinations of 18 different proteins.
                        3
                        This result is also confirmed by deriving a null distribution of the TSDS from 1000 new networks, each resulting from the permutation of the interactions (edges) of the T2DM network. The number of significant triplets identified with this procedure increases to 737 and all the 88 triplets already found are present in this new list. Spearman’s rank correlation confirms that the two ranked lists of triplets are closely related (rho
                           =0.99).

These proteins were further analysed to identify their relationships with the T2DM disease, the biological pathways involved and the pharmacological modulation needed.

The resulting targets are shown in Table 1
                     . These include proteins with a growth factor function (IGF, TGF, NGF), platelet surface membrane glycoproteins (GP1BA), which play a crucial role in the aggregation of platelets, proteins involved in blood coagulation (FGB, KNG1) and adhesion proteins as the Viniculin (VLC). Also sodium channels SCNN1G and SCNN1B as well as amyloid precursor protein APP (a protein expressed in many tissues and concentrated in the synapses of neurons) have been identified among the targets.

Since STRING is a repository of known and predicted protein associations, it may contain false positive associations. Even if we have considered only the associations deriving from experimental and database evidences and the interactions with confidence scores >0.7 (high confidence), we have carried out an analysis to examine the validity of our observations and the network robustness.

The presence of false positives has been simulated by randomly adding a number of proteins corresponding to the 1%, 5% and the 10% of the nodes in the network. The TSDS was computed on the perturbed networks. In order to evaluate the robustness of the target triplets identified so far, we have repeated this procedure for ten times and we have assessed the number of targets triplets that were still considered as significant. The average results, shown in Table 2
                        , indicates that our observations are quite robust against variation of proteins interaction data.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper is about a computational platform that integrates pathways, protein–protein interactions, transcriptional analysis in order to build in a comprehensive network for multi-target multi-drug discovery.

Our method is divided into well defined steps in order to be applicable to other cases, as well as to be easily modified and adapted. For instance, we selected the targets that interact with compounds classified in ATC (see Section 2.1.2), but this choice can be changed, for example, for drug repurposing, by selecting only the proteins that have an association with the drug of interest.

The proteins shown in Table 1 represent the most interesting targets obtained by applying the method developed in the T2DM case. The most frequent proteins are the binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP3 and IGFBP5) and the ones that belong to the insulin-like growth factor family (IGF1R). Experimental data have shown that IGF1R is a negative regulator of insulin signalling and so, in this case, an inhibition is the desired action. The deletion of IGF1R also increases insulin sensitivity [21]. This regulator has also been proposed as a biological “link” between the T2DM and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Patients with T2DM have a two- to threefold increased risk for AD. The neuronal resistance for insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 might represent a molecular link between T2DM and AD, characterising AD as “brain-type diabetes” [22]. Currently, this type of therapeutic approach is not taken into account for T2DM therapy. However, the inhibition of the IGF/IGF1R system has been proposed in a phase II clinical trial in prostate cancer, but without success. Rather interestingly, it has been demonstrated that a form of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA or Masoprocol), an antioxidant extract of Larrea tridentata, decreases both plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations in fat-fed/STZ rats [23]. The nordihydroguaiaretic acid also inhibits the activities of the IGF1R.

The presence of the amyloid precursor protein APP in the list of proteins selected as the best targets is very interesting, too. APP is a diagnostic marker for AD, and a key step in the pathogenesis of AD is the accumulation of APP in the brain [24]. Recently, it has been shown that central IGF1R reduces Aβ accumulation as well as Aβ toxicity and promotes survival.

The sodium channels SCNN1G and SCNN1B were identified among the list of proteins selected as the best targets. These are nonvoltage-gated and amiloride-sensitive sodium channels that control the sodium passage and the osmotic diffusion of the water through the apical membrane of the epithelian cells. SCNN1G and SCNN1B also control the renal, intestinal and pulmonary reabsorption of sodium. As shown in Table 1, these proteins have to be inhibited: in fact, it has been recently demonstrated that the functionality of the pancreatic cells beta insulin-producing can be improved after an amiloride treatment [25]. Moreover amiloride is able to increase the insulin release and to develop hypoglycemia [26].

Among the other targets, none with the exception of the insulin receptor is a known target for T2DM therapy, but each of them has a strong relation with the T2DM resulting from indirect experimental observations.

The absence of standard targets used in T2DM therapy is due to the fact that we built and analysed the network identifying the genes, and consequently the proteins, whose differential expression is an effect of the disease. In this way, instead of considering only the reduced insulin production and supply, which represent only one of the factors, we took into account the whole disease context.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, we developed a network-based method for a feasible and efficient identification of multicomponent synergy that may be used to treat complex diseases. A disease network has been built by integrating different sources of data. The targeting of the network is based on its topological features. In particular, we introduced some constraint on the target proteins in order to better enable a polypharmcological approach and to decrease the space of the potential targets. Finally, we have computed a score (TSDS) that ranks the combinations of target protein candidates was defined.

This work has shown the applicability of a network-based approach to identify potential drug targets by utilising information extracted from public repositories; in particular, we have studied the Diabetes type 2 case. The findings obtained demonstrate that the method could elucidate interesting interactions and new potential drug targets.

The method developed can be easily modified, e.g. by performing combinations of more or less then three targets, by introducing new target features or relaxing the current constraints.

Our aims were to accelerate and optimise the target and drug discovery for a polypharmacological-based approach. As future steps, we will work on refining the protein–protein interaction analysis, in order to extract the functional relationships between them. Once the functional interaction will be derived, it will also be possible to represent the disease network as a directed graph. Such graph may better describe the interactions as well as how the information spreads out in the network. The application of information propagation algorithms may help to better quantify and verify “in silico” the therapeutic effects on the disease.
