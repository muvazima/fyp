                  Information fusion is a known technique in enlightening features, patterns, and multiple criteria decision making. However, the decomposed information of the fusion has always been unknown, making its applications limited. This research proposes a fuzzy integral combined with a fitness fusion (named as the fuzzy integral fusion, FIF) to induce features and consequently reveal the decomposed information empirically illustrating the dominance benchmark and the fusion effect for approximations. For illustration, the proposed fuzzy integral fusion is applied on World Competitiveness Yearbook 2010 to analyze the European crisis nations (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain) and the European welfare nations (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden). The results showed that the European crisis nations should improve their institution framework to effectively raise their business finance efficiency.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

National competitiveness represents a fusion power for a nation to enhance its people’s lives and cope with worldwide challenges [1–3]. The fusion techniques can provide an aggregated information to expound features [4,5], pattern [6,7], and multiple criteria decision making [8–11]. However, the fusion techniques still have difficulty in analyzing the diverse competitiveness. There are two potential problems in this issue. First, the fused competitiveness cannot be decomposed to provide thorough information, making the implications short of sufficient information. Second, fusion uncertainty always brings complexity [7,12], which can be observed especially on the three types of fusion results: positive, negative, and independent, resulting to mixed combinations [4,5]. A fusion result is positive when the fused result is more than the sum of the individuals. In contrast, a negative result means that the fused result is less than the sum of the individuals. An independent result stays in the middle of both, which causes more uncertainty in the combinations and makes the fusion techniques limited on their applications.

With the aforementioned problems, the key challenges for analyzing competitiveness are summarized as the following:
                        
                           •
                           Short of fusion information. Fusion information is becoming more and more important for the nations to survive the diverse competition in this e-era of globalization. World Competitiveness Yearbook (WCY) is the most well-known annual report of national competitiveness [2]. It linearly aggregates diverse competitiveness. However, neither fused nor decomposed information is provided.

Challenges of inconsistency. Currently, the most popular fusion technique for utilities is by integrating the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy integral. However, it faces inconsistency challenges. For instance, applying the fuzzy integral and the fuzzy measure on two criteria and two utilities might encounter ‘Why is u
                              2 involved in the interaction effects while u
                              1 is not?’, which is formulated with gray color in Eq. (1) and illustrated in Fig. 1
                              .
                                 
                                    (1)
                                    
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                          
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           

In Eq. (1), k represents an object, Q
                              ={q
                              1,q
                              2} is a criteria set, u represents a utility function, g represents a fuzzy measure function, u
                              1 and u
                              2 are utility values of criteria q
                              1 and q
                              2 with respect to k, g
                              1 and g
                              2 are fuzzy densities of criteria q
                              1 and q
                              2, and λ is an interaction degree.

Challenges of uncertainty reduction. The fusion uncertainty from both the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy integral makes their integration a more serious uncertainty. So far, there has been no any proposed decomposing technique for information fusion, thus making the uncertainty reduction still short of a penetrating function.

To overcome the above challenges, the fuzzy integral, the fuzzy measure, and a fitness fusion are integrated, termed as the fuzzy integral fusion (FIF), to generate fusion features, provide both fused and decomposed information, and feedback selected criteria for further fusion, as shown in Fig. 2
                      with three stages. In Stage I, DRSA and the fuzzy measure identification are integrated into a generalized fuzzy integral, presented in Proposition 3 of Section 3 
                     [13–17]. In Stage II, Applying the generalized fuzzy integral generates the fusion features. Stage III, a fitness fusion is designed to select a candidate criterion for the next round or terminates the fusion. Furthermore, decomposed information of the features such as the benchmarking, fused effect, and qualities are collected at the right bottom corner.

This paper has two main parts. The first part discusses the design and implementation of FIF. The second applies FIF to analyze the European crisis nations (Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and the European welfare nations (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) based on WCY 2010. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the information fusion, Section 3 presents the fuzzy integral fusion, Section 4 addresses application results of FIF, and Section 5 presents discussions and implications for the European crisis nations. Finally, concluding remarks are stated to close the paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The International Institute for Management Development (IMD) annually publishes World Competitiveness Yearbook (WCY), a well-known report which ranks and analyzes how a nation’s environment can create and develop sustainable enterprises. Information from this report is used as the competitiveness dataset in this research [2]. Discussions related to the competitiveness fusion are presented in the following.

The information fusion is a technique proposed by Keller in 1990 [14] which aims to search the maximal agreement between the objective evidences and the subjective expectation on various sources [18,19]. The fuzzy integral defined with respect to a fuzzy measure becomes the major tool. Four years after, the information fusion was applied for classification [20], multiple criteria decision making [4], and feature fusion [5]. Technically, the fuzzy integral was developed in formulae as:

                           j
                        . The information fusion with the fuzzy integral and the fuzzy measure together has three types of interaction results, namely:
                           
                              1.
                              Negative synergy (or redundancy) – is when the importance of combining two different features is less than the sum of two individuals.

Positive synergy (complement) – is when the importance of combining two different features is more than the sum of two individuals.

Independency – is when each fusing resource independently brings its contribution into the recognition.

In recent years, the information fusion has been popularly applied in many fields. To name a few, a generalized Choquet fuzzy integral was proposed to assign confidence for a land mine detection [21], a fusion model was applied in biometrics for decision analysis [22], an application of combining fuzzy measure and nonlinear integral based on multi-regressions was developed for data mining [23], and an application for evaluation was proposed to help in distance learning [10].

Currently, the fuzzy measure is being extended to perform as a multiplicative utility function which makes information fusion as simple as a function [17].

EFM multiplies implication probabilities and preferences into utilities and then extends the fuzzy measurement to accumulate utilities for competitiveness. The following properties are their descriptions. Properties 1 and 2 are about the information system and preference expressions. Properties 3–5 include an induction rule,

The competitiveness reflects the fusion power of a nation, and has multi-criteria as defined by WCY, and discussed in Section 3.1. The fuzzy integral fusion, comprising three stages illustrated in Fig. 2, is designed to illustrate the competitiveness with fusion features. Not only characteristic of dominance-based features, but also information of fusion features is provided to help users to get sufficient understanding of the dominance competitiveness. Its illustration includes four parts, as described in the following sections. Section 3.1 is about the dataset. Section 3.2 proves the integration of the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy integral. Section 3.3 proposes notations for fusion information, and Section 3.4 is about mathematics and algorithm of FIF.

International Institute for Management and Development (IMD) publishes national competitiveness ranking from broad perspectives by gathering the latest and most relevant data on the subject and by analyzing the policy consequence. The WCY is a product of IMD cooperating with 54 partner institutes worldwide. Its data figures include the four consolidated factors and twenty criteria of Table 1
                        , which are used in researches, business decision analysis, and government policy-making. A total of 58 nations are included in 2010 WCY. The twenty criteria will be empirically used as fusion features in this research.

The fuzzy integral is designed to give the aggregated competitiveness by considering the interaction among criteria. The following are propositions about the fuzzy integral for competitiveness.

The fusion information discussed in this section contains three aspects: the fusion features, quality measures, and the fusion components, illustrated in eight propositions. Propositions 5, 6 relate to the fusion features classified by the approximation boundaries [17,24–31]. Proposition 8 
                        [32,33] and Proposition 9 
                        [17] are about the quality measures of the fusion features [17,34]. Propositions 10, 11 are about the fusion components made of P-lower and P-fused approximations illustrated below.

                              is a definition of a noncore of a P-fused approximation. The noncore comprises nations beyond the lower approximation of DRSA. Therefore, its size is defined as the fusion effect for the decision objective. By applying this advantage an understanding can be obtained, the bigger the noncore the higher fusion capability the dominating nations have.
                           

The fitness fusion takes one criterion at a time for the positive fusion and avoids the negative and independent fusions to reduce fusion uncertainty. Consequently, the complexity and disturbance during processing is also reduced.

The positive fusion model is designed to satisfy the fitness requirements. It is conceptually shown in Fig. 5
                        , mathematically presented in Model 4, and processed in Algorithm I.

The fitness fusion requirements are:

Two points make FIF different from the fuzzy integral. First, it uses a single function for aggregation instead of many integral steps. Second, it provides the decomposed information for the P-fused approximations by giving the benchmarking (core) and the fusion effect (noncore). Statically, the noncore can reveal hidden information. For instance, the bigger the noncore the more fusion the competitiveness level has.

The resulted CFDs and λ intervals for the top ten and the upper half nations are presented in Table A1. They reveal that none of the criteria can completely classify dominance classes. Only a single type of λ means these densities are reliable without uncertainty disturbance.

Based on the reliable results, four fusion features are induced by applying FIF on the top ten and the upper half nations. The fusion information of these features has two categories. The first includes feature qualities (CR, AR, and CFD). The second includes the decomposed information such as core and noncore. Fusion feature I, II, and III are illustrated in Fig. 5 as a fusion process. Fusion feature IV gives significant criteria for the upper half nations. These empirical experiments choose λ
                     =−0.01 because they require the smallest interaction as possible.

Institutional framework (q
                              8) almost classifies the upper half nations, thus it is the most important criterion for a nation to be in the upper half level. Obviously, not much fused competitiveness needs concern.

As users can see in the resulted features, the core gets smaller while the noncore gets bigger. Alternatively, as the conditional fuzzy density gets higher, the noncore nations become more. When comparing Fusion feature III and IV, the fused competitiveness plays more significance in the top ten than in the upper half level.

This research has achieved two merits. First, FIF can derive the lower fusion approximations composed of the core and the noncore. Second, FIF can determine feature qualities after proceeding fusion. These findings are further discussed in Section 5.

This section has two parts. One is about technique discussion. The other is a case study about the European crisis and the European welfare patterns.

The inconsistency of integrating the fuzzy measure and the fuzzy integral for competitiveness has been solved in Section 3.2. Furthermore, FIF takes advantages of the fitness fusion to reduce uncertainty. For example, Algorithm I filters out criteria such as q
                     4, q
                     7, q
                     8, q

                     18, q
                     19, and q
                     20 which have either negative or independent fusion effects in the second run. The criteria reduction makes uncertainty reduction possible in the polynomial time, F(n)=

                     ⩾⋯, and m
                     =20 representing the number of criteria in this case. Consequently, the computing tasks are dramatically reduced in the fusion process.

Generally, when using DRSA, the lower approximation becomes smaller as the number of criteria increases, which is shown as the dashed line in the left part of Fig. 7
                     . FIF can address this weakness by raising the fusion effects, shown as the solid line. By taking advantage of this, the top ten nations during 2009–2010 can be decomposed into the core obtained from Proposition 10 and the noncore obtained from Proposition 12. FIF can determine whether a nation in the doubt region of DRSA has a fusion effect or not, as illustrated in the right part of Fig. 7.

To compare the merits among the related techniques of the information fusion, unsupervised classification, non-additive aggregation, and decomposed information for approximations are used as comparative items in Table 2
                     . It can be seen here that FIF has all the merits. DRSA [24–30] can derive unsupervised implications and provide decomposed information but cannot handle aggregation. Both the utility theory [35,36] and the fuzzy integral [37–39] can non-additively aggregate but cannot provide the decomposed information for the fused approximations. FIF combines merits from DRSA, utility theory, and fuzzy integral to enlighten the fusion information and give reasoning.

A case study about two patterns: the European crisis suffering from financial debts and the European welfare having good business finance and institution framework. This study aims to derive a recommendation to get the European crisis nations out of crisis. Two steps deserve paying attention. First, they need to achieve the upper half positions by improving Feature IV which is solved by applying FIF on the upper half nations. Second, after climbing up to the upper half positions they need to improve their business finance based on Feature III. It can be observed that the nations of the world have a high coefficient up to 0.66 in left part of Fig. 8
                     , with Feature III as the vertical axis and Feature IV as the horizontal axis. The major root cause of the European crisis is most likely that their institution is not able to effectively support their business finance. This can be implied by the regression lines in Fig. 8. Microsoft Excel can solve the regressions for the European crisis nations, the European welfare nations, and all nations as Eq. (8)–(10) below.

According to (8) and (9), the European welfare nations have much better effect in raising Feature III by improving Feature IV than the European crisis nations.

The criteria priority is an effective strategy for improving a nation’s competitiveness. This is further discussed below.
                        
                           •
                           The fusion features give the strategy of raising competitiveness, which is presented by the dashed line of the left part of Fig. 8. When a nation wants to get better in competitiveness it firstly needs to have a solid institution framework. This implication should not be reversed. One general mistake is that a policy focuses much on the business finance before a solid institution framework is established.

The fused competitiveness appears to be more important in the top level than in the middle level. This shows that enhancing the fused competitiveness becomes more urgent when nations come closer to the high competition level. For instance, the major CFD of Feature III is smaller than that of Feature IV which means the individual importance of criteria becomes less in the high competition level. The evidences from the resulted CFDs are presented in Table A1. For instance,

The core plays as the benchmarking for a dominance class, even if it only has few members. The benchmarking of Fusion feature III can disclose two findings. Firstly, international investment (q
                              3) dramatically reduces the number of the core nations thus corrects 80% of the top nations to be the noncore nations in the third run of Fig. 6. In a reverse direction, USA is the only nation which gained movement into the top ten by the third run of Fig. 6. If USA is not a critical nation influencing the world, then the third run fusion would not move so many nations out of the core. Therefore, it can be concluded that USA is a critical nation in the world. Secondly, business finance (q
                              13) gains 0.73 of CFD in Feature I. Therefore, it is the most important criterion in the top level.

In the future work, a knowledge system with fusion reasoning should be developed to help users easily catch fusion information such as core, noncore, candidate criteria for fusion, and qualities of fusion features. Hopefully, the knowledge systems for competitiveness can be made available in the near future. Alternatively, how the business attitudes can ultimately sustain nations to approach the top deserves further exploration.

The proposed FIF integrates the fuzzy integral, the fuzzy measure identification, and the fitness fusion to generate fusion features and successfully decomposes a dominance approximation into the benchmarking (core) and the fusion effect (noncore) nations. It can help users to get an insight of the dominance nations. The benchmarking represents the characteristics of the top competitiveness and the fusion effect illustrates the criteria interdependence becomes more important in the high competition level. Technically, FIF can make up to the DRSA weakness by the fusion effect.

The case study about the European crisis and welfare patterns shows that all nations in the world have tight relationship between Feature III and IV. Their regression coefficient was up to 0.66. To measure the effective influence of Feature IV on Feature III, three horizontal dashed lines with equal length are used to compare the three vertical dashed lines. The longer vertical dashed lines reflect the higher effective influence of Feature IV on III. According to our experiment results, the European welfare nations effectively influenced Feature III by Feature IV in 2010 while the European crisis nations showed lower regression of the effective influence (0.18) compared to average value among all nations (0.66) and the welfare nations (1.07). These findings might be helpful for government policy and decision making in searching solutions for the European debts crisis, i.e., improving the institution framework, which is the major part of Features IV, can most probably solve the debt crisis.

The conditional fuzzy densities of Proposition 4 for the top-ten and the upper half nations of WCY 2010 are calculated and summarized in the left part of Table A1
