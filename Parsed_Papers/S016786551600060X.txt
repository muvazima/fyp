                  Conventionally, in vector Taylor series (VTS) based compensation for noise-robust speech recognition, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are usually trained with clean speech. However, it is known that better performance is generally obtained by training the HMM with noisy speech rather than clean speech. From this viewpoint, we propose a novel VTS-based HMM adaptation method for the noisy speech trained HMM. We derive a mathematical relation between the training and test noisy speech in the cepstrum-domain using VTS and the mean and covariance of the noisy speech trained HMM are adapted to the test noisy speech in an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the experimental results on the Aurora 2 database, we could obtain about 10–25% relative improvements in word error rates (WERs) over multi-condition training (MTR) method depending on speech front-ends and the HMM complexity.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Speech recognition in noisy environments still remains a difficult problem despite many technical advances that have been made in this field. The techniques which try to mitigate the mismatch between test noisy speech and clean speech HMM can be generally categorized as noise-robust speech feature extraction, speech enhancement, and feature compensation and model parameter adaptation [1–6].

Among these methods, we focus on the HMM parameter adaptation methods because they are very powerful in improving noisy speech recognition accuracy compared with other approaches and many new research efforts are still actively going on in these areas. Maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) is one of the earliest and most popular model adaptation methods [6]. A set of linear transformations is used to adapt the means and covariance matrices of the HMM. Some variants of MLLR have been used to cope with the large amount of adaptation data required to estimate the transformation matrices [7]. Originally, developed for speaker adaptation, MLLR can be also effective for noise robust speech recognition. However, since it does not take into account actual noise corruption process, its performance is generally lower than the model adaptation methods such as parallel model combination (PMC) and VTS adaptation [3,4] that consider explicitly the relationship between clean and noisy speech signal.

Besides their superior performance, PMC and VTS require quite less adaptation data compared with MLLR. Especially, VTS adaptation is performed at runtime just using the test noisy speech and its performance is known to be better than PMC since the nonlinear approximation based on a first-order Taylor series expansion is more accurate than the lognormal approximation used in PMC. Joint uncertainty decoding (JUD) adapts HMM parameters by explicitly modeling the joint probability density function (PDF) of noisy and clean speech signal [8]. Compared with VTS and PMC, JUD requires less computation time by considering the joint PDF for a small set of regression classes rather than for each mixture component of the HMM at a small decrease in performance. The joint PDF in JUD can be obtained either by using stereo data consisting of noisy and clean speech signal or by applying the conventional model adaptation methods like PMC/VTS.

Although the aforementioned model adaptation methods have shown very successful results in noisy speech recognition, they use HMMs trained with clean speech as the baseline, which have some limitation in improving noisy speech recognition accuracy due to the inevitable mismatch between the observed test noisy speech and the adapted HMM parameters. This comes from the inaccuracies in the assumed noise corruption model and the mathematical approximations such as the first-order Taylor series expansion in the VTS adaptation.

As a different point of view from the model adaptation approaches for noise robust speech recognition, training HMMs directly with noisy speech has been proposed to show very promising results in noisy speech recognition [9–11]. For example, in the multi-condition training (MTR) method, noisy speech signals under various noise conditions are collected to train one set of HMMs [9]. Also, multiple HMM sets corresponding to various noise types and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are constructed during training in a multiple-model based speech recognition (MMSR) framework [10]. The resulting noisy speech trained HMM significantly reduces the mismatch with the test noisy speech and performs much better than the clean speech HMM.

Some research efforts have been proposed to incorporate the conventional feature and model parameter compensation methods to the noisy speech trained HMM. This is motivated by the idea that the noisy speech trained HMM is more advantageous to performance improvement than the clean speech HMM. One of the earliest approaches to adapt the parameters of the noisy speech trained HMM is Jacobian adaptation (JA) [12]. Since it is based on a simple linear approximation of the nonlinear cepstral distortion, it seems to have difficulty in accurately reflecting the changing noise conditions into the HMM parameters. A noise-type dependent minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of the feature vectors has been applied successfully in the MMSR framework [13]. In our previous study, the nonlinear relation between the test and training noisy speech in the log-spectrum domain was used to re-estimate the test noisy speech feature vector to make it match better with the noisy speech trained HMM [14]. In recent studies, VTS and JUD based approaches have been popularly used in the feature and model compensation for the noisy speech trained HMM [15–17]. For example, in [15], an MTR trained HMM is transformed into a pseudo-clean HMM during training by using VTS. Then, the pseudo-clean HMM is used for recognition instead of the clean speech HMM to reduce environmental variations due to the noise leading to successful recognition results.

In this letter, we propose a new approach to adapt the parameters of the noisy speech trained HMM to the test noisy speech at recognition. It is based on a novel relation between the training and test noisy speech in the cepstrum domain. Compared with the recent model adaptation methods which adapt the pseudo clean speech HMM, the proposed algorithm is relatively simple in its implementation since it does not require estimate the parameters of the pseudo clean speech HMM [15]. In addition, the proposed method improves performance by adapting directly the MTR trained HMM, which makes it possible to take advantage of the inherent noise robustness of the noisy speech trained HMM.

In this section, we derive an adaptation formula for the mean vectors and covariance matrices of the noisy speech trained HMM using VTS approximation. Contrary to the conventional VTS algorithms which require clean speech HMM, the noisy speech HMM trained by MTR method is used in the proposed adaptation algorithm. A novel relation between the training and test noisy speech is first derived in the cepstrum-domain. The non-linear relation is approximated using VTS to obtain the mean vectors and covariance matrices corresponding to the test noisy speech assuming that the additive and channel noises are known. An iterative EM algorithm is employed to update both the noise and HMM parameters.

It is generally assumed that the clean speech x and the test noisy speech y contaminated with additive and channel noise n, h is related in the cepstrum domain as follows:

In summary, the iterative EM algorithm for the HMM parameter adaptation is performed by first updating the HMM parameters using initialized noise parameters 
                           μ
                        
                        
                           n, 0, h
                        0 as in (7), (8), (15). Then, the noise parameters are re-estimated as in (17), (18) using the updated HMM parameters, which are used to update the HMM parameters again. The re-estimation process can be repeated until the log-likelihood of the test noisy speech converges, but single iteration was performed in our experiments to reduce the computation time.

@&#EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS@&#

To test the proposed HMM adaptation method, experiments were performed on the Aurora 2 database [10]. The baseline noisy speech HMM was trained using the MTR data of the Aurora 2 database which consists of clean and noisy speech signals contaminated by various types of noise signals (Subway, Babble, Car, and Exhibition) with SNR ranges from 0 to 20dB in 5dB intervals.

Three test sets (Set A, Set B, and Set C) are used for recognition experiments. They are corrupted by a range of noise types with SNRs of −5, 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20dB. Set A is corrupted by additive noise of which the types (Subway, Babble, Car, and Exhibition) are known during training, while Set B is corrupted with unknown types (Restaurant, Street, Airport, and Train Station) of additive noises, and Set C is corrupted by a combination of convolution and additive noise (Subway, Street).

We used two widely known speech front-ends for the experiments. The first is entitled FE, which consists of 13th order Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) with the 0th cepstral coefficient along with their delta and acceleration coefficients to construct a 39-dimensional feature vector for each frame [20]. The second feature set is a noise robust version of the FE, which is generally called AFE (Advanced Front-End) in the literature and known to significantly reduce word error rates in noisy conditions [21]. We extracted 39-dimentional feature vectors in the AFE to be consistent with the feature size used for the FE.

The acoustic models were trained using both the Complex Back End (CBE) and Simple Back End (SBE) scripts [10], which are each separately defined for the Aurora 2 database. For the SBE model, the HMM for each digit consists of 16 states with 3 Gaussian mixtures in each state. In addition, a three-state silence model with 6 Gaussian mixtures per state and a one-state pause model tied with the center state of the silence model are used. For the CBE, the number of mixtures in each state is increased to 20 and 36 for the digit and silence model, respectively. The hidden Markov model toolkit (HTK) was employed to train and test the HMM used in this study [22].

In Table 1
                     , the word error rates (WERs) of the proposed HMM adaptation method (MTR+MA (Model Adaptation)) using SBE script is shown along with CLEAN training, conventional VTS and MTR training. The results are shown separately for AFE and FE.

As expected, the VTS applied to the clean speech HMM significantly improves the performance of CLEAN training. Its performance also outperforms MTR when using FE, but it is inferior to MTR when AFE is used. VTS does not seem to gain much improvement by using AFE while there is significant improvement in the MTR training.

By applying the proposed adaption method to the MTR, we could further improve the performance of MTR in both FE and AFE. MTR+MA is shown to outperform MTR as well as VTS at both front-ends, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The relative improvement of MTR+MA over VTS and MTR is also shown in Table 1. 29.2% and 10.6% relative improvement in average WERs over MTR training is obtained by applying the proposed adaption method when using FE and AFE, respectively. It is also shown that 14.7% and 26.9% relative improvement over VTS is obtained with the proposed method for each front-end, respectively.

Since the performance of an algorithm may depend on the complexity of the acoustic modeling, the proposed HMM adaptation method has also been tested on CBE script and the results are shown in Table 2
                     . Since more detailed acoustic modeling is used in CBE script, the results of VTS and MTR in Table 2 are much better than those in Table 1.
                  

We can see that the performance of MTR using CBE script is improved by applying the proposed adaption method. The relative improvement shown in Table 2 has similar trend as in Table 1, which shows the robustness of the proposed method against the variability in the acoustic modeling of the HMM.

In Table 3
                     , we compare MTR+MA with the recently published Noise Adaptive Training (NAT) algorithm, which is one of the representative HMM adaptation methods that make use of noisy speech trained HMM based on VTS. The comparison was performed using CBE script and the WERs of NAT are quoted from the original paper [15].

Since it is not easy to directly compare the two results due to the different baseline systems, we also show the result of the baseline system of NAT (Baseline (NAT)), which was trained by maximum likelihood (ML) criterion using MTR data of the Aurora 2 database. Although they used the same training data, a slight difference in performance is observed between the MTR training and the Baseline (NAT), which may be due to the different training procedures used in the two methods. While the average WERs of the two baseline recognizers are very close (6.79%vs. 6.76%), we can see that MTR+MA shows better performance than NAT (6.07%vs. 6.25%).

To investigate the recognition results in more detail, Fig. 1
                      shows the relative improvement (%) in WERs of MTR+MA and NAT over their respective baseline recognizers, the MTR and the Baseline (NAT). We can see that MTR+MA achieves better relative improvement over its baseline than NAT. Especially, the improvement is prominent for Set A and Set B, while similar improvement is shown for Set C.

As mentioned in the Introduction, there have been other recent noisy speech HMM adaptation methods like Joint Adaptive Training (JAT), Joint Uncertainty Decoding (JUD) and Irrelevant Variability Normalization (IVN). They are similar to NAT in their ideas. Basically, they make it possible to estimate the PDF of the noisy observations given the parameters of the pseudo clean speech HMM. Like NAT, IVN estimates the pseudo clean speech HMM parameters from MTR trained noisy speech HMM using VTS. IVN is a little different from NAT in its implementation of VTS and the HMM parameters to be updated. JAT is basically based on JUD which explicitly models the conditional PDF of noisy speech given the clean speech HMM for a small set of regression classes. But it additionally can construct the pseudo clean HMM from the noisy speech trained (multi-style) HMM as done in NAT and INV. When the joint conditional PDF in JUD is estimated using VTS for each Gaussian mixture component of the HMM rather than for the regression classes, it is thought that JAT will produce the same adapted HMM parameter as in NAT [15]. From these facts, the recent HMM adaptation methods using multi-style HMM do not seem quite different from each other in their performance and ideas.

The proposed method is basically different from the aforementioned multi-style HMM adaptation methods since it adapts directly the parameters of the MTR trained HMM, which is more advantageous in utilizing the inherent noise robustness of the noisy speech HMM. In conventional noisy speech recognition, direct use of the noisy speech HMM has often shown improved performance over the mathematical approach based on clean speech HMM. For example, the Jacobian Adaptation (JA) of noisy speech HMMs has shown better performance than the mathematical model based adaptation methods like PMC, especially when the amount of noise samples available is small [12]. The superior performance of the proposed method over NAT may be attributed to the same ground. Also, since the proposed method does not need estimate the parameters of the pseudo clean speech HMM, its implementation is simple without some intricate mathematical formulations used in other noise adaptive training methods.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this letter, we proposed an HMM parameter adaptation method for noise robust speech recognition. Contrary to conventional adaptation methods where the baseline recognizer is trained with clean speech, the proposed method adapts the parameters of the MTR trained noisy speech HMM. The method is based on a novel relation between the test and training noisy speech in the cepstrum domain. By using VTS approximation, the mean and covariance of the MTR trained HMMs are adapted to the test noisy speech in an iterative EM algorithm, where additive and channel noise parameters are also re-estimated. We have shown that the proposed method achieves about 10% and 25% relative improvement over the MTR trained HMM when using CBE script for FE and AFE front-ends, respectively. It also performed better than NAT algorithm which is one of the recent HMM adaptation methods based on noisy speech HMM. The superior performance of the proposed method may be attributed to the direct adaptation of the noisy speech HMM. Also, the relative simple implementation compared with other noise adaptive training methods is another merit of the proposed method.
