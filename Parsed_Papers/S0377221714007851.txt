                  Value–income ratios, such as dividend yields in finance and price–rent ratios in housing and real estate markets, impact society in a variety of ways. This paper proposes a new type of the present value model that features income growth with time-varying yields. It offers a new risk perspective, which may alleviate timid investor behavior in market downturns while cooling down the market in seemingly booming times. A binding relationship, the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income, is revealed. This has notable implications for empirical research, which examines value–income ratios time and again. Incorrectly perceived market behavior distorts the formation of investor behavior, and vice versa, which has serious consequences to the functioning of the market and beyond.
               
            

The present value model is one of the most used financial models in daily life for corporations and individuals alike. The present-value model states that the present value of an asset is derived from all its future cash flows that are discounted by appropriate discount rates to their present values. This crucially depends on the expectations about future income and the discount rate at which people sacrifice a portion of their current income for future consumption, after adjusting for risk. Campbell and Shiller (1987) are among the first to propose empirical tests of the validity of present value models based on cointegration relations between the present value of an asset and its future income, with the discount rate being constant. They subsequently rework the model to incorporate time-varying discount rates (Campbell & Shiller, 1988).

Price–income relationships in present value models have been scrutinized all the time. Recent examples include Riddel (2011), Lai and Van Order (2010) and Himmelberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005). They are all concerned with high house prices and phenomenal growth in house prices in the US, and examine the fundamental relationships and the presence of bubbles. Nevertheless, while such ratios or prices themselves cannot prove whether the prices are too high or modestly low, they may convey some widespread concerns or reliefs, at the wrong time and in the wrong place. These have to be adjusted by pertinent factors.

We accordingly propose a new type of income growth model with time-varying yields to maturity in this study. Several new developments are featured in the paper. Firstly, unlike Campbell and Shiller (1988), no approximation has been resorted to, except for the logarithmic expression for income growth which is conventional in financial analysis. Then, the discount rate is the rate for the life of holding the asset or yields to maturity, not the one period rate in almost all empirical studies that follow Campbell and Shiller (1988). Further, the time-varying discount rate is a variable in the fundamental relationship of cointegration in our model. Whereas the time-varying discount rate in Campbell and Shiller (1988) is included in short-term analysis but it is not an element in the cointegration relationship.

The rest of the paper progresses as follows. The next section makes a brief literature review. Section 3 introduces the basic present value model. Section 4 presents the new model, while Section 5 discusses the implications of the relationship revealed by the model. Section 6 provides examples of application. Finally, Section 7 concludes.


                     Timmermann (1995) has carried out extensive econometric tests on the present value model of Campbell and Shiller (1987) and the model augmented by Campbell and Shiller (1988) that incorporates time-varying discount rates. He claims that the latter version is more appropriate while the original present value model performs unsatisfactorily. Wang (2003) suggests the use of a Gordon dividend growth type specification for the present value model, which helps explain the discrepancy between the estimated 3.2 percent discount rate in the empirical part of Campbell and Shiller (1987) for the US broad stock market index and the usually assumed estimated mean rate of return of 8.2 percent for the period from 1871 to 1986. He claims that the difference in the two estimates implies a certain growth in dividends, which have been rightly taken into account by Campbell and Shiller (1988). While Wang (2003) has proposed the use of a Gordon dividend growth type specification for the present value model, the discount rate is not time-varying in the model.

Most recently, Cornell (2013) has another look at dividend–price ratios and stock returns in history. He argues that the “predictability” of stock returns based on regressions of future returns on dividend–price ratios is consistent with the original version of the efficient market hypothesis, which holds that expected returns are unpredictable. Indeed, returns are derived from an asset's income-generating abilities. In his case, the income is dividends. This highlights the importance of avoiding mixing a necessary fundamental relationship with return predictability. Cochrane (2011) elaborates on the importance of a time-varying yield or discount rate in his American Finance Association Presidential Address: “Now it seems all price–dividend variation corresponds to discount-rate variation”. He contrasts asset-pricing research 40 years ago with contemporary finance research, while agreeing with Fama on that asset prices should equal expected discounted cash flows. He is quoted as saying: “Fama (1970) argued that the expected part, ‘testing market efficiency’, provided the framework for organizing asset-pricing research in that era. I argue that the ‘discounted’ part better organizes our research today”. This is echoed in Cornell (2013). While we seek and may have found better explanations for returns, the findings do not contradict market efficiency and do not make stock returns more predictable.

Empirically, McMillan (2007) investigates whether there are bubbles in the dividend–price ratio by implementing an asymmetric exponential smooth-transition model. He finds that the log dividend–price ratio is stationary only in a non-linear form fitted with an asymmetric exponential smooth transition model. Therefore, use of this non-linear asymmetric model tends to reject rational bubbles that can otherwise be mistaken to exist. McMillan (2006) has communicated the above ideas earlier in a short paper. Following Campbell and Shiller (1988) in defining holding period returns, Harrison and Zhang (1999) further incorporate conditional variances in the form of ARCH into the price–dividend ratio model. They employ the semi non-parametric method to estimate the conditional density function, as the method allows for heterogeneity that is typical in financial data. They find a positive risk and return relation at long holding intervals, but such a relation does not exist at short holding intervals. They attribute these findings to their model specification that arguments the price–dividend ratio model with conditional variances. Observing that a number of papers apply different statistical methods to study the relation among dividend yields, earnings growth and stock returns in different markets along different time horizons, Pang, Yu, Troutt, and Hou (2008) study the statistical properties of dividend yields. They propose that it is more appropriate to assume that dividend yields follow a beta distribution. With a VAR framework, Goddard, McMillan, and Wilson (2006) examine the dynamic relationships between share prices, dividends and earnings for UK manufacturing and service companies. They find that there is strong evidence of a contemporaneous relationship between prices, dividends and earnings, and little evidence of independence between these variables. This justifies the adoption of price–dividend ratios in estimating stock returns.

Whether the value–income relationship holds in housing and real estate markets is also a hot topic. For example, Fraser, Hoesli, and McAlevey (2008) test whether there are bubbles in house prices in New Zealand by studying real house prices in relation to the fundamentals that make up house values for the period between 1970 and 2005. Their results indicate that there are significant deviations from fundamental values in New Zealand's residential housing prices. Wang (2000) applies the present value model to UK office, retail, and industrial property markets for scrutinizing the data characteristics of capital value and rental income and their relationships. The results suggest that the existence of rational bubbles in the UK property market can be largely ruled out in that capital values and rents do not tend to depart away in the long-run in the aggregate, office, and retail property markets. However, the UK property market appears to be inefficient. Riddel (2011) investigates whether housing bubbles are contagious with a case study of the house prices in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It is claimed that contagious prices and income growth from the Los Angeles market compounded by naïve expectations contributed to the formation of a bubble in the Las Vegas market.

The above review shows that many empirical studies have been conducted within the analytical framework put forward by Campbell and Shiller (1988). Some have improved the model fit by resorting to different estimation methods. The new developments in the paper are fundamental rather than technical, as briefed at the beginning. These will be demonstrated in Section 4 while our models with income growth and time-varying yields are presented. Prior to that, the next section introduces the basic model.

The present value of an asset is its all future income discounted:

                     Eq. (3) suggests a cointegration relation for Vt
                      and It
                     . If Vt
                      and It
                      are I(1) series, then ΔIt
                      is an I(0) series. This provides a tool for testing rationality in financial markets – the price or the present value of an asset and the income it generates should be cointegrated if expectations are formed rationally and the present value model is to hold. The cointegration vector is (1, −1/r) in this case.

The seeming stationarity of the right hand side in Eq. (3) is unrealistic. The growth in income in Eq. (3) is an absolute term, It
                      − I
                     
                        t − 1, not a relative term, (It
                      − I
                     
                        t − 1)/I
                     
                        t − 1 or ln(It
                     ) − ln(I
                     
                        t − 1). This absolute change in income will on average becomes greater and greater over time, and cannot be assumed stationary. Let us now adopt a version of the Gordon dividend growth model, in which income grows at a rate of g: r is greater than
g for incurring risks more than that incurred and compensated by growth.

The above analysis can be easily adapted to models with time-varying interest rates and growth rates. We employ yields to maturity, or long rates, instead of using short rates, or one period rates of return, which differs from Campbell and Shiller (1988). Eq. (11) then becomes:

                     where yt
                      is the yield to maturity at time t. It is unclear whether interest rate variables are stationary or not. It has been widely reported that nominal interest rates are non-stationary whereas real interest rates are stationary, although this is still subject to individual cases nonetheless. ln(1 + gt
                     ) ≈ gt
                     , the growth rate in income, is stationary in theory which largely holds in practice too. Our analysis points out that, it is not to confirm a cointegration relationship between value and income for the present value model to stand, as all in the literature assume and adopt. Crucially, it is to preserve a cointegration relationship between value, income and yield. Our design opens a new way for a cointegration relationship between three fundamental variables, value/price, income and interest rate/yield, enriching research. Vt, It
                      and yt
                      − gt
                      are cointegrated with a cointegration vector
(1, −1, 1) in their logarithmic form.

If there is a rational bubble bt
                     , satisfying bt

                        t + 1/(1 + yt
                     ), it will appear on the right hand side of Eq. (12). Consequently, although
Δln(I
                     
                        t + τ
                     ) is stationary, the left hand side of the equation is non-stationary if there is a rational bubble.

It is interesting to note that ln(Vt
                     ) − ln(It
                     ) + ln(yt
                      − gt
                     ) − ln(1 + gt
                     ) is the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income. (yt
                      − gt
                     )
is also known as capitalization rate. This is in contrast, and an augmentation to Campbell and Shiller (1988), where a simple income-value (dividend–price) ratio is used and scrutinized. The discount rate in Campbell and Shiller (1988), though time-varying, is not a part in the fundamental relationship of cointegration, after several steps of approximation. i.e., their time-varying discount rate appears on the right hand side of the equation only (Eqs. (4), (6) and (8) in Campbell & Shiller, 1988) where all the variables involved are in their first differences. Their time-varying discount rate does not appear on the left hand side that constitutes the variables in levels. So, their time-varying discount rate has no effect on empirical results with regard to cointegration and long-run relationships between the stock price and the dividend or, in general, between the asset value/price and the income generated by the asset.

Our analysis and modeling reveal that, a stationary income-value (dividend–price) ratio does not rule out rational bubbles; nor does a non-stationary income-value ratio necessarily rule in rationale bubbles. In this regard, results and conclusions based on inspections of dividend yields or other similar ratios between value and income can be misleading. The right criterion should be the stationarity of the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income.

Two longest stock market indexes on DataStream, S&P500 price index and FTSE all share price index are used in this study. The retrieved price index data and dividend yields are in the monthly frequency. Additional interest rates are from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Our data set starts in 1965:01, the earliest date when dividend yields are available on DataStream, and ends in 2012:12. Conforming to the infrastructural investment cycles of Kuznets (1930) that features the long-term characteristics in corporate activities, we adopt rolling average rates of total return over the Kuznets cycle for long rates or yields. The rolling window spans 15 years. In addition and following Campbell and Shiller (1988),

                        Yields on 4–6 month prime commercial paper were used as a proxy for short rates of stock returns.
                      Moody's yields on Baa bonds are included.

We adopt two approaches to testing the rationality of stock markets. One is to test whether the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income, the left hand of Eq. (12), is stationary. The other is to test whether ln(Vt
                     ) − ln(It
                     ) and ln(yt
                      − gt
                     ) are cointegrated. This relaxes the requirement for a cointegration vector

That is, we further test whether the price–dividend ratio is cointegrated with the capitalization rate, without a one to one proportionate relationship. Let us denote the former a strong form of rationality and the latter a weak form of rationality. For the former, the augmented Dickey and Fuller (ADF thereafter) test (cf.
 Dickey & Fuller, 1979, 1981), the Phillips and Perron (PP thereafter) test (cf.
 Phillips & Perron, 1988), and the KPSS procedure (cf.
 Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, & Shin, 1992) are adopted for unit root tests. Lag lengths in unit root tests are decided by a joint evaluation with the Akaike and Schwarz information criteria. For the latter, Johansen procedures are used for cointegration tests (cf.
 Johansen, 1988, 1991; Johansen & Juselius, 1990).


                     Tables 1a
                      and 1b
                      report the stationarity test results for the price and dividend in their logarithm, pt
                      and divt
                     , and their log differences, Δpt
                      and Δdivt
                     ; the capitalization rates adopting a 15-year Kuznets cycle crk15, and the capitalization rate using Moody's Baa bond yields crmdt
                     . Table 1a is for S&P500 and Table 1b is for FTSE all shares. The results for prices and dividends are as conventional as in almost all previous studies. Logarithmic prices and dividends are non-stationary in levels and are stationary in first differences for both S&P500 and FTSE, indicating they are all I(1) time series. The capitalization rate crk15 and crmdt
                      are also I(1) series for both S&P500 and FTSE, suggested by Tables 1a
and 1b
.




Our interest is with the results in Tables 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b for stationarity tests and cointegration tests. Results in Table 2a indicate that the simple price–dividend ratio is non-stationary for S&P500. The null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected by both ADF and PP tests at the lowest level; while the null hypothesis of a stationary time series is rejected at the highest 1 percent level by the KPSS test. Relative to S&P500, the ADF and PP test statistics are more negative with larger absolute values for FTSE. Still, the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected either for FTSE, indicated by Table 2b. Similarly, although the KPSS statistic is smaller in Table 2b than that in Table 2a, it is large enough to reject the stationarity of the price–dividend ratio at the 1 percent level for FTSE. Therefore, stock markets as represented by S&P500 and FTSE, seem to be irrational by viewing conventional price–dividend ratios.




The adjusted price–dividend ratio, i.e., the ratio adjusted by the capitalization rate and dividend growth, is stationary for FTSE, judged by the Kuznets cycle yields crk15t
                     .

                        3
                        We have also performed tests excluding the latest financial crisis period. The results are not qualitatively different, available upon request. This indicates that viewing bubbles in a short period or as a short periophenomenon is inappropriate.
                      As reported in Table 2b, both ADF and PP tests reject the null of a unit root in crk15t
                      at the 5 percent level; and the KPSS test cannot reject the stationarity of crk15t
                      for FTSE. However, the Kuznets cycle yields adjusted price–dividend ratio, crk15t
                      remains non-stationary for S&P500, indicated by the unit root test statistics in Table 2a
                     . Relative to the price–dividend ratio, although both ADF and PP test statistics for crk15t
                      become more negative with larger absolute values, they are still marginally inside the unit root circle. The stock market represented by FTSE is in fact rational, after adopting this more reasonable measure, which adjusts the price–dividend ratio by the capitalization rate with long yields and dividend growth. Nevertheless, the stock market represented by S&P500 still looks irrational after such adjustments, though it becomes less irrational relative to the simply price–dividend ratio.

The price–dividend ratio adjusted by the capitalization rate with the yields on Moody's Baa bonds and dividend growth stays in the non-stationary zone for both S&P500 and FTSE. As indicated in Table 2a, both ADF and PP tests cannot reject the null of unit root in pdcgmd15t
                      for S&P500. The KPSS test seems to suggest that pdcgmd15t
                      is stationary for S&P500 with the specification of an intercept in the time series, and remains non-stationary with the specification of an intercept and trend in the series. For the test results for FTSE in Table 2b
                     , all the test statistics indicate that pdcgmd15t
                      is non-stationary. These results suggest a detachment between the stock market and the bond market, which is confirmed by cointegration test results reported in Tables 3a
                      and 3b
                     .




A stationary price–dividend ratio adjusted by the capitalization rate and dividend growth conforms to a strong form of rationality in the stock market. Now we further test whether these two markets are rational in their weak form. That is, we test whether the price–dividend ratio is cointegrated with the capitalization rate, without a one to one proportionate relationship. It is evident from Table 3a that the S&P500 market is rational in its weak form, indicated by a confirmed cointegration relationship between the price–dividend ratio and the Kuznets cycle capitalization rate, crk15t
                     . The λ
                     max statistic is 13.5098, which rejects the null of none cointegration vector with a significant p-value of 0.0195; and the trace statistic is 14.7283, which rejects the null of none cointegration vector with a significant p-value of 0.0194. That is, there is one cointegration vector for the price–dividend ratio and the capitalization rate with Kuznets cycle yields. Given a rational FTSE market in its strong form in terms of the Kuznets cycle capitalization rate, it is logical that the FTSE market is also rational in its weak form with the Kuznets cycle capitalization rate, indicated by Table 3b. The λ
                     max statistic is 12.5854, which rejects the null of none cointegration vector with a significant p-value of 0.0287; and the trace statistic is 13.5025, which rejects the null of none cointegration vector with a significant p-value of 0.0316. These confirm that there is one cointegration vector for the price–dividend ratio and the Kuznets cycle capitalization rate. Both Tables 3a and 3b report no cointegration relationships between the price–dividend ratio and the capitalization rate adopting the yields on Moody's Baa bonds, for S&P500 and FTSE respectively. These confirm the detachment between the stock market and the bond market. Since there exists no fundamental, bounding relationship between stock returns, reflected in stock prices and dividend yields, and bond yields, it is not desirable to adopt bond yields to proxy for the capitalization rate of stocks.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

A new type of the present value model has been proposed and empirically tested in this paper. A binding relationship, the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income, is revealed, which is then proven appropriate in practice. It has been demonstrated that a non-stationary income-value ratio does not necessarily rule in rational bubbles. The right criterion should be the stationarity of the value–income ratio adjusted by yields of the asset and growth in income. Incorrectly perceived market behavior distorts the formation of the behavior of investors and all users of financial and accounting information, and vice versa. Obsession with the simple ratio may have serious consequences, impact in a distorted way on markets, corporations, individuals and society as a whole.

Two empirical cases demonstrate the application of the new measures for examining stock market rationality in the strong form and the weak form. It has been made known that the stock market represented by FTSE conforms to a strong form of rationality, which encompasses the weak form of rationality. The stock market represented by S&P500 appears to be rational to a lesser extent though. While this market is rational in the weak form, it is not rational in the strong form. That is, a bounding relationship exists between the price–dividend ratio and the capitalization rate for both FTSE and S&P500. The difference between the two markets is that the bounding relationship is a one to one proportionate relationship for FTSE, but it is not a one to one proportionate relationship for S&P500.

The study advocates a long-term view on investment thereby. Our model is derived with long-term yields or long rates, rather than short rates, or one period rates of return found in previous studies. This long-term view on stock markets and investment gives rise to a new perspective on stock market rationality and implied risk. In our cases, this long-term view alleviates timid investors in market downturns, which would otherwise go down further and further; and this long-term view cools down the market in booming times, which would otherwise rise and rise until a bubble is formed and bust. All in all, this long-term view lessens the severity of a potential financial crisis, if and when it takes place.
