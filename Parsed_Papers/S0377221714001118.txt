                  Directional distance functions provide very flexible tools for investigating the performance of Decision Making Units (DMUs). Their flexibility relies on their ability to handle undesirable outputs and to account for non-discretionary inputs and/or outputs by fixing zero values in some elements of the directional vector. Simar and Vanhems (2012) and Simar, Vanhems, and Wilson (2012) indicate how the statistical properties of Farrell–Debreu type of radial efficiency measures can be transferred to directional distances. Moreover, robust versions of these distances are also available, for conditional and unconditional measures. Bădin, Daraio, and Simar (2012) have shown how conditional radial distances are useful to investigate the effect of environmental factors on the production process. In this paper we develop the operational aspects for computing conditional and unconditional directional distances and their robust versions, in particular when some of the elements of the directional vector are fixed at zero. After that, we show how the approach of Bădin et al. (2012) can be adapted in a directional distance framework, including bandwidth selection and two-stage regression of conditional efficiency scores. Finally, we suggest a procedure, based on bootstrap techniques, for testing the significance of environmental factors on directional efficiency scores. The procedure is illustrated through simulated and real data.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In productivity and efficiency analysis, most of theoretical and empirical studies have been based on the Farell–Debreu radial oriented measures (Farrell, 1957, Debreu, 1951, Shephard, 1970). The basic idea was to gauge how much the outputs should be increased proportionally (maximal attainable value), given the level of the inputs used, to reach the efficient frontier. Alternatively, mainly when the outputs are not under the control of the DMUs, like in some service industries, one could analyze how much a firm should reduce its inputs proportionally, given the level of outputs it is producing.

Later, directional distance functions have been introduced (see Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1996, 1998, Färe & Grosskopf, 2004, Färe, Grosskopf, & Margaritis, 2008) to generalize the radial input and output distance functions. A directional distance function projects the input–output vector onto the technology frontier in a direction given by a vector d.
                        1
                        “Directional distance functions” is the terminology used in Chambers et al. (1996, 1998) and Färe et al. (2008). For sake of simplicity we will rather refer, as in our title, to the shorter “directional distances” terminology.
                     
                     
                        1
                      It encompasses indeed both the input and the output oriented radial measures as special cases when some elements of the directional vector d are fixed at zero.

Recently, Simar and Vanhems (2012) have shown that by choosing an appropriate probabilistic formulation of the production process (as initiated by Cazals, Florens, & Simar, 2002), all the known statistical properties of the nonparametric estimators of the radial efficiency scores were easily adapted to the FDH nonparametric estimators of the directional distance functions. They provided also robust versions of these estimators, based on the order-m partial frontiers (Cazals et al., 2002) and order-
                        
                           α
                        
                      quantile frontiers (Daouia & Simar, 2007). Finally, Simar and Vanhems (2012) only sketch how conditional directional distances could be defined in this framework, without providing any information about their computational implementation. Furthermore, Simar et al. (2012) analyze the statistical properties of the DEA estimators of directional distances. Statistical inference for individual directional distances was derived in these papers, and it implies the use of bootstrap methods.

Interestingly, the great flexibility of the directional distances rests in their ability to handle non-discretionary inputs and/or outputs by simply setting at zero any subset of the vector d. The only constraint is that the vector d should not be equal to zero for all its components.

Another important aspect for the practitioner in production analysis is to investigate the impact of environmental-external factors on the production process. Recently, Bădin et al. (2012) have developed a methodology initiated by Daraio and Simar (2005, 2007) for this specific purpose. Their approach uses conditional efficiency measures (see Bădin, Daraio, & Simar, 2014 for a recent survey of available techniques). All these approaches, however, use traditional radial measures.

In this paper we combine the tools recently developed by Simar and Vanhems (2012) and Bădin et al. (2012) by adapting the methodology for detecting the impact of external-environmental variables on the production process to the directional distance framework. Our contribution is thus fourfold.
                        
                           –
                           First we operationalize, by explicating the algorithms, the computation of directional distance estimates, where Simar and Vanhems (2012) were only mentioning the possibility of extension, without giving any computational details. In particular, we provide a practical procedure for computing FDH estimates of directional distances and their robust versions when some of the elements of the directional vector are zeros (both in inputs and/or in outputs).
                                 2
                                 To save space, we limit the presentation to the case of FDH and quantile frontiers. This can be adapted without much difficulty to the order-m partial frontier cases. We summarize in Appendix B the main steps for the order-m cases.
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           

Second, we make explicit the computations for the conditional distance estimates, including their robust versions. By doing this, we particularize to conditional directional distances the procedure for selecting the appropriate bandwidth, suggested by Bădin, Daraio, and Simar (2010).

Third, we adapt the methodology for measuring the impact of environmental variables implemented so far for radial oriented efficiency scores (Bădin et al., 2012) to the directional distance context. This includes the appropriate second stage regression to explore the effect of external variables on the expected efficiency scores.

Finally, we provide a test for assessing the significance of the effect of external variables on the expected efficiency scores. This test adapts a bootstrap methodology suggested for traditional nonparametric regression to this particular context. Specifically, we show how a consistent bootstrap test can be implemented by working with order-
                                 
                                    α
                                 
                               quantile frontiers. The procedure is illustrated with some simulated data sets and with a real data set on Mutual Funds. We analyze the role of Market Risk on the mean efficiency in a simple Mean–Variance model.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic notation for directional distances and their robust versions. In Section 3 we illustrate how to compute the FDH nonparametric estimators of directional distances when some elements of the direction d are set at zero. Then Section 4 gives all the details for computing conditional directional distances and their robust versions. The significance test for the external factors, based on bootstrap methods, is explained in Section 5. Section 6 illustrates the proposed procedure with some data sets. The bootstrap algorithm (including the double bootstrap) is detailed in Appendix A. Section 7 summarizes the main findings and concludes the paper.

                        ), we can recover the traditional Farrell–Debreu output (resp. input) radial distance. The flexibility of this approach rests on the fact that we might have some elements of the vector

                         that can be set at zero. This is the case when one wants to focus the analysis on distances to the frontier along certain particular paths or, for instance, when some inputs or outputs are non-discretionary, or not under the control of the manager. The usefulness of selecting zero elements in the directional vectors is not only to allow to handle input and output orientations but also to handle exogenously fixed inputs or outputs. Banker and Morey (1986) show how to achieve this when using Farrell type efficiency measures. They give the example of units willing to estimate their input savings and having to deal with some inputs that they do not control (like e.g., level of advertising and number of competitors, see Banker and Morey for a detailed discussion). These inputs are thus exogenously fixed and it is not meaningful to reduce them. Banker and Morey (1986) also give an example of exogenously fixed outputs (like e.g. check cashing in transactions in a bank, which is a purely gratis service function, so the banks try to maximize the outputs that are under their own control). We could also consider the case of bad outputs that we do not want to maximize (see Simar & Vanhems, 2012 for a discussion).

An important point to note is that the efficient frontier is uniquely defined by the boundary of the attainable set T (where all the inputs and outputs are involved), but the distance to the frontier depends on the chosen direction. In particular, in the optimization (2.3), some inputs or outputs could not be involved because they have zero elements in the direction vector, but the corresponding inputs and outputs are real inputs and outputs that determine the attainable set T. So this is different from just ignoring these inputs or outputs in the analysis. We illustrate the effects of zero elements in the direction vector, in a simple example in Section 6.1.

For a discussion about the choice of a direction, see Färe et al. (2008). The direction can be different for each unit (like in the radial cases) or it can be the same for all the units. Färe et al. (2008) argue that a common direction would be a kind of egalitarian evaluation reflecting a kind of social welfare function. Researchers often select in the latter case

Quantile frontiers for evaluating the performance of DMUs have been introduced in the full multivariate setup by Daouia and Simar (2007), by using (input or output) oriented radial measures. Their adaptation to directional distances is due to Simar and Vanhems (2012) and is quite natural after the representation given in (2.4) and exploiting the link between directional and hyperbolic distances.

                           Note the unfortunate typos around formula (51) in Simar and Vanhems (2012). The correct formulation, using similar notations is given in Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3). Note that the results in the empirical section of Simar and Vanhems use the correct formulae.

It may be useful for practitioners to measure, in original units of the inputs and of the outputs, the estimated distance of a DMU from the frontier. This permits us to appreciate the efforts to be achieved in increasing the outputs and decreasing the inputs to reach the efficient frontier. For the full frontier this measure is given by what we call the “gaps” to efficiency.

                           Sometimes researchers use the term “slacks” in place of “gaps”. In the literature, slacks appear when a part of the frontier is Farrell (radially) efficient but not necessarily Pareto efficient. The slacks is, e.g. the amount of an input we can still decrease (i.e. staying in T) keeping the other inputs at their level. So the concept we use here is different and we suggest to use the terminology “gaps”, because it is really the gap that is missing for a firm to reach the frontier in the chosen direction.

                         provides the same information but when translated in terms of the real input/output values via the gaps calculations, it may appear more evidently that the point is lying far away from the other units in the sample.

Here we want to introduce in the production model exogenous variables or external, environmental factors 
                           
                              Z

                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    r
                                 
                              
                           
                        . These variables are neither inputs nor outputs, and they are not under the direct control of the manager. However, they may influence the production process. A natural way for introducing these variables has been initiated by Cazals et al. (2002) and extended to define conditional measures by Daraio and Simar (2005).

Moreover, so far, no indication has been given for the bandwidth selection, nor for cases where there are directions with zero values and for robust (

                           We focus the presentation for the case of continuous variables Z, but as pointed in Bădin et al. (2010), it is easy to adapt the computations to the case of discrete or categorical variables, by using special kernels (see Li & Racine, 2007). However, for the particular case of full frontier, as explained in Daraio, Simar, and Wilson (2010), smoothing the discrete variable does not help because we estimate a support of random variable and not a mean or whatsoever. It is for the same reason that the kernel used in (4.1) has to be with compact support. For full frontier, we have to treat each subgroups determined by a categorical variable separately. For an ordered discrete variable taking a large number of value, we can treat it as a continuous variable.

                        Bădin et al. (2010) provide a way of selecting optimal bandwidths in the case of radial input (or output) oriented measures. In our case here, since we use the joint probability on inputs and outputs, conditional on Z, we can directly apply the optimal procedure suggested by Hall, Racine, and Li (2004), providing optimal bandwidths for the conditional probability distribution function (pdf) of

                           This is a standard problem in nonparametric density estimation and is obtained by Least Squares Cross Validation (LSCV). For instance, the np package in R, Hayfield and Racine (2008), provides such algorithm.

Here we adapt the methodology described in details in Bădin et al. (2012, 2014) for radial oriented distances, to the directional distances case. When using Farrell or Shephard radial measures of efficiencies, the ratio of the conditional to unconditional efficiency scores is quite natural. For instance, the shift of the frontier at a point 
                           
                              (

                         in the output direction can be measured by the ratio of the modulus of projection of

                         has a tendency to increase or to decrease with z. An increasing trend indicates a bigger negative shift with larger values of z, so z has a negative effect on the attainable set. On the contrary if there is a tendency of

To summarize, some potential shift observed with (4.14) could be enhanced (or reduced) if the effect on the distribution of the inefficiencies captured by (4.16) is different. So, the analysis and comparison of unconditional and conditional efficiency estimates, both with large

                           It may be worth to mention the work of Mastromarco and Simar (2014) who explore such analysis in great details in a macroeconomic application, including also dynamic effects (the effect of time) in the conditional measures.

In Bădin et al.

Their analysis can certainly be adapted here for building confidence intervals for

                        , is to provide a tool allowing to investigate the effect of z on the mean of the conditional directional distances. This is in the spirit of the so called two-stage regression approaches, where the estimated unconditional efficiency scores (input or output oriented) are regressed, in a second stage, against the Z variables. However we know from Simar and Wilson (2007, 2011) that this has a meaning only under the “separability” assumption, which assumes that the frontier of the attainable set does not depend on the values of z.

                         for all z. This assumption is very restrictive and often unrealistic. Daraio et al. (2010) suggest a bootstrap procedure for testing the separability condition, they used Farrell input or output efficiency measures, but of course we could use the directional distances in the same way.

As indicated in Bădin et al. (2012), the use of the estimated conditional efficiency scores for this second stage regression, does not require this restrictive assumption. We can evidently do the same here with conditional directional distances. Therefore, the flexible second stage regression can be written as the following location-scale nonparametric regression model:

                         can be viewed as the remaining part of the efficiency when its dependence on Z has been removed. They can be used for ranking units even when they are confronted to different environmental conditions measured by Z. Finally, they can be interpreted according to Bădin et al. as “pure” or “managerial” efficiency measures. We discuss in the next section some issues of statistical inference in these models and how the bootstrap can help to test the significance of Z.

One would be very happy to derive a procedure for testing if the effect of Z (or some components of Z) are significant on the average efficiency scores. Testing the significance of some elements of Z in the nonparametric regression of

                      would have been available. This could indeed be achieved by applying the bootstrap procedure described in Racine (1997). The procedure is seemingly simple. To summarize, the local linear estimators of the regression are used to estimate the local derivatives with respect to any selected element of Z and a test statistic is built on the average of the square of those derivatives. Finally by bootstrapping the re-centered residuals of the nonparametric regression constrained by the null hypothesis, a p-value is approximated by using the percentiles of the bootstrap distributions of the chosen statistic. This procedure is correct when the dependent variable of the regression is observed which is the usual situation.

So the simple bootstrap described in Racine cannot be used here because it ignores the noise introduced by this first stage estimation and so, underestimates (in the bootstrap world) the sampling variation of the nonparametric regression estimates. This approach is in general not consistent, in particular if the noise introduced at the first stage estimation of

                      is larger than the noise due to the second stage nonparametric regression. The procedure is complicated because the nonparametric estimators of the efficiency scores are plagued by the curse of dimensionality. As pointed above, the asymptotic properties of the individual efficiency estimators at fixed points 
                        
                           (

                      are well established, but the analysis of statistics which are functions of these estimators evaluated at random points becomes more complicated. The problem comes mainly from the bias of the resulting statistic which does not disappear at the appropriate rate compared to the variance of the statistic. Kneip, Simar, and Wilson (2014) illustrate this problems for a simple average of DEA and FDH efficiency scores and also for weighted averages of these scores (by investigating a simple OLS regression of DEA or FDH scores on exogenous factors). The latter procedure described in Kneip et al. for the OLS case, could be adapted here, because local linear (or local constant) are also weighted averages with weights determined by kernel functions, but there is little hope to get sensible results when using full frontier estimates as soon as the number of inputs and outputs 
                        
                           p

                           q
                        
                      is bigger than 2 when FDH estimator is used at the first stage and bigger than 3 when DEA estimator is used at the first stage (see Kneip et al., 2014 for details).

We will now explain how to avoid the plague due to the dimensionality of the input–output space and how to adapt the bootstrap algorithm described in Racine (1997) to our setup here, explaining why this bootstrap is consistent. A solution is indeed to use rather partial quantile frontiers and the order-

                     , rates of convergence not depending of the number of inputs and outputs. Only the dimension of Z will play a role for the rates of convergence of the efficiency scores but, as explained below, this will not hurt for the second stage regression of interest. Hence, we test the significance of Z on the average efficiency

We know from Cazals et al. (2002), Daouia and Simar (2007), Jeong et al. (2010) and Simar and Vanhems (2012) that the conditional efficiency estimates for partial frontiers share similar properties than the unconditional ones, where the sample size n is replaced by the “effective” one in nonparametric estimation, i.e.

The same is true for the partial frontiers of order-m (see Cazals et al., 2002) and for the full frontier estimates (see Jeong et al., 2010). So, we note that for order-

Finally, it has to be noted that, as pointed in Racine (1997), we can improve the performance of test (both size and power) by using a pivotal version of the test statistics

                      can be estimated by an inner loop in the bootstrap algorithm. This is known in the literature as the “double bootstrap”. The reader is referred to the detailed algorithm in Appendix A.

In this section we first illustrate, in a simple simulated example, the effects of choosing a directional vector with some elements equal to zero. We then illustrate how the testing procedure proposed in the previous section works with 3 simulated samples and with a real data set to test the effect of market risk on the performance of mutual funds.

To make the example simple allowing for pictures in two dimensions, suppose all the units produce the same amount of an output Y (say

By inspecting Fig. 1 we see the importance of choosing the directional vector. For the points A and B, the efficient measures vary with the chosen direction; for A we have

                         (radial), 0.5997 (horizontal) and 0.4070 (vertical). It is more informative to evaluate in terms of real input values the efforts of the two units to reach the frontier, according to the chosen direction. This is given by the gaps, summarized in Table 1
                        . Suppose that the input

                         on Z would be meaningless providing a wrong information (see Simar & Wilson, 2007, 2011, for a detailed discussion). For DGP2, as expected we recover the shape of the influence of Z on the average efficiency levels, the effect being more important at 
                           
                              Z

Certainly, a visual inspection of these pictures is a good tool; nevertheless, a formal test is even better. By using our bootstrap algorithm we obtain the p-values (with

                         and

                        ) reported in Table 2
                        . We should not reject the null hypothesis (no effect of Z) for DGP1 and DGP3. On the contrary, we should reject the null for DGP2, at any reasonable level given that the p-values calculated for DGP2 are very small. This is exactly what we expected. We remark that in these examples, the double bootstrap and the simple bootstrap provide very similar estimates of the p-values.

We illustrate now the methodology with a real data set. We have data on the Aggressive-Growth (AG) category of US Mutual Funds data collected by Morningstar, updated at May 2002. We concentrate our analysis on 129 AG funds previously analyzed in Daraio and Simar (2006) and in Bădin et al. (2010, 2014), where more details on the data are given. These studies used input-oriented radial efficiency scores because most output (return) have negative values and so output oriented measures were not appropriate when using radial, multiplicative, efficiency scores. Simar and Vanhems (2012) uses the same data set to estimate directional distances (with a common direction for all units, including both inputs and outputs). They derive individual bootstrap confidence intervals for full frontier but also their robust versions for partial frontiers (order-m and order-
                           
                              α
                           
                         quantile frontiers).

Here we will rather focus on the effect of the Market Risk (Z) on the performance of the funds by using directional distances where both inputs and outputs are considered together. Given the limited number of data points 
                           
                              (
                              n
                              =
                              129
                              )
                           
                         we restrict our analysis to the classical Mean–Variance framework. In fact we use as output Y the Total Return and as input X, a measure of the volatility, i.e. the standard deviation of Return. Market risks reflects the percentage of a funds movements that can be explained by movements in its benchmark index. It is calculated on a monthly basis, based on a least-squares regression of the funds returns on the returns of the funds benchmark index. We use as in Simar and Vanhems (2012) a common direction for evaluating all the funds:

                        ). Hence, the picture is clearer: for many levels (higher than 0.06) we would reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the effect of Market Risk seems to be significant. Certainly, having more data would give an even clearer picture.

We provide all the detailed algorithms to compute conditional and unconditional distances when some elements of the directional vector are fixed at zero. We describe how the methodology proposed in Bădin et al. (2012) for radial measures can be adapted to directional distances. We detail in particular how to select the bandwidth in the context of conditional directional distances and how to make a sensible two-stage regression in this framework.

Finally, we provide a formal test of significance of external-environmental factors on the average conditional efficiency. This test adapts a bootstrap methodology suggested for usual nonparametric regression. We show how a consistent bootstrap test can be implemented by working with order-

Order-m partial frontiers have been introduced by Cazals et al. (2002) for the Farrell radial efficiency measures and extended to hyperbolic distance functions in Wilson (2011). Simar and Vanhems (2012) have shown how to adapt the definition in the case of directional distances and suggest an algorithm based on a Monte-Carlo approximation of an integral to compute the nonparametric estimator. The algorithm is summarized as follows and we show how to adapt the algorithm for the conditional case (following the ideas proposed in Daraio & Simar (2005, 2007)).

The algorithm for the unconditional case is adapted from Simar and Vanhems (2012). It is as follows. With the notations of Section 3.2, define

For the conditional case, the algorithm is based on Daraio and Simar (2005, 2007). The only difference with the unconditional case described above is that the random samples of size m drawn in step (i) of the first stage of the algorithm are now replaced by.
