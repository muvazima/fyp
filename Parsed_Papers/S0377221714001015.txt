                  This paper presents a stochastic model that evaluates the value of real-time shipment tracking information for supply systems that consist of a retailer, a manufacturer, and multiple stages of transportation. The retailer aggregates demand for a single product from end customers and places orders on the manufacturer. Orders received by the manufacturer may take several time periods before they are fulfilled. Shipments dispatched by the manufacturer move through multiple stages before they reach the retailer, where each stage represents a physical location or a step in the replenishment process. The lead time for a new order depends on the number of unshipped orders at the manufacturer’s site and the number and location of all shipments in transportation. The analytic model uses real-time information on the number of orders unfulfilled at the manufacturer’s site, as well as the location of shipments to the retailer, to determine the ordering policy that minimizes the long-run average cost for the retailer. It is shown that the long-run average cost is lower with real-time tracking information, and that the cost savings are substantial for a number of situations. The model also provides some guidelines for operating this supply system under various scenarios. Numerical examples demonstrate that when there is a lack of information it is better for the retailer to order every time period, but with full information on the status in the supply system it is not always necessary for the retailer to order every time period to lower the long-run average cost.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Advances in information technology now make it possible to obtain data to track order status in real time through all the stages in a supply system. This data can potentially be used to track partial orders and shipments even at the item level. The value of this tracking information is, however, not adequately understood. The lack of a firm understanding can lead to incorrect decisions on when, where, and to what extent these technologies should be deployed, presenting a challenge – and an opportunity – for quantitative methods to model and analyze the value of real-time information.

This paper develops a stochastic model to evaluate the value of real-time order tracking information in a supply system. The supply system consists of a retailer, a manufacturer, and multiple stages of transportation. The retailer aggregates demand for a single product from his end customers and places orders on the manufacturer. The replenishment process between the manufacturer and the retailer is not instantaneous.

There are delays incurred at the manufacturer’s site and there are transportation delays. The manufacturer’s lead time, the time it takes the manufacturer to fulfill an order placed by the retailer, is a random variable that is affected by the number of orders outstanding at the manufacturer’s site. Products shipped by the manufacturer pass through a series of transportation stages before the retailer receives them. Each transportation stage can represent a physical location for shipments or a step in the delivery process. During a given time period each shipment moves through a random number of stages in the supply system. The transportation lead time for a shipment is a random variable that depends on the distribution of shipments at the various stages. The total lead time is the sum of the manufacturing and the transportation lead times.

The stochastic model presented in this paper analyzes the long-run average cost for the retailer based on the orders he places with the manufacturer each time period. The retailer uses “real-time” information to decide how much to order in the sense that his decision is made based on the state of the system at that point in time. The model can be used to provide guidelines for operating this supply system under various scenarios.

The model also quantifies the value of real-time order tracking information in terms of the associated cost savings. The cost savings with real-time tracking information is substantial for a number of scenarios. The cost savings gained by the retailer from the use of such tracking information can be shared with the manufacturer.

The presence of real-time tracking information also affects the manner in which the retailer places orders on the manufacturer. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that when there is a lack of information it is better for the retailer to order every time period, but with full information on the status in the supply system it is not always necessary to order every time period to lower the long-run average cost.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The value of sharing information in a supply chain has been widely acknowledged and the literature on supply chain information sharing is growing rapidly (see, for instance, Dejonckheere, Disney, Lambrecht, & Towill, 2004; Gaur, Giloni, & Seshadri, 2005, Kim, Chatfield, Harrison, & Hayya, 2006). Most of the work has, however, focused on the value of demand information.

A small body of work studies the value of upstream information, such as information on the supplier’s inventory status and order lead times (see, for example, Croson & Donohue, 2006; Jain & Moinzadeh, 2005; Li, Lin, Wang, & Yan, 2006; Whitt, 1999). For example, Croson and Donohue investigate the well-known bullwhip effect when inventory information is shared across a supply chain. However, most of the papers that address the value of sharing supply information mostly focus on uncertainties caused by the production or inventory condition at the supplier. The above referenced papers, for example, do not consider how uncertainties in the shipping process or the manufacturing processes affect lead times.


                     Choi, Li, and Wei (2013) discuss the topic of sharing information between the supplier and the retailer in a two-echelon supply chain. They model the supply chain using a Bayesian approach to explore the effects of forecast updating on the supplier and retailer for the case where there is a returns policy. Zolfagharinia and Haughton (2012) examine the value of information sharing in outsourcing logistics activities. They rely on procedures that use integer linear programming with exhaustive enumeration and they apply analysis of variance to data obtained from numerical experiments to help managers select logistics service providers under full and no information sharing. These models, too, assume that uncertainties in the shipping process do not affect lead times.


                     Kaman, Savasaneril, and Serin (2013) study a manufacturing shop floor and quantifies the value of using imperfect shop floor information for quoting production lead times using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model. They show that the value of information increases with increasing inaccuracy in the data.


                     Song and Zipkin (1996) allow the lead time to depend on an exogenous system, modeled as a Markov chain, which is assumed to be independent of the demand and of outstanding orders. A state-dependent, base-stock inventory policy is shown to be optimal for the inventory model. The optimal policy has the same structure as in standard models, but its parameters depend on the supply conditions. The paper by Song and Zipkin assumes that order lead times are independent of the locations of outstanding orders.

The paper by Chen and Yu (2005) analyzes the value of lead time information in a single-location inventory system consisting of a supplier and a retailer. Assuming that the lead time is modeled as a Markov chain, this paper quantifies the value of lead time to the retailer under two information scenarios: whether or not the supplier shares lead time information with the retailer.

The papers by Song and Zipkin (1996) and Chen and Yu (2005) only model shipment congestion implicitly by simply regulating the characteristics of lead time distributions. For example, in Chen and Yu (2005), the transition matrix of the Markov chain that models the lead time is restricted to a semi-upper triangular form to ensure no shipment crossovers. This restriction leads to the invariance of the lead time distribution with or without shipment congestions.


                     Liu, Srinivasan, and Vepkhvadze (2009) model a supply system with multiple stages between a manufacturer and a retailer. A stochastic model is used to evaluate the value of real-time shipment tracking information in a supply system with a manufacturer that fulfills demand from a retailer for a single product using a periodic review, order-up-to-level inventory control policy. This paper models shipment congestions explicitly so that the lead time has different distributions depending on whether or not shipment congestion is present. However, Liu et al. assume that the manufacturer has unlimited capacity and is able to fulfill any order immediately. In addition, it is assumed that the retailer orders every time period.

The current paper studies a supply system where the manufacturer has limited ability to ship orders immediately. Also the retailer does not necessarily order every time period. There are multiple stages in the supply system between the manufacturer and the retailer. The shipment congestion in the supply, as well as the number of unfulfilled orders at the manufacturer’s site, are modeled explicitly so that the lead time has different distributions depending on the number of orders still outstanding at the manufacturer’s site and on the congestion experienced by a shipment in transit in the supply system. The paper shows that real-time information on the location of outstanding orders is valuable and quantifies this value under different information scenarios.

The supply system has a manufacturer who supplies a retailer through a transportation channel. The retailer aggregates demand for a single product and places orders with the manufacturer using a periodic review, state-dependent, order-up-to-level inventory control policy. Demand placed on the retailer by customers is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over time. Products shipped by the manufacturer pass through a number of transportation stages before they reach the retailer’s site.

The supply status in this system is determined by the orders outstanding at the manufacturer’s site and by the status of orders in transit that have not yet reached the retailer’s site. The lead time for the retailer is the sum of two components:
                        
                           (a)
                           The manufacturing lead time, which is the time period from the instant an order is placed with the manufacturer until it is shipped from the manufacturer’s site. This lead time is a random variable that can be affected by the number of orders outstanding at the manufacturer’s site at the time the order is placed.

The transportation lead time, which is the time period from the instant an order is shipped from the manufacturer until the shipment is received by the retailer. This lead time is a random variable that depends on the locations of shipments already in transit at the time the order is shipped.

The number of stages a shipment moves in one time period also depends on the movement of shipments ahead of it. Shipments are not allowed to crossover; that is, they are not allowed to cross shipments ahead of them.

The no crossover requirement models a variety of situations and Axsater (2000, p. 74) notes that this assumption simply reflects common practice. For example a well-known automobile assembly facility in the US requires its seat suppliers to deliver seats in a set sequence to match up with the final assembly facility schedule. Such a sequencing requirement forces the supplier to disallow any crossovers during shipment. One of the authors of this paper has worked with a local medical supplies provider that supplies products to regional hospitals using a distributor followed by a third-party logistics provider, where time-dependent requirements require that orders are handled and delivered to the next step (transportation stage) in the same sequence.

Crossovers are also very unlikely when products are moved by railroad. Prater, Markus, and Smith (2001) describe the following case study on VAI (a subsidiary of VA Technologie AG, Austria), a large international producer of steel products. Seeking an expansion of its production capabilities, VAI set up a joint venture with steel mills in the Ural Mountains of Russia. This operation is coordinated from VAI’s offices in Austria. The joint venture allows VAI to deal with increased demand in steel while keeping costs fairly low. However, VAI has to deal with the transportation difficulties. Prater et al. state that “The steel is first transported by rail from the Ural in Russia to Odessa, Ukraine on the Black Sea, then by ship to Southeast Asia. … To track the progress of shipments, VAI hires people to observe various points of the rail line. As each train passes by, the observer notes the apparent loads of the rail cars (in order to check for theft) and sends a telegram to VAI giving the train’s location. This is the ‘information system.’” In the context of the current paper, these observation points correspond to the stages in the supply system.

It is noted that whereas for the last mentioned example the presence of observers at various stages in the supply system could conceivably result in some operating cost, such real-time information can, in general, be obtained with minimal costs these days with modern technologies such as radio frequency identification devices. In the supply system studied in the current paper, the following sequence of events takes place during each time period:
                        
                           (a)
                           At the start of each time period, the retailer receives zero or more shipments from the supply system against orders placed in earlier periods.

The retailer fulfills customer demand to the extent possible with inventory on hand and updates his inventory level. Unsatisfied customer demand is backlogged.

The retailer next reviews his inventory on hand and the total supply status and decides whether to order, and if so what the order quantity should be. It is assumed that retailer orders are conveyed immediately to the manufacturer, but the manufacturer can take multiple time units to process the order.

The manufacturer processes orders on a first-come-first-served basis and ships any orders that have completed processing. Clearly no shipments take place if there are no orders ready to ship. All completed orders ready to ship are aggregated and dispatched in one shipment.

Shipments against orders move downstream in the same sequence as the order in which the retailer places the orders, through multiple transportation stages. These shipments do not cross each other while in transit. In other words they are not allowed to overtake other shipments already in transit.

The supply system described above is analyzed with a stochastic model to determine the optimal cost of operating the system. The retailer deals with two types of costs: the holding cost for any positive inventory on hand at the end of each time period, and the shortage cost incurred whenever a demand is not met. In addition to analyzing the cost of system operation, one item of interest is to determine the value of tracking information that provides real-time data on the status of orders at various stages in the supply system.

It is assumed that the unit holding cost and the unit shortage cost are both constant over time. It is also assumed that the retailer has full knowledge of the mechanics of the supply system and the distribution of customer demand. Liu et al. (2009) study the special case of this model in which the retailer orders every time period and where the manufacturer is able to fulfill each order immediately.

The manufacturer’s production process is governed by a random variable, Ym
                     , which represents the number of unfulfilled orders at the manufacturer’s site at the end of a time period (after any orders are filled) given that there were m unfulfilled orders at the start of that time period including the order placed by the retailer (if any). It is assumed that Ym
                      is independent of the customer demand and of time period t. A limit, N, is assumed on the number of outstanding orders at the manufacturer’s site at the end of each time period. Thus, if the manufacturer starts with N outstanding orders at time t and if the retailer places a new order during that time period, the manufacturer has to ship at least one order by the end of that time period. The number N can model the physical size of the manufacturer’s facility (there is no room to accommodate more than N orders); it can also model the maximum lead time agreed upon between the retailer and the manufacturer (the order cannot take more than N time periods to ship out of the manufacturer’s site).

After an order ships from the manufacturer, it goes through a series of transportation stages before it reaches the retailer. The transportation process to ship an order from the manufacturer to the retailer takes up to K stages, labeled 1,2,…,
                     K, as shown in Fig. 1
                     . Each stage can represent a physical location or a step in the process. Orders shipped by the manufacturer (stage 0 in the process) progress through zero or more stages during each time period and are finally received by the retailer at stage K
                     +1.

Shipments against individual orders are not allowed to cross over in time and so a shipment at a downstream stage can block movement of an order from upstream stages. More specifically, a shipment against an order can only move forward as far as the next downstream shipment’s location. When order shipments from upstream stages move to the same downstream stage they merge into a larger shipment and continue to move as one shipment from then onwards until the shipment reaches the retailer.

The number of stages a shipment at stage k moves during time period t is governed by the status of other shipments in the system, and an exogenous i.i.d. random variable, Xk
                     , that is independent of customer demand and of period t. The new location of the shipment is updated at the start of time period t
                     +1. The movement of the shipment at stage k is independent of the location of shipments at stages upstream from it, but is dependent on the status of shipments at downstream stages due to possible shipment congestions. Let pk,x
                      represent the probability that the shipment at stage k will move to stage x in a single time period, if shipment congestions are absent. Thus, Xk
                      has the following distribution:

The shipment movement function, Mk
                     , models shipment congestion explicitly. If shipments at downstream stages progress slowly, shipments at upstream stages may be blocked and shipment congestion is present. If shipments at downstream stages move fast enough or there are no shipments at an downstream stage, there is no shipment congestion and Xk
                      solely determines the movement of a shipment.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows the possible transitions between two given states, with and without a new shipment. The diagram on the left in this figure shows the transitions with a new shipment while the diagram on the right shows the transitions without a new shipment.

Let m(t) denote the number of orders outstanding at the manufacturer’s site at the end of time period t
                     −1. Note that m(t) can take values from 0 up to N. If the retailer places a new order at the beginning of the time period t the number of orders outstanding at the manufacturer’s site prior to any shipment increases to m(t)+1.

The retailer’s decision to place a new order when the on-hand inventory level is lower than the specified order-up-to-level depends on the supply status

                      if the on-hand inventory is less than the specified order-up-to-level. To ensure that the state (0,0,…,0) is not absorbing, it is assumed that there is a non-zero probability of an order being placed while in this state.

If the inventory on hand, after fulfilling the customer demand, is higher than the specified level for the inventory position, no product is ordered. However, to enable analytic tractability, following Kaplan (1970) and Liu et al. (2009), it is assumed that a pseudo-order is placed for an infinitesimally small amount. This pseudo-order does not affect costs but is considered as outstanding until it is received in a shipment. Although the pseudo-orders do not affect costs, they may hold back real orders. Liu et al. conducted an extensive investigation of the effect of pseudo-orders and conclude that they hold back only a small proportion of the real orders, and only when the demand is very low.

                        Property 1

It is assumed that the retailer adopts a state dependent, myopic order-up-to-level policy. That is, the optimal order-up-to level for each time period is obtained by minimizing the one-period expected cost. For the linear cost structure assumed in this paper, a state-dependent, order-up-to-level policy is optimal; and the optimal policy tends to follow the same qualitative pattern as the simple state-dependent, myopic, base-stock policy (see Song and Zipkin (1996) for details).

Let us assume that the retailer placed an order at the end of some time period t. As he may not order all the time, the next order may not be placed at the end of the time period t

Suppose the retailer does not have any information on the supply status when the current order is placed, and suppose that the retailer uses the limiting distribution of Ts to determine the optimal order-up-to level, which is a constant.

Let Cs
                        (y) denote the long-run average cost for the retailer when the order-up-to level is y, under the assumption that no information is available on the supply status. Thus

This section presents the results of a systematic investigation to provide guidelines for operating the supply system under various system configurations using a wide range of parameters and settings. The analysis is also used to quantify the cost benefits to the retailer provided by real-time tracking information. Note first, that the relative advantage provided by real-time tracking information is fairly small when shipments progress in a rather deterministic manner. This conclusion is based on the following property.
                        Property 2

                              =1 for all 0⩽k⩽K, and the exogenous variable Ym has the distribution

                           K, shipments progress from the manufacturer to the retailer in a completely deterministic manner. With such a progression of orders and shipments, it is observed that, in steady state, there are no orders at the manufacturer’s site besides the one that is received at the beginning of the time period and that every transportation stage is occupied by a shipment. Thus, the limiting distribution of Ts has only one state,

There is only a small probability that no order is made ready for delivery during any time period. However, if the number of unfulfilled orders reaches the maximum, at least one order is produced with probability 1.

It is noted that with the Expedited Production scenario an order is fulfilled in one time period with a 90% probability with these settings, and it is quite unlikely that multiple unfulfilled orders accumulate at the manufacturer’s site.

                              A Batch Production scenario: Under this scenario, most of the production batches made ready for delivery contain two orders. If there are n unfulfilled orders at the manufacturer’s site there is a high probability that two of them are produced and made ready for delivery at a time, leaving behind n

Three modes are considered for deliveries made from the manufacturer’s site: Premium, Priority, and Economy Delivery modes. Under these modes of delivery, the shipper attempts to deliver orders from the manufacturer’s site directly to the retailer’s site with a high, medium, or low probability, respectively. If none of the transportation stages are occupied there is no congestion in the transportation channel, and a shipment dispatched directly to the retailer’s site gets delivered in the next time period. However, if there is congestion in the transportation channel this shipment merges with the shipment at the first occupied stage downstream since orders are not allowed to cross over. Orders that are not delivered directly to the retailer’s site proceed to the first transportation stage. The parameters for the 3 delivery modes are set as follows:
                           
                              •

                                 =0.1.

Priority Delivery mode: p
                                 0,K+1
                                 =0.7 and p
                                 0,1
                                 =0.3.

Economy Delivery mode: p
                                 0,K+1
                                 =0.3 and p

                                 =0.7.

The congestion at the transportation stages is modeled using two settings: the Low-congestion Transportation setting and the High-congestion Transportation setting.

                                 =0.8, or moves two stages downstream with probability pk,k+2

                                 =0.9.

With the High-congestion Transportation setting, shipments take more time to move downstream: pk,k
                                 
                                 =0.5, pk,k+1
                                 
                                 =0.4 and pk,k+2
                                 
                                 =0.1 for 1⩽

                                 =0.5.

With Low-congestion Transportation the expected time a shipment stays in stage k is 1.11, while with High-congestion Transportation a shipment at location k
                        <
                        K stays in that location for an average of two time periods. It is possible to set non-zero values for pi,j
                        
                        , for j
                        
                        >
                        
                        i
                        +2. However, in practice a shipment is less likely to move across multiple stages during a single time period unless some expediting is taking place.

A series of experiments was carried out with these parameter settings for values of K ranging from 1 to 10. The effect of shortage cost was investigated by varying the shortage cost while keeping the holding cost fixed. The demand placed by the customer on the retailer was generated from a normal distribution with different values of μd
                         and σd
                        . For each case the costs, C

                                    C
                                 
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                         are computed. In addition, the value of real-time tracking information, which is the difference in cost between C
                        ∗ and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    C

                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                        , is also computed. This difference is also referred to simply as the cost savings. The different configurations are first studied assuming that the retailer orders every time period, namely,

                                    i
                                 
                              
                              =
                              1
                              ,

                              =

                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              (

                                    K
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The effect of varying ρj
                        , the retailer’s ordering probabilities, is studied subsequently.

The next three sections are organized as follows. Section 6.2 presents the costs of operating the system, with and without real-time tracking information. This section provides insight into how the manufacturing process, the delivery process and the transportation congestion affect the retailer’s cost of operation. The next section, Section 6.3, reveals the value of real-time tracking information. Section 6.4 provides insights on how real-time tracking information helps the retailer place orders more cost-effectively.

A full factorial design was carried out. Some of the results from the experimental design were clearly intuitive but some of them were not, at least at first glance. Consider first the results that are either clearly intuitive or have an intuitive explanation. It was found that the long-run average cost (either with or without real-time tracking information) increases whenever
                           
                              •
                              the number of transportation stages (K) increases,

the shortage cost increases,

the demand variation increases, or

the transportation setting is at High-congestion.

All these results are easy to explain. The High-congestion Transportation setting and higher values of K both tend to increase the lead times, resulting in increased inventory costs for the retailer. High demand variation requires higher levels of inventory to avoid shortages. With high shortage costs the retailer tries to order more every time period. All these situations complicate inventory management and contribute to higher costs.

Some results were less intuitive at first glance. For example, an increase in N, the maximum number of pending shipments at the manufacturer’s site, did not significantly affect the long-run average costs. These costs were also very close for different values of N for both the Expedited and the Batch Production scenario. This result can, however, be explained by observing that the model considers costs only from the retailer’s point of view. Hence, the value of N, the maximum number of unfulfilled orders allowed at the manufacturer’s site, has relatively less influence on the retailer’s cost.

The long run average cost of operation as a function of manufacturer’s production and delivery process was analyzed by considering two sets of parameters:
                           
                              (a)
                              Expedited versus Batch Production scenarios. These two scenarios determine how the manufacturer fulfills the orders and gets them ready for delivery,

Premium versus Priority versus Economy Delivery modes. These modes determine the manner in which the manufacturer attempts to deliver the products to the retailer.


                           Table 2
                            shows which production scenario gives the lower long-run average cost for different shortage costs and demand variations, for the different delivery modes. The letter “E” denotes Expedited Production, and the letter “B” denotes Batch Production.

It is noted that Table 2 does not show the results for the Economy Delivery mode since the Expedited Production scenario always gave a lower cost relative to the Batch Production scenario for this delivery mode. In general, the Expedited Production scenario is more beneficial for the retailer than the Batch Production scenario, but there are a few situations (such as the Premium Delivery mode for a few values of K) where the Batch Production scenario generates a lower long-run average cost for the retailer. Overall, the results show that:
                              
                                 •
                                 With the Economy Delivery mode the Expedited Production scenario always gives lower long-run average costs compared to the Batch Production scenario.

With the Priority Delivery mode the Expedited Production scenario usually gives lower long-run average costs. The exceptions occur for a few cases with the High-congestion Transportation setting and low K values (K
                                    =1, 2, or 3).

With the Premium Delivery mode the production scenario that provides the lower cost alternates between the Expedited Production and Batch Production scenarios. The oscillation between these two production scenarios appears to be the result of interplay between the variation in the delivery process and the congestion in the transportation system as explained next.

To explain the last point, note that the production scenario affects system variation. With Expedited Production, there is a steady stream of orders flowing in the supply system since the manufacturer typically fills an order every time period. The reduced variation allows the Expedited Production scenario to provide a lower cost of operation for a majority of the cases analyzed.

The counterbalancing cases for which the Batch Production scenario provides the lower cost are explained as follows. With Batch Production a new shipment tends to find the system “less congested” compared to Expedited Production as on average there are two time periods between two consecutive shipments and shipments already on their way have two time periods to move forward and clear upstream stages. Thus shipments can move across the transportation stages in a more predictable manner. In such cases it is more likely that a new shipment does not find any congestion in the transportation channel and gets delivered directly to the retailer’s site with the Premium Delivery mode.

Since freight costs are not included in the long-run average cost of inventory, intuition would suggest that long-run average costs will be lower with the Premium Delivery mode since it tries to deliver products directly to the retailer with higher probability compared to the Economy or Priority Delivery modes. However, the results show this is true only for small K and this counter-intuitive behavior is explained as follows. As K increases, the transportation channel has more impact on the system and managing it becomes more complicated. With high values of K, the delivery mode that gives the lowest long-run average cost is the Economy Delivery mode because this delivery mode reduces variation in the system. This mode places more shipments into the first transportation stage rather than trying to deliver these shipments as far into the transportation channel as possible, thus guaranteeing a more steady passage of shipments through the transportation channel.


                           Table 3
                            shows the delivery mode that provides the lowest long-run average cost for the different configurations tested. The letter “P” stands for Premium Delivery mode, and the letter “E” stands for the Economy Delivery mode. The Priority Delivery mode does not appear in this table since it is always cost-dominated by the other two delivery modes.

As the table shows, the Premium Delivery mode gives the lowest long-run average cost for small values of K. In particular, for K
                           =1, the Premium Delivery mode gives the lowest long-run average cost for all settings. However, as the transportation channel becomes longer, the Economy Delivery mode provides better long-run average cost. In particular, for K
                           =9, it gives the lowest long-run average cost for all settings.

It can also be seen from Table 3 that the shortage cost determines how quickly the switch from Premium to Economy Delivery mode takes place as K increases. Also, the Premium Delivery mode stays the most beneficial longer for the High-congestion Transportation setting and the Batch Production scenario. As observed earlier, Batch Production affects congestion and makes the Premium Delivery mode more efficient, especially for small values of K. When there are many transportation stages, the Premium Delivery mode loses its benefit as there is a higher likelihood for a new shipment to be blocked somewhere in the transportation channel.

To summarize the results of the factorial design, the cost of operating the supply system appears to be influenced by two factors: congestion and variation. The Expedited Production scenario tends to reduce variation by fulfilling the retailer orders at a steadier rate. On the other hand, the Batch Production scenario tends to reduce congestion in the system because it typically takes more than one time period to fill the orders; hence it gives more opportunity for the transportation system to clear the shipments in transit. In general, with regard to cost of operation:
                              
                                 •
                                 The Expedited Production scenario performs better than the Batch Production scenario for most of the parameter configurations, especially when the number of transportation stages is small. For larger values of K, the Batch Production scenario provides lower cost when the Premium Delivery mode is used.

The Premium Delivery mode offers a potential advantage in the sense that it attempts to deliver products directly to the retailer. However, it generates more variation in the system, in the process of doing so. Therefore it gives the lowest cost of operation only with K
                                    ⩽4 and relatively low shortage cost. When the transportation channel is long (high K), the Premium Delivery mode performs better with the Batch Production scenario since this scenario tends to reduce congestion in the system.

The Economy Delivery mode is more advantageous to use compared to the other two delivery modes for higher values of K, because it reduces variation in the system and guarantees a steady passage of shipments through the transportation channel.

This section compares the difference in long-run average cost with and without real-time tracking information. With regard to the delivery mode, the cost savings are not significant for the Economy Delivery mode unless the shortage cost is very low. A similar statement holds for the Priority Delivery mode. For both these delivery modes, the cost savings decrease as shortage costs increase. The Premium Delivery mode, however, gives rise to some significant cost savings. With the Premium Delivery mode the cost savings increase for smaller values of the shortage cost (r
                        =1, 5, 10) and then start decreasing after the shortage cost reaches 15. Fig. 4
                         shows some representative results for the Expedited Production scenario.

As Fig. 4 indicates, cost savings are substantial – as high as 64% when r
                        =1, although this result is more academic in the sense that in practice such a low shortage cost seems unlikely. Cost savings are, however, still substantial for higher, more realistic values of r for both production scenarios.


                        Exhibits 1 and 2 in Appendix A provide the results for configurations with K
                        =8 stages, with shortage costs ranging from 5 to 15. These exhibits show that the Expedited Production scenario with Premium Delivery mode and High-congestion Transportation setting gives cost savings of 37.4% for shortage cost r
                        =5 with σd
                        
                        =10. The Batch Production scenario with Priority Delivery mode and the Low-congestion Transportation setting gives a cost savings as high as 38.9% for shortage cost r
                        =5 with σd
                        
                        =10.

These two exhibits also show that the value of real-time information is higher for the Low-congestion Transportation setting than for the High-congestion Transportation setting for the Economy and Priority delivery modes, although that is not the case for the Premium Delivery mode. These results are reflective of all the numerical experiments conducted. In general, the Low-congestion Transportation setting results in a more predictable passage of shipments through the transportation channel allowing for better exploitation of real-time information on shipment status. Intuitively, the impact of real-time information on shipment status diminishes when the system is more unpredictable as is the case with High-congestion Transportation.

In general, again, cost savings with real-time tracking information are more pronounced with a lower demand variation (σd
                        
                        =10) than with a higher demand variation (σd
                        
                        =30). This result also has intuitive appeal. As demand variation increases the impact of real-time information on shipment status diminishes since the system is more unpredictable.

The results also show that cost savings are less pronounced with higher shortage cost r. An immediate explanation for this observation is that expected costs (both with and without real-time tracking information) gradually increase as the shortage cost increases, resulting in a smaller percentage difference in these expected costs. Another reason for the narrowing cost differences is that with higher shortage costs, the retailer tends to hold more inventories, resulting in smaller adjustments on a dynamic basis.

The value of real-time information increases as K increases. Fig. 5
                         shows the cost savings for different values of K for the Low-congestion Transportation setting with the Premium Delivery mode, and the Expedited and Batch Production scenarios with N
                        =2, for σd
                        
                        =10 and σd
                        
                        =30, respectively.

The results of Fig. 5 are reflective of all the numerical experiments conducted with the Premium Delivery mode and they hold for either production scenario. The cost savings are, however, more pronounced with the Low-congestion Transportation setting for the reason explained earlier.

To further investigate the effect of different delivery modes on the cost savings, the following experiment was run. The production and the transportation congestion settings were fixed, and the delivery mode was varied by setting p
                        0
                        
                           ,K
                        
                        +1
                        =0.1*
                        i (and p
                        0,1
                        =1−
                        p
                        0
                        
                           ,K
                        
                        +1) for i
                        =0,1,2,…,9. Fig. 6
                         presents the results.

It is observed from Fig. 6 that when the shortage cost is high (r
                        =30), the best cost saving is achieved with p
                        0

                        =0.9 (Premium Delivery mode). When the shortage cost is low (r

                        =0.7 for the Low-congestion Transportation setting, and at p

                        =0.8 for the High-congestion Transportation setting. These results further strengthen the earlier observation that the value of real-time tracking information increases when Premium Delivery contracts are used.

In summary, these results show that
                           
                              •
                              Real-time tracking information can bring substantial benefits to the retailer.

The value of real-time tracking information decreases with increasing shortage cost as the retailer tends to hold more inventory, resulting in smaller adjustments.

The value of real-time information is higher when the Premium Delivery mode is used.

When the manufacturer uses Batch Production, it is more beneficial to use the Premium Delivery mode.

The value of real-time tracking information increases with the number of stages in the transportation channel for all three delivery modes.

The value of real-time tracking information decreases when demand variation (σd
                                 ) increases or when the congestion setting changes from Low- to High-congestion.

The model allows the retailer to vary his ordering probabilities based on the state of the supply system. This section investigates the expected system cost as a function of these ordering probabilities. The investigation shows that it makes sense for the retailer to order every time period if he does not have full information on the supply status.

The following case-settings are considered, regarding the availability of information:
                              
                                 Case (a): The retailer knows how many orders are at the manufacturer’s site and how many stages are occupied. But he has no information about how orders are being handled at the manufacturer’s site and no information on how orders shipped from the manufacturer’s site move downstream. In other words, he has no information about the behavior of the random variables X and Y. Lacking such information it is assumed that the retailer proceeds on the assumption that any number of orders is equally likely to be shipped during a given time period, and that shipments are equally likely to move to any of the downstream stages.

Case (b): The retailer has information on the number of orders awaiting shipment at the manufacturer’s site and on how shipped orders move downstream (information on the behavior of X). However, he does not have any information on how orders are shipped from the manufacturer’s site (no information about the behavior of Y). He, therefore, proceeds on the assumption that any number of orders is equally likely to be shipped during a given time period.

Case (c): The retailer has information on how orders at the manufacturer’s site are handled (the random variable Y), and he has knowledge on how many stages are occupied. However, he has no information about shipment movement (no information on the behavior of X). Lacking information on X, he assumes that shipments are equally likely to move to any of the downstream stages.

The baseline expected cost is the expected cost that results when the retailer orders every time period. Two ordering approaches are considered:
                              
                                 •
                                 Order according to the number of unshipped orders: set the retailers ordering probabilities to 0 when there is a pre-specified number, i, of unshipped orders at the manufacturer’s site, for i
                                    
                                    =
                                    0,1,…,
                                    N. This provides N
                                    +1 different ordering conditions. This approach is used for cases (a) and (b).

Order according the number of occupied stages: set the retailers ordering probabilities to 0 when there is a pre-specified number, j, of occupied stages, for j
                                    =1,…,
                                    K. This provides K different ordering conditions. This approach is used for cases (a) and (c).

The goal is to find out what probabilities give the retailer the lowest expected cost. Different settings for the number of transportation stages (K) and the maximum number of unshipped orders at the manufacturer’s place (N) are studied. To model the manufacturer’s known shipping policies, the Expedited and Batch Production scenarios are used (see Section 6.1). To model the known delivery and transportation policies the Premium, Priority and Economy Delivery modes are used combined with the High- and Low-congestion Transportation settings (see Section 6.1).

For all cases, the results show that the lowest expected cost is achieved when the retailer orders every time period. The results are in agreement with intuition. When there is a lack of information, it is better for the retailer to protect himself by ordering every time period. Some of these results are shown in Table 4
                            for the case when demand is normally distributed with μd
                           
                           =100, σd
                           
                           =30; and K
                           =6, N
                           =3, h
                           =10, and r
                           =5.
                              
                                 Case (a) in Table 4 shows the results when the retailer has no information on either the shipping policy or the shipment movement. The results show that the retailer should order every time period regardless of the number of occupied stages or the number of unshipped orders. The lowest expected cost is C
                                    ∗
                                    =1090.2. Note that the static policy gives the expected cost 
                                       
                                          
                                             
                                                C
                                             
                                             
                                                s
                                             
                                             
                                                ∗
                                             
                                          
                                          =
                                          1390.2
                                       
                                    , that is higher than C
                                    ∗, further underscoring the observation that a little information is better than no information at all.

Case (b) in Table 4 shows results for the Premium Delivery and Low-congestion Transportation setting with no information from the manufacturer’s side. It is observed that the expected cost gradually increases as the retailer orders less and less frequently.

Case (c) in Table 4 shows results for the Expedited Production scenario with no information on the movement of shipments. Once again, the lowest expected cost is achieved when orders are placed every time period.

To summarize, when there is a lack of information on the supply status, it is better for the retailer to order every time period.

A series of experiments was run for different ordering conditions and different values for K and N for the case where the retailer has complete information on the behavior of the p and q matrices. The results show that the retailer should order every time period for the batch shipment scenario. For the Expedited Production scenario, the results follow the same pattern with the exception of the Premium Delivery mode with the High-congestion Transportation setting. In this special case the results suggest that the retailer should order only when all the stages are empty (when the shortage cost r
                           =5). When the shortage cost is high (r
                           =15) the retailer should order more often, when there are less than K or K
                           −1 occupied stages. This result is in agreement with intuition. When the shortage cost is low, the retailer can wait until the congestion clears out.

As with the Premium Delivery mode p
                           0,
                           
                              K
                           
                           +1
                           =0.9, no congestion in the transportation channel guarantees that the new shipments will reach the retailer’s site basically in one time period. When the shortage cost is higher, the retailer tends to order more often to protect himself from the expected high shortage cost. The results for the High-congestion Transportation setting and the Premium Delivery mode also suggest that the retailer should order only when there are no unshipped orders.


                           Table 5
                            shows some results for the Expedited Production scenario with Premium Delivery mode and the High-congestion Transportation setting, with K
                           =6, N
                           =3, holding cost h
                           =10, shortage cost r
                           =5 and 15, and normally distributed demand with μd
                           
                           =100, σd
                           
                           =30.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents a stochastic model to evaluate the value of real-time information on supply status at both the manufacturer’s process and the transportation channel. In this model the order lead time is assumed to be dependent on the distribution of the locations of outstanding orders and the number of unshipped orders at the manufacturer’s site. Shipment congestions are explicitly modeled.

With the optimal myopic ordering policy, the long-run average cost for the retailer is higher when he does not have any information available. The numerical examples indicate that the cost savings are especially significant when real-time tracking information and the manufacturer’s shipping policies are available. The paper shows that when the retailer has partial or no information, it is better to order every time period. When full information on the supply system is available there are situations where the retailer does not need to order every time period to lower his expected total cost. Instead, the retailer adjusts his ordering policy based on the information available to him.

The paper assumes a myopic ordering policy for the retailer and the shortage cost. It would be of interest to investigate the value of information in case of lost sales. Another assumption in this paper is that orders do not cross in time. Although the model discussed in this paper has the potential to model orders crossovers explicitly, it appears that the lead time does not get affected by the status of shipments in the supply system. As noted by Robinson, Bradley, and Thomas (2001), with order crossovers it is better to use the shortfall distribution instead of the distribution of demand during the lead time. The approach used in this paper has the potential to model the shortfall distribution making it possible to study the order crossover case. It would thus be of interest to apply this approach to the problems addressed by Bradley and Robinson (2005) and Hayya, Bagchi, Kim, and Sun (2008).
