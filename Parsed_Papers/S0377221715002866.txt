                  A number of factors are causing changes in container logistics, particularly for imports into the United States. These include growth and volatility in demands, expansion of new routes (Panama Canal and Northwest Passage), and development of new ports (Prince Rupert and ports on the Mexican west coast). Uncertainty is a major factor confronting logistics for container shipping. A stochastic network-flow model is developed in this study to analyze risk in port throughput as a result of randomness in critical variables in the logistics system for container imports into the United States. The results illustrate the stochastic distribution of container shipments at ports and routes serving the U.S. container market. The derived distributions for port throughput have important implications for port management.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Shipping by containers has transformed global trade and has been more of a driver to globalization than all trade agreements during the previous 50 years (The Economist, 2013). A number of factors are causing major changes in the logistics of container imports, including growth in demands which are subject to uncertainty, expansion of routes (Panama Canal and Northwest Passage
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Despite earlier concerns of not being viable, traffic is increasing on the Northern Sea Route (The Economist, 2012b). In part this is being driven by global warming which is opening the route between Asia and Europe, and in 2012 the number of transits has increased from 4 in 2010 to 46 in 2012 (Cockerham, 2012). This is benefiting from the changing energy trade resulting in part from expansion in the Russian territories shipping Arctic oil and gas to China. Putin has vowed to turn the Northern Sea Route to be one of the world's “key trade routes of international significance in scale.”
                     ), development of new ports (Prince Rupert and ports on the Mexican west coast), and larger ships requiring deeper drafts to be competitive. All of these lead to potential changes in container flows to the U.S. market. Of particular importance is congestion. Allegedly, “less than half of all container vessels arrive in port on schedule” (Bloomberg, 2011, p. 82). And these concerns continue in 2015 with extreme congestion at west coast ports and some shipments being diverted to other ports and routes (Buck, 2015). The Economist (2012a) elaborated on the forthcoming, prospective inter-port competition within the United States as a result of the expanded Panama Canal. Dredging at Eastern ports is being done to accommodate larger ships as well as the anticipated diversion from west-coast ports to serve the eastern and interior markets. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) estimates that U.S. ports are spending $6–8 billion a year in federal, local and private money to modernize and there are 17 port projects being studied for improvements. However Federal policies for port expansion are complicated and dated and concern exists as the United States is “the only industrialized country on the planet that does not have a comprehensive freight strategy” (Holywell, 2012 quoting Robert Puentes). This inter-port competition to expand has been characterized as an “uncoordinated arms race between ports for maritime supremacy” (Chapman, 2012).

A high degree of risk exists for ports, railroads and managers of logistics about container shipping. Most important are the randomness in container demands, fuel costs, ship-lease rates, rail rates, etc. In addition, there are stochastic constraints in port throughput and rail capacity. These factors impact the spatial distribution of container flows. The purpose of this study is to analyze risk for port throughput and rail shipping as a result of the randomness of critical variables in the logistics system for container imports into the United States.

                        The model was of container imports. Exports of containers are relevant but were not possible because of data limitations. Modeling both imports and exports simultaneously is compounded in that there is an imbalance between volumes of exports and imports (e.g., in recent years 67–70 percent of the container trade is for imports, and in the major gateways, imports are 75–80 percent). This imbalance precludes use of any form of equality constraints for imports and exports which would otherwise be an important feature of port flows. This is left as an area of further study. The impacts of not considering exports of containers were accommodated by adjusting port container throughput for the amount of container imports only.
                      A stochastic network flow model for container imports is specified to evaluate these impacts. The model is based on cost minimization and solved using stochastic techniques to measure risks and to analyze the impacts of structural changes.

Other studies have analyzed container shipping. These have several focus areas including infrastructure planning (Lloyd's List DCN, 2009), port expansion (Harrison, Figliozzi, & Walton, 2000; Mercator Transport Group, 2005; Maloni & Jackson 2005a, 2005b among others), port pricing (Bennathan & Walters, 1979; Meersman, Van de Voorde, & Vanelslander, 2003), costs and economies of size (Cullinane & Khanna, 1999; Gao, 1994; Harrison & Figliozzi, 2001; Lim, 1998), and inter-port competition (Bennathan & Walters, 1979; Blonigen & Wilson, 2006, 2008; Ng, 2006; Veldman & Buckmann, 2003; Weigmans, Van Der Hoest, & Notteboom, 2008).

Spatial competition of container shipments has been analyzed in fewer studies (Koiser, 2004; Leachman, 2008; Luo, 2007; Luo & Grigalunas, 2003). Notteboom (2006) evaluated the effect of delays on shipping logistics. Rodriguez-Alvarez, Tovar, and Wall (2011) indicated that port-terminal costs are impacted by demand uncertainty. Impacts of congestion on spatial and inter-port competition were analyzed by Maguire, Ivey, Lipinski, and Golias (2010) and Ilmer (2010). Crainic (2000, 2002) and Crainic and Kim (2007, chap. 8) discussed the interpretation of congestion in the context of network design and network-flow models. Asteris (2009) used discreet event simulation to analyze container flows to the United Kingdom through the English Channel. DeVuyst, Wilson, and Dahl, (2009) analyzed the spatial distribution for grain shipments using a global-chance constraint specification. Wilson, Dahl, and Taylor (2011) included delay functions in a multi-commodity spatial-optimization model. Separate delay costs were used for each Reach (or section) on the Mississippi River system.

Several studies analyze supply-chain problems. Santoso, Ahmed, Goetschalckx, and Shapiro (2005) used the sample average approximation scheme to solve a large-scale stochastic supply chain network problem under uncertainty. Martel and Klibi (2012) created a risk model by generating plausible future scenarios to evaluate and design supply chain networks under uncertainty. Sox and Ishfag (2012) developed multiple-allocation p-hub median approach to integrate with a queuing model of hub operations. Leachman (2008) and Jula and Leachman (2011a, 2011b) used mixed-integer programming models to determine the least-cost supply chain for an importer of containerized products to U.S. regional distribution centers. Their focus was on location decisions and included logistical costs and strategies, including inventory levels, costs, lead times, etc., as well as risk-pooling strategies. Capacity constraints and congestion were not part of the model, and some of the shipping channels were pre-determined, although these areas were suggested for future research. Leachman and Jula (2011, 2012) also analyzed congestion for west-coast imports of containers by estimating dwell times for ports and railways, including these figures in their logistical model for importers’ location decisions.

The model developed in this paper extends these studies in a number of ways and contributes to the literature in several respects. First, it measures variability of factors that cause risk in the supply chain for containers. Second, it quantifies risks related to port throughput. Finally, the results of the stochastic network-flow model are used to compare risk in port throughput under different simulations regarding new ports and routes.

A stochastic network-flow model for containerized imports from northeast Asia and Europe to the United States is specified. The model includes ocean and rail shipping, and ports (U.S., Canadian, and Mexican ports) to meet the spatial distribution of demands, subject to nodal, arc, and related intermodal facility constraints. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the network for container imports to U.S. markets. Volumes handled by ports are affected by many factors, including demand, transportation cost, port and route congestion, etc. Some of these are stochastic and endogenous to our analysis. The logic is to model container flows through the logistics network, e.g., port and route, whereby container flows are determined by costs, technical restrictions, and other relationships under a stochastic environment. Simulation procedures were used along with optimization to derive the distributions of container volume handled by ports and routes under different scenarios. Ultimately, these distributions are used as a measure of risk for port management.

Cost elements in the model include ocean and rail shipping costs as well as the costs related to handling and congestion (see Table 1). Ocean shipping costs for different vessel sizes are included as vessel-strings which allow calls at multiple ports. Congestion costs at ports are derived using queuing theory, are nonlinear, and are determined endogenously. Because the cost function for waiting time has a nonlinear property which is difficult to solve, we employ a piece-wise-linearity technique. The model determines the optimal ship size, route, port, and interior rail route to meet the spatially distributed demands. Logistical parameters specified as random include ocean and rail shipping costs, and port and railroad corridor throughput capacities, in addition container demand at U.S. markets, defined as BEAs (Economic Areas by the Bureau of Economic Analysis).

                      (i = 1, 2, …, 10) are described algebraically in Table 1. The objective minimizes the total transportation costs of water and railroad modes, congestion and handling cost at ports, and related logistical costs under stochastic scenarios. The model was iterated N = 5000 times which enables us to describe the distribution of container flows at each node. Each scenario (iteration) implicitly had the same probability. Simulation details are described in Section 4.4.

Parameters within ≪ ≫ denote various cost structures corresponding to TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) volume. Shipments via the Panama Canal include transit fees. Greater vessel costs are included for shipments through the Northwest Passage due to lower ship speeds for about 1000 miles for shipments through this route (Carmel, 2009; Wilson, Fan, & Dahl, 2010b).

                           Cockerham (2012) more recently indicated distances between Europe and Asia can be 40 percent shorter than southern routes, thereby lowering shipping costs. These would be offset in part by greater operating costs due to reduced speeds and/or required ice-breaking escorts on some portions of the route for some periods of the year.
                      Terms 8, 9 and 10 in Table 1 comprise a “two-piece” term which assigns a penalty cost of zero for shipments equal to or below the predefined capacity and a higher penalty cost for shipments exceeding that capacity. The seventh to the tenth terms use the notation specified in AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming, Fourer, Gay, and Kernighan, 2003) to represent piecewise-linearities in the model because there is no standard way to describe piecewise-linear functions in algebraic notation.

The model was solved using stochastic parameters described in Section 4.4. Briefly, Monte Carlo was used to generate solutions from the distributions for the random variables (e.g., demand at BEAs is specified as normally distributed, and capacity constraints are assumed uniformly distributed, etc.). This is equivalent to iteratively solving the deterministic network model numerous times. Each iteration represents a possible combination of stochastic scenarios. This procedure allows us to estimate the distribution of outputs (container flows and rail shipments) under numerous possible combinations.

Container demand is specified at each BEA and is derived using data from the Public Use Waybill file (U.S. Surface Transportation Board, 2006–2007), the 
                        Journal of Commerce (2003–2007), and the U.S. Maritime Administration (2009). Container demands from northeast Asia and Europe are specified individually and are not allowed to substitute for each other. Hong Kong and Rotterdam are specified as origins for container imports from northeast Asia and Europe, respectively. Geographic Information System (GIS) data for ports, intermodal terminal facilities, and rail networks are from the National Transportation Atlas Database (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2008).

                        By now, some of this data is dated. However, much of the data used in this model becomes available only after a significant lag. At the time the analysis was conducted, all the data was the most recent available. The implications of this are mitigated somewhat that in most cases we used distributions instead of absolute values, which captures the range or possible outcomes.
                     
                  

There are a total of 31 ports in the model, including 5 in Canada and 3 in Mexico that were incorporated for evaluation and sensitivities. Two international trade lanes are specified: Northeast Asia-United States and Europe-United States. The former includes three logistical channels: Transpacific to West Coast North America, through the Panama Canal to Gulf/East Coast ports, and through the Northwest Passage to the East Coast. The international trade lanes are further subdivided into strings which comprise a sequence of vessel calls at North American seaports.
                     
                  

Rail rates were derived from the Public Use Waybill (U.S. Transportation Surface Board, 2006–2007). Ocean shipping costs were derived from the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) Vessel Cost Model (Army Corps of Engineers, 2009) which was modified by including economic speeds and by substituting time charter rates for ownership costs and was extended to larger ship capacities. A fitted relationship between time charter rates and ship capacity (TEUs) was used to generate time charter rates for various ship capacities in the ACE (2009) model and to extend to larger ship sizes. Costs were estimated for days in-port and at-sea. Days at-sea was determined by a vessel's voyage distance and economic speed. Economic speeds (Army Corps of Engineers, 2007) are used for a vessel's daily at-sea cost estimation and to calculate the days needed for each route.

A point-to-point distance matrix for ocean strings was derived from Army Corps of Engineers (2007). Distances between ports was calculated using ArcGIS Network Analyst using GIS data from National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD) 2006 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2008) and international distances were from Dataloy Systems (2009).

Port throughput capacity was estimated from a queuing model, referred to as a G/G/m queuing system, i.e., assuming general distributed inter-arrival time and m multi-containership berths with general distribution process times. Port configuration parameters, including berth number and length, draft, cranes, etc., are based on data from port websites and are supplemented with data from the Port and Terminals Guide (2007–2008) and Drewry Shipping Consultants, Ltd (2009). Arriving ships are assumed to be accommodated at each berth. Simulations were conducted to estimate the relationship between port capacity and average waiting time (Wilson, Fan, & Dahl, 2010a).

Water depth and maximum-size container vessels that ports can accommodate are specified based on the current port configurations (Port and Terminals Guide, 2007–2008 and port websites). Container ships with capacities up to 4400 TEU and 12,000 TEU are defined as capacity restrictions through the Panama Canal before and after canal expansion, respectively. Ocean carriers are assumed to operate as vessel strings and under vessel-sharing agreements. Handling charges at ports were assumed to be $285/TEU, adjusted for the differences in port tariffs for wharfage costs by port which were based on previous/concurrent studies (Gnanalingam & Datuk, 2009). Table 2 summarizes these data sources.

Variables and constraints treated as random include BEA demands, ocean-vessel costs, railroads’ shipping rates, and port and railroad throughput capacity. Each is briefly discussed.

Time-series procedures are used to capture correlations amongst BEA demands. Interdependence of the time series is evaluated using the “prewhitened” series, i.e., by transforming the series to white noise by applying a suitable autoregressive and moving average process (ARMA) or a seasonal autoregressive and moving average process (SARIMA). The sample cross-correlations (lag h greater than 0) lie within the bound ± 1.96n
                        −1/2 (where n is sample size), suggesting that the two residual series (and, hence, the two stationary series) are uncorrelated. This treatment implies that demand volatility varies by BEA and that spatial demands are affected by other exogenous variables, including income, population, and other industry variables. In addition, demand volatility varies by BEA. Simulated results using time series show that most true values of demand for U.S. interior markets fall within about ±15 percent of the predicted values. To represent random container demand, we use the 2007 volume as a base; the range is specified as ±15 percent and is assumed to be independent amongst BEAs and normally distributed.

Ocean shipping costs were specified as random and determined, in part, by the randomness of fuel and trip-lease rates. Daily vessel cost was a function of speed, vessel size, and Heavy Viscosity Oil price (HVO), Marine Diesel Oil price (MDO), and the charter-lease rate. The sets of variables, HVO, MDO price, and charter rates, were random and impacted the distributions for ocean shipping costs. Vessel costs were stochastic to account for these random input variables. Charter rates and oil prices were treated as random, and HVO and MDO were correlated. Data for these variables were from Clarkson Research Services (2009) and were used to determine the distributions and correlations for these random variables.

Trip-lease rates were also treated as random. To capture these fees, a relationship is estimated for the average daily charter rates by ship capacity for 2007 where daily charter rates (103.83TEU0
                        .6925) were multiplied by a random, shifting parameter (0.74, 1.26). This range covers the range of daily hire-rate relationships for 2007. These are used as random inputs for the ACE container vessel cost model. Ultimately, the stochastic daily vessel costs are a cost input for the optimization model.

To capture intermodal correlations between vessel costs and rail shipping rates, we included HVO, MDO oil price, and charter-lease rates in the econometric model for railroad rates. Annual data (1996–2007) for these variables were from Clarkson Research Services (2009) and the Public Use Waybill file (U.S. Surface Transportation Board, 2006–2007). There were 1439 observations, and R
                        2 was 0.79; interactive terms were statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Ultimately, MDO was treated as random to capture factors that affect vessel costs and railroad shipping rates.

Throughput capacities for imported TEUs were stochastic due to handling restrictions, depending on total import and export TEUs which are uncertain. For this reason, the capacity available for imported containers was stochastic and was derived as total throughput less non-import TEUs. Time series analysis was applied to simulated non-import TEU volumes at the major ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, and the results showed that the true value fell within the prediction interval at ±10 percent of the forecasted value. We used this range and assumed a uniform distribution to derive non-import TEUs at major U.S. ports.

Rail-route capacities are complex and are influenced by many factors, including track configuration, speed limit, control system, side spacing, crossover spacing, and other operating characteristics (National Cooperative Highway Research Program [NCHRP] report 399, 1998). The results from Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (2007, pp. 4–8, 4–10) show that railway corridors in the west are more congested than in the east and that some segments are operating near or at capacity. We specify railway capacity for those congested corridors as uniformly distributed within the range of ±10 percent around the volume of current observed shipments.

Simulation procedures were used to solve the network-flow problem under uncertainty. Decisions variables of interest were shipments by route (international and domestic), and volumes shipped through each port and rail-network. Each decision variable was a random vector affected by parameters in the stochastic simulation. A complete list of decision variables and parameters are in the Appendix. The cost per TEU was derived using vessel costs divided by the capacity measured as TEUs. This assumes the vessel is fully loaded. The integer for vessel is relaxed to avoid increasing solution complexity associated with decision variables that are integer (in terms of results, this is a near inconsequential issue).

Some realizations of uncertain parameters may be violated on some constraints. In order to ensure a feasible solution, we used “soft” constraints in place of “hard” constraints, and we imposed a piecewise-linear “penalty cost” for the objective function. The port-capacity constraint was specified with a queuing function. As capacity utilization approaches one, the waiting time and costs became very large, and are non-linear. The “soft” constraint was for a congestion cost equal to the cost when utilization is at 95 percent. Because estimation of railway capacity, delay slope, and congestion is a complex process, we added two-piece terms to the soft-railway capacity restriction. Specifically, we assigned a penalty cost to shipments exceeding the predefined railway capacity.

The following terms were included in the objective function (1) to represent a piecewise-linear cost function:

The stochastic variables are
                         treated independently, except vessel costs and rail rates (both affected by MDO oil price). Random parameters are drawn from the underlying distributions specified above using a random number generator. Specifically, Monte Carlo procedures were used to generate these distributions. Each iteration represents a possible combination of stochastic parameters and the model was iterated 5000 times. There was no significant improvement in the solution after 4000 and convergence was attained within 5000 iterations. Hence, the results were based on 5000 iterations. This procedure is equivalent to solving a deterministic problem under various scenarios. The model is iterated N times, and the results are used to derive a distribution for the output values. More details on this approach are contained in Wilson, Fan, and Dahl (2010a).

@&#RESULTS@&#

Distributions of container shipments through ports are determined by variability in demand, shipping cost, and handling capacity, along with the magnitude of congestion at ports and rail corridor constraints. The distribution of container shipments through a port is a measure of risk in throughput and has implications for management. The higher the standard deviation, the higher the variability of throughput. Our focus is on the distribution of port throughput, rail corridors, and how these change when other routes and ports are added. Sensitivity analysis consists of scenarios of successively adding Prince Rupert, expansion of the Panama Canal, Mexican ports and the Northwest Passage.

The simulated distributions (Base Case) are summarized in Tables 3–5
                         for shipments through the U.S. West Coast, Gulf Coast, and East Coast, respectively. West Coast ports are primary gateways for containers imported from northeast Asia while ports in the Gulf/East Coast transship containers from northeast Asia and Europe. Normality tests and probability plots were used to determine distribution characteristics. The results indicated that, in some cases, there is a narrow range of container throughput which appears to be normally distributed.

Port throughput is normally distributed at Los Angeles and Long Beach (LA/LB), New York, and a number of other major ports. Some of the others (e.g., Seattle, Houston, and Norfolk) are right skewed, meaning that there is a greater chance of an upward deviation than a downward deviation. Oakland and Tacoma have left-skewed distributions, meaning that there is a greater chance of downside deviations. These distributions are ultimately determined by demand variability along with each port's combined inbound and outbound logistical costs, port congestion, rail-corridor constraints, and markets served by the port.

There are specific reasons which may cause these distributions to differ. Container flows through major ports that have logistical cost advantages are normal or near normally distributed, e.g., Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York. Congestion along with high demands may divert containers to other ports, resulting in skewed distributions which are likely the reason for the left-skewed pattern at Oakland. Rightward-skewed distributions are likely at ports which divert fewer containers from congested ports than ports with left-skewed patterns, partially due to factors such as outbound flow restrictions, congestion function at the port, and total logistical costs of the corresponding intermodal transportation corridors. Shipments at these ports seem less affected than flows with left-skewed distributions when new alternatives are allowed in the system (with the exception of Houston, due to the impacts of expanding the Panama Canal). Bimodal distributions occur at those ports with small container throughput (e.g., Portland, Jacksonville, and Chester) result from variability in demands; and, apparently, are more unstable than dominating ports. Some ports have results with nil volume, including Freeport, Wilmington, Newport, Port Everglades, and West Palm which may be due to these ports’ location within the same coastal BEA as other ports and being subject to cost disadvantages; i.e., Freeport is located in the same BEA as Houston; Wilmington and Philadelphia are located in the same BEA; Newport is located in the same BEA as Norfolk; Port Everglades and West Palm are located in the same BEA as Miami.

                           Because public use Waybill only defines shipments from originating BEA to terminating BEA, other than port to terminating BEA, the outbound shipping rate from ports to interior BEAs is specified as the same for those ports located in the same coastal BEA. The ports with favorable port characteristics, e.g. water depth, throughput capacity, etc., have logistical cost advantages.
                        
                     

Changes in container flows were analyzed to determine the impacts of new ports and routes, including Prince Rupert, Mexican ports, expanding the Panama Canal, and the Northwest Passage. Traffic distributions through the major ports in each scenario are summarized in Table 6
                           . Selected distributions are shown in Fig. 2
                            (for LA/LB) to provide a graphic representation of the relative variability of TEU volume. The distributions shown in each panel, from the top to the bottom of the figure, represent different sensitivities. The top panel is Prince Rupert and expansion of the Panama Canal; the second panel is Prince Rupert, expansion of the Panama Canal, and Mexican ports; the third panel is Prince Rupert, expansion of the Panama Canal, Mexican ports, and the Northwest Passage; and the bottom panel is base-case stochastic model.

Throughput distributions for ports that are normally distributed in the base case are also normally distributed in the sensitivities. There are a number of notable changes in distributions as additional ports/routes are included in the model. The most interesting are (1) Seattle/Tacoma changes from right skewed to normal; (2) Oakland changes from left to right skewed; (3) Houston changes from right skewed to bimodal; and (4) Prince Rupert has one spike on the right end of the distribution. The new ports and routes have greater impacts on the West Coast than the East Coast. This is apparent at Los Angeles and Long Beach, where the mean values shift leftward (Fig. 2). For flows that are skewed (e.g., Oakland), the mode shifts left, and patterns become right skewed.

The result for Prince Rupert implies that it has cost advantages over U.S. routes. This means throughput via this port is at its capacity in a majority of combinations with various stochastic parameters. The very small frequency of throughput that is less than the port capacity might result from scenarios when demand is small and capacity is high in the U.S. system. Expansion of the Panama Canal results in increased throughput at Houston. In this case, the distribution shifts right, and the pattern shifts from right skewed to bimodal. The reason for the latter is likely due to more containers being diverted from LA/LB to the Gulf Coast without restrictions on the Panama Canal.

Container shipments through the Panama Canal change when competing routes and ports are introduced. In the base case, the Panama Canal is at capacity. Expansion at other ports and routes results in the distribution becoming more bimodal, with a greater mode on the right-hand portion of the bi-modal distribution. Thus, an expanded Panama Canal would result in an increase in shipments through it. The reason for the spike is more containers shipped via the Panama Canal through Houston. The prospect of a route through the Northwest Passage diverts containers from the Panama Canal.

The impacts to railways due to new ports and routes are apparent for major corridors from the West Coast to major interior BEAs. Table 7 summarizes the distribution of rail flows from LA/LB through the major corridors under various scenarios. Prince Rupert and expanding the Panama Canal divert container flows from West Coast ports to BEAs at Chicago, Memphis, and Dallas. Development of Mexican ports impact shipping on U.S. rail corridors, specifically from West Coast ports to Memphis and Dallas. Impacts for developing Mexican container ports are shown in Fig. 3. They show the distributions from LA/LB to Memphis and show that the mean shifts leftward.

There is substantial randomness in critical variables in the logistical system for container imports. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and measure these risks. A stochastic network-flow model of the container supply chain was developed to capture these impacts. The model was based on cost minimization and was solved using stochastic optimization to analyze impacts of these structural changes and to measure risks. Some variables were specified as random (including container demand, fuel costs, container ship-lease rates, rail rates, etc.), and some constraints were specified as stochastic (port handing and rail-corridor capacity). The model is highly structured due in part the problem being addressed, and can be used to generate numerous results. Those of particular importance relate to the distributions of port throughput, and changes in flows as a result of new ports and routes.

The results indicated that some ports had less variability for shipments than others. Ports with the greatest certainty were LA/LB, Seattle/Tacoma, and the East Coast ports. The ones with greater risk were Oakland, Portland, Houston, Philadelphia, and Jacksonville. Most ports had normal or near-normal distributions for port throughput; some ports had distributions that were right skewed, and a few had either left skewed or bimodal distributions of throughput.

There are both private and public sector implications of these results. Most of these revolve around expansion at ports and at rail corridors. Both port and rail expansion have the impact of reducing costs and channeling shipments through the most efficient routes and corridors. In addition, there are important public-sector implications. Certainly, there are fairly significant changes, including the near-simultaneous expansion of water-routes serving the U.S. markets (including the Panama Canal as well as prospectively through the Northwest Passage), as well as either new ports (Prince Rupert, Mexico West Coast) or port expansion which is pending at many U.S. ports. These changes, or prospective changes, should impact port-expansion and operating decisions.

The stochastic results are particularly interesting. From a port-management perspective, a distribution with low variability allows for better resource and logistical planning. In contrast, ports with greater variability in throughput would have greater difficulty making planning and allocation decisions. Some ports have non-normal distributions. The implications of these differ depending on the shape. Ports with left-skewed distributions have to be concerned about reasons that would induce lower throughput. In contrast, ports with right-skewed distributions should be concerned about managing the chance of greater throughput and improving efficiency to increase throughput and to reduce congestion with the peak-shipping volume. Finally, ports with bimodal distributions confront a more managerially challenging environment. Specifically, for these ports there is a higher probability of either lower or higher shipments, and often occurs at small ports.

The results depend on a complicated set of distributions and random variables, which cumulatively determine the optimal flows and throughput at each logistical node. The iterations can be used to draw inferences about distributions of the results. If the distributions of the underlying random variables differed, then the results would change. How much depends on the extent of the change in the underlying distributions and how these impact the optimization process. Indeed, some of the random variables were more volatile in the period following the end-date of the data used in this study. How these changes would impact the distributions of the output variables is unclear. In fact, changes in underlying distributions between the base period and the projection period are one of the biggest challenges in conducting stochastic simulation and optimization.

The strategic implications of these distributions on port planning and strategy are daunting and are beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, certainly management should be exploring the reasons for randomness and seek ways if possible to reduce the variability of shipment. These may include inter-agency planning and focus groups. In addition, congestion pricing which has become common for pricing public goods should be explored as a mechanism to manage these risks (Button, 2010). Other alternatives include contracts, and provisions regarding deviations from planned shipments, as well as alternative allocation mechanisms (i.e., as used in US railroads as discussed in Wilson and Dahl 2005) and capacity planning (Ilmer, 2010). Indeed, congestion pricing is increasingly being used in other transport problems, and as it pertains to this study, is used by the Panama Canal in its booking system.

The model analyzes impacts of infrastructure changes on container flows to U.S. markets. It is comprehensive in that it allows for inter-port, inter-modal, and inter-route competition, and it includes the impacts of ocean and rail shipping rates as well as congestion costs. The model structure and specification could be applied to other countries or logistical corridors and would be particularly useful in those that have varying forms of congestion (e.g., Brazil port and road congestion in soybean shipments). The model and its results contribute to recent literature in several ways. The major contribution is to provide network flow model framework for containerized imports by capturing congestion, multi-port calls, and uncertainty. There is dispersion, or variability, of volume of possible outcomes due to market volatility. Uncertainty in parameters impacts the variability in container flows, which reflect market volatility or risk. The model simulates the distribution of container flows under various scenarios including developing new ports and routes. We measured risk as the spread and variability of distribution of container volume through port. It measures variability for factors that cause risk in the supply chain for containers and quantifies the risks related to port throughput. Variance of throughput is important for port management and shipping companies, especially for port expansion and new port investment. These features are realistic and important but are seldom reflected comprehensively in other studies. Finally, the results are used to compare risk in port throughput under different simulations regarding new ports and routes.

The study does have limitations. One is that the data is older and the distributions generated from these may not capture the impacts of recent changes. Updating for some variables could be done easily, but others would be more difficult, costly and some (e.g., rail capacity measures) would not allow updating. Nevertheless, the general results illustrate the range of distribution types and shapes, and are suggestive of the managerial challenges in port and throughput planning. Second is that the model excludes impacts of exports. Though we accommodate this through stochastic limitations, it could be expanded to treat exports explicitly. Third, though there are many implications that could be gleaned from these results, our focus was on the distribution of port throughput, and on changes in flows as a result of new routes and ports.
