@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Let us consider a human diabetic patient who receives regular insulin doses. From time to time, the patient undergoes a detailed monitoring of his/her glucose levels using a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Over the course of a few days, the CGMS provides a detailed track of the interstitial fluid glucose levels measured in the patient׳s subcutaneous tissue. A physician reviews the interstitial fluid glucose levels measured. A difference between the blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels is considered to be unimportant because the blood glucose levels are not measured continuously. Approximately five blood glucose-level samples are taken per day, while the interstitial fluid glucose levels are usually measured every 5min.

As another example, let us consider a critically ill human patient with stress-induced hyperglycemia. Instead of having the patient tolerate the hyperglycemia, intensive insulin infusion therapy could be administered to the patient with the aim of reducing mortality [1,2]. To control the insulin dosage, the patient׳s glucose levels must be monitored. Once again, it is the CGMS that measures the patient׳s interstitial fluid glucose levels.

Glucose is primarily distributed throughout the body by blood vessels. The maintenance of normal blood glucose levels is accomplished by a network of hormones, neural signals and substrate effects that regulate endogenous glucose production and glucose utilization by tissues other than the brain [3]. From the blood, glucose is transported through the blood capillary membrane into the interstitial fluid. The interstitial fluid, which is found in the intercellular spaces between tissue cells, supplies the cells with nutrients such as glucose. In the interstitial fluid, the glucose is either utilized or leaves the interstitial fluid to eventually return to the blood. The lymphatic system represents an accessory route through which the fluid can flow from the interstitial spaces into the blood [4].

Interstitial fluid glucose levels then vary, reflecting changes in blood glucose levels. However, the change in interstitial fluid glucose levels exhibits both a delay and a magnitude difference. Different compartments may have different glucose levels; this difference is because capillaries in different compartments have different permeabilities [4]. Subsequently, the cells of different tissues have different glucose utilization rates depending on the tissue׳s metabolic needs and the levels of available glucose. Thus, as blood glucose levels change, subcutaneous tissue glucose levels cannot be assumed to be equivalent to those in different compartments. Describing the relationship between plasma glucose and interstitial fluid glucose dynamics is an important but challenging open problem.

The two-compartment model developed by Steil and Rebrin [5–7], assumes that interstitial fluid glucose levels are a convolution of blood glucose levels and the impulse response of the system with only one unknown parameter. However, a one-parameter model cannot fully describe a complex system.

Another approach used experiments involving glucose tracers. Researchers [8] measured the concentrations of three different glucose tracers in both plasma and the interstitium. Similarly, other studies [9–11] have used an approach based on fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. Such studies are intended to elucidate a particular aspect of plasma-interstitium dynamics and are not well suited for everyday use by patients. One has to consider that a diabetic patient will need to wear a CGMS taking five blood samples a day in practice. In addition, a radioactive component (the tracer) is required to perform a positron emission tomography scan, and this is a risk factor for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Another approach treats measured glucose levels as noisy time series and applies a Kalman filter [12,13]. It estimates future glucose measurements using a systems dynamics model and present glucose measurements. To estimate the model׳s parameters, one can change the parameters until the estimated glucose levels match the measured glucose levels to a satisfactory degree of accuracy. In this paper, we present an alternative to the Steil–Rebrin model of systems dynamics.

Very frequent blood glucose level sampling is the only way to understand if the newly proposed method is able to correctly reconstruct blood glucose dynamics. While other studies [12–14] measure blood glucose levels every 15min, we measured blood glucose levels every 5min. The work presented herein was tested on hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats because this allowed for a frequency of blood glucose level measuring and a longer experiment period than would be acceptable with humans.

First, the experimenter tried to achieve a steady blood glucose level, preferably at 6mmol/l, using a manually corrected glucose infusion and a constant insulin infusion. After 15min of the steady state, a bolus of glucose was administered to initiate a rapid rise of blood glucose levels. The experimenter then continued to maintain the steady state at the new blood glucose levels for 60min. Next, the experimenter administered a short-action insulin bolus to create a rapid fall of blood glucose levels and continued measuring glucose levels for only the next 80min.

During the experiment, glucose levels were measured simultaneously every 5min in arterial blood (±0.2mmol/l tolerance), subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle tissue and visceral fat (15% tolerance for the three latter compartments). For example, when a rat was given a bolus of glucose, the successive glucose levels could be increased by more than 15%. This was not due to an improper calibration of the measuring device but to an inability to further increase glucose level sampling frequencies—see Ref. [15].

This study extends our previous work as we derive an improved model of plasma-interstitium glucose dynamics. Therefore, we reused our previously conducted set of experiments to compare the previous model with the presently proposed model on the same data sets. See Ref. [16] for full details of the experimental setup.

Using the Steil–Rebrin model, we reviewed the differences between blood glucose levels and CGMS-measured interstitial fluid glucose levels [17,18]. According to Ref. [18], C

Ref. [18] assumes the following regarding the parameter g: If the blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels are equal, the expected value of g is 1 with respect to Eq. (2). τ is treated as an unknown parameter and is estimated from the data. However, it has been shown that a recalibration of the measured interstitial fluid glucose levels is needed to get the calculated g close to 1. Ref. [18] concludes with a need for developing more sophisticated recalibration procedures with time-varying modulation.

There are three effects on interstitial fluid glucose levels that cannot be covered with a single change in glucose levels: the exchange of glucose between the blood and interstitial fluid across the capillary membrane, the glucose utilization by cells and the accessory route of the lymphatic system by which the glucose returns to the blood after a delay. In laboratory experiments with frequent glucose level sampling, such patterns of glucose levels were observed, which are in conflict with Eq. (1). The interstitial fluid glucose levels were steady for at least 15min while the blood glucose levels changed. For example, see the original measured glucose levels in 
                        Fig. 1. This suggests that either the interstitial fluid glucose levels were sub-sampled or the Steil–Rebrin model is overly simplified. With respect to the previous section and Refs. [15,19], we consider the Steil–Rebrin model to be overly simplified. In this study, we present a new model that is not in conflict with the aforementioned glucose level patterns.

One study [20] suggests the use of more than one function to model a system׳s response to glucose levels. Similarly, in study [16], we viewed interstitial fluid glucose levels as a sum of the glucose flux from the blood into the interstitium and the flux from the interstitium into cells. This is another reason for considering the Steil–Rebrin model to be overly simplified.

In Fig. 1, squares denote the measured blood glucose levels. The curve next to these squares denotes the smoothed blood glucose levels. The circles denote the measured interstitial fluid glucose levels. The curve next to these circles denotes the smoothed interstitial fluid glucose levels. The measured glucose levels were smoothed using an approximation method [21].

To derive a better model of plasma-interstitium glucose dynamics, let us start with our previous work on interstitial-fluid glucose level prediction [22,23]. Eq. (3) describes our previous prediction model [22]. It relates present blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels to future interstitial fluid glucose levels [22]. The b(t) and i(t) symbols denote the blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels, respectively, at time t.

The ∆t, p, cg and c symbols have been previously described [16,22]. ∆t denotes the prediction interval. When compared to Fick׳s Law of diffusion [24], b(t)–i(t) is the concentration difference across a membrane, and cg is the surface area multiplied by the membrane permeability and divided by the thickness of the membrane. Accounting for diffusion across the membrane, p expresses a glucose gain from the blood due to intercellular clefts between endothelial cells. The symbol c represents an arbitrary glucose level that covers the difference between the flux from the blood into the interstitium and the flux from the interstitium into cells, thus covering insulin-dependent actions.

As blood glucose levels change, interstitial fluid glucose levels change as well. This is a system response that is used to determine the system variables—i.e., the model׳s parameters. A satisfactory number of measured glucose levels produce an overdetermined system in Eq. (3). In that case, the Linear Least Squares method gives the model׳s parameters – p, cg and c – for a given ∆t. It is possible to calculate parameters that remain constant throughout the duration of the experiment [23].

The model already gives acceptable results if the prediction error is considered to be the absolute average difference between the predicted and measured interstitial fluid glucose levels. However, prior to reconstructing blood glucose levels, it was necessary to reduce the maximum absolute difference between the predicted and measured interstitial fluid glucose levels. This is where the novel part of this study begins.

With the previous prediction model [16,22,23], there could be a slight time-lag of approximately 2.5min associated with a rapid blood glucose level change (e.g., when changing from 5.5mmol/l to 11.5mmol/l in 5min due to an intravenously given bolus of glucose). This lag causes an undesired maximum difference. Although the prediction provides a useful idea of the next course of interstitial fluid glucose levels, from a mathematical point of view the maximum difference must be reduced.

Let us consider a rapid change in blood glucose levels followed by a respective change in interstitial fluid glucose levels. Because the glucose transport rate from the blood into the interstitial fluid follows the concentration gradient between these two compartments, the change in interstitial fluid glucose levels must be a product of the varying glucose transport rate. To reduce the maximum difference, let us consider the rate at which the concentration gradient converges to zero—see the reasoning for Eq. (2).

Let us consider that the present interstitial fluid glucose levels and their changes determine the rate with which the interstitial glucose levels reach new levels. As a result, the prediction interval ∆t in Eq. (3) depends on the current concentration gradient between the blood and interstitial fluid. If we consider that changes in blood glucose levels affect interstitial fluid glucose levels, then the fixed ∆t has to be replaced using Eq. (4), thus producing Eq. (5). Eq. (4) reflects the fact that glucose propagates from the blood into the interstitial fluid with a delay, i.e., ∆t. Yet, Eq. (4) states that this delay is proportional to the current interstitial fluid glucose levels and their changes, which are affected by blood glucose level changes.

For the h-long interval, Eq. (4) expresses the effect of a concentration-gradient change rate as it affects interstitial fluid glucose levels. The k-parameter is a coefficient of this effect. If the concentration gradient equals zero for a past h-long interval, Eq. (4) equals the original t+∆t.

Considering an a priori identification of the parameters, let us start with Eq. (3). It is a well-established fact that blood glucose propagates into the interstitial fluid with a delay —∆t. The p, cg and c parameters are always identifiable if they are solved with the Least Linear Squares method because the method reduces the squares of the differences. In the worst case, the Least Linear Squares method produces p close to 1 and cg with c close to 0. In this case, the method behaves as a physician reviewing CGMS-measured interstitial fluid glucose levels, assuming that they follow blood glucose levels with a delay. When solving Eq. (5), the k parameter could be considered to be equal to zero, thus leading to the same conclusion.

Because Eq. (4) is not calculated with blood glucose levels, Eq. (5) can be used to reconstruct blood glucose levels using only the CGMS-measured interstitial fluid glucose levels once the parameters are determined. To determine the parameters, the measured blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels are first smoothed. We have previously described the approximation method used to smooth blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels [21]. The method reduces the effect of outliers in the measured glucose levels because they can be affected by large deviations, especially with the CGMS [26–28]. Therefore, we do not remove outliers from the measured data sets.

To estimate p, cg, c, k, h and ∆t in Eq. (5), an overdetermined system of Eq. (5) is built using the smoothed glucose levels. Eq. (5) presents a non-linear model. Let us determine the p, cg and c parameters with the Least Linear Squares method for the given ∆t, k and h parameters. Then we define the lower bound, upper bound and stepping for each ∆t, k and h parameter. The h, k and ∆t parameters are stepped within their boundaries to generate a number of ∆t, k and h triplets for which we calculate the p, cg and c parameters. The best triplet produces the least reconstruction error. The reconstruction error is the average absolute difference between the calculated blood glucose levels and the smoothed measured blood glucose levels.

With the parameters p, cg, c, h, k and ∆t calculated, let us define the following substitutions (6).

The newly introduced s-parameter selects the root. It is either −1.0 or 1.0. To determine the s-parameter, let us calculate both roots at each time point of the blood glucose level measurement. For each value of the s-parameter, let us calculate the average absolute difference between the measured and calculated blood glucose levels. The root producing the smallest difference is the desired root. So far, the s-parameter has always been 1.0.

As an alternative to Eq. (8), Eq. (7) can be used if the conditions for solving Eq. (8) are not met. In such a case, let us iterate through all of the possible blood glucose levels with the desired numerical stepping. Then, the desired blood glucose level satisfies condition (9).

If the conditions for solving Eq. (8) are not met, Eq. (9) can still identify a glucose level for which there is an acceptable difference between the calculated and expected glucose levels. If the difference is too large, the respective set of parameters is discarded and we search for a set of parameters that produces the lowest reconstruction error.

With an approach such as that in Eq. (1), deconvolution is used to reconstruct blood glucose levels from the CGMS-measured glucose levels and the impulse response of the system. This is an inverse problem which suffers from ill-conditioning. Our approach is different. We find the parameters for calculating interstitial fluid glucose levels from blood glucose levels. Then, Eq. (8) calculates the blood glucose level by calculating the root of a quadratic polynomial—Eq. (5), where the interstitial fluid glucose level is the product of the blood glucose level and not vice versa as it is with deconvolution.

The work presented was verified with 21 compartment measurements of subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle tissue and visceral fat. The results are consistent across all of these measurements.

In all of the experiments conducted, we excluded rats whose interstitial glucose levels did not change significantly. In these cases, a possible error in the CGMS sensor was suspected. Seven hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats were included in this study. All of the rats were male, and their weights exhibited the following characteristics: median, 410g; first quartile, 364g; and third quartile, 419g.

Four compartments were measured in each hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rat—blood, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle tissue and visceral fat. The measured glucose levels of each compartment were smoothed using a previously described approximation method [21]. For each combination of blood and another compartment, the overdetermined systems of Eqs. (1), (3) and (5) were solved.

While the same principles of metabolic processes apply to all of the rats, the rates of particular metabolic processes may differ in each rat. Therefore, we calculated a set of parameters for the evaluated compartments of each rat. Our goal was not to prove that universal parameters would apply to every rat, but to prove that such parameters can be calculated per rat. For this reason, there is no “training set” and no “validation set” of rats. Nevertheless, we were concerned with how the parameters differed across the rats. Therefore, we present the parameters in terms of first quartile, median and third quartile.

To find the parameters in Eq. (1), the system of Eq. (1) was solved with the Linear Least Squares method. Along τ, g is treated as an unknown parameter and is estimated from the data. This approach was used previously [18] as well and it produces less error than setting g=1.

To find the parameters in Eq. (3), the system of Eq. (3) was solved using the Linear Least Square method for each possible ∆t. The respective range was 0 to 60min. The parameters found with the best ∆t produced the lowest prediction error.

To find the parameters in Eq. (5), the system of Eq. (5) was solved for each possible combination of k, h and ∆t. The respective ranges were −0.1 to 0.0 for k, and 0 to 60min for h and ∆t. The best combination of parameters produced the lowest reconstruction error.

In 
                     Tables 1 and 3, the p, cg, k, g and ∆t parameters are dimensionless. The unit of the c parameter is [mmol/l]. The unit of the h and ∆t parameters is [min:s]. In 
                     
                     Table 2, the τ and g parameters are dimensionless.

To compare Eqs. (1), (3), (5) and (8), the difference between the calculated glucose levels and the following were calculated:
                        
                           1.
                           measured glucose levels.

smoothed measured glucose levels [21].

The average absolute differences and the maximum absolute differences were determined in units of [mmol/l]. The first number shown in the tables is the median value. The numbers within the brackets are the first and third quartiles, respectively.


                     
                     Table 4 compares Eqs. (1) and (8). The table describes the absolute values of the relative differences for blood glucose level reconstruction. We calculated these differences as absolute differences between the reconstructed and measured blood glucose levels divided by the measured blood glucose levels. The upper part of the table uses measured blood glucose levels; the lower part of the table uses smoothed measured blood glucose levels.

For example, with subcutaneous tissue, 26.71% of the calculated blood glucose levels had absolute values of relative differences from smoothed measured blood glucose levels less than or equal to 5% using the Steil–Rebrin model. This same difference interval was found in 63.01% of the calculated levels with the model proposed in this study.

As depicted in 
                     Fig. 3, φ(t) can produce a time point for which no interstitial-fluid glucose levels were measured; thus we compared only those blood glucose levels that were calculated by both methods. In total, there were 146 measured blood glucose levels evaluated in subcutaneous tissue, 197 levels in skeletal muscle and 206 levels in visceral fat.

To compare the Steil–Rebrin model with the proposed model, we computed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each calculation of blood glucose levels. To determine the AIC score, we used the residual sum of squares of the differences between the measured and calculated glucose levels. 
                     Table 5 gives the scores per compartment, where a lower number indicates a better model. The first number shown in the table is the median value. The numbers within the brackets are the first and third quartiles, respectively.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the experiments conducted, Eq. (5) outperforms its predecessor, Eq. (3), as it reduces the prediction error—see Table 3. However, its prediction capability is limited as φ(t) can be less than t+∆t. However, as a result, Eq. (8) outperforms the Steil–Rebrin model, Eq. (1), using hypertriglyceridemic rats—see the errors given in Tables 1 and 2.

The best parameters in Eq. (8) are selected with blood glucose levels, while the Least Linear Squares calculates the p, cg and c parameters using the interstitial fluid glucose levels in Eq. (5). These parameters can be used to calculate the glucose levels in both the blood and interstitial fluid. This indicates that the parameters truly describe transcapillary glucose transport—i.e., these parameters can be interpreted as being physiological markers. Using Eq. (3), this possibility was previously studied [16].

The Clarke Error Grid quantifies glucose level estimations compared with measured glucose levels. The grid defines region A as those values within 20% of the reference meter. Region B contains values that are outside of the 20% area, but do not lead to inappropriate treatment. The other regions contain values that would lead to unnecessary or potentially dangerous treatments (e.g., the D region). We evaluated the Steil–Rebrin model and the proposed model using the Clarke Error Grid. With hypertriglyceridemic rats, we can see that the proposed model outperforms the Steil–Rebrin model in this criterion—see Table 4. The number of calculated glucose levels for which the absolute value of relative differences is less than 5 and 10% is noteworthy.

A previous study [25] concluded that different CGMS׳s contribute in different ways to the observed delays between blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels. Another study [26] also observed this phenomenon while considering the impact of the glucose levels. In addition, another study [29] presented an estimation of blood glucose levels from CGMS intensity readings using autoregressive models. It states that stable and accurate models for short-term glucose prediction with acceptable time lags are attained only when the raw glucose measurements are smoothed and the model coefficients are regularized. For this reason, we evaluated the differences for measured glucose levels and smoothed measured glucose levels.

The rats allowed us to study rapid blood glucose level changes. When they were given an intravenous bolus of glucose, a steep increase of their blood glucose levels immediately followed. Before the bulk of the glucose bolus underwent glycogen synthesis, blood glucose levels could more than double. An inverse effect took place when rats were given a bolus of short-action insulin. Such effects made the interstitial-fluid glucose level predictions and blood glucose level reconstructions difficult. Therefore, the prediction and reconstruction errors tend to be greater with non-smoothed measured glucose levels.


                     Tables 1–4 confirm the findings of previous studies [29] regarding smoothed glucose measurements. All of the models produced less error when they were calculated with smoothed levels.

In Fig. 1, we can see that the first 6 interstitial fluid glucose levels are constant, while blood glucose levels vary. This demonstrates that if we measure equivalent interstitial fluid glucose levels successively, the Steil–Rebrin model cannot calculate valid blood glucose levels. If the interstitial fluid glucose levels are constant, their derivation is zero, thus the calculated blood glucose levels also have to be constant. Nevertheless, Fig. 1 depicts that blood glucose levels can change under these circumstances. The proposed model does not exhibit this weakness.

However, because φ(t) can produce a time point for which no interstitial-fluid glucose levels were measured, so the blood glucose levels might not be computable for certain marginal measurement times. Fig. 3 illustrates this scenario. A better method for finding the parameters of Eq. (8) might solve this issue. The Steil–Rebrin model does not suffer from this phenomenon, but has less accuracy—especially with smoothed measured blood glucose levels.

The Akaike information criterion rewards the goodness of fit of a model and penalizes the model for an increasing number of parameters. The proposed model achieved about a doubly improved AIC score than the Steil–Rebrin model for all of the compartments. This confirms our assumption from Section 2.2, where we considered the Steil–Rebrin model to be overly simplified. The increased number of parameters was worth the reduced calculation error.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study reports on a model to reconstruct blood glucose levels from CGMS-measured interstitial fluid glucose levels once the model׳s parameters are determined using initial blood samples. As a major benefit, the model reconstructs blood glucose levels neither as shifting interstitial fluid glucose levels in time nor as causing a single interstitial fluid glucose level change. The model shows that a single blood glucose level is linked to interstitial fluid glucose levels at three different time points. On this basis, the model presents a considerable improvement in blood glucose level reconstruction over the Steil–Rebrin model of plasma-interstitium dynamics. In addition, there are no added requirements or costs for measuring glucose levels in the proposed model.

On the other hand, the Steil–Rebrin model has been tested on a considerably larger dataset over the years than the proposed model has. Therefore, we cannot claim that the proposed model will outperform the Steil–Rebrin model with human patients in practice. However, we will proceed with further testing of the proposed model due to the promising results yielded in this study.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

The Steil–Rebrin model is widely used to describe the relationship between blood and interstitial fluid glucose dynamics. In the experiments we conducted, we measured glucose level patterns for which the Steil–Rebrin model does not hold. Therefore, we based our research on a different model that relates future interstitial fluid glucose levels to present blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels. From this model, we derived an improved model for calculating blood glucose levels.

The glucose levels of blood, subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle tissue and visceral fat were obtained in our experiments conducted on hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats. After the rats’ blood glucose levels had undergone rapid changes, the experimenter attempted to achieve steady blood glucose levels for a certain period of time. Although the insulin infusion rates were maintained constant, the experimenter manually corrected the glucose infusion rates. The interstitial fluid glucose levels of subcutaneous tissue, skeletal muscle tissue and visceral fat were used individually to calculate blood glucose levels.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this paper, we proposed an improved model that outperforms the Steil–Rebrin model and presents no additional requirements for collecting glucose level samples. In subcutaneous tissue, 26.71% of the calculated blood glucose levels had absolute values of the relative difference from smoothed measured blood glucose levels less than or equal to 5% using the Steil–Rebrin model. However, the same difference interval was encountered in 63.01% of the calculated levels using the proposed model. A 20% difference was present in 79.45% of the glucose levels with the Steil–Rebrin model, but was present in 95.21% of the glucose levels with the proposed model.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

While we outperformed the Steil–Rebrin model, the Steil–Rebrin model has been tested on a considerably larger dataset over the years. Therefore, we cannot claim that the proposed model will result in improvements with human patients in practice—this has to be yet proven.
