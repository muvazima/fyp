                  Network reconfiguration is the process of changing the topology of distribution systems by altering the open/closed status of switches. Because there are many candidate-switching combinations in the distribution system, network reconfiguration is a complicated combinatorial, non-differentiable constrained optimization problem. In addition, the radiality constraint typically increases the intricacy of the problem. In this paper, to avoid create infeasible configuration, a new codification is proposed. The proposed codification is computationally efficient and guarantees to generate only feasible radial topologies all times. Also, in this paper, a modified heuristic approach for optimal reconfiguration in radial distribution systems is presented. Additionally, in order to economize voltage profile improvement, a number of new formulas have been represented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on balanced and unbalanced test distribution systems.
