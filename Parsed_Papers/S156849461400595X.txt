                  This paper presents a novel parameter automation strategy for particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving non-convex emission constrained economic dispatch (NECED) problems. Many evolutionary techniques such as particle swarm optimization, differential evolution have been applied to solve these problems and found to perform in a better way in comparison with conventional optimization methods. But often these methods converge to a sub-optimal solution prematurely. This paper presents a new improved particle swarm optimization technique called self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimization technique with time-varying acceleration coefficients (SOHPSO_TVAC) for non-convex emission constrained economic dispatch (NECED) problems to avoid premature convergence. Generator ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zones are taken into account in problem formulation. Non-convex emission constrained economic dispatch (NECED) problem is obtained by considering both the economy and emission objectives. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on two sample test systems. The results of the proposed method are compared with other methods. It is found that the results obtained by the proposed method are superior in terms of fuel cost, emission output and losses.
