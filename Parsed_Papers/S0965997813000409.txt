                  The paper aims at developing a simple two-step homogenization scheme for prediction of elastic properties of a high performance concrete (HPC) in which microstructural heterogeneities are distinguished with the help of nanoindentation. The main components of the analyzed material include blended cement, fly-ash and fine aggregate. The material heterogeneity appears on several length scales as well as porosity that is accounted for in the model. Grid nanoindentation is applied as a fundamental source of elastic properties of individual microstructural phases in which subsequent statistical evaluation and deconvolution of phase properties are employed. The multilevel porosity is evaluated from combined sources, namely mercury intrusion porosimetry and optical image analyses. Micromechanical data serve as input parameters for analytical (Mori–Tanaka) and numerical FFT-based elastic homogenizations at microscale. Both schemes give similar results and justify the isotropic character of the material. The elastic stiffness matrices are derived from individual phase properties and directly from the grid nanoindentation data with very good agreement. The second material level, which accounts for large air porosity and aggregate, is treated with analytical homogenization to predict the overall composite properties. The results are compared with macroscopic experimental measurements received from static and dynamic tests. Also here, good agreement was achieved within the experimental error, which includes microscale phase interactions in a very dense heterogeneous composite matrix. The methodology applied in this paper gives promising results for the better prediction of HPC elastic properties and for further reduction of expensive experimental works that must be, otherwise, performed on macroscopic level.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Nowadays, homogenization of mechanical properties of multiphase materials is widely applied to classical composites with distinct inclusions and with well-defined geometry of the phases. However, application of such approaches to heterogeneous materials still faces obstacles in the form of unclear separation of individual phases, uneasy assessment of the phase properties (e.g. elastic stiffness tensor), phase volume fractions and other geometrical descriptors. To overcome these difficulties, the material heterogeneity is divided into levels assigned with a characteristic length and multiscale model is built. Different experimental techniques are applicable on individual levels to assess geometrical and mechanical characteristics depending on the phases’ size. Macroscale material properties can be handled with conventional techniques like optical microscopy and loading jacks. On the other hand, microscale testing requires more advanced methods, such as electron microscopy, micro-CT, nanoindentation and others.

In this paper, we apply several homogenization procedures to highly heterogeneous cementitious composite, namely to high performance concrete. In general, cementitious composites including various types of concretes and mortars represent the most used building materials. To a certain extent, and often with a trace of hope, concrete and mortar mixtures can be considered as a single phase, i.e. homogeneous material, on macroscale. However, this classification may change according to the level of observation (micro, meso and macroscopic level). With the scope of this definition, cementitious composites are the typical representatives of multiscale materials, since they can be treated as homogeneous in the macroscopic level (cm∼m scale) and as heterogeneous in a finer level of observation (nm–cm scale).

Heterogeneity at the lower level comes from both the chemical reactions (e.g. hydration process [1,2]) and the mechanical mixing of non-reactive components (e.g. aggregate particles [3,4]). Further, transition zones between the phases and also porosity are present at each scale of the composite; therefore, the application of the multiscale analysis is substantial.

The multiscale analysis involves the following steps: (i) separation of the levels; (ii) morphological observations and separation of mechanically different phases (both tasks can be merged if special approaches like statistical deconvolution of nanoindentation data are used, as in this paper); (iii) assessment of mechanical properties of individual phases; and (iv) upscaling of phase properties to the upper level [5,6].

The microstructure observation and determination of phases can be performed, e.g. by analysis of images obtained from optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM) or a combination of these. Several researchers [4,6–9] have been using successfully these techniques to obtain morphological and chemical parameters of individual material phases, and equally as in this paper, the microstructure analysis has often been supplemented by porosity measurements (e.g. mercury intrusion porosimetry) and/or image analysis.

The micromechanical analysis of individual material phases (nm–μm scale) can be obtained exclusively by the nanoindentation technique which is used for assessing the mechanical properties of small volumes at nano and micro level. The principle of nanoindentation lies in forcing a very small tip (typically diamond) to the material surface while the changes in the applied load and the penetration depth are measured simultaneously [10]. By using this technique, material properties, such as elastic modulus, hardness, plastic or viscous parameters, can be obtained from experimental readings for a given material volume [10–12].

The macrolevel analysis is performed by different types of standardized macroscopic tests (e.g. by the static compression, tension or bending and/or by dynamic tests) in which the overall material properties are obtained on large specimens (cm–m scale).

Transition between the micro and macro levels can be treated with a micromechanical approach that separates the levels by defining a characteristic scale and related representative volume elements (RVE) for each of the levels [13]. The response of the micromechanically heterogeneous RVE can be averaged through different homogenization techniques that aim at replacing the microscopically inhomogeneous strains and stresses by their fictitious homogeneous (effective) counterparts [13–15].

A significant group of analytical methods is based on the classical Eshelby’s solution of ellipsoidal inclusions embedded in an infinite matrix [14], namely the Mori–Tanaka method, the self-consistent scheme and others [13]. Numerical homogenizations can include finite element computations or fast Fourier transformation [15–17].

Among the analytical homogenization schemes, the Mori–Tanaka method is used frequently for its simplicity and wide applicability in terms of the concentration range of the multiple phases that are involved. Its performance was also justified by some researchers when used for cementitious composites [5,6,18].

In this paper, a proposed methodology that is based on the combination of the above mentioned techniques and approaches has been applied to determine macroscale elastic properties of a high performance concrete (HPC) based on nanoindentation mechanical tests.

The high performance concrete analyzed further in this paper composes of heterogeneous cementitious matrix (based on blended cement and fly-ash), plasticizing admixture and different sizes of aggregates. Intrinsic porosity appears on a broad range of scales in this composite (nm–mm).

Before proceeding with the application of homogenization methods, it was necessary to divide the analyzed composite into characteristic levels. In the present study, the microstructure of the analyzed composites was separated into two levels, namely the matrix level (Level I) and the mortar level (Level II).

The Level I was characterized by all the matrix phases having characteristic dimensions less than d
                     ≈10μm, i.e. hydration products, clinker and fly-ash. Due to small dimensions of the phases at this level, mechanical properties are accessible by nanoindentation. If massive grid indentation is applied [19,20], then not only intrinsic phase properties but also their volume fractions can be obtained. The RVE size of this level, which also corresponds to the indentation grid size, is of ≈100μm; hence, the scale separability condition [13,21], i.e.

                     holds, where h is the indent size (which determines the tested material volume), d the characteristic inclusion size, and L is the RVE size. The situation is further presented in Fig. 5.

The homogenization corresponds to a technique used to upscale the mechanical properties from the microscale to the upper level to find the effective properties of the RVE. In this paper, the elastic homogenization was performed by means of the analytical Mori–Tanaka scheme [22]. This scheme describes a composite by a morphologically prevailing matrix (the reference medium) reinforced by distinct non-continuous spherical inclusions. Both matrix and inclusions are assumed to be elastically isotropic. Due to its simplicity and wide range of applicability, it was successfully used also for cementitious materials [18,21]. In the Mori–Tanaka method, the homogenized bulk and shear moduli of a r-phase composite are assessed based on the following relations

                        where the subscript 0 and r corresponds to the reference medium and to a particular inclusion respectively. Thus, k
                        0 and μ
                        0 are the bulk and shear moduli of the reference medium, while k

                           r
                         refer to the inclusion phases. These values are the input to the equations that define the homogenized elastic modulus. Further, the bulk and shear moduli can be recomputed to the elastic modulus and the Poisson’s ratio as follows

The problem of finding strains and stresses in the microscopically inhomogeneous RVE can be solved by several numerical techniques, e.g. with finite element method. The numerical scheme used in this paper solves the problem of finding the effective elasticity tensor with a periodically repeating RVE by using discretization of an integral Lippmann–Schwinger equation that decomposes the local strain into homogeneous (macroscopic) and fluctuation parts as

                        0, which is a parameter of the method proposed by Moulinec and Suquet [17].

The problem is further discretized using trigonometric collocation method [23], which leads to the assemblage of a non-symmetrical linear system of equations. The system can be resolved e.g. by the conjugate gradient method as proposed by Zeman et al. [15]. Elastic constants received from grid nanoindentation have been used as input parameters for this FFT homogenization with the assumption of plane strain conditions.

The resulting homogenized elastic stiffness matrix is positive definite, symmetric but generally anisotropic. The differences in stiffness matrices obtained from the methods can be characterized by some suitable norms [5]. The analytical Mori–Tanaka scheme assumes material isotropy. If we further assume (in agreement with the FFT method) plane strain conditions, then the analytically computed stiffness matrix (in the Mandel’s notation) is given by

                        Both methods have certain advantages and some drawbacks. Although the Mori–Tanaka method uses simplified morphological assumptions and assumes an isotropic distribution of phases, it is fast and applicable to a wide range of solutions. The FFT method, on the other hand, is more general. It takes possible anisotropy into account and its precision depends only on the density of discretization (grid) points. The grid points of the FFT solution may coincide with the indentation matrix, which provides a perfect link between the methods. The density of the points used in nanoindentation is usually sufficient for providing good accuracy if the stiffness contrast between the phases is not very large. Nevertheless, it might be uneasy to achieve sufficient grid density for cases with a very high stiffness contrast of the phases (e.g. in case of air inclusions). Both methods are well applicable for the matrix level as shown later in this paper.

In this section, the details on tests performed with a high-performance composite at different levels of observation are presented. The tests were carried out with one mortar mixture denoted as HPC1. The mixture was produced with cement CEM II/A-S 52.5N, high-range water reducing admixture (Stachement 2000) and fly-ash from the brown coal power plant Ledvice, in Czech Republic. In addition, a composition of two fine quartz sands, namely S1 and S2, with different grain size limits were used as aggregates. These are composed by SiO2 (99.2%) and Fe2O3 (0.04%). The aggregate composition included 50vol.% of S1 (with the grain size range varying from 0.63mm to 1.25mm) and 50vol.% of S2 (with the grain size range varying from 0.10mm to 0.63mm). The composition of HPC1 (in mass and volume) is listed in Table 1
                     . The initial consistency of the mortar, which was determined through the standard flow-table test without applying strokes, was of 240±10mm.

For the measurement at microscale level, a cylindrical sample of 30mm in diameter was prepared and nanoindentation testing was performed. After casting, the specimens were sealed with plastic foil and kept in the mold for 24h. Next, they were demolded and stored in water for 20days until the tests were performed. The cylindrical specimens for testing were cut out from the middle section of a larger volume by using a precision diamond saw. After drying, the surfaces were grinded by SiC papers with grit of #2000 and #4000, polished by cloth with 0.25μm diamond spray, and cleaned by washing in alcohol and ultrasonic bathing. The resulting surface roughness was checked with AFM to be less than 60nm on 20×20μm area and less than 20nm on 5×5μm area.

The nanoindentation measurements were carried out in the CSM Nanohardness tester® machine. The three-sided pyramidal indenter tip (Berkovich) was used to perform several massive grids of 16×18=288 indents in each with the mutual indent’s distance of 8μm (Fig. 2
                        ). Even if the indentation locations were carefully selected by a high magnification optical microscope prior to testing to ensure that they lie away from large aggregates, part of the grids lay at the place of increased roughness (caused mainly by mechanical effects during polishing) in some cases. If this was the case, such indents were not considered in final evaluation. The total number of relevant indents reached ≈550 which provided sufficiently large statistical amount of data. The statistical representativeness of the data was also checked successively on datasets consisting of different number of points. It was found that the distribution of elastic stiffness does not fluctuate significantly for datasets containing more than ≈280 indents. Thus, the microstructure at the selected locations composed of all the cementitious matrix phases in a sufficient content.

Hence, the dimension ≈100μm was considered as a RVE on the matrix level (Level I). The individual indent size, represented by the depth of penetration h, was chosen to be h
                        ≈200nm so that the affected volume under the indenter, which can be estimated as 3×h≈600nm [21], was smaller than the characteristic sizes of inclusions to avoid significant phase interactions; therefore, the scale separability condition, detailed in Eq. (1), is verified.

Notice, however, that the complete exclusion of phase interactions can hardly be achieved because the dense matrix of a high performance composite is composed of several phases of different stiffness. Due to surface roughness, which cannot be further decreased by mechanical way [24], the indent size must be kept in the order of hundreds of nm. The indent size within the range of 100–300nm suits well the concept of grid indentation on cement pastes [21]. It can be assumed that hard clinker or fly-ash particles (of maximum ≈60μm size) in larger volumes can also cause stiffening of less stiff phases like C–S–H gels during indentation. The error incorporated into the measurements can be roughly quantified by FEM computation as 13–25% [25]. Similar errors are incorporated into measurement of stiff inclusions surrounded by a compliant matrix; nonetheless, their content is smaller therefore their influence also decreases. The sources of errors presented in this paragraph are naturally included in nanoindentation measurements and should be taken into account when comparing the upscale results and those obtained from macroscale measurements.

The nanoindentation loading regime contained loading at 12mN/min, holding for 10s and unloading at 12mN/min (Fig. 2b). The holding period of 10s was added to minimize creep effects on the elastic unloading [26]. The elastic modulus of the analyzed phase was determined according to the methodology proposed by Oliver and Pharr [11]. The analysis is based on an analytical solution for a cone punched into the elastic isotropic half-space and uses the following equations to define the indentation (reduced) modulus

The results of elastic properties received from different phases by nanoindentation are treated with the help of statistical analysis since it is not possible to distinguish mechanically dissimilar phases just by optical or SEM analyses [20]. Therefore, statistical deconvolution [4,21] of elastic modulus histograms was applied to determine the individual phase properties from the overall frequency plot assembled from all relevant measurements. The method seeks parameters of n Gauss distributions in an experimental probability density function (PDF), see Fig. 3
                        . The theoretical PDF is given by the following sum of r distributions as

In the deconvolution, a minimization procedure based on the quadratic deviations between experimentally measured and theoretically computed (see Eq. (15)) overall PDFs is calculated to find the best fit [4,5,20].

In the present work, the number of searched phases was fixed to four based on the number of characteristic peaks in the PDF. The dominant phases in the PDF need not necessarily to correlate with the chemically distinct phases, and they are further considered as mechanically distinct phases in the homogenization procedure (see the discussion in Section 5.2).

The mechanical properties of HPC1 were investigated through static and dynamic tests. The former corresponds to a standard measurement of modulus of elasticity, which also allows for measuring the compressive strength on the macrolevel. The later, on the other hand, is a non-destructive test that allows for obtaining macroscopic elastic modulus and the Poisson’s ratio. In both static and dynamic tests, prismatic specimens with 40×40×160mm (height×width×length) were used for the evaluation of the elastic modulus. The specimens were handled in the same way than the specimens that were used in the microscale measurements. Prior to testing, the top and bottom ends of the specimens were polished to obtain flat parallel surfaces.

For the static test, the load was measured by a beam load cell (MTS 100kN) attached to the electromechanical actuator. To measure the displacement of the specimens, the test apparatus included two axial extensometers with gauge length of 25mm and 50mm. The extensometers were located on the lateral surfaces of the samples and the centric loading was checked at the beginning of each test. In total, four loading cycles (Fig. 1a) were performed on each sample to exclude the initial inelasticity. The elastic modulus was computed from the linear part of the last cycle in the stress–strain curve as depicted in Fig. 1b. During the last cycle, the loading continued until the ultimate load was reached, and the uniaxial compressive strength was computed based on the obtained value.

For the dynamic test, the impulse excitation method was used. This method is based on the measurement of the fundamental resonant frequencies for longitudinal, transversal, or torsional vibrations of the specimen. In all cases, the prismatic specimen was excited by an impact hammer on one end, at which the impact force was recorded, and the acceleration resultant from the impact was recorded on the opposite end of the specimen. The vibration modes were excited with supports located in the respective nodal positions, i.e. at the midspan for both longitudinal and torsional modes. The signals were analyzed in a frequency domain, and the frequency response function was evaluated after the fast Fourier transformation. Then, the fundamental resonant frequency was determined. The elastic modulus was evaluated from the equation for longitudinal vibration of the beam with continuously distributed mass with free-free boundary condition, i.e.

The results obtained from the static testing profile are summarized in Table 2
                        . The corresponding compressive strength results are presented in the same table. In particular, the average value obtained for the tested samples, i.e. f
                        
                           c
                        
                        =47.4MPa, is assumed to be the compressive strength of HPC1. The results from the dynamic testing obtained by the impulse excitation method with longitudinal vibration, see Eq. (16), are listed in Table 2. The impulse method also provided an estimate of the sample Poisson’s ratio, see Eq. (18), which was found to be 0.19. Due to the higher loading rate, which is the physical nature of the test, the dynamic elastic modulus tends to be higher than the result from the static test. Nonetheless, the results from Table 2 indicate that agreement between the two methods, within 6.0%, was attained.

Regarding the microscale measurements, 550 indents to the cementitious matrix were performed in total. Examples of the load-penetration curves and related load/penetration-time diagrams showing indents to differently stiff phases are presented in Fig. 4
                        . All relevant indents were analyzed by the Oliver–Pharr method [11] for an elastic modulus with the assumption of constant Poisson’s ratio (0.20). This is a reasonable assumption because the influence of the selected Poisson’s ratio in the relevant range 0.18–0.22 on the evaluation is very small [18]. Next, the frequency plots, with bin size set to 1.0GPa, and related experimental probability density functions (PDFs) were computed. Further, the deconvolution method was applied to the obtained PDFs as illustrated in Fig. 3. The results from this analysis, i.e. the elastic moduli and correspondent volume fractions, are listed in Table 3
                        .

The results from Table 3 are considered as results received on mechanically distinct phases and there is no intention to link them with pure chemical phases, such as C–S–H gels with different densities, Ca(OH)2 (Portlandite) and interfacial zones [6,18,21]. Aside the clinker and fly-ash residues, the majority of the hydrated volume in our samples is composed of C–S–H gels and partly Ca(OH)2. The volume of Ca(OH)2 is decreased compared to pure Portland cement hydration since large amount of Portlandite is consumed in the pozzolanic reaction with fly-ash [28]. However, it is still present in some extent dispersed in the C–S–H phase. Although results from deconvolution present mechanically distinct phases rather than chemically distinct phases, they are closely related. Based on the SEM imaging, cement chemistry and mixture composition, the following assumptions were taken into account to proceed with the analysis:
                           
                              
                                 Phase A
                              
                              is composed of low stiffness porous phases.

contains the majority of the main hydration products, such as C–S–H gels and partly Ca (OH)2.

is composed of high stiffness hydration products, e.g. high stiffness C–S–H and partly Ca (OH)2.

contains the remaining non-hydrated clinker and fly-ash.

The original ill-posed problem of the deconvolution into infinite number of distributions is regularized by using the aforementioned four phases having a clear physical meaning related to the microstructural composition. The mechanically distinct phases are represented by significant peaks in the experimental PDF of elastic moduli and are identified by the minimization procedure in the deconvolution algorithm. The deconvolution procedure was further checked by using the same methodology to hardness measurements (0.1GPa bin size was assumed in the construction of PDF). The algorithm converged to the qualitatively analogous distributions of the four phases as shown in Fig. 3b and thus the results were found to be consistent with the results obtained for elastic modulus. Numerical results of the mean hardness values estimated for individual mechanical phases are summarized in Table 3.

Because of the unavoidable phase interactions, the obtained elastic moduli do not represent the exact material constants for pure phases, which is manifested mainly for the stiffest components, such as the clinker, whose elastic modulus reaches ∼130GPa on a pure clinker sample [26,29]. Nevertheless, the separation of the mechanical performance of the individual components is not possible from the measured response, and the influence of interactions can be just estimated. Further, the evaluated micromechanical values are considered as the first estimates and as such they neglect the interaction phenomena in the following upscaling.

Because the volume affected by the indentation is of ≈0.6μm3, it is assumed that all the pores smaller than this limit are naturally included in the indentation results. These pores includes mainly nanoporosity. However, a relativelly small fraction of pores with the dimension of 0.6–10μm (i.e. 1/10RVE) also lies in the Level I but cannot be detected by the nanoindenter. Therefore, this porosity was included as an additional mechanical phase in the Level I (Table 4
                        ).

To assess the Level I porosity that derives from pores in the range from 0.6μm to 10μm, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was performed on the crushed pieces of the composites of the size of ≈5mm. The experimental results, see 
                        Fig. 6
                        , indicate a porosity of 3.3vol.% for HPC1.

Based on the results from deconvolution of nanoindentation measurements and porosimetry, the Mori–Tanaka and FFT-based homogenization schemes were implemented. The obtained results for the homogenized elastic modulus and the Poisson’s ratio for the Level I are presented in Table 4.

The results from Table 4 show that the application of the FFT-based numerical scheme resulted in the effective matrix stiffness that was very consistent with the analytical results. The isotropic stiffness matrix (computed from the Mori–Tanaka results using Eq. (9)) was

                         matrix is characterized by a very small degree of anisotropy, which is caused mainly by almost uniform dispersion of the phases in the evaluated volume. Note also that negative components in Eq. (21) have no physical meaning and are just a product of the (small) anisotropic character of the (positive definite and symmetric) matrix.

Such result also justifies the use of a simple Mori–Tanaka scheme that is based on isotropic phase distribution. The diagonal components of the matrix in Eq. (21) correspond to the range of isotropic elastic moduli of 39.1–39.9GPa (Table 4).

Further, the level of the whole mortar (Level II) was constructed. It consisted of the homogenized phase of the Level I (matrix) and the rest of components in the composite, in particular, large sand particles, aggregates, and air voids. The latter comprises capillary pores with diameter ⩾10μm and large air voids from entrapped air ⩾1.0mm. Because the aggregate does not change chemically in the composite throughout the hydration process, its portion is given by the initial mixture proportions that were presented in Table 1. The elastic modulus and the Poisson’s ratio of the aggregates were assumed as 71.8GPa and 0.17 respectively [30]. Sometimes, an additional phase is considered as a separate phase in multiscale models. This phase corresponds to an interfacial zone (ITZ) between the matrix and the aggregate. In the present study, the properties of possible ITZ are naturally included in the nanoindentation data (Level I) since the indentation grid was squeezed between the large aggregate. Also, the very dense matrix itself consists of possibly interconnecting ITZs surrounding the pure phases.

Due to the large span of the pore diameters, which ranges from μm to mm, a combination of imaging techniques was used to assess the porosity of Level II. Image analysis was employed on segmented back-scattered (BSE) electron and optical images (OI). The segmentation was performed on the thresholded binary images as illustrated in Fig. 7
                        . The medium size porosity, i.e. 10μm to 1.0mm, was assessed from BSE images with 25× magnification. An example of the BSE image is presented in Fig. 7. In total, fifteen different images were analyzed and the results averaged. In particular, the analysis yielded 11.25% of porosity (Table 5
                        ). Further, the pores larger than 1.0mm (mainly entrapped air pores) were assessed similarly from 10× magnification OI (Fig. 8
                        ). The analysis indicates 0.47% of porosity (Table 5). Finally, the Mori–Tanaka homogenization scheme was implemented. The results of elastic modulus and the Poisson’s ratio are presented in Table 5 for the Level II.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The relative error between the results obtained from the macroscale elastic modulus tests (Table 2) and homogenized values (Table 5) is within the order of tens of percent for both static (E
                     
                        s
                     ) and dynamic (E
                     
                        d
                     ) analysis, see Table 6
                     . These results indicate similar trend; therefore, the presented analysis allowed for determining the macroscopic elastic properties of the studied composite. Despite the average difference of 14.3% between upscaled (E
                     
                        hom
                     ) and measured (E
                     
                        s
                      and E
                     
                        d
                     ) values, the results are correct and realistic.

As mentioned in Section 4.1, the evaluation of nanoindentation tests is not error-free. In the case of HPC, which consists of a dense matrix with several phases of different stiffness and also interfacial (matrix/aggregate) zones, the interaction between the matrix and these phases can affect the final nanoindentation results. Hence, it can be assumed that the difference between macroscale and upscaled results derives from the phase interactions influencing the nanoindentation results.

The macroscopic results were verified by two independent techniques and the results from theirs are similar (Table 2). The influence of the evaluation by deconvolution can also be taken into account. The analytical homogenization of the Level I (based on deconvolution results and Mori–Tanaka scheme) was verified with the numerical FFT-based method that provided similar results (2.9% difference on average). The Level II homogenization was based on mixture proportions and independent image analysis results. Therefore, the overall error must come from the basic indentation data used in the Level I homogenization. To decrease the effect of interactions and thus refine the computations in their quality, it would be necessary to decrease the indentation size, provided that the surface had smaller roughness. Nevertheless, such refinement is hardly achievable with standard polishing techniques that provide surface roughness at least in the order of several tens of nanometers on the given sample composition.

Although errors are present, the use of nanoindentation tests cannot be either discarded or substituted since it corresponds to the best experimental technique that allows for direct assessment of the mechanical properties of material volumes with dimensions on the nanometer scale, which is the reason why this technique has been chosen in this research.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

It was shown in the paper that the proposed methodology allows for an easy and realistic assessment of elastic stiffness of high performance concrete based on simple two-scale homogenization, nanoindentation results and porosimetry. The strength of the methodology lies in the combination of reliable experimental and numerical techniques that are not demanding in terms of computational and experimental time and costs but can effectively reach the given goal. The techniques are general enough to accommodate for a change in material composition in connection with possible optimization.

Also, it was shown that nanoindentation can serve as valuable tool for accessing either individual phase properties (needed by analytical homogenization schemes) or as a source for grid data (required by numerical methods, as FFT). Both approaches perform equally well for the case of isotropically distributed phases within the material microstructure. The difference between the stiffness matrices received from these methods was only 4.3%.

The upper model level was handled with the analytical Mori–Tanaka scheme, which allowed for simple incorporation of non-reactive aggregate phases as well as of air voids. The comparison with macroscopic measurements (both static and dynamic moduli) showed good agreement. The ≈14% error is caused likely by the phase interactions within the dense cementitious matrix and is already included in nanoindentation results.

The proposed methodology offers a cost-effective tool for virtual testing of the macroscale mechanical performance of HPC, which includes a mix of different chemical and mechanical phases at microscale. The simplicity of the two-level model has a high potential to be attractive to concrete industry and it can help reduce the total volume of macroscopic experimental work spent to analyze various cementitious mixtures.
