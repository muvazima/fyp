                  Various signaling techniques have been considered for I/O interconnects at 25 Gb/s or higher. However, they either suffer from high baud rate, as in the case of NRZ, or an excess signal-to-noise ratio penalty, as in the case of PAM-4. To overcome these problems, a four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol (PSS-4) signaling method is proposed that can be readily applied to high-speed I/O transceivers. By using PSS-4, the SNR penalty can be reduced from PAM-4; our theoretical analysis has revealed that the SNR performance of the PSS-4 is 6.5 dB better than that of PAM-4 with comparable bandwidth. The transistor-level simulation results have shown that PSS-4 has an average of twice larger vertical eye opening than PAM-4. In addition, the supply voltage sensitivity of PSS-4 is 55% and 20% less than that of PAM-4 and NRZ, respectively, and the power consumption of PSS-4 is 13.5% lower than that of PAM-4.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

I/O interconnects of high-density multi-core system are facing substantial scaling problems to satisfy per-pin data rate requirements. As data rates reach 25 Gb/s or even higher [1–3], signal-integrity issues are severely aggravated by unexpected effects, such as attenuations, reflections, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and crosstalk. Transmitter feed-forward pre-emphasis and receiver equalization techniques [4] have been widely used in I/O transceivers to mitigate these issues. However, higher bandwidth requires I/O transceivers to incorporate a larger number of equalization taps into the equalizers, which can increase the circuit cost and power consumption dramatically.

To relax the I/O design, a concept of transferring multiple bits per symbol by modulation techniques has been proposed to increase the I/O throughput. To facilitate the I/O interconnects in multi-core systems, various signaling methods have been employed, most noticeably four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) [5,6]. By transmitting two bits per symbol, PAM-4 suffers lower channel loss than non-return-to-zero (NRZ). However, for a given maximum voltage limit, the distance between each voltage level in PAM-4 is only one third of that of NRZ, resulting in a 9.5 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty [7]. This drawback can severely lead to a reduced eye opening (especially eye height) so that it can be difficult to make far-end decision even when enhanced equalization techniques are incorporated. Although raising supply voltage, to certain extent, can help alleviate this SNR problem, such practice would have adverse impacts on power consumption and design complexity, creating a much bigger integration problem in multi-core systems that often require a large number of I/O transceivers.

In this paper, we thus attempt to address the aforementioned problems by developing a novel optimal signaling method for high-speed I/O interconnects. The major contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

                        
                           •
                           We explore a four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol signaling method for I/O interconnects referred to as PSS-4, that can overcome the problems experienced by PAM-4 as well as other multi-level signaling. We will show that PSS-4 can reduce the symbol rate by half with only a 3.0 dB SNR penalty; this is much lower than for PAM-4. In addition, we propose a novel pre-emphasis technique to compress the bandwidth occupied by PSS-4, referred to as PSS-4-PE.

We propose the de-cycling circuit to make the usage of clock signals as symbol patterns available. To mitigate the ISI, we propose a current-mode encoder with pre-emphasis to generate the PSS-4 symbols. On the receiver side, receiver equalization schemes and timing recovery circuit along with decoding schemes are proposed to recover the symbols.

We extensively evaluate the proposed PSS-4 signaling method through transistor-level simulations and compare PSS-4 with NRZ and PAM-4 when applied to the I/O interconnects.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the related work on signaling method of I/O interconnects and Section 3 describes the proposed PSS-4 signaling method. The I/O transceiver architecture and circuits based on PSS-4 are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results along with performance analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

In the literature, a number of signaling and modulation techniques have been considered in I/O interconnect designs [5]. For instance, as a popular multi-level signaling method, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is shown to be spectral efficient in a band-limited channel, and it has found its successful applications in I/O interconnects [7]. A common belief is that PAM-4 is compatible to via-stubbed backplane channels since the frequency-domain notch severely limits the effective channel bandwidth. The main advantage of PAM-4 is that at the same bit-rate, PAM-4 suffers less channel loss than NRZ due to its reduced symbol rate. However, one big problem of PAM-4 is attributed to its circuit overhead and power consumption as a result of four-level transmissions. Many architectural improvements and circuit techniques thereby have been proposed to address the power consumption and voltage swing problems of using PAM-4 signaling. In [8], a bit-sliced architecture for the PAM-4 data path was proposed, along with a voltage-shifting amplifier to generate programmable offset to the differential signals. Instead of using current-mode logic circuits used in most PAM-4 transceiver designs, Song et al. demonstrated a voltage-mode PAM-4 driver [9] that consumes lower power consumption. Nevertheless, focusing primarily on power consumption, all these PAM-4 transceiver designs still suffer from reduced eye-opening, which can be a more pronounced problem in high speed I/Os. To alleviate this problem, several designs [5,6] incorporated multi-mode signaling into one single transceiver, ensuring that transceiver works in an optimal signaling mode for different channel and noise scenarios. However, optimum performance of these multi-mode transceivers comes with prohibitively high hardware complexity, largely due to the mode-selection logic.

Other than PAM-4, phase modulation [10] and pulse-width modulation [11,12] have also been considered, where multiple bits per unit interval are represented with either varying pulse widths or different transition edges. Although the complexity of the circuit components, such as clock data recovery (CDR) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that are needed to detect multiple voltage levels, are low, precise control of the transition positions turns out to be quite challenging, particularly true for the transceivers seen in high-speed CMOS I/O interconnects.

As another multi-bit signaling method, the four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol signaling (PSS-4), was first introduced in [13]. Result of this preliminary study indicated that PSS-4 is an efficient signaling method that can be employed by high-speed I/O interconnects, like the ones in high-density multi-core systems. As an extension of [13], PSS-4 is studied thoroughly at both system and circuit levels in this paper.

In PSS-4 signaling, every symbol includes two bits as they are represented by one of the four phases, as shown in Fig. 1
                        (a). Since PSS-4 transmits only one half cycle of a sine waveform in each unit interval (UI), the frequency of the sine wave is literally reduced by half. For instance, for a data rate of 25 Gb/s, the baud rate now is set to be 12.5 Gbaud/s and sine waveform at 6.25 GHz with a half-cycle width is actually used as transmission symbol. The four symbol patterns produce two eyes within one UI and they have the same decision threshold for decoding.

As shown in Fig. 1(a), four types of phase-shifted sine waves with 90° offsets are gray-coded to ensure that between any two adjacent neighbors of the PSS-4 symbols, there is exactly one bit difference. If four types of symbols are overlapped, there can be two opening eyes in one UI, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In simple terms, the spectral efficiency of PSS-4 is 2-bit/s/Hz. In this section, we will provide a theoretical comparison between PSS-4 and other existing I/O signaling methods (NRZ and PAM-4).

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as the mean of the outermost symbol divided by the standard deviation of the individual error terms, including inter-symbol interference (ISI), crosstalk, Gaussian noise, and jitter-induced amplitude error. All the errors are modeled as a Gaussian random variable with variance of σ

                        [14]. The SNR can be described by

                        where D is the outermost voltage level and σ is the standard deviation of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

Consider M-level signaling, where the inner symbols in the PAM-M constellation are more prone to errors by a factor of 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                        . In addition, the argument of the complementary error function is reduced by a factor of 
                           
                              1

                         to account for the reduction of the distance between symbols when the peak amplitude D is held constant. Therefore, the symbol error rate (SER) of multi-level signaling can be calculated as a function of SNR, as given below [14]:

For a given peak voltage, the voltage level at the decision point of PSS-4 signaling is 0.7 times that of NRZ. Decoding of PSS-4 signals depends on the sampling value at the decision points. Therefore, the SER of PSS-4 can be calculated as the voltage distance between two adjacent voltage levels that are normalized to

Defined as the SNR at the decision point minus the SNR required to achieve the target SER, the SNR margin [14] is used as a metric for performance evaluation. The error probabilities of various signaling methods are shown in Fig. 2
                        . For example, in order to achieve an SER of 1E
                           −
                        12, the SNR values of NRZ, PAM-4, and PSS-4 must be 16.9 dB, 26.5 dB, and 19.9 dB, respectively. As can be seen, the SNR penalty of PAM-4 is 9.5 dB against NRZ, while the SNR penalty of PSS-4 is only 3.0 dB, a significant improvement of 6.5 dB.

Another consideration in the choice of the signaling technique for I/O interconnects is the power spectral density (PSD). The PSD is compared to illustrate the anticipated benefit for bandwidth limited channels. The PSD of the PSS-4 signaling method differs from multi-level signaling. First, we can calculate the PSD for the two-phase shifted sinusoid symbol (PSS-2), as given below:

Interestingly, the two horizontal symmetric eyes in PSS-4 symbols may be asymmetrically sensitive to the channel-induced ISI. It appears that the left eye suffers more ISIs than the right eye does. Therefore, we use a PSS-4 pre-emphasis (PSS-4-PE) technique to compensate for the channel loss. Different from the pre-emphasis techniques used in typical amplitude modulation, the PSS-4-PE pre-emphasizes the left eye or de-emphasizes the right eye, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . As a result, the symbol eye-diagram of PSS-4-PE would be no longer horizontally symmetric and the duty-cycle (α) of a symbol is no longer 0.5. By shifting the common-mode voltage with a normalized amplitude of A, we can get the corresponding duty-cycle as

In addition, to avoid the right eye closing, the duty-cycle of a symbol has to be confined to a range of

                        . According to the eye-diagram shown in Fig. 3, one can see the PSS-4-PE is a combination of a PSS-4 symbol and a half-rate NRZ symbol with an amplitude of A. Therefore, the PSD of PSS-4-PE is given as

The power spectral densities of 25 Gb/s signals of NRZ, PAM-4, PSS-4, and PSS-4-PE are depicted in Fig. 4
                        (a). Two designs of PSS-4-PE with α = 0.55 and α = 0.66 are compared with the standard PSS-4. From Eqs. (7) and (8), one can see that the PSD of the PSS-4-PE is a function of the duty-cycle, α. As the value of α increases, the slope of PSS-4-PEs PSD gets closer to that of PAM-4. According to (8), PSS-4-PE shifts the majority of PSS-4 signal power to low-frequency region by adding three items with reduced symbol rate (2Tb
                        ). Theoretically, the signal can suffer less channel loss than the standard PSS-4.


                        Fig. 4(b) plots the integral signal power based on a brick-wall frequency response. As can be seen, for PAM-4, 94.4% of the signal power is located below 12.5 GHz. For comparison, the total signal powers of PSS-4-PE with α = 0.66, PSS-4-PE with α = 0.55, standard PSS-4, and NRZ at a brick-wall cutoff of 12.5 GHz are 93.9%, 91.2%, 88.9%, and 85.2%, respectively. From the spectral perspective, PAM-4 outperforms the others as it requires the lowest bandwidth.

However, all the bandwidth compression techniques mentioned above improve the bandwidth at the expense of SNR. In other words, to achieve the same SNR, the transmission power of PAM-4 needs to be increased by a factor of 3 compared to NRZ, while for PSS-4, its power needs only go up by a factor of 
                           
                              2
                           
                        . For PSS-4-PE signals, the minimum SNR is limited by the right eye. Therefore, by calculating the normalized amplitude at the decision point in the right eye, one can get that in theory, the transmission powers of PSS-4-PE with α = 0.66 and PSS-4-PE with α = 0.55 need to be boosted up by factors of 1.93 and 1.45, respectively.

From Table 1
                        , taking both of SNR and PSD into consideration, one can see that the PSS-4-PE signal with α = 0.66 achieves the similar bandwidth performance as PAM-4 but saves transmission power by 33% (i.e., 3–1.93). In essence, the PAM-4 needs three decision threshold levels while PSS-4-PE only needs one, which implies circuit complexity of PSS-4-PE can be potentially much lower than that of PAM-4.

A generic transceiver architecture based on the proposed PSS-4 signaling is shown in Fig. 5
                     . Without loss of generality, we assume that the data block size is n ( ≥ 8) bits; that is, at every cycle, n parallel bits will arrive at the transmitter for transmission. PSS-4 uses sine waves to represent the symbols as opposed to square waves or trapezoidal waves with a fixed transition-time which are used in multi-level signaling. Since the sine waves can be obtained readily from clock-generation circuits, the pulse-shaping circuit is no longer needed for PSS-4. However, clock signals cannot be used directly for PSS-4 patterns. There are two types of clock signals for different uses: CMOS logic and current mode logic (CML). The CML clock is used as the symbol pattern, while the CMOS clock, which is regenerated by a cascaded CMOS buffer, is used to control the de-cycling module. The de-cycling module recovers the symbol patterns from the CML clock, after which signals are pre-emphasized to cancel the ISI.

On the receiver side, a variable-gain amplifier (VGA) [16] is employed to ensure linear operation on the received signal. After VGA, a two-stage continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) is necessary to compensate for the channel loss. After equalization, two eyes can be opened up in each UI. In this case, two StrongArm comparators [17] are used to sample the voltage levels at the center of each individual eye. The CMOS clock recovered by the CDR module is used to align the edges. The two sampled values are decoded directly, according to the symbol patterns shown in Fig. 1(a).

One distinct advantage of the proposed PSS-4 signaling method is the simplicity of symbol generation. As only half a cycle of one sine wave is needed to generate one symbol for transmission, the multiphase outputs of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in a delay-locked loop (DLL), for example, are sufficient for this purpose.

Consider a transceiver with a data rate of 25 Gb/s. In this case, the transmitter needs to transmit the four-phase shifted symbols, which essentially are half cycle sine waves with a frequency of 6.25 GHz. These symbols are alternatively selected by the two 12.5 Gb/s bit streams, referred as

                         streams at every other cycle to ensure correct symbol generation. Fig. 6(c) shows the inverted bits that produce the correct symbols. Note that, in contrast to the symbol sources that are CML signals, the Clock signals (Clk_p and Clk_n) used for de-cycling are CMOS signals with a rail-to-rail swing.

After de-cycling, the two separated half-rate bit streams, Even and Odd, can be used to produce the symbol patterns. As shown in Fig. 7
                        (a), one simple way is a voltage-mode encoder working as a 4:1 selector, and this selector can be implemented using differential pass-transistor logic (DPTL) [18] to select one of the four symbol patterns in each UI. Note that this transmission-gate-based implementation suffers from low driving capability and large data-dependent jitter. As an alternative, an encoder based on current-mode logic with pseudo-NMOS transistors serving as the loads is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7(b). As a ratioed logic implementation, the output swing is limited due to the stacked nature of the transistors. In today’s CMOS technology, ∼ 200 mV of the voltage headroom for each stack of the CML encoder is required. With a supply voltage (V
                        DD) of 1.2 V, 300–400 mV of the peak voltage swing can be obtained.

In order to facilitate the pre-emphasis, the proposed encoder incorporates additional duty-cycle control circuit at the encoder output. According to Fig. 3, the pre-emphasis of PSS-4 can be implemented by increasing common-mode voltages when pattern11 and pattern10 are present, and decreasing common-mode voltages for pattern01 and pattern00. Therefore, a differential pair biased by

By changing the duty-cycle of the symbol, we can pre-emphasize the PSS-4 symbol to cancel the ISI and thus minimize the asymmetry of sensitivity of left and right eyes in PSS4. The effects of the pre-emphasis technique on circuit cost and delay, however, should be estimated as well. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the PSS-4 encoder is implemented with CML buffers. Considering the small-signal half-circuit of the encoder is approximated by the simple RC circuits, the total delay of the PSS-4 encoder with pre-emphasis technique can be calculated as

                         is the external load capacitance, which consists of the sum of the wiring and total fan-out capacitances of the circuits. Since the transistor sizes of the pre-emphasis differential pair (M17 and M18 in Fig. 7(b)) are equal to those of the other four differential pairs (M1–M8 in Fig. 7(b)), the incremental delay due to the pre-emphasis technique would be 25%.

As to the circuit cost of the pre-emphasis technique, there is exactly extra power consumption due to the incorporation of the tail current, I
                        DCC. Since the dynamic power dissipation of CML circuit is ignorable with respect to static power. The total power of PSS-4 encoder with pre-emphasis technique is mainly determined by static power, calculated as

Therefore, the relative power consumption of pre-emphasis technique with respect to the total power of the encoder is a function of the duty-cycle of the symbol, α. For example, if the duty-cycle is 0.66, the power consumption of the PSS-4 encoder would be increased by 48% with respect to that without pre-emphasis technique. In the case that no pre-emphasis is needed, this feature can be disabled by a control signal, Dis_preemphasis.

The receiver employs a cascaded two-stage CTLE [19] to cancel the channel-induced ISI, and each stage has individual bandwidth requirements. Due to the bandwidth compression nature of PSS-4 and PAM-4 signaling, the equalization requirement can be relaxed. As shown in Fig. 8
                        (a), the VGA uses a resistive source degeneration network while the CTLE consists of a differential pair that has both resistive and capacitive source degeneration networks. Both the resistive source degeneration in VGA (R
                        
                           S1) and capacitive source degeneration in CTLE (C
                        
                           S2 and C
                        
                           S3) are controlled by 9 thermometer-coded bits, providing a total of 10 settings with different locations of zeros and poles.

CTLE, along with VGA, is used to cover the entire frequency range of interest. The configurations of VGA and CTLE are shown in Fig. 8(a). The key parameters of VGA and CTLE are the boost and the peak frequency. Boost is defined as the high-frequency gain divided by its low-frequency gain, and the peak frequency is the frequency at which VGA and CTLE have the largest boost. In order to achieve high-frequency compensation, the second-stage CTLE incorporates a negative-capacitance feedback network [20] to enhance the bandwidth.


                        Fig. 8 (b) also displays a slow PVT corner simulation of transfer function for VGA and CTLE with 10 settings. The two stages of CTLE have different tradeoffs between the gain and the bandwidth. The first-stage CTLE gains a boost of 11.5–18.8 dB at the frequency range of 6.8–14.1 GHz, while the second-stage CTLE mainly covers high-frequency range (i.e., 14.2–21.3 GHz) at a cost of attenuating low-frequency signal components. In general, the first-stage CTLE covers a wider frequency range than the second-stage CTLE, while the second-stage CTLE produces a higher boost for high-frequency signal components.

After equalization, the clock used for decoding along with the symbols should be in synchronization. The bang–bang phase-detector and phase-rotator [16] could be used to extract the timing information. For purposes of simplicity, the symbol patterns of pattern00 and pattern11 are chosen as the training patterns. During the training phase, the other two patterns of pattern01 and pattern10 are ignored which can be controlled by the bit-streams of Even and Odd, making the eye diagram of PSS-4 close to that of a half-rate NRZ. In this case, the center of a symbol, ‘C’ in Fig. 9
                        (a), could be determined, which sits in the middle between ‘A’ and ‘B’, ideally. Although ‘C’ is not the actual sampling position, we could still shift the clock phase towards ‘A’ and ‘B’, using the center of the symbol as the basis. Furthermore, because the center of symbol is also the center of ‘A’ and ‘B’, a fixed 90° phase shift from ‘A’ and ‘B’ can be well preserved, according to the constellation of the phase rotator (shown in Fig. 9(b)). Once the center of a symbol is determined, the clock phases are tuned to ‘A’ and ‘B’ by using a phase rotator that produces phase-tuning vectors of I and Q.

After the phase of the clock has been recovered on the receiver side, a latch-based decoder (Fig. 9(c)) is used to recover the two bits represented by the symbol. One important feature of the PSS-4 receiver is that it decodes the symbol in the time domain rather than in the voltage domain. As every equalized symbol has two eyes in one unit interval, two StrongArm comparators are used to sample them independently. The comparator functions as a sensitive amplifier; it samples the weak voltage level at a certain time instant and decides the input voltage level below or above a threshold voltage. Fortunately, PSS-4 only has one threshold voltage to deal with, while PAM-4 has three. This nice feature of PSS-4 could help simplify the decoder circuits and improve the SNR at the receiver’s front end. As shown in Fig. 9, the proposed PSS-4 receiver employs a multiphase-based decoder for PSS-4 demodulation because it allows sufficient decoding time and consumes low power. The time-interleaved comparators sample the two eyes in one UI, i.e., at points ‘A’ and ‘B’. Fig. 9(c) shows the implementation of a half-rate decoder, a half-rate clock (the clock frequency is half that of the PSS-4 bit-rate) is needed to split the data paths into two individual bit streams. After the regeneration process, the original bits of the Even and Odd streams can be recovered. In addition, the decoder also supports quarter-rate sampling clock (the clock frequency is one quarter of the PSS-4 bit-rate) by increasing the number of slicer pairs, as shown in Fig. 9(d). With this configuration, four parallel bits of quarter rate are recreated for further de-serialization.

In the experiment, the performance of PSS-4 signaling method is compared with those of NRZ and PAM-4. Three channels are selected for circuit simulation. Transistor-level simulation results are obtained to compare the eye openings of the three signaling methods. All the circuits have been designed using a 65-nm CMOS RF Mixed signal process operating at 1.2 V.

Simulations are performed on three I/O interconnect channels. The S-parameter file is imported into the n4port cell from the Cadence analogLib library to model the I/O channels in the Spectre simulator. These channel models vary with geometry structures of the on-board transmission lines and dielectric material. From the insertion loss of the three channels [21] depicted in Fig. 10
                        , one can recognize that these three channels represent the three typical I/O link applications. The fci-short channel is a low-lossy channel of ∼ 5 dB at Nyquist frequency of 25 Gb/s but having many notches in the frequency response. The te29m6 channel reflects a relatively longer-length channel with a length of 29.6 in but it has a smooth frequency response. The fci-long channel suffers similar level of insertion loss as te29m6 channel, and it encounters impedance discontinuity.


                        Fig. 11
                         compares the receiver front-end eye-diagrams of PSS-4 without and with transmitter pre-emphasis technique. The data is collected from a 16 Gb/s PSS-4 applied to the fci-short channel. As discussed in Section 3.3, the left eye is more sensitive to the channel-induced ISI than the right eye, resulting in a smaller eye-opening in the left eye, as shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that by using pre-emphasis technique, the eye diagram of the PSS-4 is improved dramatically. Although the eye height of the right eye is reduced, it has nothing to do with the bit-error-rate (BER) performance, since BER is limited by the worst-case eye opening. Significantly, when the pre-emphasis is included, the difference in eye-height between the left eye and the right eye is reduced from 132 mV to just 10 mV, and the difference in eye-width between the two eyes is reduced by half.

Transistor-level simulation among NRZ, PAM-4 and PSS-4 transceivers is conducted for full-link comparison. In this study, the circuit implementations of PAM-4 transmitter and receiver are taken from [5,8,22], respectively. For a fair comparison, the transmitter-output swing is set to 600 mV

From the design complexity and cost perspectives of the I/O interconnect circuit, decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is not taken into the consideration. Unless otherwise specified, the eye-diagram results are obtained with a pseudo-random bit sequence of

                         shows 20 Gb/s ten kilo-symbol eye diagrams of NRZ, PAM-4, and PSS-4. According to Section 3, PSS-4 should allow more eye opening due to that NRZ requires the largest bandwidth and PAM-4 suffers from the greatest SNR penalty. When the three signals are transferred over te29m6 channel, PSS-4 yields the largest eye-height of 189  mV

                         while that of NRZ is 131 mVp-pd. Due to the SNR penalty of 9.5 dB and low supply voltage (1.2 V), the eye-height opening of PAM-4 is limited to only 94 mVp-pd. The next section repeats the simulation over multiple I/O channels and explores at different data rate to verify which signaling method provides the largest eye opening for a given data rate.

                           , compared to PAM-4 and PSS-4, NRZ presents superior eye quality at lower data rate and is the best choice for 16 Gb/s I/O application. As the data rate increases to 20 Gb/s and beyond, however, NRZ can hardly maintain the enough voltage margins needed by receiver slicer (only very short link, i.e., fci-short, is supported by NRZ). Instead, PAM-4 and PSS-4 become the alternatives. When comparing PAM-4 with PSS-4, one can see that the eye height of proposed PSS-4 signaling is larger than that of PAM-4. Moreover, due to the benefit from SNR margin, PSS-4 beats PAM-4 with a wide margin in terms of eye height for low-lossy (fci-short) or smooth (te29m6) channels. For the high-lossy channel (fci-long), the eye height difference between PSS-4 and PAM-4 becomes less significant, but still noticeable. Generally speaking, the eye height of PSS-4 is 17% larger than that of NRZ and twice larger than that of PAM-4 on average.

Although PAM-4 and PSS-4 share one commonality that they both increase the date rate with a fixed symbol rate, the result demonstrates one of the key differences between them. As frequency increases, channel loss difference between Nyquist frequencies of half-baud-rate and full-baud-rate signaling becomes wider. In this case, the superiority of eye height due to the SNR penalty becomes less significant for PSS-4. I/O links based on PAM-4 signaling are unlikely to achieve the eye height that can be achieved by PSS-4, except in the case where PSS-4 and PAM-4 provide scarcely any eye openings, i.e., smaller than 100 mV. That is to say, to employ PAM-4 on the legacy I/O interconnects, a higher supply voltage is terrifically required to compensate for the SNR penalty, which may increase the I/O power consumption. Therefore, PSS-4 is an optimal choice under the condition with a standard supply voltage.

The impact of supply voltage (V
                           DD) is analyzed for the link performance. The resulting data are obtained when 16 Gb/s signals passing through a te29m6 channel. As shown in Fig. 14
                           , the eye margin of PSS-4 is less sensitive to the supply voltage than PAM-4 and NRZ. When supply voltage is reduced from 1.2 V to 0.9 V, for instance, the eye width of PSS-4 drops by only 11% while the eye width of PAM-4 and NRZ drop by 66% and 31%, respectively.


                        Table 2
                         compares the average power consumption of the transceiver circuits using PAM-4 and PSS-4. For fair comparison, the transceivers are assumed to operate at a data rate of 25 Gb/s, and the transmit output swing is 600 mVp-pd with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. All the resulting data are derived by transient simulation and the average power of each sub-circuit is calculated for 10,000 symbols. Although the PAM-4 transmitter has two branches in the encoder circuit, PSS-4 needs to consume extra power: 3.2 mW for de-cycling and 4.3 mW for pre-emphasis, resulting in 2.6 mW larger than PAM-4 on transmitter side. Compared with PAM-4, the power reduction for PSS-4 signaling mainly comes from the decoder circuit because PAM-4 needs three slicers (comparators) to decide four-level voltage amplitudes; in contrast, PSS-4 needs only two slicers for a half-rate decoder. Putting things together, one can see that the total power estimation for PSS-4 I/O transceiver is 13.5% less than PAM-4 transceiver.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

As the I/O data rate increases, conventional NRZ signaling is either viewed as extremely challenging and burdensome from an equalization and power point of view or simply infeasible for such links, giving up its position to the PAM-4. Gaining momentum in today’s high speed interconnects, PAM-4 signaling, however, suffers from large SNR degradation, and this significant problem can be alleviated by using the proposed PSS-4 signaling. By cutting the symbol rate by half, PSS-4 with pre-emphasis can achieve the similar power spectral density as PAM-4, while reducing 6.5 dB SNR penalty compared with PAM-4. This paper also proposes a pre-emphasis technique for PSS-4 to cancel the channel-induced ISI, along with a complete transceiver architecture with all the circuit implementations. Transistor-level simulation results reveal that eye-height opening of PSS-4, on average, is twice larger than that of PAM-4 for I/O links of 16–25 Gb/s. In addition, the sensitivity of PSS-4 to the supply voltage, in terms of eye-width opening, is 55% and 20% less than that of PAM-4 and NRZ, respectively. Furthermore, compared with PAM-4, the power consumption of PSS-4 is 13.5% lower. As a result, the PSS-4 signaling approach may provide a path to obtaining performance for low-cost I/O interconnects in highly integrated environments such as multi-core systems.
