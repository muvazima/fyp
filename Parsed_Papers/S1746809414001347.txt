               Abstract
               
                  A novel and efficient signal compression algorithm aimed at finding the sparsest representation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is presented and analyzed. The idea behind the method relies on basis elements drawn from the initial transitory of a signal itself, and the sparsity promotion process applied to its subsequent blocks grabbed by a sliding window. The saved coefficients rescaled in a convenient range, quantized and compressed by a lossless entropy-based algorithm.
                  Experiments on signals extracted from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database show that the method achieves in most of the cases very high performance.
