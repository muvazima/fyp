                  In this paper the joint maintenance and spare parts ordering problem for more than one identical operating items is studied. The operating items may suffer two types of silent failures: a minor failure, which results in item malfunctioning, and a major failure, which renders the item completely out-of-function. Inspections are periodically held to detect any failures and the inspected items are preventively maintained, repaired or replaced according to their condition. Two ordering policies are investigated to supply the necessary spare parts: a periodic review and a continuous review policy. The expected total maintenance and inventory cost per time unit is derived and the proposed models are optimized for real case data. In addition, the sensitivity of the proposed models is studied through numerical examples and the effect of some key problem characteristics on the optimal decisions is discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Maintenance policies for stochastically failing systems have received great attention from researchers during the last decades. In most of the proposed maintenance models it is generally assumed that spares are always available when needed for replacement, which is not usually the case in practice. In fact, since the procurement leadtime is generally non-negligible, any replacement policy should be combined with an appropriate ordering policy for timely supply of spare parts. In such cases, spare parts demand is governed by the failure mechanism of the operating units as well as by the applied preventive maintenance or replacement policy, if any. Thus, spare parts demand is usually more peculiar than that of regular products but, at the same time, manageable to some extent since preventive maintenance times are rather easily adaptable. In addition, shortage costs of spare parts are generally considerably higher than those of regular products since shortage of spares upon need may result in excessive production downtimes. Thus, typical inventory control models are generally not appropriate for spare parts management and ad hoc ordering policies have been proposed for such cases.

In practice, the problem of managing spare parts appears in several variations depending on the deterioration mechanism of the operating system, the number of operating parts, the type of the applied maintenance policy, the severity and detectability of failures and the limitations and special characteristics of ordering policies themselves. Therefore, the research on this field may take several directions to keep up with industry requirements. A thorough review on joint maintenance and inventory optimization models has been recently published by Van Horenbeek, Bure, Cattrysse, Pintelon, and Vansteenwegen (2013).

The study in the current paper was motivated by the spare parts inventory control and maintenance problem observed for steam traps in an oil-refinery. Steam traps are subject to non-observable failures which result in excessive losses of live steam. Thus, all traps are periodically inspected using a specialized monitoring device, which detects steam leaks through temperature and ultrasonic measurements analysis. According to the inspection outcome, traps may be preventively maintained, repaired or replaced by new ones. Clearly, the length of the inspection interval directly affects the cost incurred due to steam losses as well as the number of spares needed at every inspection instance. Considering that there are more than 3000 traps in the steam network of the company, it is clear that the decisions on the inspection frequency as well as on the ordering policy of spares are of major importance to the company. Therefore a joint maintenance and spare parts ordering policy is proposed and the economically optimal inspection interval, spare parts ordering time and quantity are derived.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section the relevant literature is reviewed and briefly discussed. In Section 3 the problem setting as well as the proposed maintenance and ordering policies are described in detail. In Section 4 two models, differing in the type of the proposed ordering policy, are developed, while in Section 5 an extension of the proposed models is discussed. In Section 6 the proposed models are optimized for real case data, their economic performance against simpler approaches is investigated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. Section 7 summarizes the paper and presents topics for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The literature review presented in this section focuses on models that study spare parts ordering and maintenance policies taking into account the failure time distribution of the operating units. An important distinguishing characteristic of these models is whether they consider a single or several identical operating units. In fact, most of the proposed models assume a single operating unit and the great majority of them are restricted in the case of a single spare part in stock, as well. The objective is to derive the optimal ordering and replacement times that minimize the total inventory and maintenance cost.

Within this context, Wiggins (1967) derives the optimal ordering time for exponential failure times and corrective replacement assuming one spare in stock at most. The use of the exponential lifetime distribution leads to an extreme ordering policy, which dictates either immediate order of a new spare as soon as the one in stock is used or no order until a failure occurs and no spare is available. Osaki (1977) derives the optimal ordering time assuming that the operating unit is replaced as soon as the ordered spare is delivered or at failure, whichever occurs first. Thomas and Osaki (1978) investigate more general ordering – replacement policies allowing for emergency orders in case a failure occurs and no spare is available. Park and Park (1986b) study the same problem as in Thomas and Osaki (1978) assuming random leadtime but emergency orders are not allowed. As a result they conclude that the optimal replacement policy is extreme and similar to that studied by Osaki (1977). Armstrong and Atkins (1996) extend the analysis of Thomas and Osaki (1978) assuming that preventive replacement is generally less expensive than failure replacement. Other extensions of the model proposed by Thomas and Osaki (1978) are also studied in Dohi, Kaio, and Osaki (1998) and Giri, Dohi, and Kaio (2005).


                     Osaki, Kaio, and Yamada (1981), Park and Park (1986a), Sheu and Liou (1994), Sheu (1999) and Park and Sun (2009) consider two types of failures, a minor and a major one, and assume that minor failures are corrected by minimal repair actions. Chien (2010) also considers two types of failures and two types of corrective maintenance actions (minimal repair against minor failures and replacement against major ones) combined with preventive replacement and derives the optimal number of minimal repairs before ordering a spare part. Cheng and Li (2012) study a similar problem but they also derive the optimal number of minimal repairs prior to preventive replacement. Elwany and Gebraeel (2008) and Louit, Pascual, Banjevic, and Jardine (2011) extend the work of Armstrong and Atkins (1996) and study a Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) policy updating the lifetime distributions based on data obtained through condition monitoring. A CBM policy is also studied by Rausch and Liao (2010) who assume that maintenance is performed as soon as degradation exceeds a certain threshold. Rausch and Liao (2010) relax the assumption of a single spare part in stock and investigate a more general (S
                     −1, S) policy.

The assumption of a single spare part in stock is also relaxed in Falkner (1968), Nosoohi and Hejazi (2011), Kabir and Al-Olayan (1994), Dohi, Shibuya, and Osaki (1997) and Diallo, Aït-Kadi, and Chelbi (2008). More specifically, Falkner (1968) uses dynamic programming techniques to derive the optimal initial inventory, maintenance times and reorder quantities for the finite horizon case. Nosoohi and Hejazi (2011) develop a multi-objective model to derive an efficient solution for the age-based preventive replacement time and the initial stock of spare parts for a given planning horizon. Kabir and Al-Olayan (1994) use simulation to investigate a continuous review (s, S) policy combined with age-based preventive replacement, allowing for emergency orders in case of shortage. Dohi et al. (1997) study both periodic and continuous review policies, which combine regular and emergency orders. They derive the optimal ordering time and reorder quantity assuming that only corrective replacement is performed. Diallo et al. (2008) derive the optimal continuous review (s, Q) policy assuming that the operating unit is replaced upon order delivery or at failure, whichever occurs first.

The case of more than one identical units that operate in parallel is significantly harder to model and, therefore, the relevant research is rather limited. In addition, due to the mathematical complexity of the integrated ordering and maintenance problem for several operating units, most of the published works in the field either adopt a simple maintenance and/or ordering policy or use simulation to compute the cost of the proposed models.

More specifically, Allen and D’Esopo (1968) as well as Al-Bahi (1993) derive the optimal (s, Q) policy assuming exponentially distributed failure times and thus only corrective replacement is considered. On the other hand, Kabir and Al-Olayan (1996), Hu, Yue, and Xie (2008) and Kabir and Farrash (1997) investigate age-based preventive replacement combined with continuous review (Hu et al., 2008; Kabir & Al-Olayan, 1996) or periodic review (Kabir & Farrash, 1997) ordering policy, but they all resort to simulation in order to solve the problem. Acharya, Nagbhushanam, and Alam (1986), Brezavšček and Hudoklin (2003) and Huang, Meng, Xi, and Liu (2008) consider block replacement policies combined with periodic review ordering and assume that the stock review interval is equal to the block replacement interval. Block replacement is also examined by Sarker and Haque (2000), who consider a continuous review (s, S) ordering policy combined with expedited orders in case of zero spares in stock and use simulation to optimize their model. Vaughan (2005) derives the optimal ordering policy for periodically inspected operating units, a random number of which may be preventively replaced at inspection intervals. He assumes exponentially distributed failure times and uses dynamic programming to conclude that the optimal ordering policy is of the (s, S) type, where the reorder point s and the order-up-to level S depend on the time until the next inspection point. Wang (2011, 2012) derives both the optimal ordering parameters and inspection interval for periodically inspected components under the so called “Delay-Time” concept, according to which the failure is assumed to be a two-stage process. All failed components are correctively replaced upon failure while all defective components are preventively replaced upon inspection. Wang, Pecht, and Liu (2012) develop both theoretical and simulation-based models for spare parts ordering and maintenance decisions of systems equipped with early failure warning devices.

In the field of Condition Based Maintenance Li and Ryan (2011) use dynamic programming to derive the optimal inventory control policy assuming Brownian deterioration, control limit maintenance policy and periodic review of spare parts inventories. In addition, Xie and Wang (2008) and Wang, Chu, and Mao (2008, 2009) investigate joint Condition Based Maintenance and continuous review (s, S) ordering policies using simulation. Wang et al. (2008) investigate the optimal ordering parameters assuming non-observable failures, Markovian deterioration and control limit replacement policy. In Xie and Wang (2008) and Wang et al. (2009) failures are immediately detected and the optimal inspection interval and deterioration threshold are also investigated.

Although the current study shares some common features with previous works cited above, its main contribution is that it examines the joint maintenance – spare parts inventory problem for the multiple items case adopting an analytical approach, while most previous studies resolve to simulation for equally complex (or even less complex) problem settings. More specifically, the expected total maintenance and inventory cost for both reorder-point (s, S) and reorder-interval (R, S) policies is analytically derived and the inspection and ordering decisions are jointly optimized. In addition, a generally different deterioration mechanism and maintenance policy than those previously studied is considered.

The main distinguishing characteristics of the current problem setting are summarized as follows:
                        
                           a.
                           The operating items suffer two types of failures (minor and major) under general (not necessarily Markovian) deterioration. Items that have already suffered a minor failure are more prone to major failures; that is, the probability of a major failure occurrence is higher in malfunctioning items than in normally operating ones.

Both types of failures are not directly observable (silent failures) and can only be detected through inspection.

A system consisting of m identical critical items that are subject to deterioration is considered. The operating units deteriorate with time (age) and are subject to two types of failures: a minor one (state M), which can be corrected by repair, and a major one (state F), which is non-repairable and thus calls for replacement. The items continue to operate even if a minor failure occurred and has not yet been detected but under inferior conditions which incur a malfunction cost per time unit. In addition, an item which malfunctions, due to an undetected minor failure, can still suffer a major failure with higher probability compared to a normally operating item of the same age. A major failure is fatal for the item, i.e. the item is no longer functional, and incurs a downtime cost per time unit until the item is replaced. Both types of failures are not directly observable and the actual items condition can only be revealed through inspection.

Inspections are periodically held every T time units, during which the true state of all items is identified. If an item is found to operate normally (state 0) it is preventively maintained and restored to an as-good-as-new state. On the other hand, if an item is found in a non-operating state (i.e. it has suffered a major failure), it is replaced. Finally, if an item is malfunctioning (i.e. it has suffered a minor failure), the failure is removed and then the item is preventively maintained to an as-good-as-new state. In other words, whenever an item is malfunctioning a two-step maintenance process is implemented: first a corrective maintenance action aiming at removing the minor failure effect and then a preventive maintenance action aiming at renewing the item (similarly to normally operating items). However, for reasons of brevity, the combination of these two maintenance actions (first corrective and then preventive maintenance) will be hereafter simply referred as “repair”. Apparently, the repair cost is always higher than the preventive maintenance cost since it also includes the failure removal cost. Given all these, every inspection point is a renewal point of the process, since all items are either new or as good as new after inspection. Renewing all items at every inspection instance may form a rather demanding maintenance policy but it is a reasonable (and cost effective) policy when failures can only be detected at inspection instances. In such cases failure consequences are heavier, due to high malfunction and/or downtime cost, and thus drastic preventive maintenance measures should be taken against deterioration to avoid frequent failure occurrences.

Note that the proposed models can also apply with only slight modifications to simpler cases than that described above. That is:
                           
                              a.
                              Markovian deterioration mechanism, where all transition times to minor or major failures are exponentially distributed. In this case, preventive maintenance is clearly needless (since failure probabilities do not increase with time). Removal of minor failures and replacement of non-operating items are the only actions needed.

Items that may suffer only major failures. In this case replacement of non-operating items and preventive maintenance of the operating ones are the only actions needed.

Preventive replacement of malfunctioning items (those that suffered minor failure). In this case, there is no need for repair but a generally higher number of items are replaced at every inspection instance.

In any case, the objective is to derive the optimal inspection interval and provide adequate spare parts to support the replacement policy.

According to the previously described maintenance policy, spare parts are only needed for replacements at inspection epochs. In other words, spare parts demand occurs only at inspection instances and it is generally non-unitary. Thus, it is reasonable to schedule spare parts orders so that they will be delivered just before an inspection instance.

The procurement leadtime is assumed to be smaller than the inspection interval, which is not a very restrictive assumption since the life time of the items is generally high compared to a typical procurement leadtime. For example, in the steam traps problem that motivated this study, the usual inspection interval is a year, or even longer, while the leadtime does not exceed one month for any of the suppliers. This is because the expected lifetime of the steam traps is typically longer than three years (it depends on the type of the traps) and inspection is rather difficult and costly, since it requires the isolation of the trap from the steam network and its connection with the specialized monitoring equipment.

In addition, in case of a stockout, i.e., if the number of items that need to be replaced in some inspection epoch is higher than the available number of spares, an emergency order is placed to cover extra demand. Otherwise, the failed items would remain out-of-function until the next order delivery causing an excessive downtime cost. The leadtime of an emergency order is generally significantly shorter than that of a regular order and it is assumed to be negligible compared to the inspection interval. The objective is to decide when an order should be placed and how many spares should be ordered taking into account the order, holding and shortage costs. In addition, the optimal ordering parameters depend on the length of the inspection interval since the latter affects the number of items that will need replacement upon inspection. To this end, two ordering policies are developed: a periodic review policy (R, S), where an order up to S is placed every R inspection intervals and a continuous review policy (s, S), where an order up to S is placed whenever the available spare parts are less than or equal to s.

The optimal ordering parameters as well as the optimal inspection interval are derived minimizing the total maintenance and spare parts inventory cost function.

Every inspection interval of length T constitutes a maintenance cycle of the process since all items are either new or as good as new after inspection. The maintenance action that will be performed in every item depends on its state at the time of inspection. Recall that every item found in a non-operating state (X

The first integral in (3) stands for the case where the item moves directly from normal operation to major failure (without suffering a minor failure first), while the double integral stands for the case where the item suffers a minor failure at some time t during the inspection interval and a major failure afterwards (at some time t
                           1
                           >
                           t).

An item operates normally either until the end of the inspection interval (for T time units since previous inspection instance) if neither a minor nor a major failure occurs or until the time of a (minor or major) failure occurrence prior to T. Thus the expected time that an item operates normally during an inspection interval, μ
                           0, is given by

Every item in a maintenance cycle (inspection interval) is inspected once at the end of the interval, replaced, repaired or preventively maintained depending on its state and may incur a malfunction cost and/or a downtime cost if a minor and/or major failure has occurred. Therefore, the expected total maintenance cost for all m items during an inspection interval (maintenance cycle), E(CM), is

As already mentioned, two types of inventory control policies for the spare parts problem are examined: a periodic review (R, S) and a continuous review (s, S) policy. In both policies an order up-to-S is placed according to the reorder interval R (periodic review) or to the reorder point s (continuous review). In addition, an emergency order with higher cost but practically negligible leadtime is placed in case of shortage to cover the additional demand for spare parts and make sure that all m items will be operating at the beginning of every maintenance cycle.

Recall that, regardless of the review policy type, the inventory position of spare parts should be checked at most once within each inspection interval. In fact, since spare parts are needed only at inspection points, the number of available spares needs to be recorded only once in a replacement cycle (inspection interval) at least L time units prior to the next inspection. More specifically, in a continuous review policy the inventory position of spares should be checked (once) in every inspection interval and compared to the reorder point s to decide whether an order should be placed, or not. In a periodic review policy, on the other hand, the inventory position of spares should only be checked every R inspection intervals to define the order quantity, if any.

Under the periodic review inventory control policy (PR policy) for the spare parts an order up-to-S is placed every R inspection intervals, if there are less than S spare parts available (R
                           ⩾1, S
                           >0). The order is placed exactly L time units prior to the next inspection point so that the ordered spares are delivered just before inspection and replacement of any failed items. Thus, every R inspection intervals exactly S spare parts are available just before inspection and a new inventory cycle begins. Note that, since no more than m items may be replaced in every maintenance cycle and an order is placed every R maintenance cycles, there is no point in stocking more than Rm spare parts (S
                           ⩽
                           Rm).

The behavior of the inventory level under the proposed joint inventory–replacement policy is depicted in Fig. 1
                            for R
                           =4 (an order up-to-S is placed every four inspection intervals). In Fig. 1 the first inventory cycle ends with a positive number of spares and therefore the order quantity is smaller than S. In the second inventory cycle of Fig. 1 a shortage occurs, which is covered immediately by an emergency order, and a regular order of S spare parts is placed L time units prior to the next inspection instance.

Let H represent the total inventory time accumulated during an inventory cycle, i.e. the sum of the times every spare is held in inventory. As shown in Fig. 1, every inventory cycle starts with an inspection and lasts exactly R maintenance cycles. At every inspection point the inventory level drops by the number of spares used to replace non-operating items until it is depleted. Thus, the number of spares in inventory at the beginning of every maintenance cycle (after replacing any failed parts) is S minus the total number of spares used up to that point, say i. These parts are held in inventory at least until the next inspection point: that is, at least for T time units. Therefore, the expected total inventory time during an inventory cycle can be calculated as the sum of spare parts that are held in inventory in every maintenance cycle within an inventory cycle multiplied by the maintenance cycle duration T, as follows:

Although in a PR policy it is assumed that an order is placed every R inspection intervals, in this case it is possible that no spares will be used during an inventory cycle and thus no order will be placed. The probability of placing an order in a given order instance taking also into account this, rather extreme, scenario is given by

see Appendix A. □


                           Lemma 1 confirms that there is no point in stocking more than Rm spare parts in every inventory cycle (S
                           ⩽
                           Rm) and facilitates the optimization procedure. In addition, note that the optimal solution for S described in Lemma 1 resembles the newsvendor type.

Under the continuous review inventory control policy (CR policy) an order up-to-S is placed whenever the inventory position drops below or exactly to s (s
                           ⩾0, S
                           >
                           s). Since the inventory position is reviewed in every maintenance cycle and no more than m items may be replaced at every inspection instance, there is no point in placing an order when at least m parts are available (s
                           <
                           m).

The behavior of the inventory level under the proposed joint inventory–replacement policy is depicted in Fig. 2
                           . The first inventory cycle of Fig. 2 lasts four inspection intervals and ends with a shortage, which is covered immediately by an emergency order, and a regular order of S spares, which is placed L time units prior to the next inspection instance. The second inventory cycle of Fig. 2 lasts five inspection intervals and ends with a positive number of spares (at most s) and a regular order of less than S spares.

The number of inspection intervals between two successive orders under the CR policy is not constant. More specifically, an inventory cycle is at least as long as an inspection interval (minimum duration of every inventory cycle) plus the duration of the inspection intervals required for the inventory level to drop below s
                           +1, if any.

Thus, the expected number of inspection intervals (maintenance cycles), E(I), within an inventory cycle is

                           Lemma 2 confirms that there is no point in placing an order when at least m parts are available (s
                           <
                           m) and facilitates the optimization procedure. Similarly to Lemma 1, the optimal solution for s described in Lemma 2 resembles the newsvendor type.

In both models (PR and CR), the objective is to minimize the expected total cost per time unit, given by (14) for the PR case and by (21) for the CR case, and derive the optimal values for the three decision variables (T, S and R or s). In theory, T can take any positive value, s should be a non-negative integer while R and S should be positive integers, since R is expressed in multiples of T and obviously s and S refer to spares quantity. In practice, however, T is discretized in some suitable time unit (one day increment in all numerical examples of the current study) and its value is optimized through direct and exhaustive search.

More specifically, for the optimization of the examples presented in Section 5, the optimal values of the two decision variables are obtained through exhaustive search while the optimal value of the third decision variable (S for the PR case or s for the CR case) is easily derived using either Lemma 1 or Lemma 2 for every combination of the other two decision variables. In fact, for every possible value of the maintenance cycle duration T the search is terminated when the length of the inventory cycle has become so large that an emergency order is definitely preferable to holding spares in inventory and the whole optimization process eventually ends when the length of the maintenance cycle has become so large that all items have practically failed.

The model proposed in Section 4 is based on the assumption that failures of parts are independent; that is, the pdf of the time to failure of every part does not depend on whether or not other parts of the same type have already failed. However, sometimes it is reasonable to assume that if one item suffers a failure the remaining items’ condition is aggravated and consequently they become more prone to failures. In the current section, the proposed model is extended to incorporate the case of dependent (correlated) failure times between parts. Thus, it is now assumed that the pdf of the time to failure for every part depends on the number of operating parts of the same type at every time instance. To this end, whenever a part fails the pdf of the time to failure of the remaining parts of the same type is updated (normally worsens). In this case, the probabilities p
                     0, p
                     
                        M
                      and p
                     
                        F
                      as well as the expected times μ
                     0, μ
                     
                        M
                      and μ
                     
                        F
                      derived by Eqs. (1)–(6) should be reevaluated taking into account the aforementioned failure time dependency among parts. The rest of the model characteristics, though, are not affected and can still be derived by expressions (7)–(21).

Note that, if the possibility of correlated failure times is combined with the deterioration mechanism discussed in Section 3.1 (the operating parts may suffer two types of interrelated failures), the proposed model becomes too complicated, and thus, to facilitate presentation, it is now assumed that the operating items may suffer only one type of failure (the major non-repairable failure). In other words, state M no longer exists and consequently f
                     0M
                     (t), f
                     
                        MF
                     (t), p
                     
                        M
                      and μ
                     
                        M
                      are excluded from the analysis. However, the proposed methodology could straightforwardly be extended to the more general case of more that one failure types.

Again, the expected time that an item is in state 0 during an inspection interval can easily be derived by

Using (22)–(25) in (13) for the PR case or in (20) for the CR case the expected total maintenance and inventory cost per time unit can be evaluated for the case of correlated failure times. Also note that Lemmas 1 and 2 do not rely on the assumption of independently distributed failure times and, consequently, they are still valid for the extended version of the model presented in this section.

The proposed joint maintenance–inventory models are optimized using the field data on steam traps of the oil refinery case. The refinery owns several identical steam traps of various types and sizes. For the numerical illustration purposes two types of traps with different characteristics are selected: type A and type B traps. Both types of traps may suffer either minor or major failures but under different deterioration mechanisms. A minor failure means that a trap has failed partially opened, resulting in a slow leak of live steam and in a developing (major) failure. Depending on the trap type, minor failures either call for repair (cleaning of the internal parts of the trap) or for trap replacement. A major failure, on the other hand, results in excessive steam loss and always requires the replacement of the trap. The exact characteristics of the selected trap types are the following:
                           
                              (a)
                              All transition times (from state 0 to state M or F as well as from state M to state F) in type A traps follow the Exponential distribution (Markovian deterioration). Thus, if at some inspection instance a trap of this type is found to operate normally (state 0) it does not need preventive maintenance. In addition, minor failures are removed by appropriate repair.

All transition times (from state 0 to state M or F as well as from state M to state F) in type B traps follow the Weibull distribution. Thus, even if at some inspection instance a trap of this type is found to operate normally (state 0) it is preventively maintained and brought back to the as-good-as-new state. In addition, minor failures cannot be removed by repair and thus all malfunctioning traps are replaced by new ones.

The values of all necessary model parameters for both types of traps were estimated using historical system data and are summarized in Table 1
                        .

In addition to the data of Table 1, the inspection of a trap, regardless of its type, costs 12.5€ and lasts about 40minutes, since it requires the connection and disconnection of the ultrasonic device to the trap. Finally, the leadtime of a regular order is one month for both types of traps.

For type B traps, since minor failures lead in trap replacement, C

                         in (13) and (20). In addition, the number of type B traps that need replacement in every inspection instance is again a binomially distributed random variable with parameter p
                        =
                        p

                        .

The optimal values of T, S and R (for the PR model) or s (for the CR model) can now be obtained using (8)–(14) and Lemma 1 for the PR case or (15)–(21) and Lemma 2 for the CR case. The resulting optimal values of all model parameters for both trap types are summarized in Table 2
                        .

As expected, the inventory level is significantly higher for type B traps (S
                        
                           B
                        
                        >
                        S
                        
                           A
                        ) since not only completely failed type B traps but also partially failed ones are replaced in every inspection instance. From Table 2, it is also observed that T
                        
                           B
                        
                        >
                        T
                        
                           A
                         although the mean transition times (from state 0 to state M or F as well as from state M to state F) are smaller for type B traps. This is because, the Weibull distribution with shape parameter c
                        =2 is characterized by significantly lower variability than the exponential distribution and thus transition times are more predictable in the Weibull case allowing for longer inspection intervals.

It is interesting to compare the economic effectiveness of the optimal policies of Table 2 to that of the currently applied policies in the company. According to the current maintenance practice both types of traps are inspected once per year (or even less frequently). In case of type A traps all failed traps are replaced and all partially failed traps are repaired, while in case of type B traps all failed and all partially failed traps are replaced. In addition, the current practice dictates a CR policy, according to which: (a) up to 30 type A traps are ordered (S
                        
                           A
                        
                        =30) if less than 10 spares of this type are available (s
                        
                           A
                        
                        =10) and (b) up to 40 type B traps are ordered (S
                        
                           B
                        
                        =40) if less than 20 spares of this type are available (s
                        
                           B
                        
                        =20). Consequently, the resulting total maintenance and inventory cost of the current inspection–ordering practice of the company is 254.84€ per week for type A traps and 324.31€ per week for type B traps, that is 45.65% and 67.67% higher than the optimal cost that can be achieved by the proposed model, respectively, as presented in Table 2. In fact, the inspection interval currently used in the company (and the inventory parameters as a consequence) is far from its economically optimal value leading to a significant cost increase. Taking also into account that the company uses more than 3000 steam traps (of several types) and generally long inspection intervals, it is expected that deriving the economically optimal maintenance and inventory parameters would result in a significant cost reduction.

In order to investigate the benefits of the proposed joint maintenance–inventory model over commonly applied schemes, where maintenance and ordering decisions are made in two steps, the optimal expected total cost (ECT) of the proposed model is compared against the expected total cost of a sequentially optimized scheme (ECT
                        
                           S
                        ) for the steam traps case. Under the sequentially optimized scheme the value of the inspection interval T
                        
                           S
                         is derived first, by minimizing only the expected maintenance cost ECT
                        
                           M
                        . The values of the ordering parameters are then obtained by minimizing the expected inventory cost ECT
                        
                           I
                         for the previously determined value of the inspection interval.

Note that the value of the inspection interval T
                        
                           S
                         that minimizes ECT
                        
                           M
                         under the sequential approach depends solely on the maintenance cost elements, while the optimal value of the inspection interval T under the proposed joint maintenance–inventory model depends not only (although mainly) on the maintenance cost elements but also on the inventory-related ones. Thus, the jointly optimized T may take different values for the same set of maintenance cost parameters as long as the inventory cost parameters differ. Clearly, the more the optimal T (which minimizes the joint maintenance–inventory model) differs from T
                        
                           S
                         (which minimizes ECT
                        
                           M
                        ), the higher the expected benefits of the proposed model against the sequential one.

To investigate this effect, the value of the inspection interval T as well as the values of the ordering parameters of the periodic review policy, R and S, were obtained under both the joint and the sequential optimization approach, for both trap types and for several values of the inventory cost elements. In addition, the expected total cost for the sequentially optimized decision variables, ECT
                        
                           S
                        , was compared against the minimum expected total cost for the jointly optimized decision variables, ECT, to evaluate the penalty incurred by the sequential optimization. The optimal value of the inspection interval under both the joint and the sequential model (T and T
                        
                           S
                        , respectively) as well as the resulting percentage penalty of the sequential optimization

From Figs. 3 and 4 it is observed that as the inventory related portion in the total cost increases the optimal T under the joint model deviates from T
                        
                           S
                         (decreases) and consequently the benefit achieved by the joint optimization approach increases. More specifically, the difference T
                        
                           S
                         – T is rather small for low values of the ratio ECT

                           I
                        /ECT increases further, resulting in significant improvement under the proposed joint optimization approach (the cost penalty of the sequential approach becomes higher than 5% for type A traps and higher than 80% for type B traps when

                              =

                        ). In fact, the proposed joint approach is clearly more flexible than the sequential ones in dealing with high inventory costs (which render inventory–handling an expensive process) by appropriately changing the value of the inspection interval. That is, in order to avoid handling expensive inventories, the proposed model suggests a more frequent inspection scheme and a more intensive preventive maintenance policy (type B traps) or a higher number of minimal repairs (type A traps) instead of letting the traps to irreversibly deteriorate and inevitably be replaced. This way, trap replacements (and stock requirements as a consequence) are significantly decreased compared to those of a sequential approach. In the refinery case, this phenomenon is more pronounced in type B traps since the number of traps that are normally replaced in every inspection interval is higher for this type of traps (both minor and major failures are removed by trap replacement).

As a conclusion, it could be stated that the benefits of the jointly optimized maintenance-ordering model over the sequentially optimized models are obviously case dependent but are generally non-negligible especially when inventory related costs are rather high.

A sensitivity analysis of the proposed models is performed in order to investigate: (a) the effect of potential changes of all input parameter values on the optimal solutions, (b) the effect of misestimating the input parameter values on the expected total cost and (c) the effect of potential changes of all input parameter values on the economic superiority of CR over PR of spare parts.

To investigate the effect of the input parameter values on the optimal solutions, both review models are optimized for a 40% increase and a 40% decrease of the value of every input parameter, compared to the base-case scenario presented in Table 1, keeping the values of all other model parameters unchanged, for both trap types. Tables 3 and 4
                           
                            summarize the results of the sensitivity analysis for the PR and CR model, respectively. The optimal values of the decision variables for all cases of Tables 3 and 4 are also illustrated in Fig. 5
                           .

From Fig. 5 it is observed that:

                                     has a lower impact on the optimal solution than λ
                                    0M
                                     and λ

                                    since it is much more likely that a normally operating trap will suffer a minor failure than a major one. In addition, the effect of λ
                                    0M
                                     and λ
                                    
                                       MF
                                     on the optimal solution is more pronounced for type B traps due to the significantly lower variability of the transition times in this case.

                                     affects mainly the length of the inspection interval T and the inventory parameters S and s or R as a consequence. More specifically, the length of the inspection interval increases in C
                                    
                                       I
                                     to reduce inspection frequency while at the same time orders become more frequent (the number of maintenance cycles between two consecutive orders decreases) and smaller.

                                     to a lesser degree) results in shorter inspection intervals so that the traps will be under minor or major failure for shorter time periods and also fewer traps will need replacement in every inspection instance. On the other hand, an increase in C
                                    
                                       MR
                                     (for type A traps) and, especially, in C
                                    
                                       PM
                                     (for type B traps) results in longer inspection intervals since repair (type A traps) and preventive maintenance (type B traps) become less favorable options compared to replacement.

To investigate the impact of misestimating the values of the input parameters, the optimal cost for all cases of Tables 3 and 4 is evaluated and compared to the total expected cost of the solution provided in Table 2 for each trap type and review model.

The rightmost column of type A traps as well as the rightmost column of type B traps in Tables 3 and 4 show the percentage cost increase if the solution presented in Table 2 is used (due to misestimation) although the actual value of every model parameter is the one presented in Table 3 or Table 4. It is obvious from both tables that the cost increase due to misestimation of any parameter value is generally very low although the actual parameter values of Tables 3 and 4 are 40% higher or lower than those of Table 1. In other words, the proposed model seems to be very robust to misestimation of input parameters, and thus important savings can be achieved even with rough estimates.

The optimal expected cost under the CR policy presented in Table 4 is evidently lower than the respective cost under the PR policy presented in Table 3, for every set of input parameters. However, the resulting cost differences of the two review policies (continuous and periodic) are very low (lower than 1% in all cases of Tables 3 and 4). This is because the number of traps used in the refinery (for both trap types) is quite large resulting in relatively low variability of spare parts demand compared to the mean spare parts demand of every inventory cycle. That is, the coefficient of variation of spare parts demand within an inventory cycle is rather low and it is a well known result that CR performs significantly better than PR in cases of highly stochastic demand. In addition, the economic superiority of CR is mainly observed in the expected inventory cost per time unit, ECT
                           
                              I
                           , which is only a fraction of the expected total cost per time unit, ECT, of the proposed models. In fact, in all cases of Tables 3 and 4 
                           ECT
                           
                              I
                            is a small fraction of ECT and thus the savings achieved in ECT
                           
                              I
                            under CR shrink significantly when ECT is considered.

To overcome the two abovementioned problems and provide insights on the sensitivity of the economic superiority of CR over PR with respect to changes on the values of the model input parameters, some slightly different numerical examples with decreased number of traps (to increase the coefficient of variation of spare parts demand) and increased shortage cost (to increase the inventory related cost) are presented. More specifically, an analysis similar to that of Section 6.3.1 is carried out for the case of 10 type A traps and for C
                           
                              S
                           
                           =150. Fig. 6
                            summarizes the impact of increasing the value of every input parameter (from 60% to 140% of the base-case scenario presented in Table 1) on the percentage penalty of PR versus CR for both ECT
                           
                              I
                            and ECT.


                           Fig. 6 shows that the parameters with the most significant effect on the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty are the shortage and holding cost C
                           
                              S
                            and C
                           
                              H
                            as well as the downtime cost C
                           
                              F
                            and the inspection cost C
                           
                              I
                           . More specifically, as the shortage cost increases (or equivalently as the holding cost decreases) both review models tend to operate in higher service levels on the optimal solution. The superiority of CR over PR is enhanced in higher service levels since PR needs a significantly higher investment on inventories than CR to achieve strict service requirements. As a result, the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty of PR versus CR is higher for high C
                           
                              S
                            and low C
                           
                              H
                            as shown in Fig. 6. In addition, the superiority of CR over PR increases significantly for low C
                           
                              I
                            and high C
                           
                              F
                           . This is because decreasing C
                           
                              I
                            and increasing C
                           
                              F
                            results in significantly shorter maintenance cycle, which in turn results in significantly smaller probability that an item suffers a major failure during the maintenance cycle and in higher coefficient of variation of spare parts demand upon inspection.

Note that, the percentage ECT penalty in Fig. 6 is significantly smaller than the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty, since ECT
                           
                              I
                            is still a rather small part of ECT. In addition, the impact of the four abovementioned parameters on the percentage ECT penalty may be distorted by changes on the values of ECT
                           
                              I
                            and/or ECT
                           
                              M
                           . For example, if an increase in the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty is combined with an increase in ECT
                           
                              M
                            (which is the case when C
                           
                              F
                            increases) or with a decrease in ECT
                           
                              I
                            (which is the case when C
                           
                              O
                            decreases), the percentage ECT penalty may decrease although the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty increases. That is why these two parameters do not seem to have a significant impact on the percentage ECT penalty although they significantly affect the percentage ECT
                           
                              I
                            penalty.

Spare parts management and control may be a very important issue for a company incurring high inventory-related costs. Typical inventory control models are usually inadequate to account for the spare parts case since spare parts demand is governed by the deterioration mechanism and maintenance policy of the operating items. This strong interrelationship between spare parts and maintenance decisions necessitates the development of specially designed models for the joint consideration and optimization of spare parts and maintenance–replacement policies.

Within this context, the joint maintenance and spare parts ordering problem for more than one operating units has been studied. The operating items deteriorate with time and are subject to minor failures (malfunctioning), and catastrophic failures. Both types of failures are not directly observable and thus all items are periodically inspected to identify their condition and perform appropriate maintenance actions. The total maintenance and inventory cost function has been developed, for general deterioration mechanisms under both periodic and continuous review inventory policies. Useful properties for some decision variables, which facilitate the optimization procedure, are also provided. The proposed models are optimized for real case data with different deterioration mechanisms and maintenance decisions and the optimal inspection interval and inventory parameters are derived. Sensitivity analysis through numerical investigation shows that the proposed models are robust to misestimation of their input parameter values.

A possible extension of the work presented in this paper with practical interest is the case of self-announced failures that call for immediate replacement, combined with time-based or condition-based preventive maintenance and/or replacement. In such cases the company faces two, usually interrelated, strings of spare parts demand: random failure demand and scheduled preventive replacement demand. As a result, managing spare parts for such cases is a very challenging task and needs further investigation.
