                  The Spectral Radiance Piecewise Partition Model (SRPPM) is a new model for characterizing Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD). According to the additive property of the spectral radiances of the primary displayed color, the SRPPM model can be divided into three subspace partitions to calculate the transfer coefficient matrixes with cubic polynomial, which based on the relationship between the digital input of the LCD and the spectral radiance of displayed color. The color difference was used to evaluate the accuracy of this model. Comparing with other characterization models for LCD, the experimental results show that the average color difference of SRPPM is 0.82ΔE
                     76, and 80% of the color differences between color samples are less than 1ΔE
                     76.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Liquid–Crystal Displays (LCD) are gaining recognition in terms of high luminance, large contrast ratio, sharpness, spatial uniformity and low power consumption. It replaced the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor as in color graphic reproduction the LCD has better and smoother color reproduction, such as the softproofing technology. Comparing with CRT displays, the LCD has strong channel interaction and non-constancy of channel chromaticity.

The displays characterization aims to model the relationship between digital input of the display and the displayed color (in a device independent color space based on Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity, such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB, or the spectral radiance).

Gain-offset-gamma (GOG) model [1,7,9] is a well-known colorimetric characterization. The GOG model uses the gain-offset-gamma or gain-offset gamma-offset models. It characterizes the electro-optical transfer function by using exponential curve. However, the GOG model cannot be used to characterize an LCD accurately.

The CRT display has a physics basis, whereas an LCD depends on the specific cell construction. Therefore, the operating mode and usual remapping were generally via a voltage ladder or look-up table to compensate a suboptimal relationship between voltage and perceived lightness to mimic CRTs. Here, the S-curve and S-shape model, polynomial model and masking models are proposed as colorimetric characterization of LCD.

The chromaticity of LCD technology varies with the input voltage and the relationship between digital input of the LCD and the displayed color is fitted well with S-shaped curve [2,6]. Therefore, the S-curve and S-shape model characterizes the electro-optical transfer function by using an S-shaped curve.

Because of the nonlinear relationship between digital input of the LCD and the chromaticity of displayed color, the polynomial model characterizes the electro-optical transfer function by using the polynomial function.

Masking model considered the channel interaction and non-constancy of channel chromaticity when characterized the LCD. Masking model based on the theory of UCR (Under Color Removal) in printing technology, measured the secondary and tertiary color to approximate the channel interaction and the primary color vector. This model is calculated by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to minimize the error that caused by the variation in the channel chromaticity [3].

Because of the channel scalability and independence of LCD are not met, all those colorimetry models have the prediction error and require a large number of measurements to characterize LCD.

There are many researches about spectral characterization. Senfar Wen used the spectral radiance of displayed color to analyze the crosstalk of two primary channels. In this study, two primary crosstalk spectra were defined as the two-primary spectra subtracted the sum of the two-primary spectra and black spectra [4,11]. The computation effectiveness was evaluated by using the spectral radiance of displayed color to compensate the two-primary crosstalk.

Haoxue Liu presented a model that based on the relationship between the digital input of LCD and the wavelength of spectral radiance of displayed color, and the computation accuracy of it was higher than other colorimetric characterizations [5]. However, his model did not implement well when the digital input of LCD was small, especially less than 85.

This paper presents a Spectral Radiance Piecewise Partition Model (SRPPM) for characterizing LCD based on the spectral radiance of the displayed color in the center of LCD screen. The SRPPM includes three subspace partitions for calculating the transfer coefficient matrixes with cubic polynomial, which based on the varying relationship between the digital input of LCD and the spectral radiance of displayed color. The SRPPM applies well whether the digital input of LCD is small or large, and is more effective than the other models.

Measure Instrument: Konic-minolta CS-2000 Spectroradiometer (0.1/50cm distance, aperture of 0.1°, resolution 1nm).

Display: NEC MultiSync EA191M (19in., PVA, best resolution 1280×1024, screen percentage 5:4, dot distance 0.294mm, luminance 250cd/m2, response time 25ms, angle of view 176/176°).

Graphics board: NVIDIA GeForce 310.

Calibration condition: D65 illumination pre-heated 2h.

The colorimetric characterization was performed in the ProfileMaker 5.10 software environment. MeasureTool was used to display color samples and interact with the measurement instruments. MeasureTool is software for color measurement, monitor calibration and characterization. Different from others, it does not re-render the display profile.

Lighting: Measurements were taken place in a dark room. The white point of the display was calibrated into D65.

Three sets of RGB values were created for this test. The first set was three 17-step ramps from 0 to 255 of the red, green, and blue channels, individually. The second set was three 17-step ramps in digital counts from 0 to 255 of the equal amount of red adding green, green adding blue, and blue adding red channels, individually. The third set was created as one 17-step ramp from 0 to 255 of the sum of equal amount of red, green and blue. The total number of the color sample was 884.

The experiment procedure shows in Fig. 1
                        . We analyzed the additive of spectral radiances of the displayed color samples measured using tele-spectroradiometer at first. According to the additive color theory, and because the addition of three primary spectra comprises three times the black point spectrum, the spectral radiance of the displayed color should equal to the sum of the spectral radiance of Red, Green and Blue subtract two black point spectra in Eq. (1) 
                        [4,8,10]. While, the digital inputs were normalized into digital counts (0–1). dr

                         is the spectral radiance of absolute black which is produced by RGB inputs equal 0 respectively.

Because the crosstalk came from two primary radiances, we found the addition of two and three primary spectra did not fit with the corresponding spectral measurements of displayed color. Then we analyzed the differences between the spectral measurement of displayed colors and the addition of two and three primary spectra radiance, and found out the regulation of additive properties of the spectral radiance of displayed color in LCD. Based on the regulation, we divided the model into three subspace partitions to model the relationship of digital input and the spectral radiance of the displayed colors. Using the model, we could predict the spectral radiance of displayed colors according to the digital input of LCD.

To compare the spectral and chromatic accuracy of the model, we calculated the relative differences between the predicted and measured spectra, then converted the predicted and measured spectra into CIEL∗a∗b∗, and calculated the color differences using the color different formula.

The efficiency of the proposed model was analyzed by comparing the color differences between the predicted and measured displayed colors by using GOG, S-shape, Masking, spectral I (It is the method presented by Haoxue Liu in Ref. [5]) and polynomial at 4° and 6° models.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The experimental results show that the spectral radiance of colors which calculated by adding two primary spectral radiances are well fitted with the spectral radiance measurements of displayed two mixing colors at large digital drive values, such as the digital drive values equal 255. But it is not the case for small digital drive values, as shown in Fig. 2
                        .


                        Fig. 2 is the spectral radiance of the displayed color samples. The diagram on the left shows the spectral radiance of displayed color when the red and blue digital input both equal 8 (the blue line in the left diagram of Fig. 2, labeled as Measurement R8B8). The diagram on the right shows when the red and blue digital input both equal 255 (the blue line in the right diagram of Fig. 2, labeled as Measurement R255B255). The red lines in both diagrams of Fig. 2 show the sum of the spectral radiance of displayed respective red and blue. In the left diagram, the digital input of red and blue are 8 respectively (labeled as Addition of measured R8+B8). In the right diagram, the digital input of red and blue are 255 respectively (labeled as Addition of measured R255+B255).

In this study, the spectral radiance of the displayed color does not comply with the fundamental of additive color while the digital input of LCD is small.

The relationship between the digital scalars and the spectral radiance measurements was analyzed. In Eq. (2), Xp
                         is the spectral radiance of red, green or blue. P is stand for one of the primary color, r, g or b.

                         is the transpose of the column vector of the matrix Xp
                        , as shown in Eq. (3), and the digital scalar is dj
                        . m is the count of digital scalar. n is the count of wavelength of spectral radiance.

From the diagram of the measurements of the spectral radiance, there is a nonlinear relationship between input digital scalars and the spectral radiance at each wavelength shown in Fig. 3
                        .

Based on the relationship between the input digital scalars and the spectral radiance at the given wavelength ranges, a matrix for transferring input digital scalars to the spectral radiance of displays was defined. The Eq. (4) is defined to calculate the spectral radiance at the given wavelength.

                        n is the count of wavelength of spectral radiance measurement.

If the digital drive scalar is dp
                         (p stands for r, g or b), and a transpose of digital scalars is defined as Dp
                        =[1 dp d

                           T
                        , m is the degree of the polynomial.

The distribution of RE shows in Fig. 4
                         presents that the abnormity undulate appears when the digital inputs are less than 64; when the digital inputs are more than 160, a stable trend of RE was less than 15% appears.


                        Fig. 5
                         shows the nonlinear relationship between the digital input scalars and the spectral radiance at the given wavelength ranges. For different input digital scalars, the nonlinear relationships are different. In Fig. 5 three ranges of digital drive scalars were present. From left to right, the first one shows this relationship when the digital scalars range was from 0 to 0.25. The second one is when the range was from 0.33 to 0.627. The last one is when the range was from 0.67 to 1.

Therefore, in this study, those three subspace partitions are based on the distribution of RE and used to model the relationship of input digital scalars and the spectral radiance of displayed colors.

To improve the precision of the characterization, different polynomial models named as SRPPM were used to fit different piecewise relationships.

The three coefficient matrixes are defined in Eq. (6).

                        k is the mark for piecewise partition of digital scalar.


                        n is the number of wavelength of the measured data.

The computation workflow of SRPPM is shown in Fig. 6
                        . Firstly, the input digital scalars are compared with the partition points. Then, SRPPM model was used to select the corresponding coefficient matrix to calculate the spectral radiance of displayed color.

To analyze the precision of SRPPM, the color differences between the measured data and the predicted data that from different characterizing models were computed. Those models were GOG, Polynomial, Masking, S-shape, Spectral I and SRPPM. The color differences are listed in Table 1
                        , and the CRF of the color differences is shown in Fig. 7
                        .

In Table 1, the maximum and average color differences of SRPPM are the smallest among all the models. The average color difference of SRPPM is 0.82ΔE
                        76. According to the CRF curve which shown in Fig. 7a, 80% of the color differences of the SRPPM model are less than 1ΔE
                        76, and 11% of the color differences are 0ΔE
                        76. After characterization, all the RE of color samples are less than 25%, and most of them are less than 15%, as shown in Fig. 7b. That means the performance of the display characterization when used SRPPM was good.

After characterization, the spectral radiance of the addition of two and three primaries is fitted with that of measurements of secondary and tertiary color perfectly at small digital scalars, as shown in Fig. 7c. That means the characterization using SRPPM is excellent performance at smaller color difference and could predict spectral radiance of display precisely.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Having an accurate transformation between digital drive signals and colorimetry (or spectral radiance) for computer-controlled displays is critical for color reproduction. The SRPPM, which is proposed by this paper, presents a piecewise partition characterization for LCD with the spectral radiance measured which simplified the algorithm with cubic polynomial algorithm and reduced the number of samples for measurement. When the display characterization used SRPPM, showing the excellent performance of the model 80% of the color differences between measured and predicted data are less than 1ΔE
                     76.

However, there are some limitations of using SRPPM. The SRPPM uses the spectral radiance to train the coefficient matrixes which would became more complex for different function of the spectroradiometer, and the partitions would change with the stability of the display.
