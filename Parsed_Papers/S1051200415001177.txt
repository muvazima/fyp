                  This paper examines the application of binary integration to X-band maritime surveillance radar, with a view to enhancing detection performance. The clutter is assumed to follow a Pareto distribution, since this model has been validated for high resolution X-band maritime clutter returns. The binary integration process is based upon an order statistic detection scheme, which has the constant false alarm rate property with respect to the Pareto shape parameter. An optimisation procedure is outlined, which results in ideal choices for the binary integration factor and the order statistic index. Performance of the resultant detection process is analysed, with homogeneous and heterogeneous simulated clutter, whose parameters are matched to those obtained from real clutter data sets. A direct application to real data is also included.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Binary integration is a suboptimal incoherent detection process, which has a simple receiver implementation, while potentially improving detection performance [1]. The technique was introduced in [2], and then further refined to include optimal choices for integration parameters [3]. The process of binary integration involves examining a series of univariate detection processes, and integration of the detection results by declaring a target present if at least a predetermined minimum number of hits is exceeded. If the univariate detection processes have the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property, with respect to clutter parameters, then the binary integrated detection process will also preserve this property. The development and applications of binary integration to target detection in various clutter environments can be found in [4–10].

In this work, binary integration is applied with order statistic (OS) CFAR detectors, designed to operate in Pareto distributed clutter [11]. The motivation for analysing OS-CFAR is that it has the potential to manage interference very well. The Pareto clutter model is used because it has been validated for high resolution X-band maritime surveillance radar clutter returns, independent of the grazing angle [12,13]. Additionally, the Pareto model is a member of the class of the amplitude (or intensity) models associated with compound Gaussian processes and hence it fits the currently accepted clutter model characteristics [14,15].

A new technique for CFAR development based upon the Pareto clutter assumption can be found in [16], with extensions reported in [17] and [18]. The approach used is to transform CFAR processes designed for Gaussian intensity clutter, to operate in Pareto distributed clutter. As a consequence of this, the Gaussian probability of false alarm (Pfa) and threshold multiplier relationship is preserved. The new detectors depend explicitly on the Pareto scale parameter. However, there are new algorithms that allow efficient estimation of it in practice [19]. Hence it will be assumed throughout this work that this parameter is completely known.

This paper will establish how one can optimise the choice of OS-CFAR and the binary integration parameter, so as to maximise detection performance in X-band high resolution radar clutter. By accounting for an expected number of interfering targets, an optimal choice for the OS-CFAR index is outlined. Additionally, by applying methods as in [20], the optimal number of pulses to integrate can be determined. This is done with respect to Swerling target models in Pareto distributed clutter. However, some rules of thumb can be established, relative to the clutter's polarisation, on the best choice for binary integration parameters in general.

Throughout this work Pareto clutter parameters, for simulated data, have been based upon estimates taken from real data sets. This is Defence Science and Technology Organisation's (DSTO) Ingara data, which is a series of X-band high resolution medium to high grazing angle maritime surveillance pure clutter returns. The Ingara radar has been discussed in a number of publications [21,22]. The data obtained, and modelled by a Pareto distribution in intensity, has been discussed extensively in [13,23,24]. The radar is fully polarimetric, and operated in a circular spotlight mode, obtaining clutter measurements in the full 360° of azimuth angles. Included in the numerical analysis is an application to target detection when a synthetic target is embedded within the real data sets. This will give an indication of the relative merits of binary integration with OS-CFAR.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical preliminaries, while Section 3 discusses optimisation of detection process parameters. Section 4 illustrates the performance of binary integration in homogeneous Pareto distributed clutter. The effect of interfering targets in the CFAR range profile is then examined in Section 5. False alarm regulation is considered in Section 6, where the effect of clutter power changes on the design Pfa is analysed. Finally, Section 7 examines the binary integration process applied to high resolution X-band maritime surveillance radar clutter returns collected by DSTO. Due to the absence of a target in the data, synthetic Swerling target models are inserted. This allows the construction of detection performance curves, giving an indication of real detector performance.

A CFAR process takes a video range profile, consisting of amplitude or intensity measurements, and passes it to a shift register of a given length. Subsampling is then performed so that the returns are approximately uncorrelated. This can be achieved by applying guard cells between each observation. A cell under test (CUT) is included in the data in the shift register, where this element will be tested for the presence of a target. From a mathematical perspective, it is usual to assume that there are a series of pure independent clutter returns

                        , where X is the statistic of the CUT. This detection process is said to be CFAR if τ is independent of the clutter power [26]. Such a test can be written succinctly in the form

OS-based CFAR processes were first introduced in [27], which base the choice of the function T on an order statistic. The success of an OS-based detection process in managing interference and clutter transitions in a Weibull background is demonstrated in [28]. In the Pareto context, [17] shows how Gaussian-based OS-CFAR detectors can be transformed. If we let

                         is the Gamma function [25]. Hence (3) uses the kth OS, for some integer 
                           1
                           ≤

                           N
                        . The Pfa (4) can be recognised as that for a Gaussian based OS-CFAR process [17,29]. Clearly the detector is CFAR with respect to the Pareto shape parameter. For a given Pfa, numerical inversion is applied to (4) to extract τ for application in (3).

Suppose we have a series of M scans, each consisting of N clutter cells for the CFAR process, a CUT and guard cells on either side of the CUT. The process of binary integration is to declare a target present if at least S out of the M individual detection processes register a target present [1]. In order to analyse this process mathematically, we assume each of the clutter returns in each detection cell is independent. Additionally, it is assumed that the independence property holds between each of the M range profiles, and the probability of detection remains uniform also, following the assumptions used in [9].

Suppose that p is the success probability in a series of M Bernoulli trials. Then the probability of at least S successes is given by

Under the assumption of independence, the false alarm probability for the binary integration scheme is given by 
                           f
                           (
                           
                              Pfa
                           
                           )
                        , where Pfa is given by (4), while if Pd denotes the detection probability associated with (3), then 
                           f
                           (
                           
                              Pd
                           
                           )
                         is the detection probability of the binary integration scheme. Hence analysis in simulated clutter can be based upon (5) with (4). Observe that, in view of (5), if the underlying detection process has the CFAR property with respect to a given clutter parameter, then the binary integrated detection process will preserve this property.

Due to the fact that a large number of assumptions form the basis for the results presented in this paper, Table 1
                         lists the major assumptions and includes a brief description and references providing a justification or validation for it.

For a fixed integration maximum M, there have been attempts to select an optimal S 
                        [3,20]. Before examining this, it is of interest to examine binary integration from a mathematical perspective.

An analysis of the binary integration scheme is now provided. Since the idea behind integration in a radar detection context is to improve performance via increasing information, one can ask the following question. When does the detection probability given by (5) improve on that from the single look/univariate detection process defined by (3)? As a first case, consider for a detection probability p resulting from (3), the requirement that

The proof of Lemma 2.1 is elementary and hence is omitted.

Observe that property (1) in Lemma 2.1 implies that, with an application of the intermediate value theorem, for each S 
                        
                           
                              
                                 g
                              
                              
                                 S
                              
                           
                           (
                           p
                           )
                         will possess at least one stationary point. Property (2) implies 
                           
                              
                                 g
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           (
                           p
                           )
                           <
                           0
                         because 
                           0
                           <
                           p
                           <
                           1
                        . Hence binary integration based upon 
                           S
                           =
                           1
                         will always have a greater integrated detection probability.

By contrast, property (3) in Lemma 2.1 implies that 
                           
                              
                                 g
                              
                              
                                 M
                              
                           
                           (
                           p
                           )
                         is always nonnegative, and so binary integration based upon 
                           S
                           =
                           M
                         will always introduce a detection loss. Finally, note that the second term on the right hand side of property (4) in Lemma 2.1 is always nonnegative, therefore it follows that 
                           
                              
                                 g
                              
                              
                                 S
                              
                           
                           (
                           p
                           )
                         is an increasing function of S, for each fixed p. Consequently one can conclude that the maximum binary integration gain will result from the 
                           S
                           =
                           1
                         case.

In a CFAR system one desires to maintain the Pfa at a fixed level, and thus it is necessary to determine an appropriate threshold multiplier to use in (3), based upon setting the Pfa through (5). As a result of this, the corresponding univariate detection probability, used in each binary integration and for the same Pfa, will be produced with a different threshold multiplier, and so one needs to account for this with the selection of an optimal S.

Consider the binary integration Pfa defined by 
                           f
                           (
                           
                              Pfa
                           
                           )
                         with (5). Due to the fact that in cases of interest, Pfa will be very small (such as 
                           
                              
                                 10

                        ) one can apply a Poisson approximation [30] to the binomial integration. It is shown in [30] that the distribution of a Binomial random variable X with parameters M and p, and mean 
                           λ
                           =
                           M
                           p
                        , can be approximated by the distribution of a Poisson random variable Y with matched mean parameter λ, with an error bound given by

                         where the set A is a subset of the nonnegative integers. The error bound (9) implies that the Poisson approximation of a Binomial distribution only depends on the probability p and not M. However, for a meaningful approximation, it is necessary that the mean λ remains finite and nonzero.

Thus, applying a Poisson approximation to (5),

                         which has been obtained from (4) and (11). In order to analyse (12), the following Lemma is required:


                        
                           Lemma 2.2

                              is a decreasing function of the threshold multiplier τ.
                           

The proof of this lemma can be found in Appendix A.

                        . From (14), the univariate detection processes used in binary integration are set with a Pfa smaller than the design Pfa, and hence it follows from the above considerations that the threshold multiplier

It is immediate also, based upon (3), that the binary integration univariate probability of detection will be smaller than that of a single detection process (3). This can be realised by noting that if the underlying detection statistic is Z (for brevity), then if we let

Consequently, for the case of CFAR detection with binary integration, the analysis in the preceding discussions needs to be reconsidered. In particular, due to the variation in the resultant Pd, the criterion of optimising S needs to be reformulated to accommodate CFAR. This will be a significant focus of the results in Section 3. However, before proceeding to this, some further comments are made concerning the selection of S and binary integration gains. The following Proposition establishes that there exists an S that will result in binary integration gains:

This proposition implies that it is always possible to improve detection performance with binary integration, and there may be several S which yield larger detection probabilities. Due to the fact that the detection probabilities will depend on the clutter characteristics as well as the received target signature, and especially the target strength, it is difficult to determine a mathematically exact relationship between

The results in this section demonstrate that binary integration has the potential to improve detection performance. However, it is difficult in general to determine the degree of improvement analytically. The merits in binary integration will be demonstrated with numerical examples to follow. What is now required is an optimal way in which to select S, as well as an outline of appropriate choices for the OS index k.

To begin, the determination of an appropriate k in (3) is examined. The following Proposition is useful for this purpose:

                                       k
                                    
                                 
                              
                              , given by inversion of

However, in order to manage interfering targets, it is thus advisable to not select k too close to the maximum of N. Consequently, if the detection process is designed to manage

The next parameter to be considered is the binary integration parameter S. It will be assumed that the maximum number of integrated pulses M is fixed. The problem of optimal selection of S has been examined extensively in previous work [1,3,20]. Most of the schemes that examine such optimisation base analysis on the assumption of a certain target model. The approaches, along these lines, such as in [20], become difficult mathematically with the assumption of Pareto distributed clutter, even with a Swerling target model. In the following, a numerical method to optimise the selection of S is examined, while in the following subsection progress is reported on the adaptation of the approach of [20] to the case of Pareto distributed clutter.

As discussed in [20], for a specified univariate cumulative detection probability and false alarm rate, and a fixed number of maximum binary integration returns, there exists an optimal S which minimises the required signal to clutter ratio (SCR), and maximises the binary integration gain. This can be done visually or numerically by plotting the minimum SCR as a function of S, under the assumption of a certain signal model. To illustrate this, Fig. 1
                         provides two examples of this. Here the minimum desired Pd is set to at least 0.5. The left subplot corresponds to a Pareto clutter model with 
                           α
                           =
                           4.7241
                         and 
                           β
                           =
                           0.0446
                        , which is a typical horizontally polarised case. The right subplot is based upon 
                           α
                           =
                           15.8983
                         and 
                           β
                           =
                           0.1812
                        , which is typical for vertical polarisation. For these two examples, the CFAR design parameters are 
                           N
                           =

                           =

                           =
                           
                              
                                 10

                         and 
                           M
                           =
                           8
                        . In both cases, a Swerling 1 target model is assumed. The left subplot shows that the optimal S is 4, while the right subplot indicates that it is 2 for this case. Table 2
                         shows selected values for 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 opt
                              
                           
                         based upon four clutter models, and three Swerling target models. These models are a Swerling 0 (constant) target (SW 0), a Swerling 1 (Gaussian) target (SW 1) and a Swerling 3 target (SW 3). Additionally, Table 2 specifies which Ingara data set the Pareto clutter parameters have been sourced from, as well as the azimuth angle and polarisation. Only examples for horizontal and vertical transmit and receive polarisation are considered. Based upon Table 2, it is clear for target detection in horizontally polarised clutter, a larger value for S must be selected, than that required for the vertically polarised case.

Although the algorithm of the previous subsection can be readily applied in practice, it would be useful to examine whether an analytical expression can be obtained for 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 opt
                              
                           
                        . In this subsection, progress toward this objective is reported. For convenience, this is specialised to the case of a Swerling 1 target model. The cases of constant and Swerling 3 targets introduce increased complexity, due to difficulty in finding an appropriate expression for the univariate detection probability. Extension of the results presented here to other Swerling target models will be the subject of future work.

The idea employed is to extend the approach of [20] to the Pareto setting. In the latter, an approximation is obtained for 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 opt
                              
                           
                         for the case of a Swerling target in Gaussian intensity clutter. Due to the model and clutter assumption, [20] is able to exploit the fact that the univariate probability of detection can be written explicitly in terms of the signal to clutter ratio. By then viewing this as a function of the binary integration parameter S, one can derive an approximate differential equation, and then search for conditions under which the SCR, as a function of S, has derivative zero. This enables the construction of estimates of 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 opt
                              
                           
                        . The difficulty in extending this to the Pareto setting is the lack of closed form relationship between the univariate detection probability and the SCR. Here the main result is presented without proof.

The approximation (19) was applied to the relevant examples in Table 2, and found to be slightly inaccurate, which is attributable to the series of crude approximations applied in its derivation. For run 34 690, (azimuth 255°) in the case of horizontal polarisation (19) was estimated to be 7, compared to 4 via the numerical algorithm. For the same run, and with vertical polarisation, (19) returned an estimate of 5, compared with the numerical estimate of 2. For run 34 683 (azimuth 225°), in the case of horizontal polarisation, (19) was 7, compared with a 3 from the numerical algorithm. For the same run, but with vertical polarisation, (19) returned an estimate of 6, compared with the numerical estimate of 2. Clearly further research is required to improve these results.

Performance analysis begins with the examination of binary integrated OS-CFAR in homogeneous Pareto clutter. In this Section, as well as in subsequent sections, the CFAR parameters are set to

                      provides examples of detection performance using binary integration with OS-CFAR in several different scenarios. The plots in Fig. 2 have been based upon simulated clutter with 
                        α
                        =

                        0.0047
                     , corresponding to spiky horizontally polarised data. The left subplot uses a Swerling 0 target model, and so 
                        
                           
                              S

                        6
                     , based upon Table 2. The right subplot is for the case of a Swerling 1 target model, and so 
                        
                           
                              S

                        4
                     , based upon Table 2. This example illustrates detection performance curves for each possible selection of S, together with a standard OS-CFAR curve. The Figure shows that the optimal choice for S, based upon Table 2, is indeed correct. A similar result can be illustrated for the same scenario, except with a Swerling 3 target model (figure not included for brevity).

Analogous results can be demonstrated for less spiky clutter. In particular, it was found that for vertical polarisation with Pareto clutter parameters

                      values in Table 2 worked well. A limitation of this is that knowledge of the target type is required. However, one can formulate some approximate rules of thumb, based upon the results in Table 2. For detection in spiky clutter, namely horizontally polarised returns, one could select a larger S, which is to be expected because of the difficulty with detection in such clutter. Thus one could select 
                        
                           
                              S
                           
                           
                              opt
                           
                        
                        =
                        6
                      based upon Table 2, for binary integration of up to 
                        M
                        =
                        8
                      pulses. For the vertically polarised case, the choice for 
                        
                           
                              S

                      can be reduced, since less pulses are required for detection. Hence, for binary integration of up to 
                        M
                        =
                        8
                      pulses, one can select 
                        
                           
                              S

                     , based upon Table 2.

These results demonstrate that binary integration can provide a significant gain over univariate CFAR detection, and that it can be designed to have optimal performance. In the next Section, the effect of interfering targets in the clutter range profile will be examined.

The effect of interference is now considered, by embedding a number of independent and identically distributed targets into the clutter range profile. In all cases, a Swerling I target models is used for both interference and the CUT. Fig. 3
                      is an example in the case of horizontal polarisation. Here, the clutter is modelled by a Pareto distribution with 
                        α
                        =
                        3.1912
                      and 
                        β
                        =
                        0.0047
                     . The left subplot shows a detection performance curve when there are up to three interfering targets, each with 
                        
                           SCR
                        
                        =
                        10
                      dB. For this scenario, 
                        
                           
                              S
                           
                           
                              opt
                           
                        
                        =
                        4
                      is used. The right subplot shows a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), plotting the Pd as a function of the Pfa. The target in the CUT, for this plot, has SCR 10 dB. There is a degradation in detection performance with the introduction of interference. However, if the interference power is reduced, the detection loss is correspondingly reduced.

In the vertically polarised case, similar results are also found, except the detection performance improves due to the polarisation.

The next stage of analysis of the OS-CFAR binary integration scheme is to examine the effects of clutter transitions on the design Pfa.

Since CFAR detection processes are designed to control the desired Pfa, it is important to examine the effect of clutter changes on the resultant Pfa. This is done by examining the Pfa as the number of CFAR clutter cells are slowly increased with either increasing or decreasing powered clutter [29]. While Monte Carlo methods can be applied to estimate the resultant Pfa, it is more accurate to construct an analytic expression instead. The approach used in [9] can be applied to the Pareto case, with a much simpler expression resulting than that for Weibull distributed clutter.

Suppose we have a series of independent clutter returns where the first set consists of T Pareto distributed returns with shape parameter

                      and scale parameter β, while the second set of 
                        N
                        −
                        T
                      consists of Pareto distributed returns, with the same scale parameter but shape parameter 
                        
                           
                              α

                     . Changes in clutter power can be introduced by selecting

If the clutter range profile has length N, then once the approximate middle of the clutter cells are considered saturated with higher powered clutter, the CUT is then also considered to be affected. Hence we suppose the CUT has a Pareto distribution with scale parameter β, and shape parameter μ. The value of μ is

                     , with a design Pfa of 
                        
                           
                              10

                      has been set to 4. The left subplot in Fig. 4 corresponds to a 1 dB power increase, while the right subplot is for a 
                        
                           CCR
                        
                        =
                        5
                      dB. The change in the design Pfa is clearly seen, with the level of deviation dependent on the strength of the clutter power variation.

In the case of vertical polarisation there is a much stronger deviation from the design Pfa than the horizontally polarised case.

To complement the analysis presented in the preceding sections, an application to target detection in real data is included. This has been achieved by embedding a Swerling target model within DSTO's Ingara data. Initially the focus is on the case of horizontal polarisation, due to the fact that this presents the greater challenge for target detection as shown in the simulation analysis. The data sets used for this purpose are run 34 690 at azimuth angle of 255° (with 
                        α
                        =
                        3.1912
                      and 
                        β
                        =
                        0.0047
                     ) and run 34 683, at an azimuth angle of 225° (with 
                        α
                        =
                        4.7241
                      and 
                        β
                        =
                        0.0466
                     ). These clutter parameters have featured in the simulated detection performance analysis in previous sections.

In order to give an indication of the performance of the proposed binary integrated OS-CFAR scheme analysed in the preceding sections, the clutter in a particular azimuth data set can be analysed by running a sliding window across the data. This window partitions the data into segments which can then be used for sequential univariate detection, with the results combined via binary integration.

Data set run 34 690, used for this analysis, contains 989 184 clutter measurements, and the detection process applied consists of binary integration of eight OS-CFAR processes. Three Swerling target models are considered, and so a choice of 
                        S
                        =
                        6
                      was selected, based upon the idea that more pulses will be required in the integration process due to horizontal polarisation. As in previous sections, the Pfa has been set to

                     , with the univariate CFAR process using 
                        N
                        =
                        32
                      and 
                        k
                        =
                        29
                     . Two guard cells have been used on either side of the CUT. Based upon this, a run length of 988 888 is available. For each target SCR, this run length is used to give an estimate of the probability of detection. Fig. 5
                      (left subplot) shows the detection performance, as a function of the SCR, for a constant target (Swerling 0), a Swerling 1 and 3 target models.

The right subplot is for run 34 683, with all parameters retained from the previous example. This Ingara data set contains 840 704 clutter measurements, Based upon this, a run length of 840 408 is available. The key difference between the two subplots is that the left subplot, which is spikier clutter, requires a larger SCR for target detection. As an example, in the left subplot and for a Swerling 0 target model, it is not until almost 0 dB that an approximate Pd of 0.5 is attained. In the left subplot, this occurs at approximately −4 dB by contrast.

The plot shows how the detection scheme will perform in practice. It is worth noting that the Ingara clutter is correlated (see [18]), and hence not homogeneous. Hence the assumptions under which the binary integration scheme was designed are not valid. Consequently, the plots are entitled approximate detection performance curves. Nonetheless, the figures show that the binary integration process enhances detection performance in real data, even with design assumption violation. An underlying assumption also made is that the Pareto scale parameter is known. In further analysis of binary integration, running on real data, the effect of estimation of β adaptively will be considered.

As a final comparison, the direct application of binary integration to the Ingara data is compared with variations in the clutter model assumption and detector. In particular, it is of interest to investigate the result of applying the binary integration scheme of [9]. In the latter, analysis is based upon the Weibull clutter model assumption. Hence the clutter is assumed to have distribution function

                      Observe that in view of (27), it is clear that under a Weibull clutter model assumption, the univariate detection process is only CFAR with respect to the Weibull scale parameter. Consequently, this will mean that the binary integration process will only be CFAR with respect to the same parameter.

                     , and for vertical polarisation in the right subplot. The interesting observation is that in both polarisations, the binary integration process based upon a Pareto clutter model assumption improves on that based upon a Weibull clutter model. This may be due to the fact that the univariate detection process (3) has been constructed by transformation of the Gaussian intensity OS-CFAR process to operate in a Pareto clutter environment. The detector (26) is the Gaussian intensity OS-CFAR detection process applied directly in a Weibull clutter environment, using (27) to set ν appropriately. Hence the latter may not be the ideal way in which to produce a Weibull-based OS-detector.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A binary integration detection process, coupled with an OS-CFAR detector, was introduced and optimal selection of detection parameters were discussed. This integration scheme was then shown to work well with Swerling targets in homogeneous clutter. When interference was included in the clutter range profile, there was an inevitable detection loss, which was managed by appropriate selection of the OS index. It was also demonstrated that during clutter transitions, the design Pfa could be better regulated in the case of horizontally polarised clutter. With vertical polarisation, there was an unacceptable deviation from the design Pfa. These results suggest that it is more appropriate to perform detection in the horizontally polarised case, to preserve the CFAR property.

In view of this, an application where a Swerling target was embedded directly into the Ingara data, was considered, for horizontal polarisation. Despite the breakdown in design principles, the binary integration process showed very good performance in the real data. Finally, it was shown that binary integration based upon a Pareto clutter model assumption worked better than that based upon a Weibull model, for the Ingara data. This is attributed to the way in which the CFAR scheme is designed for the Pareto clutter model assumption.

                         Observe that the derivative (35) is zero at 
                           θ
                           =

                        , implying a stationary point.

By a second application of differentiation to (35), one can arrive at the second derivative
