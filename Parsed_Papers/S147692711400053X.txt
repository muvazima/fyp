                  Inferring transcriptional regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their targets has utmost importance for understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in cellular system. In this paper, we introduced a computational method to predict regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis based on gene expression data and sequence information. Support vector machine (SVM) and Jackknife cross-validation test were employed to perform our method on a collected dataset including 178 positive samples and 1068 negative samples. Results showed that our method achieved an overall accuracy of 98.39% with the sensitivity of 94.88%, and the specificity of 93.82%, which suggested that our method can serve as a potential and cost-effective tool for predicting regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulations is a crucial step to elucidate various biological processes. In eukaryotes, a protein known as transcriptional factor (TF) binds specifically to the cis-regulatory element of a gene to executive biological processes or adapt to different environmental stresses. Mining the regulatory interaction between TF and its target can help biologist to decipher the complicated regulatory networks and uncover the processed of growth control, cell-cycle progression, and development as well as differentiated cellular function (Alberts et al., 1994).

In the past decade, extensive efforts have been made to identify the TF–target regulatory interaction in genome-wide research. Probably the most famous experimental method is ChIP-on-chip technique, which combined the chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray technologies, and can directly identify in vivo promoters for a specific TF (Orlando, 2000; Ren et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2000). However, such experiment is based on a certain special TF and need to get the specific antibodies for the TF. Subsequently, with the huge accumulation of molecular and microarray data, many computational methods for predicting the regulatory interactions are proposed. These methods can be generally classified into two categories: methods in the first categories identify the TFBS of the TF on the cis-regulatory element of a gene under the assumption that genes with the similarity expression profile may under the similar transcriptional coregulation. So the genes can be grouped into disjoint clusters on the basis of similarity in their expression profiles or functional annotations (Eisen et al., 1998; Roth et al., 1998; Spellman et al., 1998; Hughes et al., 2000). Genes in the same cluster are thought to be transcriptionally co-regulated, and their regulatory regions can be analyzed for the presence of shared sequence motif (Tavazoie et al., 1999; Brazma et al., 1998; Vilo et al., 2003; Doi et al., 2008). Methods in the second categories circumvent the TFBS finding process and focus on gene expression data. (Qian et al., 2003; Friedman et al., 2000; Yoo et al., 2002; Nero et al., 2009; Jiao et al., 2011). They used gene expression data to infer TF–target regulatory interactions, without identifying the TFBS in the promoter region of a target gene.

Despite the computational approaches introduced above are very promising to discover TF–target regulatory interactions, they still have some limitations. Many researches argue that inferring regulatory interactions based on microarray data has some inherent faults. First, TFs and their targets do not have a correlated expression profile data over a time course (Qian et al., 2001), so measuring similarity of expression profile suggests only a statistical dependency between TF and its targets, not a direct causal relationship. Second, microarray is a kind of high-throughput analysis technology after all, so it cannot be very precise. Genes with a slim expression level can hardly be detected accurately (Liu et al., 2010). Therefore it is inadequate to predict regulatory interactions only considering the expression data, which leaves us wondering whether some simple but potentially probable basic information could be uncovered.


                     Arabidopsis thaliana, as a primary experimental plant model, has widely used in a reductionist approach to dissect different aspects of plant biology (Somerville and Koornneef, 2002). Inferring of regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis not only enhances our knowledge of biological processed in plants, but also helps a great deal in developing bio-engineered crops that can better sustain challenging environments (Kasuga et al., 1999). In this paper, we introduced a computational approach for inferring regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis based on SVM by incorporating a variety of features including gene expression data and sequence information of the TF and its target gene. Our method was evaluated by the Jackknife cross-validation on a set of 178 positive regulatory interactions and 1068 negative gene pairs, and achieved good performance in an overall accuracy of 98.39%.

Gene expression data were obtained from the TAIR database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/expression/microarray/ATGenExpress.jsp). This microarray dataset contains 79 different samples derived from different tissues and different developmental stages in wild-type Columbia (Col-0) and various mutants of Arabidopsis, including seedling and whole plant, leaves, roots, flower and pollen, shoots and stems, siliques and seeds. In addition, we extracted the upstream promoter sequences up to 1000bp for each gene from the genome-wide of Arabidopsis and download the peptide sequences of TFs from the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS).

In order to meet the requirement of our regulatory interactions prediction problem in a form suitable for training, we constructed TF–target gene pairs (T, G) as follows. These pairs consisted of a known TF T and a putative target gene G that might be regulated by this factor T.

The gene expression data collected is based on 79 experimental conditions in all, and each condition is repeated 3 times by experiments. In this study, the average of triplicate values was calculated for each condition and regarded as the final expression value. Then, we got 79 expression values as a feature vector for each TF and target gene, formulated as

In Eukaryotes, transcription factors regulate their target genes through binding their respective promoter regions. Hence in this study, the sequence-derived information features were extracted to describe the peptide sequence of TF and the promoter sequence of target gene. Amino acid composition (AAC) is a conventional sequence-based feature for protein sequence, which consists of 20 components, referring to the occurrence frequencies of the 20 amino acids in a given protein sequence. Here, AAC was applied to represent the peptide sequence of TF and was denoted as:

                           As is known, the promoter is a specific, short DNA sequence motif located in the upstream sequence of a target gene, providing a control point for regulated gene transcription. Further analysis of the promoter sequence is useful for getting some information to infer regulatory interactions. In bioinformatics, k-mers usually refer to specific k-tuples or k-grams of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences that can be used to identify certain regions within biomolecules like DNA sequence. Specially, 3-mers, which are called codon, as a triplet form in mRNA is of great significance in biology. In view of this, many work employed 3-mers as a useful tool for characterization of DNA sequences (Nikolaou and Almirantis, 2003; Wang and Zhang, 2006). In this study, we also utilized the combination of 3-mers as characteristic features to represent the promoter sequence. The frequencies of 64 3-mers are formulated as:

A set of 598 experimentally validated TF–target interactions involving 35 TFs annotated as “confirmed” were downloaded from the AGRIS. These data were filtered as the following steps: we first discarded those interactions which are found no gene expression data in the TAIR database. Then, the interactions found no corresponding peptide sequence of TFs or the promoter sequence of target genes in the TAIR database were also removed. However, of all the 598 TF–target interactions, numbers of target genes regulated by different TFs vary significantly. For example, the TF AT5G11260 has 216 TF–target interactions, while TF AT5G61850 has only one confirmed interaction. This sample imbalance problem will cause the prediction result possibly dominated by the TF AT5G11260, and underestimated the effect of the TF AT5G61850. In order to alleviate this imbalance problem and expect that each TF–target interaction contributes equally to the prediction results, we reduced the number of TF–target pairs for TFs like AT5G11260, and only randomly retained up to 30 TF–target interactions in the final. After above process, a set of 178 TF–target interactions were left as the positive samples.

The negative samples, which would be gene pairs have no regulatory interactions definitely, are essential for a reliable classifier. But to our knowledge, current database do not document negative samples on Arabidopsis. In the study, motivated by Qian et al. (2003), we adopted the following strategies to construct the negative samples: For the TF T whose TFBS was known, we searched for its binding site in the upstream sequence of all genes. If the promoter sequence of the target gene G contained no TFBS for transcription factor T, the pair (T, G) constituted a negative sample. Then for the TF T whose TFBS was unknown, we randomly selected a gene G to construct a gene pair (T, G). To make sure the gene G was not regulated by T, we disorganized the expression data of gene G randomly by rearrangement of the components of the vector V while keeping the expression data of TF T unchanged. Lastly, we constructed 1068 negative samples, which is 6 times the number of positive samples. The positive and negative samples constructed in this paper are list in Table 1
                        , and all the regulatory interactions we predicted are in the case of they were common in all tissues.

SVM, as a classifier of supervised learning machine algorithms introduced by Vapnik (1998), has been used for many kinds of pattern recognition problems in recent years. Given a set of labeled training samples vectors (positive and negative input samples), SVM can learn a linear decision boundary to discriminate the two classes. If the input samples are not linearly separable, SVM first maps the data into a high dimensional feature space, and then classifies the samples by the maximal margin hyperplanes. SVM training always seeks a globally optimized solution and avoids over-fitting. More detailed descriptions of SVM method can be found in Vapnik (1995). In our study, the Libsvm package is used to implement the SVM classifier (Chang and Lin, 2009). The Radial Basis Function (RBF) is chosen as the kernel function, which is defined as K(x, x′)=exp(−
                        γ|x
                        −
                        x′|2). Two parameters, the regularization parameter C and the kernel width parameter γ are optimized on the training set using a grid search strategy in the Libsvm.

In statistical prediction, the following three cross-validation tests are often used to examine a predictor for its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling test, and Jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995). Of these three, the Jackknife test is deemed the most effective that always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset (Mardia et al., 1979). In our study, the Jackknife test is also explored. Feature vector of each gene pair in the samples is singled out in turn as a test sample, and the remaining are used as a training sample. To evaluate the performance of the test, sensitivity (S

                           p

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

A basic hypothesis is that the variation of expression levels of TF will affect expression level of its target by the regulatory interaction (Liu et al., 2010). In order to infer that whether the regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis also conform to this hypothesis, we mapped gene expression data under each condition for some (T, G) pairs in positive samples and the results can be roughly illustrated in Fig. 1
                        . The blue line was the expression profile for TF while the red line was the corresponding regulated target gene (TG). Taking the levels of expression strength into account, we supposed that the similarity may relate to the distribution of variation range of expression levels. e.g., the smaller the relative variation range of the expression levels of the (T, G) pair is, the more the pair is likely to be strongly correlated. From Fig. 1A, we saw that the variation tendency of the expression profiles for the TF and TG were exactly similar, indicating that the expression levels of them were positively correlated. However, it seemed nearly no expression correlation between the TF and TG in Fig. 1B, because the fluctuation of the TF curve varied bigger, but simultaneously the variation of the TG is lower. In addition, in Fig. 1C and D, only part of variation range of the expression profiles was correlative. In order to avoid the intuitive of our analysis, we also checked the distribution of the Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) values of all the positive samples. The greater the absolute value of the correlation coefficient, the stronger the correlation. Fig. 2
                         showed that when |PCC|>0.6, the percent number of the positive samples is only 24.71%, which demonstrated that most of expression profile of the positive samples are not strongly correlative. From the above, it was confirmed that the correlation of the expression profile may be inadequate to infer the regulatory interaction between TF and its target.

In this study, the feature selection tool (Chang and Lin, 2001) based on Libsvm was employed to obtain the contribution score of each feature in the 242-D feature vector for the prediction performance, and the contribution score of different features was shown in Fig. 3
                        . From the previous introduction of part ‘Multiple feature construction’, we know that the former 158-D features of the vector are gene expression data, while the remaining features are the sequence information. In the bar chart, the higher the bar, the more important role the feature plays. As can be seen, the distribution of the score almost remains constant in the interval 1–28 at the beginning, and then it has a significant fluctuation in the interval 29–150. Subsequently, the score grows rapidly, and at the feature 156, 157, and 158, the score reaches the peak values 0.0684, 0.0587, and 0.0652, respectively. After that, the score sharply goes down, but the distribution has a fat fail. We found that the constant interval 1–28 happen to the two tissues of Arabidopsis: seedings and whole plants, and leaves, in which almost all features have a slightly low fluctuation. The top 20 features with the highest score were list in Table 2
                        . The ‘e’ represents the feature belonging to the gene expression profile, while the ‘s’ represents the feature coming from the sequence. It is interesting to mention that 7 of the top 10 features are the expression data of siliques and seeds, which might be due to the fact that this tissue of Arabidopsis has important relevance with the gene expression process. Meanwhile, we also found that there are 9 sequence features in the top 20 features, and 8 of them come from the 3-mers characteristic features of the promoter sequence. It suggested that employing the codons as features to represent the promoter sequence is applicable, and the sequence information have an important role in the prediction performance.

Because of the limited number of learning samples, learning with a small number of features often leads to a better generalization of machine learning algorithms (Occam's razor). Moreover, interpreting prediction is possible if the number of features is very small (Briesemeister et al., 2010). According to the contribution of each feature for the prediction performance, we selected 60 features with the highest score to form the optimal feature vector for our method, which are composed by 25 gene expression data and 35 sequence information data. We first transformed the 1246 gene pairs into 60-D fixed-length feature vectors. Then the 1246 feature vectors were fed to SVM to perform our method. In this study, we selected radial basis kernel function to build the prediction model and the two parameters C and γ are set at C
                        =32, γ
                        =3.0517578125e
                        −05. Through the Jackknife test, the overall accuracy of our method achieved 98.39%, with the sensitivity, specificity achieved 94.88% and 93.82%.

In order to investigate the effectiveness of different features selected for our prediction accuracy, we tried to choose the top K (K
                        =20, 40, 60, 80, 100) features with the highest score value and all the 242-D features as the input feature vector to perform our method. The prediction results were listed in Table 3
                        . As showed in Table 3, the specificity and the overall accuracy of SVM_60 are 93.82% and 98.39%, which are all the highest than others. The sensitivity of SVM_60 is slight lower than SVM_80, but is higher than SVM_20, SVM_40, SVM_100, and SVM_242. Moreover, we also compared the respective prediction result of the two groups: the 158 expression features and the 84 sequence features. We found that SVM_158 and SVM_84 played almost the same role in the prediction, which illustrated that we should consider both of the two groups in our study. It's worth mentioning that the specificity of SVM_242D is 73.03%, which is obviously lower than others. For Arabidopsis, the actual ratio between negative and positive interactions may achieve 1000:1 or larger. Considering the cost of experimental validation, it's more suitable to ensure the specificity value of our computational approach much higher. The result of this comparison indicated that the optimal 60-D features selected by the feature selection tool could effectively improve the prediction result.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we proposed a method to predict the TF–target regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. The novelty of the proposed method lies in combining gene expression profile and some sequence information as the characteristics to represent each given gene pair (T, G). A feature selection tool based on Libsvm was applied to extract effective features. We employed the algorithm SVM and the Jackknife test to validate the performance of our method, and the prediction result showed that our method achieved an overall accuracy of 98.39% with 94.88% sensitivity and 93.82% specificity, which demonstrated our method performed well for predicting the TF–target regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis.

Our proposed computational method is more timewise and resourcewise than the experiment-based methods, which are costly and time-consuming. However, there are still some limitations of our study. First, up to now, the TF–target regulatory interactions validated by experiment for Arabidopsis are limited, which prevent us from a broader study. The actual ratio of the positive and negative samples may be far beyond 1:6. When employing the algorithm to perform our method, this ratio will incur the imbalance problem and result in biased prediction in favor of the negative samples. Second, our proposed method relies on knowledge of the peptide sequence of TF and promoter sequence of target gene, but several gene pairs have not been found the corresponding sequence, which is also an obstacle for our application. But this may not be a problem when more and more sequence information added to our knowledge. In the future, with the increasing data on regulatory interactions validated by experiment, we hope to improve our performance of interpretability of regulatory interactions between TF and its target in Arabidopsis by integrating further biologically relevant features. Finally, we hope our approach would be a potential and complementary tool for constructing the transcriptional regulatory network of Arabidopsis.
