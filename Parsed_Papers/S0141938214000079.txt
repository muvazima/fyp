@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

White organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiency have been attracted broad attention for their future application as full-color display and solid-state lighting [1–3]. To improve efficiency, organic phosphorescent complexes [4] are widely utilized in white-light OLEDs, owing to their harvesting of both triplet and singlet excitons inducing internal quantum efficiency of 100% [5]. However, it has been identified that the efficiency roll-off is one of the main drawbacks of phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) due to triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) which occurs as the current density increased [6,7]. Additionally, the triplet states can readily diffuse more than 1000Å due to their long exciton lifetimes, which may lead to nonradiative decay by triplet quenching process in the luminescent layer [8]. Thus, it is critical to use device configurations that confine the triplet excitons within the emission layer (EML) [9].

In terms of white emission from OLEDs, it has been shown that the broad electroluminescence (EL) spectra could be obtained by incorporation of a multiple-doped emission zone (multiple-doped emissive layer [10] or multilayer of emitters [11,12]). These approaches have been demonstrated to achieve high color-rendering indices (CRI) and high efficiency for illumination application. However, they have inherent defects due to energy transfer process between different emitters, leading to unstable emission color for WOLEDs [13,14].

It has been reported that the problems mentioned above could be solved by utilizing the blue phosphorescence dopant of platinum(II) [1,3-difluoro-4,6-di(2-pyridinyl)benzene] chloride (Pt-4) in WOLEDs [15,16]. By combining the sky-blue monomer emission peaked at 480nm and red excimer emission at 660nm that originated from single Pt-4 dopants, white-light emission has been achieved. Although Yang et al. demonstrated the use of Pt-4 as a single emissive layer to fabricate white-light OLED devices, which exhibited a two-peak emission EL spectrum and good Commission Internationale de L′Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.36) [16], the devices’ chromatic stability was rather poor. Recently, Xiong et al. solved this problem by using a green fluorescence material, N,N′-di(n-butyl)-1,3,8,10-teramethylquinacridone (TMDBQA), as the complementary dopant, which improve the chromatic stability and achieved a CRI of 94 [17]. However, its current efficiency needs to be further improved for practical application. Hence, this work in this paper made an emphasis on how to improve the current efficiency and reduce the efficiency roll-off of WOLEDs based on Pt-4.

White-light OLEDs were fabricated on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. Before evaporation, ITO glasses were cleaned by deionized water, detergent water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath, sequentially, and dried in nitrogen gas flow prior to about 10min oxygen plasma treatment. Organic materials and a metallic layer were deposited using a conventional thermal evaporation system without breaking the vacuum system. During the evaporation process, the vacuum degree was about 10−6
                     mbar. The deposition rate and layer thickness were controlled in situ using quartz crystal oscillator monitors. For characterization of device performance, the current–voltage-luminance characteristics were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter and a PR-655 luminance meter. All measurements were performed at ambient atmosphere under room temperature.

Two groups of devices were fabricated during the experimental process. For all devices in Group A and Group B, 4,4′-bis[N-(1-napthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) was used as hole transporting layer (HTL), 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) was used as electron blocking layer (EBL), N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP) doped with 8wt.% Pt-4 was used as EML, 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-phenylene)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) was used as hole blocking layer (HBL), and LiF was used as electron injection layer (EIL). In addition, 4″,4′′′-N,N-diphenylamine-4-4′-diphenyl-1,1′-binaphthyl (BN1) [18] was introduced in devices for studying the generation region of excitons. The device structures in Group A are as follows.

Device A1: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

Device A2: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/BN1(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

Device A3: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/BN1(5nm)/TPBi(40nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

In Group B, the fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium(III) [Ir(ppy)3] doped TPBi emissive layer was introduced, and an additional thin film of TPBi was used as the space layer to balance the charge carriers. The device structures in Group B are reproduced below.

Device B1: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

Device B2: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(1nm)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

Device B3: ITO/NPB(40nm)/TCTA(5nm)/mCP:Pt-4(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(2nm)/TPBi:Ir(ppy)3(20nm, 8wt.%)/TPBi(30nm)/LiF(0.3nm)/Al(200nm).

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#


                     Fig. 1
                      shows the current efficiency and power efficiency of Device A1, in which the inset shows the EL spectrum composed of the monomer and excimer emission from single Pt-4 dopant. Owing to the square-planar coordination geometry of platinum (II), Pt-4 molecule favors face-to-face interactions in doped films [19,20]. It may display low-energy absorption and efficient emission bands, resulting in broad EL spectrum and generation of new emission band in the longer wavelength region. Here, with the appropriate concentration of 8wt.%, we realized white-light emission from the single Pt-4 doped emissive layer. The EL spectrum of Device A1 (see inset of Fig. 1) exhibited two main emission bands, accompanying with monomer emission of Pt-4 in the sky-blue region (λ
                     max
                     =480nm) and excimer emission in the red region (λ
                     max
                     =660nm). Additionally, its CIE coordinates were (0.32, 0.39) under the current density of 10mA/cm2, which was close to the ideal CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33) required for high quality white illumination. Since the energy transfer process between the monomer and excimer was prevented effectively [4], the CIE coordinates were very stable, that showed slightly varying from (0.312, 0.398) at 1000cd/m2 to (0.320, 0.395) at 9000cd/m2.

In contrast to typical PhOLEDs, the single Pt-4 doped white-light OLED exhibited a low efficiency roll-off property. At the luminance of 1000cd/m2, the current efficiency of Device A1 was 11.3cd/A, which was nearly equal to the maximum current efficiency of 11.5cd/A. When the luminance increased to 6000cd/m2, the current efficiency of Device A1 still maintained above 10cd/A. From published literatures, the efficiency roll-off is attributed to triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA), TTA, unbalanced carrier injection, and exciton dissociation effected by electric field [21–23]. Owing to the relative longer lifetime of phosphorescent materials, remarkable deactivation of triplet excitons could occur via non-radiative decay. Among the aforesaid effects, the undesired efficiency roll-off of white-light PhOLED is influenced mainly by TTA process. In order to suppress the TTA, extending the hole-electron recombination zone [24–26] and confining triplet exciton in EML [27] are effective methods that have ever been demonstrated.

Locating the accurate hole–electron recombination zone is the first phase to suppress the TTA. As shown in Fig. 2
                     , it is noteworthy that there are distinct energy gaps at mCP/TCTA (EML/EBL) and mCP/TPBi (EML/HBL) interfaces, respectively. So, it is predicted that both the EML/EBL and EML/HBL interfaces are hole–electron recombination zone. To determine the recombination zone accurately, Devices A2 and A3 were fabricated, in which we introduced BN1 layer into these two interfaces separately. The BN1 is reported to be a high-efficient deep blue material which emits a light peaked at 444nm [18] and can be distinguished from Pt-4 emission. As illustrated in Fig. 2, both Devices A2 and A3 exhibited analogous spectra comprising emission bands of BN1 and Pt-4. However, while comparing these two contrast devices, it is found that Device A3 with BN1 situated at mCP/TPBi interface showed a stronger emission of BN1 than that of Device A2 with BN1 situated at mCP/TCTA interface, indicating that holes and electrons were mainly recombined at the EML/HBL interface (see Fig. 3
                     ).

For PhOLEDs, it is important to avoid any back energy transfer from the triplet excited state (T1) of phosphorescence guest to any other organic layers, for example, from the T1 of host to the T1 of carrier transporting material nearby, which ensure light-emission derived from all triplet excitons. Because of the high triplet energy level of Pt-4 (∼2.65eV), the choice of host material was restricted. Here, we chose mCP as host material for its triplet energy level of 2.91eV, which is much higher than that of Pt-4. Therefore, it is speculated that there should be an efficient exothermic energy transfer from the triplet state of mCP to the Pt-4, and an excellent triplet energy confinement on the Pt-4 molecules within the emissive layer [28,29]. Both the triplet energy levels of TCTA and TPBi are higher than that of Pt-4, which means efficient suppressing the triplet energy from Pt-4 that transfer to TCTA or TPBi. Hence, the device structure of Device A1 is appropriately designed for confining the triplet excitons in emission layer, which could contribute to the low efficiency roll-off.

As previously mentioned, the white-light OLEDs based on Pt-4 exhibited a characteristic of low efficiency roll-off. But their device performance needs to be further improved for practical applications. Hence, we optimized the device structure of Device A1 and then designed Device B1, in which ultra-high efficiency green-light phosphorescent material of Ir(ppy)3 was introduced [30]. It had been identified in the former section that more triplet excitons were generated at the EML/HBL interface. Therefore, the TPBi:Ir(ppy)3 (8wt.%) layer was placed at the mCP/TPBi interface for better utilizing the efficient Ir(ppy)3. The proposed structure of Device B1 was illustrated in the inset of Fig. 4
                     . By comparing the EL spectra of Devices A1 and B1, the EL intensity of green-light which emit from Ir(ppy)3 was distinctly stronger than that of Pt-4 monomer. Simultaneously, we found that the intensity of excimer emission originated from Pt-4 in Device B1 was a bit weaker than that in Device A1, due to less carrier recombination in mCP:Pt-4 (8wt.%) layer in Device B1. As a consequence, the white-light color of Device B1 became a bit greenish, which exhibited CIE coordinate of (0.31, 0.49) at 100cd/cm2.

The current efficiency of Device B1 is shown in Fig. 5
                     , which exhibited a peak value of 34cd/A that was increased two times when compared with Device A1. However, the current efficiency of Device B1 dropped drastically as the luminance increased at the initial stage (below 100cd/m2), and turned to be relatively stable at a higher level of luminance. This interesting phenomenon could account for the serious efficiency roll-off character of Ir(ppy)3, but the Pt-4 possess an intrinsic low efficiency roll-off property. Generally, it is considered that the hole mobility is higher than the electron mobility in most organic materials. In Device B1, holes were transported to the TPBi:Ir(ppy)3 emitting layer through a long distance and recombined with electrons injected from cathode, resulting in lower luminance due to the unbalanced carrier mobility under low driven voltage. Thus, the initial current efficiency of Device B1 was primarily determined by the high efficiency of Ir(ppy)3 under the low current density. But as the driven voltage increased, more electrons were transported into the mCP:Pt-4 layer and recombined with holes transported from TCTA layer, which intensified the emission from Pt-4 and resulted in mild efficiency roll-off. Hence, Device B1 suffered a relatively low efficiency under high driven voltage that is determined by the Pt-4 emitter.

To improve the performance of Device B1, a thin film of TPBi was utilized as a space layer placed between different emitting layers in Device B1, which plotted as dashed blank boxes in Fig. 4. The thickness of the TPBi space layer was controlled at 1nm in Device B2. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 5. that Device B2 exhibited lower efficiency roll-off and maintained a higher current efficiency of 20.4cd/A at the luminance of 100cd/m2 with the CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.49), which was performed better than Device B1. Moreover, the average current efficiency of Device B2 was gratifyingly improved by at least two times than the original Device A1.

In addition, we increased the thickness of TPBi space layer to 2nm and fabricated Device B3. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the current efficiency of Device B3 was much lower than that of Device B2 since TPBi suffers from a relatively poor hole injection ability due to its high HOMO level of 6.1eV. But in Device B3, the 2nm TPBi layer trapped holes and electrons next to the mCP:Pt-4 emissive layer, leading to a stronger Pt-4 emission and gained better CIE coordinates of (0.34, 0.42) close to the pure white-light. This can be observed from the EL spectrum of Device B3 in Fig. 4. By considering the whole performance of the devices, it is observed that the EL spectrum of Device B2 was almost the same as Device B1, indicating that the emission intensity of Ir(ppy)3 is appropriate and 1nm TPBi is thick enough to broaden recombination zone availing for low efficiency roll-off.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, we demonstrated high performance white-light OLEDs based on Pt-4. The single doped device exhibited a broad EL spectrum of white-light emission containing sky-blue light band of monomer emission and red light band of excimer emission of single Pt-4 dopant, which showed a maximum current efficiency of 11.5cd/A with an extremely low current efficiency roll-off property. Moreover, device structure was optimized by applying Ir(ppy)3 as a complementary emitter and an additional 1nm thickness of TPBi as the space layer, which demonstrated current efficiency of 20.4cd/A at the luminance of 100cd/m2 with the CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.49).
