@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the home appliances industry, ongoing competition has resulted in the need for more effective cost reduction and control. As a part of this effort, at the design stage, design teams have developed various time-estimation methods that can be used for setting target costs, and have conducted ongoing analysis of the resulting production processes  [1]. In particular, the outsourcing of production of components has attracted increased attention as a means of meeting targets. This has resulted in intense collaboration between small- and medium-sized manufacturers.

Most product costs are determined at the design stage [2]. In addition, the assembly cost can be a major element in the overall cost of a product. Therefore, a quick and reliable method of estimating the assembly time is essential. After determining the dimensions and features of components on a drawing, it is necessary to determine the time needed to assemble them without actually making and assembling a physical prototype.

Currently, there are two main types of time-estimation techniques: product-based and process-based. Among the product-based time-estimation techniques, the original design for assembly (DFA) method and its variations for manual assembly have been widely adopted [3]. Among the process-based time-estimation techniques, the modular arrangement of predetermined time standards (MODAPTS), a type of time and motion study, is applied to determine the actual time needed to complete assembly  [4]. In both methods, the goal is to design assembly lines that make assembly as easy as possible so that products can be rolled off in high volumes.

Home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines all go through a manufacturing process known as “final assembly” whereby components are put together by hand to prepare the product for delivery. New components may incur different assembly operations, which can cause the time required for assembly on the line to differ. Among these, self-adhesive insulators, which are used to suppress vibration and block moisture, are designed with different forms and methods of attachment according to the requirements of the customers. For example, the front module of an air conditioner incorporates 39 insulators among its 93 parts, that is, the insulators account for 41% of the total. The cap module of a refrigerator contains 10 insulators among its 16 parts, such that the insulators account for 62% of the total.

The conventional DFA method has been widely used as a time-estimation method in the design phase. The DFA estimates the total handling and insertion time based on tables that relate the assembly time to design factors that influence the gripping, orientation, and insertion of parts  [5]. Although the DFA is able to calculate accurate assembly times for general parts, the time estimates for handling adhesive insulators range from 5 to 7 s depending on their sizes, while those for insertion vary between 5.5 and 6.5 s depending on the holding down required and their ease of alignment [6]. These estimates are far from realistic, however, because the insulators used in industry are much more varied in their sizes and shapes.

The MODAPTS system is used to analyze the way work is performed by quantifying the amount of time required to perform an assembly operation [7]. It is accurate enough to be used for setting labor rates in industry. However, the method is not easy for design engineers to apply because it incurs tedious manual processing requiring hours of effort.

In the home appliances industry, the attachment time is that time needed to attach a self-adhesive insulator. It must be estimated from a drawing in terms of product assembly time. The current time-estimation method is based on times that are directly proportional to the area of the baseline insulator. No consideration is given to the actual shape and size of the insulator. As such, the method is very easy but inaccurate. For a given size, for example, a time estimate can be determined by identifying the size of an insulator as given by the following equation: attaching 
                        
                           time

                     ). This method is easy to use because it needs only the size of the insulator, but the average difference between an estimate made with this method and the actual data can be as much as 30% because it does not consider the shape of the insulator.

In this paper, as an alternative, we propose an easy and accurate time estimation model based on the time relationship between the motions involved in attaching an insulator and the size and shape of that insulator. For this purpose, we recorded videos of the attaching of 350 different-shaped insulators of the types used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines, and then analyzed the motions used to attach them in an actual physical factory layout using MODAPTS.

This study aims to contribute to a practical means of estimating the time required for attaching self-adhesive insulators at the design stage. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section  2 describes the review of the related literature. Section  3 presents MODAPTS in detail. Section  4 presents the proposed time-estimation method and its validation. Section  5 summarizes the results obtained for an actual industrial case. Section  6 discusses the case results and some issues arising from the development of the proposed method. Finally, Section  7 summarizes the advantages and limitations identified by these studies.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The most widely used method for estimating the time required for assembly at the design stage is the Boothroyd–Dewhurst DFA Method, the Hitachi Assembly Evaluation Method, the Lucas DFA Method, and the Fujitsu Productivity Evaluation System. The first such evaluation method was developed by Hitachi and was called the Assembly Evaluation Method (AEM)  [8].

The Hitachi Assembly Evaluation Method (AEM) was developed as a design evaluation method for evaluating the assemblability of products and their component parts. It rates assemblies according to the ease with which they can be automatically assembled based on the principle of an assemblability evaluation score called a “point-loss standard”. The AEM was then extended to make it more practical in terms of cost estimation capability. The accuracy of the extended assemblability evaluation claims to be within 15% for parts. This means that AEM can be applied to a wide variety of products with a degree of accuracy that is sufficient for practical purposes  [9].

DFA has been used to enhance the ease of assembly by identifying those aspects of assembly that are relatively difficult during the product development phase. The DFA method, like the AEM method, was originally provided as a table that related the assembly time to design factors influencing parts gripping, orientation, and insertion  [10]. It assesses the difficulty of handling and insertion. The levels of difficulty in handling are determined by checking whether there are any barriers to an operative gripping a part and then moving it to a specific location. The assembly time for each component is then obtained by adding the handling time for that part to its insertion time  [11].

The Lucas DFA evaluation is based on three indices that provide a relative measure of assembly difficulty. The following three analyses are performed in three sequential stages: functional, feeding (or handling), and fitting analyses  [12]. In the analyses, the feeding/handling and fitting ratios are used as measures of performance to indicate the effectiveness of the design quality with respect to assembly [13]. When making estimates for self-adhesive parts, however, Lucas DFA provides only one score, which is 0.5. It does not attempt to make any allowance for the different sizes and features of the insulators for accurate time estimation.

Unlike the previous three methods, the Fujitsu Productivity Evaluation System allows designers to select parts similar to those to be used in the product and also specify their assembly sequence  [14]. The system promptly retrieves a library of subassemblies and a corresponding number of essential parts that are stored as a functional module and evaluates the subassemblies to obtain the assembly time and cost. The analysis addresses the handling and insertion of parts, specifies the target number of essential parts, and identifies high-cost processes and parts [8,15].

Predetermined motion time systems (PMTSs) are work measurement systems used to set basic labor rates by focusing on the manual movement of a component. The concept behind the system is to break down an activity into basic human movements and to classify each movement according to the nature of the movement and the conditions under which it is performed. Table 1
                     summarizes the characteristics of each type of PMTS, namely, Modular Arrangement of Predetermined Time Standards (MODAPTS), Methods Time Measurements (MTM-1, -2, -3), and the Maynard Operation Sequence Technique (MOST).

MTM-1, the most basic form of the MTM family, consists of seven action categories containing 26 motions that are used to describe manual activities. It incorporates four combination motions: consecutive, combined, simultaneous, and compound  [17]. MTM-2 was developed for work areas in which the work cycle is more than one minute and does not involve a large number of either complex or simultaneous repetitive hand motions. MTM-2 incorporates nine categories of multi-motion with 39 time values  [18,19]. MTM-3 is useful for situations where fast application is essential even at the expense of some accuracy. MTM-3 encompasses four categories of combined motion: handling, transport, stepping and other foot motions, bending and rising [20]. The accuracy of the MTMs is reported as MTM-2: 13% and MTM-3: 19% [20].

MOST is a simplified system developed by Zandin  [21] as a means of quickly establishing time standards. The MOST work measurement system consists of three basic sequence models: the general move sequence (the movement of an object through the air), the controlled move sequence (an object remains in contact with a surface or is attached to another object during the movement), and the tool use sequence (addressing the use of common hand tools). The sequence models provide a total time for the activities by using index numbers. An index is placed after each sub-activity in the sequence, and the index represents the time allowed for that sub-activity  [21].

The most popular type of PMTS in use today is MODAPTS, which has been tested and thoroughly proven worldwide. MODAPTS differs from other PMTSs in two aspects. The first is that it concentrates on the body part performing the moving rather than on the distance covered by the body part or the object being handled. The second aspect is that speed values in MODAPTS are simple numbers associated with the modules, and the fact that elements have identifiers that also serve as time values, which act as a form of shorthand.

As a result of the above, the benefits of the MODAPTS technique are as follows: (1) it is easy and fast to apply, (2) it produces accurate and reliable results, (3) it improves communication and productivity, (4) it can quickly determine rates, (5) the method has a quantitative basis, (6) it enables ergonomic improvement, and (7) it can increase the utilization of the labor available from individuals [7]. However, MODAPTS is still so complicated that design engineers are reluctant to learn it. To overcome this issue, we propose a motion-based time-estimation method based on designating the representative motions and MODS used in MODAPTS. The next section presents MODAPTS in detail.

To assemble components into a final product on an assembly line, sequential assembly operations are performed. MODAPTS analyzes the body motions required for these sequential assembly operations and translates them into element class codes and time values that are expressed as units called MODS. The assembly motions are represented in alphanumeric form using the element class codes listed in Table 2
                        [22].

MODAPTS identifies the element class codes and MODS for each work element according to specified rules  [7]. The movement class code, M, refers to those motions or movements that are performed by the body parts such as the finger, hand, or arm. The number of MODS associated with the movements and their corresponding distances are described in Table 3
                     .

The terminal class refers to those motions that are performed at the end of an elemental operation and which are close to the object being manipulated. There are two activities in the terminal class: Get (G) and Put (P). The auxiliary class refers to those motions that are not performed with the body parts. Some examples include walking, sitting, standing, deciding, inspecting, etc. [23,7].

Get (G) involves gaining control of an object. Put (P) involves putting an object in a specified location. The Get and Put contacts can require either low- or high-conscious control operations. According to MODAPTS, a low-conscious control operation is an automatic response requiring little muscular control, no visual control, and no mental control. To satisfactorily complete a high-conscious control operation, a degree of muscular control is required, often with visual or sensual assistance. For low-conscious control, G1 or P1 is used. For high-conscious control, G3, P2, or P5 is used.

When fastening a screw, for example, an operative tends to grip the screw in his hand. The work element can be coded as M3G1. M3 means moving the arm with 3MODS and G1 means getting a screw with 1MOD. One MOD is equivalent to 0.1 s, which is the time that a qualified and experienced person needs to complete an activity  [7]. In this paper, one MOD is set to 0.115 s by including a fatigue allowance of 15%  [21]. The time required for the work element is estimated to be 0.46 s (0.115 s * 4MODS). The next chapter presents the estimation of the time required to attach the self-adhesive insulators.

This study proposes a motion-based time-estimation method for attaching the self-adhesive insulators used in home appliances. For this research, we used MODAPTS to analyze the motions required to attach 350 insulators used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines. The representative motions were investigated through the visual observation of those motions. Table 4
                      summarizes the process for developing the motion-based time-estimation method.

From the results of the motion analysis for attaching the 350 insulators, it was found that the attachment motions could be largely classified into detaching, placing, rubbing, and folding, as shown in Fig. 1
                        . The detaching motion (1) is conducted to remove the protective film from the insulator. The putting motion (2, 3) is conducted to position the insulator on the destination area. The rubbing motion (4) establishes the firm attachment of the insulator. The folding motion (5) is conducted when it is necessary to fold an insulator along a fold line.

In addition, it was found that the attaching motions were affected by the shape and size of the insulators. Fig. 2
                         depicts shape features such as grooves, holes, fold lines, or edge steps, with the size of these shape features being the most important parameters when attaching an insulator.

We collected 350 different insulators for this study. Their shapes and sizes were classified as listed in Table 5
                        . The range of the shape and size features is summarized in Table 6
                        .

The sub-motions for attaching an insulator are associated with the shape features. For those insulators with only a main body, the detaching and putting are carried out and then a rubbing motion is carried out over the main body of the insulator. For those insulators incorporating a groove or a hole, the detaching and putting are carried out and then rubbing is performed all over the main body and then both sides of the groove or the areas surrounding the hole, respectively. For insulators including a fold line, the detaching and putting are carried out and then rubbing is performed over the main body and then the fold area after the fold has been made. If there is any edge step, additional rubbing is conducted over the main body to prevent disengagement resulting from poor adhesive contact around the edge step. The sub-motions associated with the shape features are listed in Table 7
                        .

If an insulator includes one edge step and two grooves, its attachment starts with common motions such as detaching, putting, and rubbing of the main body. The edge step of the insulator requires rubbing of the same body again. The two grooves require rubbing of the grooves twice because the iteration of rubbing the shape features is determined by the number of those shape features. The determination matrix of the sub-motions for attaching an insulator is given in Table 8
                        .

While attaching an insulator, the putting motion is conducted with either one or both hands, depending on the size of the insulator. Likewise, the rubbing motion is conducted with either one or both forearms. This section describes the cutoff length used to choose a hand motion. In addition, the times taken to complete the detaching, rubbing, or folding motions are directly proportional to the sizes of the insulators. This section describes the time values associated with the linear movements of each body type by linear interpolation.

The putting motion requires the use of either one or both hands to place the insulator in position. We examined the hand motions performed by operatives along the length of the insulators. Fig. 3
                            shows a scatter diagram for one or both hands along the length of the insulators. For insulators measuring 
                              156

                              ≤
                              l
                              ≤
                              176
                              
                              
                                 mm
                              
                           , it seems that the operatives have no preference regarding which hand they use when placing the insulator.

To estimate the time required for the putting motion, however, a cutoff length must be determined whereby one or both hands can be used within that range. We carefully examined the hand motions conducted by the operatives. We found that the distance between the end point of the thumb and the end point of the middle finger became the cutoff length because the operatives would generally grasp small insulators using these end points. Given the sizes of the body parts and the allowable joint angles for the average operative, the maximum movement distance can be calculated. Table 9
                            presents the trigonometry of the oblique triangles of the human hand. Because we know one angle (abduction) and the two adjacent sizes (thumb, middle finger), the opposite side can be determined from the law of cosines. The grasping distance then becomes about 166 mm.

We tested the 166 mm grasping distance empirically as the cutoff length by inspecting whether the operatives use either one or both hands when positioning insulators with sizes of between 156 and 176 mm. Table 10
                            lists the rates whereby one or both hands are incorrectly chosen for different grasping distances. We found that the maximum variation in the incorrect rates occurs at 176 mm, which is 2.6% for a distance of 166 mm and that variation is caused by the variation in the sizes of the operatives’ hands. Because the variation in the incorrect rates for 166 mm is very small, one of the grasping distances around 166 mm can be a candidate cutoff length. For the purpose of time estimation, however, a value of 166 mm is selected as the cutoff point because it minimizes the incorrect rate. As a result, insulators with a length of less than 166 mm are grabbed with one hand. On the other hand, insulators with a length in excess of 166 mm are grabbed with both hands.

We then compared the time difference between the estimated time by the cutoff length and the average time by simple averages. We first took the average of the times to be taken by one- and two-handed operations when positioning insulators with sizes of between 156 and 176 mm. We then compared the average of the times as estimated with the 166 mm cutoff length. As listed in Table 11
                           , the average actual and estimated times for one hand are 0.53 s and 0.575 s, respectively. The t-test statistic shows that the 
                              t
                           -value is 1.08 and the 
                              p
                           -value from this statistic is 0.287, which is more than 0.05 (the level of significance usually used for the test). Such a 
                              p
                           -value indicates that the time difference between the average actual and estimated times is statistically insignificant. For both hands, the time difference between the average actual and estimated times is also statistically insignificant.

In terms of the movement involved with the rubbing motion, rubbing begins immediately after the putting motion is complete. The rubbing motion is performed over the main body of the insulator. During the rubbing motion, the operative generally rubs the insulator with one forearm or both forearms hinged at the elbow, depending on the size of the insulator.

We examined the forearm motions conducted by the operatives along the length of the insulators. Fig. 4
                            is a scatter diagram for the one- or both-hands motion along the length of the insulators. For insulators measuring

                                 mm
                              
                           , it seems that the operatives exhibit no preference for one arm over both arms when they perform the rubbing motion.

To estimate the time required for the rubbing motion, however, a cutoff length needs to be determined for choosing between the use of one or both forearms for that range. We carefully examined the rubbing motions conducted by the operatives. The allowable distance of the rubbing movement with one forearm was calculated. Table 12
                            presents the trigonometry of an isosceles triangle of the human forearm. Because we know one angle (allowable joint angle) and the two equal sides (forearm), the baseline of the isosceles triangle (allowable distance for rubbing movements) becomes about 325 mm.

We tested the 325 mm value by inspecting whether the operatives use one or both arms when they are rubbing insulators measuring between 315 and 335 mm. Table 13
                            lists the rates of the incorrect choice of one or two arms for different rubbing distances. Because the variation in the incorrect rates around 325 mm is very small, the cutoff point around 325 mm can be a candidate cutoff length. For the purpose of time estimation, however, the 325 mm value is selected as the cutoff point because it minimizes the incorrect rate. As a result, insulators with a length of less than 325 mm are rubbed with one arm. On the other hand, insulators with a length of more than 325 mm are rubbed with both arms.

The time it takes to complete the detaching, rubbing, or folding motions is determined by the location and size of the shape features of the insulator. The variations in the time values (M) are caused by the sizes of the insulators. According to the current MODAPTS, the time value has a distinct MODS to assign the standard time values that are predetermined according to the time required to complete an elemental operation, as listed in Table 3.

The number of MODS associated with the movements of each body type is predetermined based on the average distance. For example, the average distance of the M3 movement is set to 150 mm by the movement involving the forearm hinged at the elbow. Given this definition, the time value for an insulator for which 
                              l
                              =
                              149
                              
                              
                                 mm
                              
                            becomes M3, but the time value for an insulator for which 
                              l
                              =
                              151
                              
                              
                                 mm
                              
                            becomes M4. Because the time values for the rubbing motion are directly proportional to the sizes of the insulators, such MOD assignments cannot accurately estimate the time required for the linear movements.

To more accurately estimate the time required for the linear motions, we adopted the interpolation of each interval of MODS to estimate time values that vary continuously with the sizes of the insulators. Such a simplification may be acceptable only for the insulator attachment operations. The MODS equations based on the movement distances are summarized in Table 14
                           . If the length of an insulator is 200 mm, the time required for rubbing the insulator can be estimated by the MODS equations, at 3.33 M.

Attachment times are those times required to complete four sub-motions: detaching, placing, rubbing, and folding. MODAPTS analysis translates the sub-motions into work elements. These work elements are represented with an element class code and a time value. We then remove the time values expressed in units called MODS to investigate the frequency distribution of the detaching motions. Table 15
                         lists the variations in the element class codes and their frequency for each motion.

We examined the frequency distribution of the variations in the sub-motions listed in Table 15, and determined the representative sub-motions. In the detaching motion, the MGGM motion is most frequently used (83.3%). In the putting operation, two types of motion are frequently used: MP (53.1%) and MGMPP (31.6%). For MP, both ends of the insulator are brought together with one hand. For MGMPP, one end of the insulator is placed first and then the other side is placed with both hands. For the rubbing motion, MMA2 (54.1%) and MA2 (29.7%) are most frequently used. The MGMMA motion (81.8%) is most frequently used for folding.

Through a visual examination of the actual movement of the representative sub-motions, it was found that the sub-motions involved typical movements when the operatives were attaching the insulators. The typical movements of the representative sub-motions are listed in Table 16
                        .

The next task was to determine the MODS associated with the representative sub-motions. According to MODAPTS, M and G have distinct MODS to assign standard time values that are predetermined according to the time required to complete an elemental operation. For the detaching motion, the element class code M has two types of MODS. According to the Appendix, the first M is assigned M3 because the distance between the hand of the operative on the work table and the insulator container is normally set to 150 mm, which is about equal to the forearm movement of an average operative under the current work table. Get (G) involves gaining control of an object. There is no need to concentrate when grasping either the protective film or the insulator. For low-conscious control, G1 is used. The number of the second M varies depending on the insulator size. The MODS equation associated with the size of the insulators in Table 14 is used to determine the number of M. The Appendix describes how MODS are assigned for the sub-motions. The MODS assignment of the representative sub-motions is summarized in Table 17
                        .

To test the accuracy of the representative sub-motions, we selected the sample sizes listed in Table 18
                        . By using the Grant method with a 5% allowable error  [26], the required number of observations for accuracy tests can be calculated from Eq. (1).

The initial number of observations is arbitrarily selected, and then the minimum number of observations is determined for each test. Based on the minimum number of observations, we increased the number of observations. The required number of observations is finalized as listed in Table 18. We randomly collected insulators required for observation. The range of the size and shape features of the insulators is summarized in Table 19
                        .

We compared the actual and estimated times for the accuracy of the motion-based time estimates. Table 20
                         lists sample insulators and their time differences. For the detaching motion, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is about 0.07 s (9.3%). For the putting motion, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is about 0.07 s (14.8%) with insulators measuring

                        , respectively.

For the rubbing motion for the main body, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is about 0.05 s (10.1%) with insulators measuring 
                           l

                        . For the motion of rubbing grooves, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is about 0.04 s (8.1%). For the motion of rubbing holes, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is about 0.05 s (6.8%). For the motion of folding lines, the deviation of the estimated times from the actual times is 0.08 s (8.7%).

As a result, the overall estimate made with motion-based time-estimation method can vary from the actual value by an average of 9.5%. This shows that the motion-based time estimation is sufficiently accurate for application to practical uses in comparison with MTM (13%–18%) and AEM (15%).

This section demonstrates how the motion-based time-estimation method can be used in the design stage. The procedure for using the motion-based time-estimation method is described in Fig. 5
                        . This insulator is going to be attached to the base component to prevent noise and vibration. Fig. 6
                         shows an example insulator.

In the second step, sub-motions associated with the shape features are determined using the determination matrix of the sub-motions listed in Table 8. In this case, the sub-motions for the shape features are listed in Table 21
                        . The sub-motions for attaching the insulator become detaching, placing, rubbing the main body (twice), the groove, and the hole, and then folding along the fold line.

In the third step, the representative sub-motions are identified from Table 17. The representative sub-motions are: M3G1G1M(

In the fourth step, MODS associated with the movements of the sub-motions are assigned using Table 14. The MODS for the detaching motion is given as M3G1G1M(

                           l
                        )A1 because the length of the insulator is less than 325 mm. M(

The MODS for rubbing the groove is given as M(

                         at 30 mm. Therefore, M1.6G1M1.2M1.2A2 is assigned for the folding motion.

In the final step, the overall attaching time can be estimated by adding all the MODS. According to MODAPTS, 1MOD is set to 0.115 s. The time estimate for attaching the insulator is summarized in Table 22
                        .

This section demonstrates how the proposed method can be effectively used to estimate the attaching times from insulator drawings at the product design stage. The discharge felt, which is a sub-assembly in the front case of an air conditioner, is used to adjust the direction of the air flow. The assembly includes twelve insulators to protect the internal parts from moisture. The discharge felt and the insulators are shown in Fig. 7
                     . The insulators are newly designed and attached to the main body of the discharge felt. They are all different from the 350 insulators used to develop the method, but their range of sizes and features is within that of the 350 insulators, as shown in Table 23
                     .

The case study was conducted using 57 participants, and the actual times were measured by reviewing video recordings of the attaching operations. Among the participants, 29 were male and 28 were female, with an average age of 38.4 years. Table 24
                      presents the results obtained for the average time, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and incorrect rate. For the 12 different insulators, the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to check the relative variability of the participants. It expresses the variation as a percentage of the mean and is calculated as follows: Coefficient of Variation (CV) =  100 * Standard Deviation/ Average.

A low CV implies a relatively low degree of variation. Comparing the CV values for the insulators shows that the gender and age of the participants slightly affects the attaching time. In addition, the incorrect rate for using one or both hands for 12 cases is found to be 8.7%. This is slightly higher than the incorrect rate at the cutoff length due to the small sample size.

As shown in Table 25
                     , the average accuracy was calculated to be 9.3%. The accuracy expected in the case study is slightly higher than the accuracy (9.5%) reported when developing the motion-based time-estimation method because of the similarity in the sizes and features.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Because this method is based on analyzing the body motions required to complete a task and the time required to perform those movements in the production stage, it can provide a relative accurate estimate. However, there are some modeling issues arising from development of the motion-based time-estimation method.

For the baseline hand sizes for one-hand motion, we adopted the average body size of a Korean operative. The resultant sizes are 166 mm for putting and 325 mm for rubbing. If these sizes are not appropriate in other regions or countries, the baseline sizes should be readjusted according to the rate of incorrect baseline hand motions. If the rate is high, the baseline size is not appropriate. Therefore, other baseline sizes need to be considered. To accurately estimate the time required for linear motion, we adopted interpolation of each interval of distinct MODS to estimate time values that vary continuously according to the sizes of the insulators. This assumption is valid if the movement associated with each body part can be linear within the allowable joint range of the operative’s body.


                     Table 26
                      summarizes the time difference for each of the sub-motions. The overall deviation of the motion-based time estimation is about 9.5%. Compared to MTM (13%–18%) and AEM (15%), we can conclude that motion-based time estimation offers a level of accuracy that is sufficient for practical applications. As we mentioned in the Introduction, the current time-estimation method is based on times that are directly proportional to the area of the baseline insulator. Using the current estimation method, however, the average difference between an estimate made with this method and the actual data for the 12 insulators is calculated to be an average of 30.4%.

Insulators in white goods have a wide range of sizes and shapes, which makes time estimation a challenge. To estimate the time needed to attach an insulator, we considered the entire range of sizes and features used in such appliances. Because the insulators used in the case study are used for white goods, even when an insulator is newly designed, the range of its size and shape features will be very similar to the insulators used in the development of the motion-based time-estimation method. In particular, they become very good case insulators for testing the accuracy of the motion-based time estimation because a large time difference occurs in the case of small insulators and the number of their shape features.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper has presented a motion-based time-estimation scheme for the attachment of insulators. To this end, we analyzed the motions involved in attaching 350 insulators using MODAPTS and then designated the representative motions and their time values. We modeled the time relationships of motions and the shape and size features of insulators to attain a more accurate time estimate.

During the design phase, design engineers establish the attaching motions based on the shape features of the insulators. They then choose the representative motions. The number of MODS associated with the representative motions is calculated from the MOD equation. The resultant MODS are translated into a time estimate. Because the estimate is based on the actual body motions required to attach insulators in the production process, it is accurate enough to estimate a fair value for vendor quotations.

One benefit of the proposed model is that the amount of estimation effort and time can be reduced. As listed in Table 27
                     , the motion-based time-estimation method requires different resources relative to MODAPTS. MODAPTS requires site visits, the capture of video, and an in-depth knowledge of MODAPTS. However, the proposed method requires only drawings and a basic knowledge of MODAPTS.

The actions were video-recorded and the time taken was measured for five participants, by implementing both the motion-based time-estimation method and generic MODAPTS for industrial case 1–5. The participants were well trained in the analysis of MODAPTS. They first applied MODAPTS and then the motion-based time-estimation method. The time differences are compared in Table 28
                     . The average reduction attained by implementing the motion-based time-estimation method was found to be 68.4% with a 0.005 standard deviation.

Another benefit is that the representative motions can be used as a target time at the design stage. The representative motions presented in the method can be considered as being baseline motions so that the time estimated by the motion-based time-estimation method can be a target time in the production stage. However, the proposed method may not be sufficiently accurate in the event of new shape features being applied or operatives not being sufficiently well trained to implement the representative motions. The first case can be handled by adding new motions caused by new features according to the proposed method. In the second case, the local manufacturing companies should understand the representative motions before actually bidding. Their operatives should be trained in the representative motions so as to be able to perform the tasks in the estimated time after winning a bid.

In the future, we will expand our current research by adding more insulators and developing a computer program that allows the easy use of a motion-based time-estimation method. We hope to be able to assist design engineers who are looking for a simple way to estimate assembly times.
