The surface is constructed through a repeated elimination of Delaunay tetrahedra subjected to circumcenter and topological constraints. Theoretically, we justify our algorithm by establishing a topological guarantee on the 3D shape-hull with the help of topological rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on models with sharp features and sparsely distributed point clouds. Compared to existing sculpting approaches for surface reconstruction that require either a parameter tuning or several stages, our approach is simple, non-parametric, single stage and reconstructs topologically correct piece-wise linear approximation for divergent concave surfaces.

Given a finite set of points 
                        S
                        ⊂

                     , sampled from the surface 
                        P
                      of a real world object, the task of reconstructing a model of 
                        P
                      from 
                        S
                      is referred to as surface reconstruction problem. Recently, the problem has gained a lot of attention both in computer graphics and computational geometry, especially due to the proliferation of laser scanners and their wide applications in areas such as reverse engineering, product design  [1], cultural heritage  [2], and cartography  [3], among others. Apart from laser scanners, input point samples are also obtained from photogrammetry technique or mathematical functions. Different approaches have been taken to solve the problem depending upon the input data type or output reconstructed surface  [4]. Input data may be a registered point cloud equipped with or without normals and the reconstructed model may be a parametric or implicit surface or a triangulated surface mesh.

Surface reconstruction is an ill-defined problem  [5] as there are several surfaces that might fulfill the topological and geometric properties of the original surface. Therefore, the main challenge for any surface reconstruction approach lies in mathematically defining a surface that best captures the geometric and topological properties of the original surface. It is well established that proximity information and neighborhood relationships of surface samples has a major role in defining the geometric shape of any surface. Aimed at an approach that exploits these two factors, we define a proximity graph called as shape-hull graph (
                        
                           SHG
                        
                     ) which is essentially a restricted Delaunay graph that consists of Gabriel edges  [6] and a few non-Gabriel edges. The boundary of 
                        
                           SHG
                        
                     , referred to as shape-hull (
                        
                           SH
                        
                     ), represents the polygonal reconstruction of a surface from its sample.

In computational geometry, sculpting refers to the process of creating shapes or surfaces through a repeated elimination of tetrahedra from an initial tetrahedral mesh. We propose a sculpting algorithm for closed surface reconstruction based on three dimensional shape-hull graph, taking a registered point cloud without normals (this is referred to as raw point cloud data) as input and producing a triangulated surface mesh as output. The approach combines a local measure (circumradius) and a global information (largest circumradius). As a consequence, no user driven parameter tuning is required for the whole reconstruction process. We observe that non-parametric approach is a reasonable trade-off in many situations especially when considering that the parameter is critical to the output of many established algorithms and these algorithms provide only a limited guidance on selecting the optimal parameter. Moreover, we also provide a guarantee on the topologically correct reconstruction under the theoretical framework based on divergent concave curves, 
                        ϵ
                     -sampling  [7] and topological rules.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

Most of the current surface reconstruction methods fall into two major categories: one class of surface reconstruction techniques use implicit functions to represent surfaces and the other methods use Delaunay/Voronoi based triangulated mesh to represent the surface. One of the early work in implicit surface reconstruction is the tangent plane estimation method by Hoppe et al.  [8]. The method uses principal component analysis to estimate the normals and then employ neighborhood graph search to unify the inside/outside directions followed by reconstruction of surface as the zero-level set of an implicit signed distance function with the help of marching cube method. Ohtake et al.  [9] present a multilevel partition of unity (MPU) approach to reconstruction which basically tries to locally fit the surface via quadratic functions blended by weighting function (partition of unity). In  [10], Kazhdan describes a reconstruction algorithm which uses Stokes theorem to compute an indicator function of the surface. Other related approaches compute indicator function of the underlying shape by solving Poisson equations  [11], wavelets  [12] or generalized eigenvalue problem  [13]. Approaches like moving least square methods generally define the surface as an invariant set of projection operator which in turn is computed by numerical optimization on a locally constructed implicit function  [14,15]. Another method to implicit surface reconstruction is the computation of radial basis functions (RBF)  [16] or anisotropic basis functions to represent the surface  [17]. It is to be noted that most of these techniques use acquired or estimated point normals to facilitate the reconstruction process.

In computational geometry, several Delaunay/Voronoi based surface reconstruction algorithms have been proposed  [5,18], most of which provide provable theoretical guarantees on the quality of reconstructed output under specific sampling model. Underlying intuition is that, when the point sampling is dense enough and free of noises and outliers, the neighboring points on the surface will also be neighbors in the space and hence can be captured with the help of Delaunay triangulations or Voronoi diagrams. Early work in this direction include sculpture algorithm by Boissonnat  [19] and three dimensional 
                        α
                     -shapes by Edelsbrunner et al.  [20]. Thereafter, many researchers approached reconstruction problem from a geometric point of view, focusing on topology reconstruction and providing guarantees on the quality of output under dense sampling model such as 
                        ϵ
                     -samples  [7]. The model of Delaunay/Voronoi together with 
                        ϵ
                     -sampling (or a related sampling model) has been extensively studied and many notable work have been proposed that include crust  [7], powercrust  [1], r-regular shape reconstruction  [21] and cocone family of algorithms  [22–25].

Few other Delaunay based approaches assure a topological equivalence between the reconstructed surface and the original surface 
                        S
                     . Gopi et al.  [26] describe a tangent plane based method that is guaranteed to construct a model homeomorphic to the original surface when a locally uniform sampling condition holds. Edelsbrunner’s WRAP  [27] algorithm relies on the concepts of flow and stable manifolds where the flow relation has been formulated on the set of Delaunay simplices. An extension of WRAP by Ramos et al.  [28] uses 
                        ϵ
                     -sampling model to provide guarantees such as tubular neighborhood and homotopy equivalences. Gezahegne  [29] develop a hybrid approach to surface reconstruction based on sculpture and cocone algorithms and establish a topological guarantee for reconstruction of a piece-wise linear water-tight approximation. Approaches such as constriction  [30], greedy algorithm  [31], ball pivoting  [32], regular interpolant method  [33], geometric convection  [34], hybrid sculpting  [35], Delaunay based region growing  [36] do not provide theoretical guarantees but found to perform reasonably well for a range of point sets. Moreover, some of them are rather simplistic in nature and stand out in terms of their efficiency. In general, Delaunay/Voronoi based approaches are found to produce good approximations for dense uniformly sampled point cloud, work on input scans without point normals and often compute output meshes with a complexity in the order of input point set size.

                        -sampling, curve portion which encapsulates more details are sampled densely. Hence the concave portions of

                        . Consequently, circumcircles of these triangles approximate the medial balls. Under such a dense sampling assumption, we prove Lemma 3.1.

                        We need to show two points. Each pair of points in

                            is connected by a path and 
                              
                                 SHG

                                 )
                              
                            is free of junction points, dangling edges and bridges. To prove these points, we make use of a case (
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                           ) shown in Fig. 7
                            where two groups of points, denoted by 
                              A
                            and 
                              B
                            are connected by two adjacent triangles shown in green box. For the sake of argument, we assume that the triangles in the green box are obtuse. In such a case, despite the two triangles in the green box contains non-Gabriel edges, the condition 2(a) of Definition 13 (all the three vertices of both triangles are boundary vertices) makes sure that these triangles are never deleted from 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                           . So from an extreme case like this, we can see that any pair of points are connected by a path in 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                           . A similar argument and case hold good for the absence of bridges in 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                           . Dangling edges are possible if two thin boundary triangles (whose circumcenter lie outside 
                              ∂
                              S
                              H
                              G
                           ) share a common edge (Fig. 8
                           (d)). However, in this case, if one triangle gets removed, then all the three vertices of the other triangle becomes boundary vertices and hence will be retained in 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                            (again due to condition 2(a) of Definition 13). Similarly, due to the same condition of 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                            definition, junction points(Fig. 8 (a)) are also not possible in 
                              
                                 SHG
                              
                           . Hence the lemma.

A point set can have different shape-hull graphs as illustrated in Fig. 8. This arises when two thin boundary triangles with circumcenter lying exterior to

                      consists of Gabriel tetrahedra and few non-Gabriel tetrahedra whose circumcenter (CC) lies inside 
                        ∂
                        S
                        H

                      or whose deletion violates the topological regularity. The proposed algorithm is inspired from Boissonnat’s sculpture  [19] method but adopts a different sculpting strategy. We use the combination of circumcenter and circumradius of Delaunay tetrahedron to capture the structure of Delaunay tetrahedra and consequently the geometric proximity of surface samples.

Intuitively, a tetrahedron with one boundary face and its circumcenter lying exterior to the boundary of the tetrahedral mesh tends to have a wider solid angle at the vertex opposite to the boundary face as illustrated in Fig. 9
                     . A wider solid angle at the opposite vertex D pushes the boundary vertices further away from each other by making them likely non-neighbors on the surface to be reconstructed. In Fig. 9(a), boundary face 
                        △
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      has longer edges compared to the interior edges of the tetrahedron. On the contrary, 
                        △
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      has shorter edges compared to the interior edges in Fig. 9(b). Intuitively, the face 
                        △
                        A
                        B
                        C
                      in Fig. 9(a) and eventually the tetrahedron itself does not play a role in defining the surface and may be deleted.

Similarly, a tetrahedron having two boundary faces with its circumcenter lying exterior to the boundary of the tetrahedral mesh is found to have a wider planar angle between its interior faces as shown in Fig. 10
                     (a). A wider planar angle pushes the vertices opposite to the interior edge to lie at a relatively larger distance and makes them non-neighbors on the surface. So the tetrahedron (in effect two boundary face and the edge shared by them) may be deleted. In our approach, we remove all boundary tetrahedra of the type shown in Figs. 9(a) & (b) without relaxing the topological regularity to reconstruct the required surface.

Basically these rules are designed to ensure the topological equivalence of the reconstructed surface to a sphere. Corollary 5.1 establishes this claim. Deleting a tetrahedron with three boundary faces will disconnect a point from

                         and hence we restrict the removal process only to tetrahedra with one or two boundary faces. The algorithm terminates when no more tetrahedra can be removed from

                         and the boundary of non-eliminated tetrahedra constitutes the surface approximation of 
                           S
                        . Algorithm 1 presents the pseudo code of the surface reconstruction.

In sculpting algorithms, selection criteria, i.e. selection of tetrahedra for removal plays a crucial role in defining the geometrical correctness of the reconstructed surface. It is unknown what criterion will work well for a wide range of point set and difficult to find one as the requirement may vary depending on the algorithms. Different selection criteria have been employed in various sculpting algorithms. Sculpture  [19] algorithm uses a value, 
                           V
                           
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    T
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                         defined by the maximum distance between the faces of a boundary tetrahedron, 
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         and the associated parts of the circumsphere of 
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         as the selection criterion. This removal order may produce deadlock tetrahedra on the reconstructed surface. Deadlock tetrahedra are non-removable tetrahedra (due to tetrahedra removal rules) which are clearly external to the polyhedral representation of the point set. Veltkamp  [30] employs 
                           γ
                         
                        —indicator (ratio between the radius of the circumsphere of Delaunay tetrahedron and the radius of the circumcircle of the boundary face) which may generate long and skinny triangles on the surface. Hybrid sculpting  [35] selects the tetrahedra based on the magnitude of the longest edge of boundary tetrahedron. However, longest edge does not capture the geometric property of a tetrahedron in its entirety.

We use circumradius of a tetrahedron as the selection criterion. Tetrahedron with largest circumradius gets removed first. The reason for choosing circumradius as criterion is that when combined with the location of circumcenter, circumradius serve as an effective tool in capturing the geometric proximity of surface samples as already described and illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. Moreover, we experimented with few selection criteria such as volume, ratio of circumradius to the shortest edge, side length and circumradius of tetrahedra. Tetrahedra with the largest quantity was deleted first. From the experiment, selection criterion that found to perform well for different data sets is circumradius (Refer Fig. 11
                         for the results of pig point cloud using different selection criteria). For ordering the boundary tetrahedra according to their circumradius, we employ a priority queue using heap.

                        -indicators of each one is considered. The boundary tetrahedron with the smallest sum of 
                           γ
                        -indicators is removed in each iteration.

Both, the constriction and shape-hull algorithms depends on a closely related but different selection criterion which uses circumcenter and circumradius. So it is worthwhile and necessary to analyze and study the relationship between both the methods and the corresponding selection criteria. Essentially, both the selection criteria capture the angle at the vertex opposite to the boundary face of a tetrahedron. In addition to the angle, our selection criteria quantifies the size of the tetrahedron, which cannot be achieved through 
                           γ
                        -indicator. In certain instances, the boundary triangle with the smallest 
                           γ
                        -indicator may not be a good choice as illustrated in Fig. 13
                        (c) & (d). We observe that wider solid angle at interior vertex together with tetrahedron constitutes a better local measure to facilitate the reconstruction. Moreover, 
                           γ
                        -indicator incurs an additional computational overhead of division (
                           
                              
                                 r
                              
                              
                                 R
                              
                           
                        ) which definitely makes an impact on the running time.

In constriction, boundary tetrahedron with an interior circumcenter may be removed if it respects the tetrahedra removal rules. As opposed to this, no tetrahedra with circumcenter lying interior to the boundary are removed in shape-hull. If the constriction process get stuck with deadlocked tetrahedra then more overlapping 3-simplices are created by fine tuning the value of parameter

                                 1

                         in the interval 
                           
                              [
                              −
                              1
                              ,
                              0
                              )
                           
                        . However, for a particular input sample, it is impossible to tell in advance which value of

                         will guarantee a hamiltonian polyhedron and hence completely relies on trial and error method. On the contrary, shape-hull does not rely on any external parameter and for a densely sampled divergent concave surfaces, it guarantees to interpolate the points.

Though, constrained sculpting  [29] employs circumradius as the selection criterion, it uses a different removal strategy which depends on the goodness measure of boundary faces inferred through cocone  [22] test. One advantage of hybrid and constraint sculpting algorithms is that compared to the other three, it can construct surfaces with genera. Both the algorithms use the concept of pseudo-prism to construct the genus boundary. However, these algorithms alternates between three stages until the termination criteria is met and hence may take longer computational time. To the best of our knowledge, apart from topological guarantees based on the tetrahedra removal rules, the previous sculpting algorithm gives no bound on the specific sampling distance for which an exact reconstruction is guaranteed. As opposed to this, 3D shape-hull algorithms relies on the theoretical framework designed for 2D shape-hull (Section  4).

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

Our algorithm was implemented in C++ using Delaunay triangulation and geometric predicates available in Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL). The algorithm demands fast construction of Delaunay triangulation in order to efficiently scale for large models and exact computations of circumcenters and circumradii of Delaunay tetrahedra for ordering and eliminating tetrahedra from the intermediate boundary. Fortunately, CGAL offers a kernel for exact predicates that computes geometric predicates such as circumcenter and circumradii with numerical certainty and allows fast point location queries to construct optimal Delaunay triangulation. Having compared with the sculpting algorithms in Section  5.4, we now analyze various properties of the reconstructed models and qualitatively compare our results with the results generated by various state of the art algorithms such as powercrust  [1], robustcocone  [23] and screened Poisson  [11]. It is to be noted that all the three algorithms (powercrust, robustcocone and Poisson) depend on multiple external parameters and hence we had to try out several parameters (in fact, different combinations of parameters where each parameter was picked from the range of values provided along with the algorithm) to obtain the best possible results in our experiment.


                     Feature preserving reconstruction: We tested our method on several publicly available data sets from either Stanford 3D scanning repository (bunny) or Aim@shape repository (bimba, sheep, fandisk, foot etc.). Fig. 14
                      shows the models reconstructed by the proposed algorithm for various point clouds of different sizes. The algorithm is able to reconstruct very fine features of several models such as intertwined hair of bimba (Fig. 14(a) & (b)), imprints on the base of budha model (Fig. 14(e) & (f)), wrinkles on the forehead of Caesar (Fig. 14(d)), protuberances on the bumpy sphere (Fig. 14(g)) and furs of sheep (Fig. 14(h)).


                     Robustness to non-uniform sampling: In surface reconstruction, the reconstructed model is expected to match the original surface in terms of topological and geometric properties  [5]. The major challenge of the problem lies in the reconstruction of a model from a sparse, non-uniform and raw point samples, that approximates the original surface 
                        S
                      with reasonable accuracy. Fig. 15
                      illustrates the adaptivity of our algorithm to the successive down sampling of raw point cloud. For down-sampling bunny point cloud, we used Poisson disk sampling that refines the existing samples and generates a non-uniform (specifically semi-random) point cloud. In Fig. 15, one can observe that screened Poisson progressively shrinks, left ear of the bunny distorts in the second stage and subsequently merges with the right ear in the third stage of under-sampling. Similarly, robust cocone starts degrading from the second stage, important features fades away in the last stage, especially the left ear gets disconnected into pieces. In contrast, powercrust is found to be more resilient to down-sampling. In the third stage, one can observe few deadlocked tetrahedra in shape-hull. One obvious reason for the presence of such undesirable tetrahedra is the violation of divergent concavity between the left ear and the body of bunny due to heavy under-sampling.


                     Fig. 16
                      shows the evaluation of the under-sampling results performed using root mean square (RMS) of Hausdorff distances computed with METRO  [40]. The results indicate that, our method performs well in all the three stages of the sampling, especially for lower samples (722 points) where our method, despite having few unwanted tetrahedra on the reconstructed model, outperforms the other three algorithms. In addition to this, our approach is also capable of reconstructing models from very sparse, non-uniform point clouds as shown in Fig. 17
                     .


                     Sharp edges and corners: In most of the reconstructed meshes, the normals at the faces around the vertices next to the sharp features have been twisted i.e., the faces actually becomes chamfers of sharp edges or corners  [41]. Generally, an edge (a curve of non-smooth points on the surface) is considered to be sharp, if the dihedral angle around the edge is bounded away from 
                        π
                      degrees. Correspondingly, a sharp corner is a non-smooth point on the surface whose exterior solid angle is bounded away from 
                        2
                        π
                      degrees.


                     Fig. 18
                      shows how various algorithms reconstruct models with sharp edges and corners. We consider raw point clouds of three models for the experiment: screw driver containing 27152 points, fandisc containing 11984 points and shark containing 10054 points, all of which possess several sharp features. Fig. 18 broadly indicates that the Delaunay based methods capture the sharp features better than the Screened Poisson method. This is evident from the close-ups of screened Poisson models in Fig. 18 (c), where the edges leading from the fandisc corner are round and hence does not capture the sharpness property. Further, dorsal and pelvic fins of the screened Poisson shark model are distorted and its tail is round and bulgy. Among the Delaunay based algorithms, our method seems to have achieved a better reconstruction, especially when comparing the way the three edges meet at the corner of fandisc in the close-ups of the second row in Fig. 18. Similarly, for shark model which has sharp fins and tail, our method generates a better result as compared to the other three. This is more evident from Fig. 19
                      that depicts the Gaussian curvature maps of the shark tails generated by different methods (except robust cocone which is a non-manifold and hence the Gaussian filter was not applicable). All tetrahedra having either sharp edges or sharp corners are found to have their circumcenter inside the final reconstructed surface due to the dihedral and solid angle constraints and hence our algorithm clearly has a superiority in dealing with such models.

In this paper, the concept of divergent concavity for simple and closed planar curves has been introduced. A new proximity graph called as shape-hull graph has been defined and its properties have been studied. It has been shown that under 
                        ϵ
                     -sampling model, the boundary of shape-hull graph represents the polygonal reconstruction of a divergent concave curve. Extending these ideas to three dimensions, we have presented a simple and non-parametric sculpting algorithm for closed surface reconstruction from raw point clouds. We have done some experiments on under-sampled data and models with sharp features. Results show that our approach is capable of capturing very fine details of the surfaces and reconstructs the models from under-sampled and sparse data. Compared to other prominent surface reconstruction algorithms, our approach found to perform well in the case of reconstruction of models with sharp features. There are some avenues for future work, especially the reconstruction of surfaces having genus and extending the proposed algorithm for addressing non-divergent concave surfaces.
