                  Background
                  The best indicator for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia derived from anthropometric measures of body shape remains a matter of debate. The objectives are to determine the strongest predictor of hypertriglyceridemia from anthropometric measures and to investigate whether a combination of measures can improve the prediction accuracy compared with individual measures.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A total of 5517 subjects aged 20–90 years participated in this study. The numbers of normal and hypertriglyceridemia subjects were 3022 and 653 females, respectively, and 1306 and 536 males, respectively. We evaluated 33 anthropometric measures for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia using statistical analysis and data mining.
               
               
                  Results
                  In the 20–90-year-old groups, age in women was the variable that exhibited the highest predictive power; however, this was not the case in men in all age groups. Of the anthropometric measures, the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia in women. In men, the rib-to-forehead circumference ratio (RFcR) was the strongest indicator. The use of a combination of measures provides better predictive power compared with individual measures in both women and men. However, in the subgroups of ages 20–50 and 51–90 years, the strongest indicators for hypertriglyceridemia were rib circumference in the 20–50-year-old group and WHtR in the 51–90-year-old group in women and RFcR in the 20–50-year-old group and BMI in the 51–90-year-old group in men.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our results demonstrated that the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia may differ according to gender and age.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In both Western and Eastern populations, hypertriglyceridemia is becoming more common [1–5]. Hypertriglyceridemia, or high triglycerides (TGs), which indicates an abnormal concentration of TGs in the blood [6], is a primary predictor of type IIb dyslipidemia [7], and it is one of several independent lipid factors used to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [7–9]. Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and coronary artery disease have higher levels of plasma TGs, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [10,11]. Overweight and, more specifically, abdominal obesity have been associated with hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, systemic hypertension, stroke, CHD, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, osteoarthritis, liver disease, and several types of cancer [12–16]. Additionally, obesity and body shape are associated with high levels of plasma TGs and low levels of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [17–21].

Anthropometric measures of body shape detailed by Cornier et al. [14] are reasonable alternatives used to identify fat distribution (regional obesity) and obesity-related diseases [22,23]. Although radiological imaging techniques, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bioimpedance, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry are useful and accurate methods to determine abdominal fat levels and body composition [24], they are expensive, not easily accessible, and potentially dangerous to some patients, such as pregnant women or individuals with pacemakers. Therefore, these techniques are not suitable for epidemiological and clinical purposes [10,22].

For decades, numerous studies have investigated the association of anthropometric measures with hypertriglyceridemia, and the findings have directed the diagnosis and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, CVD, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome [25–28]. However, the best predictor or indicator for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia among the anthropometric measures of body shape remains a matter of debate [25–27,29–41]. For example, waist circumference (WC) was the best single predictor of hypertriglyceridemia in Korean adults [25,29], Taiwanese men and women [30], and Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents [31]. However, in Swiss men and women [26], Hong Kong Chinese women [32], Iranian men and women [33], and Thai women [34], the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was the strongest indicator of hypertriglyceridemia. The waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) exhibited superiority over other measures in Taiwanese [35] and German [36] men and women and in a meta-analysis [37]. In another study, body mass index (BMI) had a substantially stronger predictive power compared with other measures in Thai men [34], whereas in European women, the waist-to-thigh circumference ratio was the strongest indicator of hypertriglyceridemia [27].

Several studies identified a combination of two factors for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia. WHR and WHtR were better predictors compared with other measures in Hong Kong Chinese men [32], and WHR and WC were good indicators in Indian men [38] and Japanese subjects [39]. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that widely used anthropometric measures exhibited similar or identical predictive powers for hypertriglyceridemia. The predictive capabilities of BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia were similar or identical in Iranian [40] and Asian/non-Asian [41] men and women.

It has been demonstrated that the use of a combination of anthropometric measures to predict hypertriglyceridemia is important to improve the prediction accuracy. While some studies have indicated that the combination of two or more measures did not improve the predictive power for the identification of high TG status or dyslipidemia compared with the use of a single measure [31,37,41], combinations of several measures have been simultaneously used to successfully predict hypertriglyceridemia in other studies [30,42,43].

The purpose of this study was to identify the best indicator of hypertriglyceridemia in Korean individuals using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques and to investigate whether a combination of anthropometric measures acquired from specific sites of the human body improves the prediction accuracy. For these purposes, we obtained data for 33 anthropometric measures from study participants and performed statistical analyses and prediction experiments. To our knowledge, no study has reported the outcome of hypertriglyceridemia prediction using a combination of anthropometric measures based on machine learning in Korean individuals. The results of the present study may help improve preliminary health-screening tools for hypertriglyceridemia and accelerate the integration of telemedicine or remote healthcare with existing medical systems.

A total of 5517 subjects (3675 women and 1842 men) aged 20–90 years old participated in this retrospective cross-sectional study between November 2006 and August 2012. The data were collected from the Korean Health and Genome Epidemiology study database (KHGES). The Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all subjects provided written informed consent.

We used more detailed and varied anthropometric measures in the present study compared with previous studies. The specific sites measured in the body are important for the prediction of obesity-related diseases because small differences in the measured sites affect the ability to predict health risks [27,44]. For example, a study by Seidell et al. [27] regarding the association of cardiovascular risk factors with anthropometric measures proposed that the best site to measure WC in the body is midway between the superior anterior iliac crest and the lower rib margin in European women. All measurements were performed by a well-trained observer according to standard protocols. Height and weight were routinely measured in lightweight clothing without shoes to the nearest 0.1cm and 0.1kg, respectively (GL-150; G Tech International Co., Ltd Uijeongbu, Republic of Korea). The circumferences of 8 specific sites were measured using a non-elastic flexible tape while the subject was standing [45]. The BMI was computed as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Detailed descriptions of the specific positions measured in the body are described in Jang et al. [45]. In previous studies [45,46], the forehead circumference (FC) was measured at the levels of the glabella and occiput in the head. The neck circumference (NC) was measured at the levels of the thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage, the axillary circumference (AC) was measured at the levels of the left and right axillae, the chest circumference (CC) was measured at the levels of the left and right nipples, the rib circumference (RC) was measured at the levels of the left and right 7th and 8th prominences of the costochondral junction, the WC was measured at the level of the umbilicus, the pelvic circumference (PC) was measured at the levels of the left and right anterior superior iliac spines, and the hip circumference (HC) was measured at the level of the upper edge of the pubis. The circumference ratios between 2 positions and all baseline data used in the present study are described in 
                        Table 1. The data used in this study were divided into male and female groups because the change in body shape with aging may differ according to sex.

For the measurement of TG values, all participants were required to fast for at least 8h; blood samples were subsequently drawn (ADVIA 1800, Siemens, USA). Hypertriglyceridemia was defined as a fasting TG level of >2.26mmol/l (>200mg/dl) according to the recommendation of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and previous studies [7,47–55]. Therefore, we followed the definition of a fasting TG level>200mg/dl and/or physician-diagnosed hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, if subjects who were diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia completely recovered, they were considered normal subjects.

All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 19 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using binary logistic regression and the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis data mining tool (WEKA) [56]. Concretely, a statistical evaluation of the significant differences between the normal subjects and subjects with hypertriglyceridemia was conducted using binary logistic regression. To identify the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia among the various measures, we used two machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and the Naïve Bayes algorithm. Both Naïve Bayes and logistic regression are widely used to solve classification problems; however, their methods to estimate the classifier are different. For a brief explanation [57,58], let

                           i
                        . In Naïve Bayes, a classifier estimates

                                 ,
                                 y

                         from training data, and the weights for each feature are fitted independently, which is the so-called ‘generative model’. In contrast, logistic regression directly estimates 
                           p
                           (
                           y
                           |
                           X
                           )
                         by minimizing error functions, taking into account the whole covariance among input features, which is the so-called ‘discriminative model’ [57,58].

Furthermore, to identify the optimal combination of measures and to reduce model complexity, we used two variable-selection techniques: the filter approach, which used correlation-based feature subset selection (CFS) [59,60], and the wrapper approach [61,62]. In general, filter approaches select subsets of measures during a preprocessing step independent of prediction algorithms, and wrapper approaches employ a classifier to evaluate subsets of measures according to their prediction performance [62]. CFS was designed on the basis of the hypothesis that nice variable subsets consist of variables that are strongly correlated with the response variable (class) and are not correlated among independent variables (features) [59,60]. The CFS kernel was presented by the following equation, obtained from a previous study [59], which induces a ranking on variable subsets in the search space.

                         is the mean inter-correlation between independent and dependent variables. Therefore, variables with a high correlation with the response variable and a low correlation with other independent variables are ranked as important variables. We can obtain the merit score of the best variable subsets during the search and identify the final variable subsets. In the wrapper approach [61,62], the variable subset selection is conducted using the induction algorithm (referred to as the black box) and performs a search using the induction algorithm itself as an evaluation function for the superior variable subset. A search in the wrapper approach consists of a search engine, such as a greedy search or a best-first search, a state space, a termination condition, and an initial state, such as the empty set of variables or full variable set. Each state in the search space organization indicates a variable subset. If there are n variables, there are n bits in each state. Each bit indicates that the variable is present or absent, and operators play the role of adding or eliminating a single variable from a state. Termination conditions may differ according to induction algorithms. We can determine the state with the highest accuracy using a heuristic function through the search process.

In the statistical analysis step, the data were standardized with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one; in the prediction experiments, we applied the supervised discretization technique proposed by Fayyad and Irani [63]. In the filter approach, after performing variable selection using CFS, prediction experiments were performed using logistic regression and the Naïve Bayes algorithm. In the wrapper approach, after performing variable selections using Naïve Bayes and logistic regression with a greedy step-wise (backward) search method, prediction experiments were performed using two machine learning algorithms. A schematic diagram on the workflow of this study is shown in 
                        Fig. 1.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC or AROC) is a major criterion for comparison of the predictive powers of individual measures. The AUCs were derived from models that combined many measures to evaluate whether a clinically meaningful improvement in the discrimination of hypertriglyceridemia could be achieved by combining anthropometric measures. For a detailed analysis of the predictive power, we also included the additional criteria of sensitivity, 1-specificity, precision, and the F-measure in our analysis. The F-measure is defined as a harmonic mean between precision and recall, and it used important criterion for prediction or classification results; the maximization of both recall and precision values should be considered for a good prediction model and as a major issue of prediction algorithms [64]. A formal definition of the F-measure is provided as follows [64]:

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this study, the numbers of normal and hypertriglyceridemia subjects were 3022 and 653 in females, respectively, and 1306 and 536 in males, respectively. In anthropometric measures, 33 variables were used to predict hypertriglyceridemia, and many variables were significantly different between men and women and between normal TGs and hypertriglyceridemia in both men and women (p=<0.0001).

Many anthropometric measures used in this study were correlated with each other. 
                        Fig. 2 shows the correlations among anthropometric measures in both men and women aged 20–90 years using a heat map. For example, the NC, AC, CC, RC, WC, PC, and HC measures exhibited highly positive correlations with weight and BMI in both men and women. The HWcR and WHtR exhibited highly negative correlations with NC, AC, CC, RC, and WC in women.

In women, age was the variable that exhibited the highest AUC among all measures, which is most likely because of the effects of aging on body shape in women. Among only anthropometric measures with the exception of the age variable, the WHtR was the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia in females (OR=2.16, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.725). Additionally, the RC (OR=2.07, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.72) and rib-to-forehead circumference ratio (RFcR) (OR=2.06, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.72) exhibited strong predictive powers for hypertriglyceridemia in women. In men, the RFcR was the best indicator of hypertriglyceridemia (OR=2.22, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.702). The predictive power of age in men was lower compared with women. In a comparison of all measures across the male and female groups, the predictive powers of most measures in women were slightly higher than in men, with the exception of NC, NFcR, HNcR, RCcR, and WCcR. The detailed analysis of the results regarding the predictive power of individual measures is shown in 
                        Table 2 for women and 
                        Table 3 for men.

In the experiments that used a combination of measures selected by variable-selection techniques, the AUC values ranged from 0.77 to 0.79 in women and 0.73 to 0.74 in men. Compared with the best individual predictor, the AUCs of the models that used a combination of measures exhibited slight improvements of 0.065 in women and 0.038 in men. The results of the 4 methods for combining measures are depicted in 
                        Fig. 3. For example, the Naïve Bayes wrapper method (Naïve Bayes with wrapper-based variable selection) in women included age, height, PC, HACR, RCCR, HCCR, WRCR, and WHtR. Additionally, the AUC of the model was 0.79 and demonstrated that the sensitivities for normal and hypertriglyceridemia were 0.84 and 0.54, respectively.

In a comparison of the two machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and Naïve Bayes were somewhat different regarding the detailed performance of sensitivity and 1-specificity. The logistic regression models tended to be somewhat biased towards relatively large sample sizes (e.g., the normal class) compared with relatively small sample sizes (e.g., the hypertriglyceridemia class) in both the male and female groups because of the very low prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the subjects. For example, the sensitivity values of the logistic regression model with the wrapper in women were 0.96 in normal and 0.16 in hypertriglyceridemia patients, whereas the 1-specificity values were 0.84 in normal and 0.05 in hypertriglyceridemia patients. This finding resulted from the fact that many machine-learning algorithms are normally formulated on the premise that the numbers of case and control samples are equal [65]; therefore, the algorithms find it difficult to solve a problem with an unbalanced sample size [64]. In these experiments, the Naïve Bayes models tended to be less biased than the logistic regression models. The detailed results of the performance of the two machine learning algorithms using CFS and the wrapper are described in 
                        Table 4.

From the perspective of a reasonable balance between sensitivity and 1-specificity, our results suggest that prediction models that use Naïve Bayes with variable subset selection techniques are better than logistic regression models in both women and men. In women, Naïve Bayes with the wrapper are superior to other prediction methods; in men, Naïve Bayes models with CFS and the wrapper are superior to other methods, which exhibit similar AUCs but different sensitivities and 1-specificities.

The numbers of measures selected by the CFS approach in the female and male groups were similar; however, in the wrapper approach, only a few measures were selected in the female group compared with many measures selected for males. This phenomenon is because of the exertion for maximization of the diagnosis accuracy (AUC) in the process of selection and in the adoption of measures by the machine learning algorithm and search method (deemed the black box). In 
                        Table 5, some variables were commonly selected in all variable selection methods. In women, the best predictor (WHtR) of hypertriglyceridemia among the anthropometric measures and the best predictor (age) among all variables were commonly identified in 3 variable selection methods. Additionally, RCCR and HCCR were commonly identified in 3 variable selection methods. In men, the BMI, RC, RACR, RCCR, and HRCR were commonly identified in 3 variable methods. The best indicator (RFCR) of hypertriglyceridemia was commonly identified in CFS and logistic regression with wrapper methods. Only RCCR was commonly identified in all variable selection methods in both men and women. However, a prediction using selected variables from variable section methods is not optimal because we did not consider the best predictor regardless of gender, and experiments that use all combinations of all variables were not performed because they are not realistic because of the large number of combinations. Detailed descriptions of the measures selected by the various selection techniques are described in Table 5.


                        
                        Table 6 lists the comparisons of the predictive powers according to the subgroups of 20–50 years old and 51–90 years old. In men, the predictors with the highest AUC value for hypertriglyceridemia were RFcR (AUC=0.753) in the 20–50-year-old group and BMI (AUC=0.618) in the 51–90-year-old group. The indicators with the highest AUC value in women were RC (0.746) in the 20–50-year-old group and WHtR (AUC=0.598) in the 51–90-year-old group. However, several measures had a similar predictive power compared with the indicator with the highest AUC value in each group. For example, RC (0.747) and RFcR (0.753) in the 20–50-year-old men and BMI (0.618) and WHtR (0.617) in the 51–90-year-old men exhibited very little difference in predictive power. Additionally, many anthropometric measures tended to have a higher predictive power in the 20–50-year-old group compared with the 51–90-year-old group.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the present study, we demonstrated that among anthropometric measures, with the exception of age, the variable that is the best anthropometric indicator of hypertriglyceridemia is WHtR in Korean women and RFcR in men; furthermore, age is the highest risk factor in women but not in men. Diagnostic models that use a combination of several measures have a better predictive power compared with individual measures in both women and men. Additionally, the best indicator of hypertriglyceridemia may differ according to age groups.

High TGs have been directly associated with age, sex (especially in post-menopausal women), diet, lifestyle, and body shape [7,9,23,66] and have a clear relationship with the incidence of CHD [9,66]. In women, age was the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia. These results are similar to previous studies. A study by Wells et al. [42] suggested that aging changed body shape, and a study by Mukuddem-Petersen et al. [23] demonstrated that aging is related to an increase in abdominal fat distribution, a decrease in height, and a decrease in muscle mass. Additionally, increases in WHR, WC, and BMI in both genders tended to increase the levels of TGs and total cholesterol and decreased the level of HDL cholesterol [28,67]. In a meta-analysis of 7–10 studies [37], women with predictions of dyslipidemia were more likely to have higher AUCs than men, and this result is consistent with the results of the present study. In our results, age had the strongest predictive power in women but not in men in all age groups. Our data support previous reports that age is an important risk factor for hypertriglyceridemia in women.

To date, numerous studies regarding the identification of the best predictor or a good indicator of hypertriglyceridemia have been conducted in various countries and ethnic groups. Worachartcheewan et al. [68] reported the optimal cutoff values for WC and BMI for the prediction of metabolic syndrome in the Thai population. 
                        Table 7 lists the previous studies regarding the association of hypertriglyceridemia with anthropometric measures according to country and ethnic group. For example, in Switzerland [26], in a comparison of the predictive powers of WHR, BMI, sum of four skinfolds, percent body fat, alcohol consumption, and other variables, WHR was the single best predictor of TG level in both genders. In Iranian men and women, hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder [69]; however, the predictive powers of BMI, WC, WHR, and WHtR for the prediction of dyslipidemia were similar in both women and men [40]. In another study, WHR was the best predictor for hypertriglyceridemia in 18–34-year olds, 35–54-year olds, and 55–74-year olds [33]. In the Korean population, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia has increased with abdominal obesity over the previous 10 years [25,70,71]. Studies by Lee et al. [25] and Lee [29] proposed that WC was better for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia compared with BMI in a comparison of the two measures. Regarding the comparison of WC and BMI, the results of the present study are consistent with previous studies by Lee et al. [25] and Lee [29]. The predictive power of WC (OR=1.98, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.701 in women; OR=1.97, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.68 in men) was slightly better than BMI (OR=1.82, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.687 in women; OR=1.84, p=<0.0001, AUC=0.667 in men) in both genders. However, previous studies of South Koreans only compared two measures (WC and BMI), whereas the present study used a greater number of anthropometric measures, basic measures and the ratios of combinations of two measures and demonstrated that WHtR in women and RFcR in men have better predictive powers for hypertriglyceridemia than WC and BMI.

The findings of the current and previous studies imply that the best indicator for a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia may differ according to country and ethnic group. Furthermore, although experiments that used subjects from the same country and ethnic group were conducted, the strongest predictor may differ by gender. Therefore, we should consider these differences and the characteristics of ethnicity, country, age, gender, place of residence, food consumption, and socio-economic circumstances in the study of disease prevalence [28,38–40,69,72,73]. In addition to our study, Christian et al. [28], Aekplakorn et al. [34], Mirmiran et al. [40], and Freedman et al. [74] have demonstrated that the associations between anthropometric measures and risk factors for certain diseases can differ according to ethnicity, country, age, or gender.

A controversial issue in the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia using anthropometric measures is whether a combination of measures has better predictive power compared with individual measures [30,31,37,41–43,75,76]. Several studies have suggested that the use of a combination of two or more measures for the diagnosis of obesity-related diseases provides more reliable diagnoses than the use of each measure alone [30,42,43,75,76]; in other studies, the use of several measures did not improve the predictive power compared with the use of a single measure [31,37,41]. For example, Chen et al. [30] recommended that WC, BMI, and WHR should be simultaneously used to predict diseases because the relationship between anthropometric measures and metabolic disorders, including hypertriglyceridemia, varied according to gender, smoking status, and age. Janssen et al. [75] proposed that the use of WC in addition to BMI in the diagnosis of a patient׳s health risk provides more important information in clinical practice. However, Lee et al. [37], in a meta-analysis, and Barzi et al. [41] argued that the combination of BMI with several other measures, such as WC or WHR, did not improve the predictive power compared with the use of a single measure alone for the identification of high TG status or dyslipidemia. The results in Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 3 indicate that models that use a combination of measures provide better predictive power compared with models that use individual measures in both women and men. However, we must consider that the experimental conditions of our study were somewhat different compared with previous studies. In most previous studies, only a few anthropometric measures were used in combination for the analysis of predictive power, and the selection and adoption of measures were performed using a straightforward combination method. In our study, we used 33 anthropometric measures that were reliably measured in the body and applied 2 variable subset selection techniques, filter and wrapper, for better predictive power.

The findings and proposed prediction method described in this study have two applications: as a preliminary health-screening tool for hypertriglyceridemia and in the integration of telemedicine or remote healthcare with existing medical systems. First, our findings can be used as a quick and easy health-screening tool to identify hypertriglyceridemia. If patients are diagnosed with hypertriglyceridemia using our diagnostic model, we recommend that they be accurately diagnosed using blood tests in hospitals. Second, with the recent development of telecommunications and the internet, along with advances in medical science and engineering, additional information regarding the prognosis and diagnosis of several chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorders, has been supported by artificial intelligence, decision support systems, and data mining [77–81] in hospitals using telemedicine and in remote healthcare settings [82–91]. It is straightforward to measure the body using non-elastic flexible tape to obtain anthropometric measures of individuals. It is possible to input anthropometric information into our prediction model on site or remotely to immediately obtain the results of a preliminary screening. Therefore, our method can be applied to existing medical systems, telemedicine or remote healthcare. However, we should note that the measurements in body shape using a non-elastic flexible tape are not easy because the anthropometric measures must be measured accurately in an exact method in specific sites. Thus, a healthcare expert or well-trained observer is required for exact measurements.

Our study cannot establish causality because our data were obtained using a cross-sectional design, which makes it difficult to prove a cause–effect relationship. Additionally, when variable selection techniques with wrapper approaches in machine learning were used in the male group, the number of selected measures was compared to the female group. We may need to improve the AUCs for better diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia and reduce the number of measures. In the future, we will attempt to establish the cause–effect relationships between hypertriglyceridemia and anthropometric measures and to identify a new indicator or a combination of measures for accurate disease diagnosis. In addition, the study population included only Korean women and men; therefore, these findings cannot be applied to other populations because of differences in socio-economic status, gender, nationality, and ethnic groups. Many countries or ethnic groups have different BMIs and body types. Thus, further study is needed to build and assess a generalizable model across populations. A future study is necessary to evaluate additional variables, such as histories of hypertriglyceridemia and other diseases. Furthermore, additional studies are required to establish a cause and effect relationship between hypertriglyceridemia and anthropometric measures based on longitudinal study according to temporal sequence.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

The best predictor of the risk of hypertriglyceridemia derived from anthropometric measures of body shape remains controversial. The findings of the present study demonstrate that in all age groups of Korean adults, the best anthropometric indicators of hypertriglyceridemia are WHtR in women and RFcR in men, and age is the highest risk factor in women but not in men. However, the best predictors may differ according to gender and age subgroups. In both women and men, diagnostic models that incorporate several measures have superior predictive power compared with the use of individual measures. These findings offer the prospect of a safe, effective, simple, quick, and inexpensive method of preliminary screening to identify hypertriglyceridemia in Korean adults.
