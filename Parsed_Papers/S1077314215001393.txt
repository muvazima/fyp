                  Frequent in practice spatially variant contrast/offset deviations that preserve image appearance hinder classification based on signal co-occurrence statistics. Contrast/offset-invariant descriptors of ordinal signal relations, such as local binary or ternary patterns (LBP/LTP), are popular means to overcome this drawback. This paper extends conventional LBP/LTP-based classifiers towards learning, rather than prescribing most characteristic shapes, sizes, and numbers of these patterns for semi-supervised texture classification and retrieval. The goal is to discriminate a particular texture represented by a single training or query sample from other types of textures. The proposed learning framework models images as samples from a high-order ordinal Markov–Gibbs random field (MGRF). Approximate analytical estimates of the model parameters guide selecting characteristic patterns of a given order, the higher order patterns being learned on the basis of the already found lower order ones. Comparative experiments on four texture databases confirmed that classifiers with the learned multiple LTPs from the 3rd to 8th order consistently outperform more conventional ones with the prescribed 9th-order fixed-shape LBP/LTPs or a few other filters.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Texture analysis and recognition belong to basic image processing and computer vision tools and are widely used in many applications, including industrial inspection, remote sensing of the Earth’s surface, computer-aided medical diagnostics, content-based image retrieval (CBIR), and so forth (see, e.g., [1–6] to cite only a few. As shown in [7], local and global texture descriptors [8,9] have become important and efficient additions to the earlier colour and shape ones in the CBIR. An effective retrieval based on basic texture elements, or textons, was introduced in [10].


                     Contrast-invariant texture recognition. Visual appearance of natural materials depends to a large extent on illumination, viewing directions, and imaging geometry. Therefore, analysis and retrieval of real-world textures requires invariance to at least main perceptive (contrast/offset) and geometric, e.g., affine, projective, or non-rigid variations between images captured under a variety of viewing conditions.

Most of conventional texture descriptors [11,12] account for local signal co-occurrences via, e.g., integral characteristics of grey level co-occurrence matrices [13] or outputs of linear Gabor filters [14] and wavelets [15–17]. However, the real-world textured objects are often viewed under arbitrarily varying illumination, and signal magnitudes may be also affected by spatially variant sensor noise [18]. The resulting image deviations make the co-occurrence-based texture descriptors fragile and notably degrade their image retrieval and classification performance. Leung and Malik [19] used three-dimensional textons to classify materials photographed under real-world conditions. But the required multiple co-registered images captured from known viewpoints under fixed illumination decrease the robustness to changing orientation or scaling.

The famous VZ classifier by Varma and Zisserman [20] described appearances of natural materials from a single image with no prior viewing or illumination knowledge by using probability distributions of textons built by clustering outputs of a bank of rotation invariant filters. The VZ exemplifies a large group of texture descriptors employing deviation-invariant filters to deal with varying illumination and sensing conditions. Local descriptors in [21] also combine outputs of linear filters in a rotation/contrast/scale-invariant way.

Image filtering describes a high-dimensional space of signal co-occurrences with computationally feasible low-dimensional (mostly, scalar) projections. The more the types of global and local signal deviations to deal with, the more intricate the filters to be designed, reducing the discriminability of textures and aggravating the recognition accuracy [22]. Moreover, joint intensity distributions over a compact pixel neighbourhood have outperformed filtering the same neighbourhoods [23], i.e., ensured much better performance than both the VZ and local rotation, contrast, and scale invariant descriptors [21,24] on a very difficult UIUC database [25].


                     Local binary/ternary patterns. Most frequent spatially variant perceptive deviations, caused by illumination and sensor noise, keep appearance of a natural texture due to preserving ordinal relations between closely-spaced signals. Popular local binary or ternary patterns (LBP/LTP) [26], accounting only for such relations, are thus powerful and practical contrast/offset-invariant descriptors and have already solved various practical image analysis tasks, including visual inspection and classification of textured objects.

The basic LBP [27] has a predefined star-like circular central-symmetric shape and quantifies the binary ordinal relations between a central pixel (an origin) and each of its eight equidistant and evenly spaced close- or long-range neighbours. An empirical marginal of such quantified relationships over an image is the ordinal descriptor, which is robust to any monotone transformation of the pattern-wise grey scales and has impressive computational efficiency and discriminative capabilities.

The above conventional descriptors employ the local filters and LBP/LTPs of a fixed hand-picked shape, namely, the N × N squares of small size (
                        
                           N
                           =
                           3
                           ,
                           5
                           ,
                           7
                        
                     ) or the star-like circular structures, respectively. At the same time, unique appearances of many translation invariant textures are characterised by spatial repetitiveness of only specific statistics of local relationships (interactions) between the intensities. The early texture models, such as, e.g., simple 2nd-order auto-regressive, or Gauss–Markov random fields in [28], used a learnable spatially invariant linear predictive filter of a fixed small size to reveal such statistics and classify the textures.

As was shown later [29], learning a unique spatial pattern of multiple close- and long-range pairwise interactions yields a more efficient MGRF model of texture. A characteristic neighbourhood, uniting the learned pairwise interactions of every single pixel, and corresponding marginals of individual pairwise intensity co-occurrences are the model-based image descriptors, which can be used, in particular, for texture classification and synthesis.


                     High-order MGRFs, being generally more powerful than 2nd-order MGRFs due to accounting statistics of much richer interactions between multiple signals [30] and have shown promising results in image denoising, segmentation and restoration. However, the lack of efficient learning and inference algorithms remains the main challenge and limits applicability of these models. The classic N
                     2-order FRAME [31] and FoE [32] models capture characteristic interaction patterns implicitly, by describing all intensity co-occurrences over the N × N square windows placed, ultimately, around every pixel by K marginals of original (FRAME) or transformed (FoE) outputs of K filters; K ≤ N
                     2. Given a training image, the FRAME filters are selected in a computationally intensive sequential way from a hand-picked collection of linear orthogonal filters (often, the 2D Gabor filters with spatially oriented Gaussian-weighted sinusoidally-shaped coefficients), including also a few nonlinear filters. At each step, the maximal distance between the marginals collected for all the remaining filters over the training image and a texture, synthesised with the current model, indicates the next filter to be placed into the model. The FoE employs initially orthogonal linear filters, being principal components of the training N
                     2-element vectors of signal cooccurrences. The output of each filter is transformed with a hand-picked non-linear parametric potential function. The filters and parameters of their transforming potentials are refined by minimising the training image energy. Both the models account for almost no spatially variant perceptive deviations and thus have limited abilities to learn adequate appearance descriptors.

More recent 3rd- and 4th-order MGRFs in [33] used simple hand-picked clique structures, namely, pixel triples along the coordinate axes or 2 × 2 rectangles. A conditional high-order 
                        
                           P
                           n
                        
                      Potts random field of region labels, given a piecewise-homogeneous texture, with a special parametric polynomial potential, was developed specially for the graph-cut based segmentation [34,35]. Other recent high-order MGRFs [36–39] focus on transforming high-order energy functions to low-order representations, such as linear or boolean functions, to reduce the optimal statistical inference to minimization of an equivalent 2nd-order energy function. Some global image properties, such as connectedness [40,41], can be also modelled with potentials depending on all the pixels. The model parameters are set up either manually [35] or by an iterative search for local minimum of a specific regularised energy function [40]. However, it is difficult to use all these MGRFs for texture modelling and recognition under spatially variant perceptive deviations.


                     Overview of the paper. This paper introduces and employs a new generic MGRF, which inherits the 2nd- and higher-order ordinal pixel-to-neighbours interactions from a generalised LBP/LTP, but allows for learning most characteristic patterns of arbitrary shapes, adapted to appearance of each training texture. The model is robust to local perceptive variations due to using ordinal relations and has also a limited rotational invariance due to its in-built adaptation by minimising the total interaction energy of a given texture.

Novelties of the paper are four-fold. (i) Unlike most of the high-order models with hand-picked square or circular interaction structures of fixed sizes, shapes of our structures can be arbitrary and are learned to better characterise each training texture. (ii) In so doing, potentials of our MGRF are learned analytically, in a computationally efficient way, rather than hand-picked among specific parametric functions as in a large group of the high-order MGRFs that act as smoothing or global connectivity priors in image segmentation and facilitate statistical inference based on graph-cut or belief propagation optimisation. (iii) Characteristic interaction structures and potentials learned for our model (of up to the 8th order in this paper) are texture-specific descriptors, usable in other applications. (iv) The proposed high-order ordinal model is robust to spatially variant perceptive variations over the textures.

Performance of the proposed high-order model with the learned LTPs was evaluated experimentally on 1072 digital textures from four popular image databases, including the recent Outex and older Brodatz collections. These experiments confirmed that our texture retrieval accuracy is consistently higher than for the known fixed-structure LBP/LTPs and descriptors derived from the VZ filters and the FRAME and FoE models.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the prior work. The proposed generic high-order ordinal MGRF and its learning are detailed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses experimental validation of these descriptors, and Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines the future work.

                      accounting for only n uniform patterns in [44] is called below the classic LBP. Spectral features of an LBP marginal obtained by the discrete Fourier transform (LBP-HF) [45] have performed in texture classification and face recognition better than the earlier classic LBP. The alternative ILBP [46] and MBP [47] replace the central grey value g
                     0, 0 in Eq. (1) with the mean or median grey value, respectively, of the whole shape including the centre. An LTP in [48] encodes the pairwise ordinal relations between the grey values more in detail. To become more robust to image noise, a fuzzy LBP (FLBP) [49,50] employs two fuzzy membership functions instead thresholding, and a shift LBP (SLBP) [51] implementation makes the FLBP five times faster.

This paper uses sufficient statistics of the contrast-offset invariant MGRF introduced in Section 3, i.e., empirical marginals (normalised histograms over the image g) of values of the learned LBPs as ordinal texture descriptors. The like marginals for the classic LBP, LBP-HF, SLBP and LTP, as well as descriptive marginals from the VZ, FRAME, and FoE serve as the control methods (most of their MATLAB codes are available online, e.g., [52,53]). At the recognition stage, the training (query) descriptors and the like descriptors for other images are compared and discriminated using conventional inter-distribution statistical tests, such as the chi-square metrics [26,44].

The LBP itself is not rotation-invariant. To define a rotation-invariant LBP, its numerical code for each neighbourhood is compared in [43] to one of the 36 individual patterns by rotating the neighbourhood until one match is achieved. The marginals of the matching frequencies over the image are used as the rotation-invariant LBP descriptors. An alternative approach in [54,55] used the MGRF models with the arbitrary-shaped

                     (a) illustrates the difference between the partial and complete ordinal interactions by showing all the interactions taken into account for a 4th-order pattern. Because the cardinality of the set of the complete ordinal relations grows much faster than the cardinality of the set of 
                        
                           (

                      or 4. According to experimental results, such learned 3rd- and 4th-order models outperformed, in application to texture classification, the learned earlier 2nd-order MGRFs accounting for multiple pairwise signal co-occurrences [29,56], but rank below the classifiers using the classic LBPs. An introduced below new learnable MGRF with multiple high-order ordinal interactions quantified with the arbitrary-shaped LBPs or LTPs has less limitations.

The proposed MGRF describes a texture with a collection of the empirical marginals, i.e., marginal probability distributions of the LTPs supported by spatially repetitive pixel configurations of arbitrary shapes. The configurations act as cliques of the interaction graph linking all the mutually interacting pixel pairs. Each such

                     -order MGRF model of each particular texture has its own learned geometric shapes of the cliques stratified into one or more families of the translation invariant same-shape cliques and own Gibbs potentials learned for each family. Given a training subset of images of a particular texture, the approximate potentials for all arbitrary-shaped candidate clique families of each order are first estimated analytically and then used to select the most characteristic families from a pool of the candidates by comparing their Gibbs energies. After the characteristic 2nd-order families are learned, the found shapes are used for building the higher-order ones. Based on a conjecture that lower-order cliques being constituents of a characteristic high-order one are characteristic by themselves, the sequential learning proposed below will greatly decease the numbers of candidates for the higher-order cliques.

The characteristic clique families are found by analysing the partial interaction energies for a large search pool of the candidates. In the experiments below (Section 4), intra-clique pixel x- and y-offsets for the 2nd-order candidate families have been limited to the ranges

                         details learning 2nd-order characteristic clique families.

The most characteristic (least-energetic) families were selected by separating an empirical distribution of the family-wise interaction energies with the unimodal thresholding [59]. The selection threshold corresponds on the distribution curve to the point at the maximal distance from a straight line from the peak energy to the last non-empty position of the energy distribution, i.e, to the least energy or the maximal negated energy. Fig. 3 illustrates learning the characteristic 2nd-order clique families for the Brodatz texture D1 from the distribution of the negated energies for all the 5150 candidates with the absolute x- and y-coordinate offsets |ξ| ≤ 50; |η| ≤ 50.

The energy distributions for some textures are multi-modal, especially, for the sets of the higher-order candidates. For simplicity, in the experiments below a proper lower-energy threshold is determined by iterating the unimodal thresholding until the number of the selected clique families is in a prescribed range [50, 200] for the 2nd-order and [20, 50] for the higher-order families. This heuristic iterative search circumvents a more complicated estimation of the dominant energy modes, while produces reasonably small numbers of the characteristic clique families of each order under consideration, which are sufficient for capturing and discriminating the learned textures [55].

A very similar process of learning potentials for and structures of the higher-order clique families has only two differences. (i) The number

                                 |
                              
                           
                         of distinct numerical codes for the 
                           
                              (
                              K
                              +
                              1
                              )
                           
                        -order LTPs grows as 3
                           K
                        , e.g., from 9 to 2187 for the 3rd- to 8th-order families, respectively. (ii) Although the candidate 2nd-order families exhaust all the coordinate offsets in a search window, the like initial search pool of all possible 3rd- or higher-order shapes within the same window is impractical due to its exponential growth, e.g., more than 1.3 × 107 candidates just for the 3rd-order models. To have a feasible search pool of each order, our sequential learning Algorithm 2
                        
                        
                        
                         assumes that every characteristic high-order conditional signal dependency in textures of our interest implies all the lower-order ones, so that the higher-order cliques can be built gradually from the already selected characteristic lower-order ones. Fig. 4 illustrates the selection of the 3rd-, 5th-, and 8th-order cliques for describing the texture D1.

Adding a next node to an already built lower-order shape specifying the clique family has one practical constraint: the distance between the new node and each previous one must exceed a certain prescribed or experimentally found threshold, d, shown in Fig. 5. For example, if two clique elements are too close, the formed candidate 3rd-order clique is actually too similar to the original 2nd-order one. To capture longer-range shapes and decrease the number of the candidate families, only the offsets exceeding the threshold take part in building the higher-order cliques (
                           
                              d

                         was empirically set up in our experiments in Section 4).

After the characteristic cliques and their potentials for the ordinal MGRF model are learned from a training, or query texture,

                        Rotational invariance of our 2nd- or higher-order LTP-based MGRF model is achieved, just as in [43], by matching both the LBP codes, corresponding to the LTP for each pixel neighbourhood, to their rotationally equivalent individual codes, i.e., by rotating the neighbourhood until finding the exact match. Alternatively, the characteristic cliques learned for the training texture can be rotated until finding the lowest interaction energy for or the highest similarity of a given test texture.

The learned characteristic low- and high-order texture descriptors and their texture retrieval performance for the χ
                     2 metric of Eq. (10) were tested on four databases:

                        
                           1.
                           
                              DB 1: 192 textures from the Outex_TC_00000 test suit [60], having been used in [44] (24 classes; 8 samples 256 × 256 per class, randomly cropped from 746 × 538 source images); their examples are shown in Fig. 6 (four top rows);


                              DB 2: 560 images of natural and man-made homogeneous textured surfaces (28 classes; 20 samples 256 × 256 per class) viewed under similar illumination and used by Kylberg et al. [51]; the examples are shown in Fig. 6 (four bottom rows);


                              DB 3; DB 4: 320 Brodatz [61] and 320 Outex [60] images (40 classes; 8 samples 256 × 256 per class, randomly cropped from 512 × 512 source images) and exemplified in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 shows variations of the “cushion1” and “lentils1” textures.

Only a single sample, randomly selected from each class, was used as a query or training texture. All other samples from this class, together with all samples of the other classes were the test images for retrieval.

The retrieval experiments evaluate the accuracy of searching for similar to a query textures in a database. Let M be the number of samples for one class in a database. One randomly selected sample of each class serves as a query, whereas the remaining 
                        
                           M

                           1
                        
                      samples of this class and all samples from all other classes in the database form the search set. The class-wise model performance was measured, as in [62], by the percentage of correctly retrieved images among the top M images, and the average percentage over all the queries gives the total accuracy of the model on a particular database.

The RFS bank consisted of 38 49 × 49 linear Gaussian filters and their first and second derivatives, including the Laplacian-of-Gaussians. Marginals of the pixel-wise responses of the RFS filters centred at every pixel were used as image descriptors.

In addition, although the conventional high-order FRAME and FoE MGRF models have never been used for texture recognition, their filters were learned in our experiments for each training image and the empirical marginals of their pixel-wise responses, being the sufficient statistics of the models, were used as the control descriptors, too. For all the control descriptors, the same χ
                     2-distance of Eq. (10) between the training and test marginals measured the similarity of the textures.
                     
                  

The RFS filters and the FoE model were implemented using their public-domain MATLAB codes provided at the authors’ websites [20,63]. Learning the FRAME filters was implemented using an introduced in [64] simple efficient selection from a bank of the 9 × 9 filters, containing one intensity delta-filter, 48 linear Laplacian-of-Gaussian filters, and 36 linear Gabor filters with different parameters.


                        Tables 1 and 2 present the texture retrieval results on the DB 1 and DB 2 using the LTPs learned for the 2nd to 8th-order MGRF models, comparing with the classic LBP, LBP-HF, SLBP, LTP, FRAME, FoE, and RFS as the control methods. Comparative summaries for all the four databases, DB 1 to DB 4, in Table 3 show that the higher the order, the better the performance of the learned high-order LTP models, which notably outperform the original fixed-shape 9th-order LBP or LTP models. The retrieval with the χ
                        2-similarity measure and the learned 8th-order LTPs has consistently either better or at least the same accuracy across the chosen databases, than the conventional descriptors.

For almost all the textures, the learned 8th-order LTPs (abbreviated D8 in Tables 2 and 3) were better by the classification χ
                        2-metrics than the conventional LTP3, being the best of the four LBP/LTP-related descriptors. This justifies the advantage of learning the texture-specific interaction structures, since our 8th-order model only differs from all its conventional counterparts in the learned, rather than prescribed fixed 9th-order structure. Our model has much better retrieval accuracy than the learned FoE and FRAME filters-based descriptors. Moreover, different selections of the FRAME filters led to even worse accuracies across all the databases. At the same time, the descriptors based on the RFS filters achieved quite similar to our model performance on the DB 1, DB 2, and DB 3, as shown in Table 3.
                     

However, the 38 RFS filters of size 49 × 49 applied to the windows centred at each pixel involve, in total, more than 91,000 elements per pixel vs. only 400 elements in our 8th-order model limited to the 50 clique families. Thus, the RFS model has much higher computational complexity and is less flexible. Its performance may considerably deteriorate if its preselected filters turn to be inadequate for describing the target textures (e.g., its accuracy on the DB 4 was lower than for both the conventional LTP3 and our 8th-order model).

It is worthy to note that the proposed learnable 8th-order model is not only accurate, but also computationally efficient. Its present mixed-code (Matlab and C programming language) implementation on a 3.33 GHz Intel Core i5-2500 processor with 8 GB memory takes, given a 256 × 256 query image, about 5 s for selecting the 2nd-order characteristic clique families from the 5150 candidates. The complexity of learning the higher-order families depends on the number of their candidates. Building the higher-order structures sequentially from the lower-order ones with Algorithms 1 and 2 under the empirically chosen upper limit of the 100 characteristic families per model takes, in the average, about 15 s for selecting the 8th-order characteristic structure for the texture retrieval.

The database DB 2 is more challenging than the other three databases due to many random non-repetitive textures, which could be difficult for recognition. As shown in Table 2, our descriptors (D
                           8) performed consistently better across all the 28 classes in the DB 2, especially for the textures 6 (“cushion1”), 7 (“floor1”), 10 (“lentils1”), 11 (“linseeds1”), 17 (“sand1”), 18 (“scarf1”), 19 (“scarf2”), 23 (“sesameseeds1”), 24 (“stone1”), 25 (“stone2”) and 27 (“stoneslab1”). Fig. 9 exemplifies the learned 8th-order cliques for the uniform and stochastic textures. Although the textures “lentils1” and “linseeds1” are both stochastic, the learned high-order cliques captured their main structural differences.


                           Fig. 10 illustrates the retrieval of the
                           
                            same three textures (“cushion1”, “lentils1”, and “linseeds1”) using the learned 8th-order LTPs and the control LTP3. The 20 retrieved images are ordered by similarity to the query image. For “cushion1”, the LTP3 gave two errors from two other classes (“sesameseeds1” and “rug1”), decreasing the overall accuracy to 90%, while the learned 8th-order LTPs gave the accuracy of 100%. For “lentils1”, the LTP3 had three errors from two other classes (“rice2” and “pearlsugar1”) resulting in the 85% accuracy, whereas the learned 8th-order LTPs had only one error (the accuracy of 95%) with local elements of very similar sizes comparing to the query. For the “linseeds1”, the LTP3 retrieved ten erroneous “oatmeal1” images, decreasing the accuracy to only 60%. The learned 8th-order LTPs improved this accuracy to 80% (four errors).

However, in spite of these improvements, the overall performance for the textures 2, 9, 16, 26, and 28 was too low for all the descriptors, with better accuracies of 40, 45, 50, 35 and 35%, respectively, for the learned 8th-order models. One of the reasons is that some texture classes in the DB 2 are visually too similar to be accurately discriminated (see, e.g., the samples “stone3”, “stone2”, and “sand1” in Fig. 11. Also, the retrieval fails when the assumed translational invariance does not hold, i.e., local signal patterns are changing across different samples of the same class too randomly and are not repetitive, as e.g., for the texture 9 (“grass1”) and 2 (“blanket2”). The latter image consists mostly of uniform grey areas, so that other highly uniform textures may appear in the retrieved results and decrease the performance.

Three other databases (DB 1,3,4) contain many spatially uniform textures and thus are not very challenging, because each texture has specific repetitive elements simplifying its discrimination from other classes. Even with the fixed LBP/LTP structure, the signal patterns produced form clusters, or peaks in the marginal, although these repetitive patterns are not intuitive to the human vision.

For example, both our 8th-order model and the control LTP3 have good retrieval performance (the accuracy of 94 and 90%; 96 and 99%, and 95 and 94% on the DB 1; DB 3, and DB 4, respectively). Fig. 12 shows that our model performs better on the DB 1 texture 16 (“canvas035”), than the LTP3, improving the retrieval accuracy from 63 to 88%. However, for the DB 4 classes 5 (“canvas004”) and 25 (“rubber001”), the learned 8th-order LTPs perform worse, than the conventional LTP3, 0.63 vs. 1.00 and 0.75 vs. 1.00, respectively. The learned 8th-order clique families and the retrieval errors with such LTPs in Fig. 13 suggest that in some cases, e.g., for the query “rubber001”, the learned clique shapes are unreasonable. The characteristic cliques disperse over a large area with short-range interactions disappeared. And also only the interactions in the horizontal direction are captured. Missing really characteristic short-range dependencies could have happened due to the chosen fixed distance threshold d, rather than a more adequate angular one for excluding close elements of a higher-order clique. Actually, building characteristic high-order cliques requires a more general solution instead of our current ad-hoc simplifications (e.g., all the currently learned 8th-order clique shapes for the class “canvas004” , shown in Fig. 13, look too similar and thus hardly represent the existing long-range dependencies in the vertical direction.

Although most of the conventional LBP/LTPs [26,42,44] have the radius no larger than 3, our experiments have shown that the larger radii could improve the retrieval accuracy for some textures. This confirms the importance of learning, rather than pre-defining the interaction structures.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper proposes a new framework for learning texture-specific contrast/offset-invariant high-order MGRF models of images described in terms of multiple arbitrary-shaped LBPs or LTPs, which are considered ordinal signal configurations supported by K-order clique families on an interaction graph; 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                           3
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           8
                        
                     . Given a training or query image, our learning framework builds a K-order MGRF model of this class of textures by recovering both the translation-invariant interaction structure, i.e., the number and shapes of characteristic repetitive patterns, and their corresponding Gibbs potentials. First, the analytical approximate MLEs of the potentials are computed from the empirical marginals for the numerically coded candidate LBPs or LTPs. Then, the partial Gibbs energies totalling the potentials over every translation-invariant clique family are used to determine the characteristic families sequentially, by building the next-order cliques from the already selected lower-order ones.

Experimental results on the four texture databases show that the marginals of the LTP values over the learned high-order characteristic clique families act as highly efficient texture descriptors. The χ
                     2-distances between such training and test descriptors outperform by the texture retrieval accuracy the like descriptors for the classic fixed-shape LBPs and LTPs, as well as for the learned filters from the well-known high-order FRAME and FoE models. The descriptors based on the RFS filters from the highly efficient VZ classifier perform very similarly to our model, but at the expense of their considerably higher computational complexity and hence much slower retrieval.

However, the learning actually hindered the performance for a few classes of textures, partly, because of simplifications in building higher-order cliques from the lower-order ones by adding new characteristic dependencies on the basis of their relative energies. These problems will be explored in our future work on improving the effectiveness of high-order contrast/offset-invariant texture descriptors, including the proposed arbitrary-shaped texture-specific LTPs. While this paper focussed on texture retrieval with a single query image of a goal class, such descriptors could be applied also to more general texture classification and object recognition problems.

The learned LTPs are well suited for describing various textures, which are spatially homogeneous in that their contrast/offset-invariant statistics of local signal co-occurrences are spatially (translationally) repetitive, e.g., for regular (mosaic-like) and stochastic textures. Due to learning from a single query, or training texture, the already found descriptors can be directly applied to any texture database for retrieving textures of the same class. But, in principle, a net of such position-dependent descriptors can be learned for a spatially inhomogeneous texture, too, given a sufficiently large set of co-aligned training images.
