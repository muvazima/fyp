                  Financial data are often thick-tailed and exhibit skewness. The versatile Generalized Tukey Lambda (GTL) distribution is able to capture varying degrees of skewness in thin- or thick-tailed data. Such versatility makes the GTL distribution potentially useful in the area of financial risk measurement. Moreover, for GTL-distributed random variables, the familiar risk measures of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) may be expressed in simple analytical forms. It turns out that, both analytically and through Monte Carlo simulations, GTL’s VaR and ES differ significantly from other flexible distributions. The asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator of the GTL parameters are also examined. In order to study risk in financial data, the GTL distribution is inserted into a GARCH model. This GTL-GARCH model is estimated with data on daily returns of GE stock, demonstrating that, for certain data sets, GTL may capture risk measurements better than other distributions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The global financial crisis of 2008–2009 was triggered by various factors. One of the primary culprits was the failure to correctly measure the risks of financial positions in many large firms (Lo, 2008). The inaccurate measurement of risk, together with a perverted incentive structure in the finance sector, led to the collapse of the housing mortgage market, triggering the global crisis and recession. Though many remedial legislative actions were taken after the crisis, an accurate and robust measurement of risk is still the striving goal of many in the business world. Thus, any new technique or model that may enhance the robustness of risk measurement will be a gain (Acharya et al., 2012; Brownless and Engle, in preparation).

In finance, a risk measure is often used for specifying capital requirements in financial regulation (Francq and Zakoïan, 2010). Therefore, quantifying risk is crucial in financial risk management. Value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are the most widely used risk measures. Both of these are more accurate if the probability distribution used in the risk calculation matches closely to the true underlying data generating process. In particular, since these risk measures relate to the tail behavior, correct specification of the tail behavior is essential. Rachev et al. (2008) describe several desirable properties of an ideal risk measure. Given the multidimensional aspects of risk, they search for an ideal risk measure for a portfolio selection problem. Since the evidence on the skewness and kurtosis of financial time series data is well-documented (Engle and González-Rivera, 1991; Harvey and Siddique, 1999, 2000; Jondeau and Rockinger, 2003; Christoffersen et al., 2006; Grigoletto and Lisi, 2009), a robust risk measure should account for skewness and kurtosis in the data.

There is an extensive literature on the estimation of VaR and ES, from fully parametric to semi-parametric and nonparametric approaches. The main advantage of the semi- and non-parametric approaches is that weak assumptions are imposed on the data generating process, but at the cost of more time-intensive estimation and lower efficiency (Bassett et al., 2004; Scaillet, 2004; Taylor, 2008a,b; Cai and Wang, 2008; Chen, 2008). Moreover and most importantly, as Komunjer (2007) points out, the difficulty of these approaches to risk measurement lies in their inability to estimate the expected shortfall variance. The parametric approach does not suffer from these issues, though it does require stronger assumptions about the data generating process: it imposes strong constraints on the shape of the density and, in particular, on tail behavior. For example, the familiar Student’s 
                        t
                      distribution is often used to capture heavy tails, but is restricted by its symmetry; its extensions, i.e., the skewed-
                        t
                      and generalized 
                        t
                      distributions, are able to capture skewness (Bali and Theodossiou, 2007; Hansen, 1994; Fernández and Steel, 1998; Branco and Dey, 2001; Azzalini and Capitanio, 2003). The generalized error distribution (GED) is known for its flexible tail decay property (Nelson, 1991); this symmetric distribution has been generalized in various ways to account for skewness as well (Fernández et al., 1995; Ayebo and Kozubowski, 2003; Komunjer, 2007). The generalized hyperbolic (GH) family of distributions is known for having semi-heavy tails that converge to zero more slowly than those of a normal distribution (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1977; Eberlein and Keller, 1995). Note that the literature contains various definitions for heavy tailedness (or fat-tailedness) (Embrechts et al., 1997; Sigman, 1999); also, see Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2001) for a discussion on semi-heavy tailedness. One of the members of the GH family is the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, which has been used in financial applications where tails are not too heavy and skewness is evident (Barndorff-Nielsen, 1997; Eberlein and Keller, 1995; Eberlein et al., 1998; Prause, 1997, 1999; Rydberg, 1997; Lillestøl, 2000). However, estimation of the parameters of GH distributions is often hampered by the fact that maximum likelihood estimation typically requires very large sample sizes. Aas and Haff (2006) introduce the generalized hyperbolic skew Student’s 
                        t
                     -distribution to account for skewness.

This paper explores the advantages of using the Generalized Tukey Lambda (GTL) distribution in financial risk measurement. The GTL distribution is a versatile distribution that is able to capture varying degrees of skewness in data that exhibit thick- or thin-tailed behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this distribution–the two-parameter version introduced by Pregibon (1980) and Freimer et al. (1988)–has never been applied to risk measurement. Very recently, the distribution was fitted to exchange rates in Corlu and Meterelliyoz (forthcoming) and Corlu and Corlu (forthcoming), and it is also used in binary choice modeling (Koenker and Yoon, 2009; Vijverberg and Vijverberg, forthcoming). A related extension of Tukey’s lambda distribution, known as the Generalized Lambda Distribution, did receive some attention in finance; see, for example, Corrado (2001), Tarsitano (2004), Chalabi et al. (2012), and Pfaff (2013). We contribute to the existing literature in the following ways. (i) We derive VaR and ES for a GTL-distributed random variable and compare them with those of other commonly used distributions. Since VaR and ES for GTL are available in closed form as functions of GTL parameters, numerical integration schemes are not needed. This is unlike some of the aforementioned distributions where the calculation of ES requires numerical integration, which may be difficult to implement successfully for particular parameter values. (ii) Whereas Su (2007) proposes the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the GTL parameters only from an algorithmic perspective, we study the asymptotic properties of the MLE. In particular, we outline restrictions that must be placed on the range of the GTL parameters in order for the MLE to be consistent and asymptotically normal. These restrictions are inconsequential for the application of GTL in financial risk measurement, as they rule out members of the GTL family that have high truncated tails (e.g., the uniform distribution). (iii) We compare the relative risk measures of the GTL distribution with other distributions, first analytically in terms of skewness, kurtosis, VaR and ES, and then with an extensive Monte Carlo study in terms of the variability of VaR and ES. (iv) We show empirically that, for certain data sets, GTL may capture risk measures better than other distributions. We use GE stock to illustrate the performance of VaR and ES in a GARCH model of stock returns with GTL-distributed innovations and compare it to GARCH models based on the normal, skewed-
                        t
                     , skewed generalized error (SGE) and NIG distributions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The characteristics of the GTL distribution will be discussed in Section  2.1. Section  2.2 develops the VaR and ES concepts under the GTL distribution. Section  3 addresses the maximum likelihood estimation of the GTL parameters. Section  4 inserts the GTL distribution into a GARCH(
                        p
                        ,
                        q
                     ) model. In reference to VaR and ES, Section  5 compares the GTL distribution with alternative distributions. Section  6 applies the GTL-GARCH(1, 1) model in a study of a financial time series and compares the estimates with GARCH(1, 1) estimates that rely on four other distributions. Section  7 concludes the paper.

The Tukey-lambda distribution was introduced by Hastings et al. (1947) and Tukey (1960). Apart from a location and scale parameter, it relies on one parameter to generate distributions that vary in tail thickness. Pregibon (1980) and Freimer et al. (1988) generalized it as a two-parameter extension that also permits varying degrees of skewness. In its canonical form and following Pregibon’s notation, this Generalized Tukey Lambda (GTL) distribution is defined as follows.

                         and

                         in Pregibon’s (1980) parameterization that is given in Eq. (1) are quite directly related to kurtosis and skewness, respectively. For these reasons, and because Pregibon was the first to propose this generalization of the Tukey-lambda distribution, we prefer to refer to the distribution as GTL(
                           α
                           ,

The canonical form in Definition 1 is a natural and unique way of representing the GTL distribution. The canonical form of a distribution represents the essential functional form by which the distribution is characterized. Statistical distributions are often stated in a canonical form rather than in a standardized form; e.g.,

To illustrate the richness of the GTL distribution, Fig. 2

                        , GTL densities are symmetric. The densities in Fig. 2(a) exhibit tails in increasing degrees of thickness due to

                         decreasing from 0.45 (truncated tails) to −0.45 (thick tails). To get an idea of the tail thickness of these distributions, draws from a GTL

                        ) density in Fig. 2(b) is the same as the logistic density in standardized form, which in turn is closely similar to a

In order to avoid confusion, we note that GTL is distinct from the Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD), another two-parameter extension designed by Ramberg and Schmeiser (1974). The GLD has received much more attention in the literature; for example, see Karian and Dudewicz (2000, 2011). One distinction between the GTL and GLD is that the logistic density is a special case of the GTL but can only be closely approximated by the GLD. Also, while GTL and GLD function specifications seem very similar, GTL and GLD parameter values that yield similar skewness in the approximated distributions differ substantially—and it is not clear that one family dominates the other in the closeness of the fit. Most importantly, the feasible parameter space of the GLD has gaps that are tedious to negotiate in the iterative search for the maximum likelihood estimates. To be specific, as demonstrated in Karian et al. (1996), the GLD is not defined in the following regions of the shape parameters

                         consists of four non-contiguous areas. Occasionally, the literature distinguishes the two extensions by the acronyms GLD-RS and GLD-FKML; we prefer the GTL label because the cousins are not brothers from the same family, as noted in Karian and Dudewicz (2000, p. 39).

We will first summarize value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) generically, in reference to both left and right tails, then homogenize the notation for statistical purposes, and finally apply these concepts to the GTL framework.

Let 
                           r
                         be the percentage change in the value of the holding asset measured as the difference in the daily log price multiplied by 100, and let 
                           F
                         be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of 
                           r
                        . Typically, VaR is defined as the smallest loss incurred with probability 
                           p
                        , and ES is the average loss given a VaR violation. For firms with a long position, a drop in the price of an asset (i.e., 
                           r
                           <
                           0
                        ) implies a loss. For them, VaR is computed through the implicit equation

                           r
                        . In contrast, holders of a short position are interested in the right tail of the CDF of 
                           r
                         because for them a rise in the price of an asset (i.e.,

The asymmetry in the definition of VaR in the left and right tail is inconvenient. Since VaR merely measures the quantile of a distribution, we modify the notation such that VaR is simply the quantile at probability 
                           p
                         (i.e., 
                           p

                           F

                              )
                           
                        ), noting that holders of long positions are interested in 
                           
                              VaR
                           
                         for 
                           p
                         close to 0 and holders of short positions in 
                           
                              VaR

As shown in Section  2.1, generating random variates from a GTL distribution with known parameters is straightforward. However, estimating the GTL parameters

                      from a sample of data is more involved. The literature of statistical data analysis offers several methods to fit the GTL distribution (or its cousin, the GLD distribution) to data. Ramberg et al. (1979) propose to estimate the distribution’s parameters by the method of moments using the first four moments. Öztürk and Dale (1985) suggest a least squares estimation method. King and MacGillivray (1999) fit the GTL distribution to the data by the “starship” method, which is a computationally intensive grid-search, while Karian and Dudewicz (1999) and Su (2011) derive parameter estimates by quantile matching, and Karvanen and Nuutinen (2008) do the same from L-moments. Su (2007) proposes an algorithm that combines a random grid search with maximum likelihood estimation, but he only examines the bias and variance of this estimator by simulation—and in this simulation he uses parameter values for which asymptotic normality cannot be asserted according to Theorem 3. In the following, we describe the statistical properties of the maximum likelihood estimator, in both large-sample and small-sample contexts.

Let 
                        Θ
                      be the parameter space. We assume 
                        Θ
                      is compact; clearly, the scale parameter

                        Θ
                      must be restricted further, as is indicated by the following two theorems, of which the proofs are provided in Appendix C.

In Theorem 2, the exceptions stem from the fact that the GTL density simplifies to a uniform density for both of the stated 
                        
                           (
                           α

                           δ

                      values. However, the exceptions are less problematic than they seem: in Theorem 3, not just one of these but both values are removed from the feasible parameter space. The reason for this is the following. Define the range of 
                        ϵ
                      as 
                        E

                     , which may depend on 
                        
                           (
                           α

                      as was indicated in Section  2.1. Accordingly, let the range of

                      be given by 
                        R

                     , which is

                      shifted by

                        θ
                      is usually problematic because proofs of asymptotic normality rely on the interchange of differentiation and integration, and the dependence of the bounds of 
                        r
                      on 
                        θ
                      may prevent that. In our case, provided that

                     . By Lemma 3, this restriction implies that GTL densities with finite endpoints are feasible only if at the finite endpoint the density equals 0 and is tangent to the horizontal axis. (At an endpoint that is infinite, the GTL density always approaches the horizontal axis asymptotically.) Practically speaking, this implies that draws from feasible GTL distributions near the endpoint are rare; there is no probability mass at the endpoint. In estimation, we enforce this restriction with a mild regularity penalty function.

GARCH models are commonly used to study the behavior of financial time series and to derive measures of risk associated with financial positions. In this section, we introduce GTL-distributed innovations into a GARCH model.

Even if innovations are non-normally distributed, one could still assume, and fit a GARCH model with, a normal distribution. This Gaussian quasi MLE (QMLE) is consistent and asymptotically normal (White, 1982; Wooldridge, 2002), but it is unlikely to adequately account for the potential skewness and heavy-tailedness in financial time series data. Therefore, other flexible densities for the maximum likelihood estimation of conditionally heteroskedastic models have been considered in the literature. See, for example, Bollerslev (1987) for a model with the 
                        t
                      density, Engle and González-Rivera (1991) with the gamma, Nelson (1991) with the generalized error, Hansen (1994) with the skewed-
                        t
                     , Liu and Brorsen (1995) with the stable, Harvey and Siddique (1999) with the non-central-
                        t
                     , Premaratne and Bera (2000) with the Pearson Type IV, Jondeau and Rockinger (2001) with the Gram–Charlier, Bai et al. (2003) with the normal mixture, and Komunjer (2007) with the asymmetric power density.

                      random variable. Recently, Su (2015) describes regular and quantile regression of models with GTL or GLD disturbances, however without GARCH features. (The GLDreg package in R may be used for estimation of such models.) Here, note again that 
                        α
                      and 
                        δ
                      control the shape (through tail-thickness and skewness, respectively) of the GTL density. The restrictions on the parameters are imposed to satisfy stationarity and invertibility conditions. Bougerol and Picard (1992) derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique non-anticipative strictly stationary solution for GARCH(
                        p
                        ,
                        q
                     ) process. Berkes et al. (2003, Lemma 2.3) show the further implications of this condition.

Note that the main drawback of the MLEs employing non-Gaussian densities is that they are inconsistent under any distributional misspecification (Straumann, 2005, Theorem 6.2.1.), although such concerns should be lessened when the assumed distribution is highly flexible. Even so, QMLEs employing non-Gaussian distributions have recently received some attention. For example, Berkes and Horváth (2004) consider the QMLE with the Laplace distribution, and Fan et al. (2014) introduce the generalized non-Gaussian QMLE and establish its properties. However, these two estimators cannot account for skewness in financial time series. Recently, Zhu and Li (forthcoming) proposed a QMLE with the Pearson Type IV distribution to capture both skewness and heavy-tailedness. Along the same lines, the quasi maximum likelihood methodology employing the GTL density in the estimation of GARCH models can be further investigated. However, the conditions for the large sample properties of the non-Gaussian QMLE are tedious to derive and therefore we do not pursue this avenue here.

When data give evidence of thick tails, researchers often specify a model with a 
                        t
                      distribution. When data are skewed, popular alternatives are the skewed-
                        t
                     , skewed generalized error (SGE), and normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distributions. (See Web Appendix B for information on these distributions.) We now compare the GTL distribution with these alternatives, both analytically and by means of Monte Carlo experiments. Other alternatives, like the Hyperbolic and Generalized Hyperbolic distributions, were dropped from consideration as we encountered frequent convergence problems with these when data are thin-tailed.

How much does GTL differ from popular alternative distributions? We examine differences according to five dimensions: the gap between the densities, and the difference in skewness, kurtosis, VaR, and ES. In this comparison, we limit the comparison to the set of GTL functions with finite fourth moments. In Fig. 1, this corresponds to values of

                              (
                              α

                              δ
                              )
                           
                        -area is symmetric around the horizontal (
                           α
                        ) axis, the difference in skewness should be symmetric around 0. Variations of this in Panel B are due to numerical imprecision in the process of distribution fitting. The last row of each panel shows the correlation of the GTL statistic and the same statistic of the alternative distribution. Generally, the skewness and kurtosis of the skewed-
                           t
                        , SGE, and NIG correlates quite well with GTL’s, but stark differences in both skewness and kurtosis exist for some GTL configurations.

The differences become more pronounced when we inspect VaR and ES values. Panels D and E describe the differences in the left tail at 
                           p
                           =
                           0.01
                        ; symmetry in the design produces the same descriptive right-tail values (with an opposite sign). Because the GTL distribution that each alternative is approximating is standardized, the units in which these VaR and ES differences are expressed are standard deviations of the potential underlying data. Thus, for example for 
                           p
                           =
                           0.01
                        , the worst overstatement of the Value at Risk of the skewed-
                           t
                         distribution equals 0.75 standard deviations; the worst understatement is 0.52 standard deviations; the Expected Shortfall for this long position varies from a 1.33 overstatement to a 0.95 understatement. While skewed-
                           t
                         yields larger overstatements than understatements, SGE and NIG show the opposite: relative to GTL, their understatements are worse than their overstatements. Thus, relative to GTL, skewed-
                           t
                         may more often generate tails that are too thick, and SGE and NIG yield tails that are too thin (consistent with also Panel C).

The direction and magnitudes of such errors depend on the skewness and kurtosis of the GTL data configuration. Detailed inspection of the results of the fitting exercise shows that the normal distribution produces the largest understatements of long (short) positions when the GTL distribution is thick-tailed and left- (right-)skewed. The magnitude of the errors is two or more standard deviations. For these same data configurations, symmetric 
                           t
                         distributions are estimated with thicker tails, which yield both an understatement of the risks of a short position and an overstatement in the case of a long position when the GTL distribution is left-skewed and vice versa when right-skewed. By accounting for skewness, the skewed-
                           t
                         distribution is able to substantially reduce these errors; the largest errors still occur under thick-tailed GTL data configurations, where long (short) positions are overstated with left- (right-)skewed data. In contrast, SGE distributions can produce errors of several standard deviations for long (short) position with thick-tailed left (right-)skewed data; NIG distributions do so likewise. Data configurations with short tails consistently yield overstated ES values for NIG, regardless of skewness; the skewed-
                           t
                         distribution typically overstates the long (short) ES when data are right- (left-)skewed. SGE is relatively closest to GTL when data configurations have short tails.

Analytical differences may be outweighed by imprecision in the estimates. When these models are applied to data, the estimated VaR and ES may not be so different, even if in theory only one of the estimators is unbiased. On the other hand, analytical similarities may also be outweighed by precision: small biases may prove to be discernible and significant when estimates are precise. Thus, we ought to examine the bias also with a Monte Carlo analysis. We first generate data with the GTL distribution and fit each candidate distribution to these data. Then, we reverse the process and fit the GTL distribution to data generated by an alternative distribution. In each case, we focus our comparison on the risk measures of VaR and ES and ask whether VaR and ES of misspecified distributions–even if biased–are still reasonably accurate relative to those of a correctly specified model.

In the Monte Carlo investigation, we select six cases with (

                            is nearly the same as a normal distribution, which is symmetric. Similar to Section  5.1, these values are representative of the area in Fig. 1 between the M4 and AN boundaries. In these experiments, asymmetry is in the form of a right skew.

To compare with GTL, we again select the following five distributions: the normal distribution, the 
                              t
                            distribution with a free degrees of freedom parameter, the skewed-
                              t
                           , SGE, and NIG. For each (
                              α
                              ,
                              δ
                           ), we generate 1000 data sets with 
                              n
                              =
                              1000
                            standardized GTL draws according to Eq. (3). On each data set, we fit each distribution by means of the maximum likelihood estimator, and we calculate the respective estimated VaR and ES for 
                              p
                              =
                              0.01
                            and 0.05 in the long position and 
                              p
                              =
                              0.95
                            and 0.99 in the short position. The variation of the 1000 simulated values of VaR and ES for different 
                              p
                            provides the information by which the performance of each distribution is evaluated.

The GTL density is estimated with the optim package of the R programming software and a script to compute the log-likelihood function that is provided as an online supplementary resource (see Appendix A). For all other distributions, estimation was done with the rugarch package of the R programming software (Ghalanos, 2012). The NIG distribution proved to be difficult to estimate when data are short-tailed (
                              α
                              ≥
                              0.25
                           ) because such data are very incompatible with a NIG distribution. However, we also discovered that when the iterative search did not formally converge but did report the parameter vector at the final iteration, this parameter vector produced VaR and ES values that usually were no different in any meaningful statistical sense from other replications that did yield converged estimates. Thus, we compile summary statistics for all reported parameter vectors, whether replications formally converged or not. Another computational issue arose with respect to the calculation of ES: with the exception of the GTL distribution, this was done by means of numerical integration. We used the integrate function in the stats package of R to perform the numerical integration. For a few of the NIG estimates, this numerical integration failed. Such cases are omitted from the summary statistics in the tables that follow.

To conserve space, Tables 3 and 4
                           
                            show abridged results for 
                              p
                              =
                              0.01
                           , and 0.99 and cases A, C, and E, which represent the cases with the thickest tails (A), the most skewness (C), and the most truncated tails (E). Tables E.1 to E.4 of Web Appendix E provide the full summary of the simulation results for all six cases A–F. The first line in each panel records the analytical values of VaR and ES of the distribution that generated the data. For example, for 
                              
                                 (

                           , the analytical VaR and ES values are −2.76 and −3.91. The remaining six rows of each panel characterize the distribution of the estimates of VaR and ES for each distributional specification, as evidenced in the 1000 simulated values. In particular, we report their average value under the heading of “mean” and their 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentiles (i.e., “P5”, “P25”, and so on; P25 and P75 are omitted from the abridged tables). These percentiles give more insight into the shape of the sampling distribution than the standard deviation that is commonly reported as a summary of Monte Carlo results. For each distribution, the difference between recorded mean and the analytical value represents bias. For example, for 
                              
                                 (

                           , the normal distribution exhibits a bias in VaR of 
                              −

                              0.44
                           . To illustrate the seriousness of the bias, we examine where the true analytical value falls within the range of simulated values: we add two superscripted stars (“**”) if the analytical value falls between P25 and P75, or one star if the analytical value is farther out in the tails between P5 and P25 or between P75 and P95. If no star is indicated, the analytical value falls outside the range from P5 to P95. This implies that the sampling distribution is hardly indicative of the analytical value, and the estimator under the stated distributional assumption proves to be decisively biased.


                           Tables 3 and 4 indicate that maximum likelihood estimates of GTL-based VaR and ES are nearly unbiased for all

                              t
                            distribution has three parameters, and the normal distribution has only two parameters. Even so, in the context of risk management, an underestimated (overestimated) ES implies an underestimated (overestimated) risk. Any kind of biased ES estimate is undesirable.


                           Table 4 describes short positions with 
                              p
                              =
                              0.99
                           . When the underlying distribution is symmetric (
                              δ
                              =
                              0
                           ), results are similar to those in Table 3: once again, the other distributions fit poorly when tails are short. As for the asymmetric experiments (here, 
                              δ
                              >
                              0
                           ), skewed-
                              t
                           , SGE, and NIG overstate risk in the left tail and understate risk in the right tail. This suggests that GTL can model asymmetric thick tails better than the other distributions.

As mentioned, we also compare the estimates of VaR and ES for all these distributions for the cases of 
                              p
                              =
                              0.05
                            and 0.95 (see Web Appendix E). In general, GTL-based estimates of VaR and ES outperform those of other distributions, and the VaR and ES biases become smaller as the value of 
                              p
                            moves closer to 0.5.

Skewness in the sampling distributions may be evaluated by comparing the distance from the median (P50) to the outlying percentiles. For example, for the normal-based sampling distribution of ES for 
                              p
                              =

                            and 
                              
                                 (

                                 ,
                                 δ
                                 )

                                 )
                              
                           , the distance between P25 and P50 equals 0.11 and that between P50 and P75 equals 0.07: this sampling distribution is left-skewed. The sampling distributions of normal- and 
                              t
                           -based estimators show the most evidence of skewness, in particular when the GTL data are heavy-tailed and asymmetric.

The differences between the various models are clearer when they are made visual. Fig. 4
                            shows boxplots of ES values for 
                              p

Given the analytical ES values of −3.59 and 4.23, the GTL-based estimator of ES clearly outperforms those based on other distributions. Among the distributions that accommodate skewness, SGE and NIG have tighter confidence intervals than skewed-
                              t
                           , but they also understate ES in both tails. The interval of skewed-
                              t
                            is about as wide as that of GTL, but it overstates ES. The normal distribution is way off, and 
                              t
                            is not as accurate as skewed-

This comparison of GTL with other distributions highlights the differences between the various distributions. The results indicate that, for certain data sets, GTL can capture VaR and ES more precisely than other distributions.

One may contend that using GTL in the data generating process and fitting alternative distributions gives an unfair advantage to the GTL model. Therefore, we now reverse the process: we use one of the other distributions (skewed-
                              t
                           , SGE, or NIG) in the data generating process and compare the fit of GTL and this other distribution in terms of VaR and ES. Providing further structure to this comparison, we again use the previous section’s six cases, which show tails of various thickness both with and without skewness. For example, consider the skewed-
                              t
                            distribution. It is already clear from the tables above that for some 
                              
                                 (
                                 α

                                 δ
                                 )
                              
                            skewed-
                              t
                            is unable to represent GTL-generated data accurately. Then, suppose instead that the data are actually generated with a skewed-
                              t
                            distribution: is the GTL family of densities flexible enough to measure this skewed-
                              t
                            distribution’s VaR and ES well enough?

Therefore, we find six skewed-

                           . We then use skewed-

For clarity, Fig. 5

(Other tables in this Appendix contain similar statistics for 
                              p

                           .) With three cases and with data generated by three distributions (skewed-
                              t
                           , SGE, and NIG), this generates nine scenarios. For each scenario, Panel A shows five different percentile values (i.e., P5, P25, etc.) of VaR for 
                              p
                              =

                            and 
                              p
                              =
                              0.99
                            estimated under the erroneous assumption that the distribution is GTL, as well as the true (analytical) VaR which is represented by a solid dot. Panel B does the same for ES. If the solid dot falls between the two squares, the analytical value falls between the 25th and 75th percentile of the estimated GTL values and the distributional misspecification bias is quite unimportant; if the solid dot falls between a square and a circle, the analytical value falls between the 5th and 25th (or between the 75th and 95th) percentiles of the estimated GTL values and the bias is becoming more substantial; and if the solid dot falls outside the circles, the analytical value falls in the tails of the estimated GTL values and the bias is serious. The latter situation never happens. In fact, the analytical value often falls between the 25th and 75th percentile.

In particular, when fitting skewed-
                              t
                            data with the GTL and considering all six cases A–F, the analytical values fall between the 25th and 75th percentile in 20 of the 24 scenarios (i.e., across six cases; 
                              p
                              =
                              0.01
                            and 0.99; and VaR and ES). For the other four scenarios, the analytical values fall between the 5th and 25th percentile. When data are generated with SGE, there are only three scenarios where the analytical values fall between the 5th and 25th percentile; all the others capture the true analytical values in the 25th–75th percentile range. Finally, when NIG generates the underlying data, there are two scenarios where the analytical values of ES for 
                              p
                              =
                              0.99
                            fall between the 5th and 25th percentile range; in all other scenarios, the true analytical values fall comfortably in the 25th and 75th percentile range. Thus, in general, the bias in GTL’s VaR and ES is small in most scenarios. By implication, if the true distribution of the data generating process is unknown, we may have confidence that the GTL distribution can represent this unknown distribution fairly well.

To demonstrate that, for certain data sets, the GTL may capture risk measurement better than other distributions, we test our GTL-GARCH model empirically using daily data on the stock price of GE from the yahoo.com historical price section. These data begin on 8 May 2000 (right after a stock split) and continue until 31 December 2012.

GE’s rate of return is calculated as the daily log price difference, multiplied by 100. The first column of Table 5
                      shows the descriptive statistics of these returns. This series has heavy tails, illustrated by a large kurtosis value: 10.664.

These data exhibit distinct GARCH-type fluctuations. Thus, Section  6.1 reports the estimates of a GTL-GARCH(1, 1) model. We use the whole sample period to estimate the parameters of the model and to examine the corresponding VaR and ES. As for out-of-sample forecasting (Section  6.2), we use a rolling window scheme for parameter estimation. The window is set to 1500 observations. We then calculate one-step ahead forecasts of VaR and ES. We estimate the model by assuming that the error terms are GTL, normal, skewed-
                        t
                     , NIG, or SGE; we omit estimation of models with the 
                        t
                      distribution as skewed-
                        t
                      nests 
                        t
                      and performed better than 
                        t
                      in the simulations reported in Section  5. In each case, we do VaR and ES tests to check the validity of the distribution’s representation of the tails.

For our application, we specify a simple GTL-GARCH(1, 1) model. In order to determine the proper lag lengths, we explored alternative GARCH models under a MLE scheme with normal and skewed-
                           t
                         distributions. The third-order parameter of a GARCH(1, 3) model is marginally significant only with skewed-

                        ) of either a GARCH(1, 3) or GARCH(1, 2) model is tiny (less than 0.0001) and never statistically significant. Moreover, the Akaike Information Criterion is lowest for a GARCH(1, 1) model. We also examined the assumption that the mean is constant rather than an AR(1) process. This assumption proved to be clearly appropriate for these data; moreover, the other parameters are stable relative to the inclusion or exclusion of an autoregressive structure in the mean. Thus, we adopt a GTL-GARCH(1, 1) model.

The GTL-GARCH model is estimated with the optim package of the R programming software and a script to compute the log-likelihood function that is provided as an online supplementary resource (see Appendix A). The estimates are given in Table 6
                        . In regard to the GARCH parameters, the estimate of the persistence parameter 
                           β
                         is 0.942, and

                         is quite small. The estimate of 
                           α
                         is −0.218. Since an approximately normal GTL distribution requires

                        , which expresses the ES-VaR distance in standard deviations. Because of skewness, 
                           T
                         differs between the left and right tail. Left- and right-tail values of 
                           T
                         are 0.883 and 0.849. Thus, the tails of GE stock returns are almost symmetric: 
                           T
                         translates the variations in (

                                 ˆ

                                 ˆ
                              
                           
                        ) into terms relevant for financial risk management.

With these estimates, we are also able to compute dynamic VaR and ES values over the length of the sample. In Fig. 6
                        , the top panel shows ES of a short position with 
                           p
                           =
                           0.95
                        ; the bottom panel shows the same for a long position with 
                           p
                           =
                           0.05
                        . The financial crisis in 2008 had an obvious impact on these variables.

We now turn to the out-of-sample performance of the GTL-GARCH model in comparison with GARCH models that are based on other distributions (normal, skewed-
                           t
                        , NIG and SGE). We use a rolling window scheme for parameter estimation. The length of the estimation window is set to 1500 observations. After we obtain the estimates, we calculate one-step-ahead forecasts of VaR and ES, which form the basis of our evaluation of the suitability of each distribution: thus, we have 1594 forecasts in the case of GE.

To aid in this evaluation, Table 7
                         reports three summary statistics and five test results for each distribution and for each long (
                           p
                         equal to 0.01 and 0.05) and short (
                           p
                         equal to 0.90 and 0.95) position. “mu.VaR” and “mu.ES” are the averages of these one-step-ahead forecasted VaR and ES values. “cv” represents the coverage ratio, indicating the frequency of VaR violations for a given 
                           p
                        : this frequency should be close to 
                           p
                         for a long position and 
                           1
                           −
                           p
                         for a short position, if the innovation distribution is assumed correctly.

As for the test statistics, we report the 
                           p
                        -values of the tests only: low 
                           p
                        -values indicate that the specified distribution offers a poor fit of the data. To evaluate VaR forecasts, we implement the unconditional coverage test (Kupiec, 1995) and the conditional coverage ratio test (Christoffersen et al., 2001). The unconditional coverage test assumes that the number of exceedances of the VaR value follows a binomial distribution. Under the null hypothesis of a correctly specified model, the assumed probability (
                           p
                        ) of exceedance should be consistent with the estimated exceedance under the binomial process. This test, however, ignores the fact that exceedances in a binomial process are assumed to be independent, which is a testable assumption. Accordingly, the conditional coverage test examines the frequency of the exceedances as well as their independence jointly. In the tables, the 
                           p
                        -values of these two tests are denoted as p.uc and p.cc respectively.

To evaluate ES forecasts, the test of McNeil and Frey (2000) evaluates the mean of the shortfall violations, which should be equal to the mean of the specified distribution under the null hypothesis when the model is correctly specified. The 
                           p
                        -value of this test is denoted as p.MF. We also implement both unconditional and conditional Berkowitz tests. Diebold et al. (1998) showed that, under a given hypothesized distribution, the forecasted ES values may be converted into draws from a uniform distribution on the 
                           
                              [
                              0
                              ,
                              1
                              ]
                           
                         interval that should be independently and identically distributed if the underlying distribution is correctly hypothesized. Berkowitz (2001) went a step further by transforming these uniformly distributed values with the inverse of standard normal distribution. If the hypothesized distribution coincides with the true underlying distribution, then the transformed values should be independently and identically standard normal. Here, the unconditional Berkowitz test focuses on the overall shape of the distribution, whereas the conditional test evaluates the performance in the tails. Their 
                           p
                        -values are denoted as p.Bu and p.Bc, respectively.

The results in Table 7 show that GTL performs relatively well in the coverage ratio, compared to other distributions. When the tail region is 1% (i.e., 
                           p
                           =
                           0.01
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           0.99
                        ), VaR tests represented by p.uc and p.cc indicate that normal distribution does not fit GE data well for both left and right tails; SGE barely fits the right tail at the 5% significance level (i.e., 
                           p.uc
                           =
                           0.061
                        ). For the tail region of 5% (i.e., 
                           p
                           =
                           0.05
                         and 
                           p
                           =
                           0.95
                        ), VaR tests show that skewed-
                           t
                         and NIG do not fit the data on the left tail; while all distributions fit GE data well in the right tail. As for the ES tests, all three tests indicate that the normal distribution does not fit the data well in both right and left tails, regardless of the tail region. Of these three tests, p.Bc tends to find lower 
                           p
                        -values for various distributions. When the tail region is 1%, for the left tail of the GE data, normal and SGE do not fit and NIG barely fits the data at the 5% significance level; for the right tail of the GE data, GTL and SGE barely fit at 5% significance level. In the case of 5% tail region, none, except GTL, fits GE data well on the left; both normal and SGE do not fit the data on the right. Thus, for GE, based on these different evaluation measures, the overall performance of GTL is relatively most satisfactory.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The purpose of this paper is to show the added value of the GTL distribution in risk measurement. Since the GTL distribution is a flexible distribution, it can model thin- and thick-tailed data with an arbitrary degree of skewness. We consider five other distributions in a comparative study of simulated GTL data. The two more common distributions, normal and 
                        t
                     , are easy to estimate but have an important shortcoming: they are symmetric and thus exhibit large biases in computed VaR and ES measures whenever data are skewed and heavy tailed. Three other distributions, i.e., skewed-
                        t
                     , SGE and NIG, perform better, but they do produce biased VaR and ES, and the degree of bias varies between the long and short positions. In a reverse comparison, where we use other distributions in the data generating process and then fit the simulated data with GTL, we do find that GTL, though not as perfect as the correctly specified distribution, is an adequate competitor.

To test our model empirically, we use GE data in a volatility forecasting GARCH model and calculate the corresponding risk measurements. Test results indicate that the GTL distribution fits better than four other distributions (normal, skewed-
                        t
                     , NIG, and SGE).

Together, these results serve as a useful illustration, though it would be presumptuous to claim that the GTL distribution is superior to other distributions for all time series under all circumstances. Each time series has its own characteristics and may be fitted with one distribution more accurately than another, since each of these flexible distributions differs in its characteristics and its inference for risk management. We do claim that, for certain data sets, the GTL distribution is able to provide better risk measurements than other distributions. For those data sets, calculating the risk measurements by means of the GTL distribution is a prudent risk management strategy.
