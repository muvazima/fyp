                  Protein p7 of HCV is a 63 amino acid channel forming membrane protein essential for the progression of viral infection. With this momentousness, p7 emerges as an important target for antiviral therapy. A series of small molecule drugs, such as amantadine, rimantadine, amiloride, hexamethylene amiloride, NN-DNJ and BIT225 have been found to affect the channel activity. These compounds are docked against monomeric and hexameric structures of p7 taken at various time steps from a molecular dynamics simulation of the protein embedded in a hydrated lipid bilayer. The energetics of binding identifies the guanidine based ligands as the most potent ligands. The adamantanes and NN-DNJ show weaker binding energies. The lowest energy poses are those at the site of the loop region for the monomer and hexamer. For the latter, the poses show a tendency of the ligand to face the lumen of the pore. The mode of binding is that of a balance between hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation with backbone atoms of the protein.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Hepatitis C virus is a pathogen which infects liver cells and could lead to asymptomatic conditions in patients ((Poynard et al., 2003) and references therein). There is an evidence that exposure to HCV can be linked to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, the infection is treated with interferon/ribavirin which is not well tolerated by many patients. There is a series of novel small molecule drugs in the pipeline to improve future therapy (Sharma, 2010; Tong et al., 2012). These drugs are developed to target soluble proteins. Promising small molecule drugs are on its way targeting a membrane protein encoded by HCV, namely p7, a channel forming protein (Pavlović et al., 2003; Luscombe et al., 2010; Foster et al., 2011).

Viral channel forming proteins (VCPs) are found in a series of viruses (Fischer and Sansom, 2002; Gonzales and Carrasco, 2003; Wang et al., 2010; Nieva et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2012; OuYang and Chou, 2014). In some of the viruses, the VCP is non-essential for the survival of the virus, in others, however, including HCV, the VCP is essential. To date, known and applied antivirals targeting VCPs are amantadine and its derivative rimantadine (Hay et al., 1985) as well as guanidinium compounds (Luscombe et al., 2010), with other types of small molecules proposed (Foster et al., 2014).

HCV protein p7 is a 63 amino acids polytopic membrane protein with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which belongs to the class of VCPs. It is produced at the site of the ER as part of a polyprotein (Lin et al., 1994). Upon cleavage, p7 is separated from preceding structural and successive non-structural proteins of HCV. Its role as a VCP has been established by in vitro channel recording experiments using synthetic peptides corresponding to p7 (Pavlović et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2004) or protein expressed in and purified from bacterial vectors (Griffin et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2006). The consequence of p7 activity is identified to support viral assembly (Gentzsch et al., 2013). Channel recordings show that p7 is a weak cation specific channel which can be modulated by Ca-ions (Premkumar et al., 2004). Recently, its capability to conduct protons has been reported (Wozniak et al., 2010). Channel activity is found due to the oligomerization of the protein. Hexameric assemblies for selected strains are identified to be the prevalent form of the oligomeric protein using EM (Griffin et al., 2003; Luik et al., 2009) and NMR spectroscopy (OuYang et al., 2013) although a genotype specific heptamer is reported (Clarke et al., 2006). Structural features range from the formation of more or less parallelly aligned helical segments (Foster et al., 2014; Patargias et al., 2006; Cook and Opella, 2010; Montserret et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2013) to a more complex intercalation of three helical segments (OuYang et al., 2013).

Conductance measurements have shown that amantadine (Griffin et al., 2003), imino sugars like NN-DNJ (Pavlović et al., 2003; Pavlović et al., 2005) and guanidines such as hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) (Premkumar et al., 2004) and BIT225 (Luscombe et al., 2010) are potential candidates to block channel activity. The poses of the potential drugs have been investigated using NMR spectroscopy (Cook et al., 2013), biochemical methods (StGelais et al., 2009) and computational approaches on monomeric (Wang et al., 2013) as well as computational derived structural bundles models of p7 (Patargias et al., 2006; StGelais et al., 2009).

In this study, the poses of most of the known ligands affecting VCPs are used to probe their interaction with monomeric and hexameric p7 of genotype 1a. Protein flexibility is taken into account by docking the ligands to various structures taken from MD simulations at different time steps. This protocol allows screening energetic and structural features of ligand–p7 interaction supporting the drug development process.

The p7 protein sequence was taken from the HCV genotype 1a, H77 strain (Pavlović et al., 2003): ALENLVILNA10 ASLAGTHGLV20 SFLVFFCFAW30 YLKGRWVPGA40 VYAFYGMWPL50 LLLLLALPQR60 AYA.

The following ligands have been used for docking: N-[5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-naphtalene-2-carbonyl]-guanidine (BIT225) (Luscombe et al., 2010), N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) (Durantel et al., 2001), 1-amino-adamantane (AMA) and α-methyl-1-adamantane methylamine (RIM) (Hay et al., 1985), N-amino-3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine carboxamide (AMIL) (Benos, 1982) and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride (HMA) (Ewart et al., 2002).

The monomer and hexamer were taken from simulations reported earlier (Wang et al., 2013, 2014). In brief, each of the TMDs (TMD1–32, TMD236–63) was individually simulated in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer (POPC) for 50ns (Wang et al., 2013). Averaged structures over the backbone atoms of the 50ns MD simulations of each of the TMDs were derived by fitting the peptide structure of each time frame to the starting structure thereby removing rotational and translational motions. The program g_covar from the GROMACS-4.0.5 packages was used for the calculations. The monomer is formed by linking the assembled TMDs with a short loop (Lys-33, Gly-34, Arg-35) using the program Loopy (Xiang et al., 2002; Soto et al., 2008). The derived monomeric structure was embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. Hexameric bundles were generated with the monomer by creating symmetric copies of the monomeric subunit around a central pore axis (Krüger and Fischer, 2009; Hsu and Fischer, 2011). To sample the whole conformational space of the bundles each of the degrees of freedom were varied stepwise: (i) distance of the monomer to the central axis, (ii) rotational angle, and (iii) tilt. For each position, the side chains were linked to the backbone. The side chain conformation was chosen to be the most likely one for a given backbone conformation according to the MOE library. A short minimization (15 steps of steepest decent) followed the generation of the side chains. For each conformation, the potential energy was evaluated according to the all-atom AMBER94 force field mimicking a bilayer environment (ϵ
                        =2). The lowest energy conformer was then embedded into a fully hydrated POPC lipid bilayer.

Lipid bilayer patches were generated from 16:1-18:1 Diester PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glyucero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules on the basis of the parameters of Chandrasekhar et al. Chandrasekhar et al. (2003). The lipid patches were equilibrated for 50ns. MD simulations of the bundles/lipid/water system were carried out with GROMACS-4.5.4 using Gromos96 ffG45a3 force field. The p7 models were embedded into the POPC bilayer system and the overlapping lipid molecules were removed using the g_membed program from GROMACS-4.5.4.

The extracted structures from MD simulations were individually imported in to LeadIT V.2.1.2 (www.bioslveit.com) and docked with several compounds. The software generates fragments of the ligand and places them onto the target (Rarey et al., 1996). The scoring function of this software is based on free energy estimation taking hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions and lipophilic contact surfaces into account (Böhm, 1992, 1994). The CORINA software was implemented generating potential conformers of cyclic and acyclic molecules (Sadowski et al., 1992). In the latter case, conformers of an aliphatic chain were generated along the ‘principle of longest pathway’ (Sadowski and Gasteiger, 1993). The ligands of the compounds were generated in MOE 2011.10 and imported in LeadIT in their respective protonated state. The guanidine moiety was protonated in LeadIT.

The receptor files of the monomer structures were prepared by loading the extracted structures as protein files into LeadIT and defining the binding site as the whole protein by individual marking of all residues. The receptor files of the hexamer structures were also prepared by loading the extracted structures as protein files in to LeadIT and then separately defining four different binding sites or regions due to the great size of the hexamer structure. The loop region (LR) includes residues 25–45 of each monomer chain. The terminal region (TR) includes residues 1–13 and 50–63 of the N- and C-terminal sites. The pore region (PR) is covered by defining a sphere of a 20Å radius around Gly-18 (PR1), as well as around Thr-205 (PR2). The two amino acids were chosen as central points. The PR included screening of the membrane-exposed site of the TMDs.

The docking was done using the default settings as following. Docking strategy: enthalpy and entropy (hybrid approach); scoring: scaling accessed, same settings to all H-bond relevant contact types; full score contribution: 0.3; no score contribution: 0.7; stereo mode: no stereo modes considered; protein–ligand maximum allowed overlap volume: 2.9Å3; intra-ligand clash-factor: 0.6, hydrogen atoms considered; maximum number of solutions per iteration: 200; maximum number of solutions per fragmentation: 200.

The results were evaluated by tabulating the score values of the lowest energy pose of the compounds docked to the structures and using the 2D-docking-pose to tabulate the amino acids involved as well as their form of interaction. The average binding energies and standard deviation, as well as the average number of amino acids involved of all MD-simulation structures for each compound, were calculated for the monomer and the hexamer structure.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The monomer structure and a hexameric structure (Wang et al., 2013, 2014) are used for probing interaction of small molecule drugs (Fig. 1
                     ) with the protein. Individual structures at various time steps during the simulation are chosen to account for the dynamics of the protein in the docking approach. Structures taken every 10ns, starting with the structure at 0ns, are chosen for the monomer docking, and structures taken at 0ns, 10ns, 30ns, 50ns, 80ns, and 100ns for the hexamers (Fig. 2
                     A). The center for the docking is placed so that it covers (i) the loop region (LR), (ii) the pore region (PR1 and PR2) and (iii) the termini (TR) (Fig. 2B).

A common feature of all small molecules drugs investigated (here BIT225, AMIL and HMA in their protonated forms) is, that the minimum poses independent of the frames used for docking, are mostly at the site of the loop region (Fig. 3
                        ). Residues include the region Leu-32 to Gly-39.

In one case, BIT225, the prevalent docking occurred in the loop region (Leu-32, Gly-34, Arg-35, Trp-36) for the frames at 30ns as well as 140ns and 150ns which include side chain binding with Tyr-42 (Fig. 3A). Frames before that time show docking poses with sites towards the C terminal side of TMD1 via hydrophobic interactions (red bars) and only rarely with the backbone of the residues (black bars). Interactions with side chains (yellow bars) are identified for TMD2 (Met-47, Trp-48). The lowest energies of each of the poses of all the guanidinium ligands are independent of the frames used for docking (blue bars).

Besides interacting with the loop region, AMIL also docks to residues at the N terminal and C terminal sides of TMD1 and TMD2, respectively (Fig. 3B). The predominant interaction is via the backbone of the residues (black bars).

The almost exclusive interaction of NN-DNJ with residues of the loop region and adjacent residues of the TMDs at either side (Fig. 3C), are flanked with occasional (frames at 60 and 70ns) hydrophobic interactions with residues at the N terminal (Val-6–Leu-13) and C terminal side of TMD2 (Leu-53–Pro-58). The binding energies of the poses at the termini are most unfavorable compared to the other poses (underlying smallest blue bars). AMA (Fig. 3D), RIM (Fig. S1) and HMA (Fig. 3E) are following this picture. In addition to residues in the loop region they also interact with residues within TMD1 and TMD2. Two poses of AMA with structures at 70ns and 120ns (RIM at 60ns, 70ns, 130ns) are unfavorably compared to the other poses (underlying smallest blue bars) when interacting with amino acids at either termini. HMA interacts with more residues of TMD1 than of TMD2. Due to the similarity of the data for AMA and RIM, only the former is taken forward for docking with the hexamric bundle.

The sites of interactions are independent of the protonation state of the drugs BIT, AMIL, and HMA (unprotonated, data not shown).

All drugs mostly interact via hydrogen bonding with backbone carbonyls in the loop region but prefer hydrophobic interaction with residues in the TMDs.

For the docking experiment with the bundle, BIT225, AMIL and HMA are used in their protonated forms.

Restricting the docking to the loop region (LR) reveals the interaction of all small molecule drugs with residues flanking the basic loop region (Lys-33, Gly-34, Arg-35) at either side (Fig. 4
                        ). Binding in this region involves amino acids of two adjacent monomers, except for AMA. Strikingly, AMIL and BIT225 are not docked to the loop region anymore except in frame 0ns (Fig. 4A). NN-DNJ and AMA (Fig. 4C and D, respectively) still show a few interactions, as well as HMA (Fig. 4E). Data are independent of the protonation state of the guanidinium ligands (data not shown).

Docking in the pore regions (PR1 and PR2) shows a preference for interaction with residues of TMD1 and the N terminus over those of TMD2 and the C terminus (Fig. 4). The poses are mostly due to hydrophobic interactions. The site of His-17 is chosen by all small molecules, except AMA. In this region up to four monomers contribute to the docking poses interacting with Ser-12, Leu-13, His-17 and Ser-21.

Limiting the docking towards the N and C terminal sides (TR), shows that BIT225 (Fig. 4A), AMIL (Fig. 4B), NN-DNJ (Fig. 4C) and HMA (Fig. 4E) have contacts with the entire range of residues at either termini. At the other extreme, interaction of AMA is limited to the first three residues (Ala-1, Leu-2, Glu-3) and the last residues (Gln-59–Ala-63) (Fig. 4D). Binding to TR involves mostly a single monomer.

From visualization of the binding energies (blue bars, Figs. 3 and 4), there is a discrepancy seen between the energies for the poses in the LR and the PRs compared to the TR for AMA (blue bars). The values for NN-DNJ suggest lower values for LR compared to the other regions. The values of the other ligands, BIT225, AMIL and HMA do not show a large discrepancy. The largest bars, however, are identified for poses in LR.

Evaluation of the averaged energy values of the lowest docking poses over all frames of the monomer reveals that BIT225 shows the lowest energies of (−22.6±1.6)kcal/mol, followed by AMIL (−18.3±1.9)kcal/mol and HMA (−18.3±2.4)kcal/mol (Table 1
                            and Fig. 6). NN-DNJ (−6.7±3.3)kcal/mol, AMA (−5.4±1.3)kcal/mol and RIM (−5.1±1.3)kcal/mol show higher binding energies (Table 1 and Fig. 5
                           ). Good binding of BIT225 correlates with a large number of amino acids (5.9±0.9) involved in the binding, in combination with a low average number of backbone and side chain amino acids involved (1.6±1.0) (Table 1 and Fig. 6
                           ). AMIL and HMA show interaction with a similar number of amino acids, 5.5±1.2 and 5.4±1.2, respectively, but a higher number of backbone/side chain interactions of 3.6±0.9 and 3.0±1.0, respectively. NN-DNJ is the only ligand which exhibits a larger number of interactions with amino acids (6.3±1.0), but also interacts with a high number of backbone/side chains (3.7±1.0). AMA and RIM interact with 4.3±1.6 and 4.4±1.0 amino acids, respectively, and 2.0±0.4 and 1.8±0.5 number of backbones/side chains. Based on the lowest binding energy in combination with a high number of amino acid interaction but low number of backbone/side chain interaction, it is suggested that, the hydrophobic interactions are an important component of the interaction.

The structure at 0ns is seen as an open structure which could harbor the drugs within the pore. The docking energies of the poses of BIT225 (protonated) with the hexamer range from −28.8kcal/mol to −23.7kcal/mol (Table 1). The pose of LR is pointing into the lumen of the pore (Fig. 5) and shows the lowest binding energy of −28.8kcal/mol. The second best pose within the TMD region (−26.1kcal/mol, PR1) and the third best pose in the TR (−25.3kcal/mol) are all within the pore (Fig. 6). Also, for AMIL (−21.6kcal/mol), HMA (−25.3kcal/mol) and NN-DNJ (−11.1kcal/mol), the lowest energy poses are within LR. For AMA, the lowest energy pose is in TR (−11.8kcal/mol). The same pattern is also found for the unprotonated drugs.

Average lowest binding energies of the docking approach (independent of pose) with the hexamer over all frames and docking constraints follow the trend mentioned for the monomers. BIT225 exhibits the lowest energy values (−25.5±2.4)kcal/mol, followed by HMA (−22.8±3.5)kcal/mol and AMIL (−22.6±3.0)kcal/mol. AMA (−7.9±2.4)kcal/mol and NN-DNJ (−6.5±3.2)kcal/mol show much lower values. This trend is also observed if only the poses are considered in which the ligands are found within the lumen of the pore (Table 1 and Fig. 5).

The difference between the total number of amino acids involved in binding (e.g., BIT225: 6.8±2.2) and the number of backbone interaction together with side chain interactions (e.g., BIT225: 2.4±0.8) (Table 1 and Fig. 5) indicate that the difference in the binding energies is due to hydrophobic interaction. In this respect, BIT225 exhibits the largest number of hydrophobic residues with which it is interacting.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The bundle is built on a fully computational derived protocol (Krüger and Fischer, 2009; Hsu and Fischer, 2011). In this protocol, it is considered that the in vivo monomer is built prior to the in vivo bundle form (Patargias et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013). The overall structural features align with those proposed by NMR spectroscopic studies (Foster et al., 2014; Cook and Opella, 2010; Montserret et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2013). At this stage, the bundle presented in this study, represent plausible models which are used in computational modeling studies (Patargias et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013; Chandler et al., 2012).

Independent of the models used, monomer or hexamer, the lowest energy poses of the ligands are mostly in the loop region. Poses fully within the pore seem to be less favorable. The guanidinium based drugs BIT225, AMIL and HMA seem to bind best, with the first ligand ranking top. The mode of successful binding is to adopt a balanced interaction of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts.

A large part of NN-DNJ is capable to form hydrogen bonds with the target protein. It also has a large aliphatic chain. Overall this molecule has the largest number of rotatable bonds due to the aliphatic chain moiety. The docking algorithm places the aliphatic chain as much stretched as possible within hydrophobic pockets. Due to the overall performance of the algorithm with increasing number of rotatable bonds (Bursulaya et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) the docking result need to be seen with some caution. Comparative performance studies of different docking software, consider the overall rotatable bonds within the molecules, but do not specifically address the effect of those deriving from alkyl chain moieties (Chen et al., 2006).

HMA would be another candidate with a larger number of rotatable bonds. At this stage the good binding data match with experimental findings of HMA, being able to block channel activity of synthesized p7 (genotype 1a) reconstituted into lipid bilayers (Premkumar et al., 2004).

Amantadine has been found either to occlude the pore of the proton channel M2 of influenza A (Stouffer et al., 2008), whilst rimantadine has been observed at a membrane facing site of M2 between two helices at the level of the head groups (Schnell and Chou, 2008). In a more recent study amantadine is proposed to be located within a hydrophobic pocket of p7 obviously accessible from the outside of the bundle rather than the inside (OuYang et al., 2013). In this study, the bundle architecture adopts, possibly genotype specific, a structure different from structures derived from measurements with genotypes 1a and 1b p7 protein and from computational models based on genotype 1a. Thus, the site of mentioned can only be used with some caution for data evaluation at this stage.

Experimental results with other membrane protein such as the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) identify binding sites of respective drugs at the outerside of SERCA, e.g., thapsigargin (TG) (Obara et al., 2005), as well as within the TMDs, e.g. TG (Obara et al., 2005), cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (Takahashi et al., 2007), 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxybenzene (BHQ) (Obara et al., 2005). All position in common is, that they prefer sites at the level of the head group regions. Docking approaches, using the ‘empty’ protein for ‘re-docking’ the ligand, have been able to reproduce these binding of the drugs to these sites (Lape et al., 2010).

The docking programs aim to maximize the contacts between the ligand and the protein. In this respect within the pore would be a preferred site. In this study, the best binders identified at a pore-facing orientation on the level of the loops. The outer sides of the TMDs are considered in the docking approach but missing the embedment due to the surrounding lipids and their hydrophobic interactions. However, in the light of the scoring function used by the docking approach such a site, if preferred, should be detected (see also (Lape et al., 2010)). Such hydrophobic ‘outside pockets’ identified for M2 are reasonable sites for ligand binding. Experimental studies, like those reported for the adamantanes, would be essential to be done with NN-DNJ. From the structural point of view, TG is closer to NN-DNJ, with a hydrophilic head and a medium sized hydrophobic tail. Nevertheless, it is found at sites within and at the outsides of the TMD region of SERCA (Obara et al., 2005).

The suggested poses presented in this study are reasonable suggestions based on the program algorithm, using a fragment based approach, and fit into the overall performance of docking programs. It is up to the experimental studies to verify or falsify the poses.

AMA has been used in clinical trials, but results are not as expected (Deltenre et al., 2004), so that using it as mono therapy (Lim et al., 2005) may only be useful to transiently reduce viral load (Chan et al., 2002). It is the triple therapy with IFN/Rib/amantadine which leads to more promising results (Deltenre et al., 2004). RIM shows effect of lowering dye release from a liposome dye release assay (Foster et al., 2014). Blocking of the release of infectious viruses is stronger for NN-DNJ than for RIM (Foster et al., 2014). Resistance mutations having L20 changed into F indicate that RIM could be located at a membrane exposed binding pocket in a parallel aligned p7 model (Foster et al., 2011). In this study, AMA is not found to interact with this residue. NN-DNJ is proposed to bind between monomers based on a F25A polymorphism found in genotype 3a HCV (Foster et al., 2011).

In another study using p7 of genotype 1a in cell essays, it is reported that, AMA has no effect on neither RNA replication nor virus release as well as on infectivity of virus particles, in contrast to NN-DNJ (Steinmann et al., 2007a). In addition, channel recording data indicate that blocking of p7 was possible with an AMA concentration too high for application to cell cultures. In contrast, NN-DNJ blocked p7 channel in a concentration of 31μM.

In light of the reported datasets, the present study supports the finding of weak (Griffin et al., 2008) or very weak (Steinmann et al., 2007a) binding of AMA by the low binding energy reported in Fig. 5. NN-DNJ data may slightly be under estimated, but do not reach the low values of the other compounds.

BIT225 has been reported to show an antiviral activity when used against pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) which serves as an HCV surrogate model (Luscombe et al., 2010) since it harbors a p7 protein (Elbers et al., 1996). Channel blockage was reported when adding BIT225 to synthesized p7 (genotype 1a) reconstituted into lipid bilayers (Luscombe et al., 2010). The drug is now used in clinical trials.

There is an experimental evidence that AMA interacts with the terminal region of p7 (Cook et al., 2013), which could also include the leucine motif (Leu-50–Leu-55) (StGelais et al., 2009). Similarly, chemical shift differences in NMR data are also found at the C and N termini, when NN-DNJ is added (Cook et al., 2013). In an earlier in vitro study, the loop region has also been proposed for the binding of AMA (Griffin et al., 2004). HMA is found to bind towards the loop region (Cook et al., 2013). All these locations are in accord with respective computational data, in which the drugs are evaluated against the monomeric form of p7 (Wang et al., 2013). Strikingly, docking the respective drugs to the hexamer in this study supports the findings as well.

In this study, an in silico model is generated and relaxed using MD simulations (100ns) of the putative bundle embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer (Wang et al., 2014). Hydrophobic binding pockets which harbor some of the ligands, e.g., adamantanes, are not identified in the structures chosen for docking. If present in the structures, the docking software should have identified these pockets (e.g., Kim and Chong (2006)). At this stage it is concluded, that hydrophobic pockets should ‘close’ during the MD simulations. Simulations with hexameric p7 bundle reveal an increase in compactness of the bundle (Wang et al., 2014). In light of the mutations found in p7 of patients nonresponsive to amantadine (Foster et al., 2014), it needs to be considered that the site of a mutation could also be necessary in order to adjust protein dynamics in response to drug binding (Teague, 2003).

All studies, including this one, identify novel drug binding sites on best structural estimates. In this study, protein dynamics is taken care of by docking to a series of structures rather that to a single structure, a fact that has been newly considered.

The loop region has been found to harbor residues essential for the mechanism of function of p7 (Steinmann et al., 2007b). It is hypothesized that binding of the ligands in this regions disables important dynamics of the protein in the loop region.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Amongst the ligands tested, the guanidinium based drugs are bound to the putative structures of the monomer and hexameric form of p7 protein at the site of the loop with a trend to face the lumen of the pore. The mode of binding should be driven by balancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation with backbone atoms of the protein.
