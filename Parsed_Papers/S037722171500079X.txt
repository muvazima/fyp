                  In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive traffic control on single junctions with the three following objectives to be minimized: the total waiting time and the number of stops for private vehicles, and a public transport criterion. This problem being modeled as a multi-objective mixed integer linear program, we provide an interactive system based on an adaptive reference point approach. This system adapts, in real-time, priorities given to the different criteria according to the traffic situation. Formal guarantees are provided on the behavior of our system. A comparison with a standard semi-adaptive system on a simulated traffic shows that it provides significantly better solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The problem of traffic control at single junctions can be seen as the management of access to a specific space, the junction, by different types of users. These users cannot access simultaneously the junction for security reasons and the access rules are generally defined depending on the junction characteristics. The traffic light control problem we consider consists in finding in “real-time”, on a single junction, an appropriate plan of traffic lights states, according to several criteria, over a time horizon.

Traffic control has been well-studied for the last 50 years, and a lot of methods and systems were developed to handle this problem, with different levels of adaptability. Such systems can be classified into the following three categories. Non-adaptive systems aim at building signal planning for a fixed-time use, see e.g. Cantarella and Improta (1984); 1988); Webster (1958); Wong and Wong (2003) for single-objective systems and Reljic (1996); Robertson (1969); Wong (1997) for systems with several criteria. Semi-adaptive systems aim at partially adapting an initial signal timing to the traffic situation, without being able to change it radically in real-time, see e.g. Dotoli, Fanti, and Meloni (2006); Lowrie (1982); Wey (2000) for single-objective systems and Bretherton (2007); Bretherton and Browen (1990); Garcia-Nieto, Olivera, and Alba (2013); Head and Mirchandani (2001); Kachroudi and Bhouri (2009); Li, Yu, Tao, and Chen (2013); Schöcker, Ahuja, and Bell (2008) for systems with several criteria. Finally, adaptive systems are able to totally adapt the signal timing to the traffic situation, see e.g. Boillot, Midenet, and Pierrelée (2006); Boumghar (2000); Cai, Wong, and Heydecker (2009); Farges, Henry, and Tuffal (1983) for single-objective systems and Coll, Factorovich, Loiseau, and Gómez (2013); Khamis and Gomaa (2014); Li, Canepa, and Claudel (2014) for multi-objective ones. Systems belonging to the second and third categories are generally real-time systems, since they rely on information about the traffic situation provided regularly by some sensors. The system we developed belongs to the third category.

Most real-time urban traffic control strategies were developed to minimize a single objective (the total waiting time of private vehicles) or a simpleweighted sum of several objectives, where the weights are fixed a priori. Our approach does not use such an a priori aggregation, but aims at adapting the traffic control policy to the current traffic situation. This is achieved by adjusting the priorities given to the criteria depending on the traffic situation.

The considered criteria are the total waiting time (WT) and the total number of stops (NS) for private vehicles, and the total “error on requested waiting times” (ERB) for public transport vehicles (buses), where the term “total” means a sum over all vehicles. These three criteria reflect three important issues in traffic control: traffic fluidity, environmental aspects, and development of public transport. Criterion WT is a standard measure of traffic fluidity. Environmental aspects focusing on the reduction of pollutant emissions depend on criterion WT but also on criterion NS. Defining this second criterion is thus a way of emphasizing environmental aspects. Criterion ERB, which measures the respect of time schedules, favors the use and development of public transport.

Every criterion is to be minimized, and is taken into account in a multi-objective mixed integer linear program embedded in an interactive real-time and adaptive multi-objective system based on a reference point approach. This procedure adapts the traffic control policy depending on the current traffic situation.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a general description of the problem and a comparison of different mixed integer linear program (MILP) that we experimented. Section 3 focuses on the interactive procedure, and shows that it satisfies some desirable formal properties. Experimental results illustrating the adaptive capacities of the system are reported in Section 4. Conclusions and perspectives are provided in a final section.

The traffic control problem we are interested in takes place at a given junction. It can be described as follows: every fixed time step, we want to find the best possible traffic light switchover planning over a given horizon, according to the three criteria previously defined and a measure of the ‘traffic situation’. The traffic situation provides a set of indicators used to adapt in real time the relative importance of the criteria. This defines an evolutive traffic control policy. The way of adapting a traffic control, depending on the traffic situation, is controlled by rules, called policy evolution rules, that will be defined formally in Section 3.1.

We call section a lane related to a traffic light (it could be directional). We suppose that we are able to know, at any time, every queue length and arrival flows of private vehicles on every section, every previous traffic lights switchover dates, and every bus position. The project related to this research commonly uses video based measurements like queue lengths, spatial occupancies etc. This is the reason why we consider in this paper that this information is available. Nevertheless, if no camera is available on an intersection, it is possible to estimate approximately this information from loop detectors as, e.g., in the PRODYN traffic control system Farges et al. (1983).

Regarding buses, the knowledge of the bus positions makes it possible to calculate every eventual bus arrival date on the junction during the time horizon. Moreover, we suppose that the bus company indicates, for each bus, a reference date at which it should cross the junction. Criterion ERB is then defined as the sum, over the approaching buses, of the absolute difference between the reference date and the actual crossing date of the junction for each bus.

Finally we consider only red and green states as decision variables, with given fixed minimum and maximum red and green durations. Amber state has usually a fixed duration, and can be included just before the end of optimal green periods of every traffic light. We consider as given and fixed the set of all antagonist pairs of traffic lights. Two traffic lights are considered as antagonist if they cannot be in a green state at the same moment.

Note that no traffic light switchover order is supposed a priori, which classifies our proposed system as an adaptive system. Moreover, it is a real-time system. Once the best planning is computed, only the part corresponding to the first next time step is sent to the controller to be implemented. During this time step we compute the best next planning according to the new traffic situation, and so on. Each such step is called an iteration, and corresponds to an iteration of a multi-objective interactive optimization procedure.

At every iteration we need to solve a multiobjective MILP in order to find the best planning. Different MILP models, which are described in Section 2.3, have been experimented and compared. One of these, called the ‘hybrid model’, has been selected for reasons explained in Section 2.3.

In order to take into account the three criteria and a traffic control policy, the MILP uses, as an objective function, a parametrized aggregation function, based on a reference point approach and called achievement function (see Gardiner and Vanderpooten (1997); Vanderpooten (1989); Vanderpooten and Vincke (1985), or Section 3.2 for more details). We use the following standard achievement function to be minimized:

                         are preference parameters indicating the values to be achieved on the respective criteria.

Optimizing this function guarantees to return an efficient solution (i.e. efficient planning) at every iteration. An efficient solution is a solution that cannot be improved on one criterion without deteriorating at least another criterion value.

This function is used iteratively, by varying the preference parameters, within an interactive procedure. Unlike in standard interactive procedures, preference parameters are not defined by a decision maker, but by the policy evolution rules depending on the traffic situation.


                        Fig. 1
                         summarizes the general structure of the system including the interactive procedure.

Three alternative MILP models were developed and tested, which are precisely described in Dujardin (2013); Dujardin, Boillot, Vanderpooten, and Vinant (2011). Each model is based on a macroscopic modeling for the private vehicles and on a microscopic modeling for the public transport part.

The first one, called “state model” consists in associating a binary variable to every traffic light and every discretized moment of the time horizon. These variables indicate the red or green state of the corresponding traffic lights. This type of model is well-known in scheduling theory and called ”discrete time model” (see Floudas and Lin (2005), Section 1.2).

The second one, called “date model”, consists in associating a continuous variable to every traffic light and every switchover dates occurring during the time horizon. This type of model is called ”event based model” in scheduling theory (see Floudas and Lin (2005), Section 1.3).

The goal of this section is not to give a precise mathematical description of these two models but to give their main features and the reasons why a third ”hybrid” model was relevant to consider given their natural complementarity, in term of number of variables and linearity.

In both cases two types of constraints have to be taken into account: antagonisms between certain pairs of traffic lights and minimum and maximum red and green duration.

The number of required binary variables to represent the constraints may vary significantly depending on the model and the type of constraints (see Table 1
                        ). The number of binary variables is a critical indicator of a MILP “complexity”, in the sense that usually the solution time depends highly on this number.

The way of modeling each criterion may also vary significantly depending on the model (see Table 2
                        ). The resulting effort to obtain a linear formulation also gives indirectly a hint on the “complexity” of each model.

The italics in Tables 1 and 2 indicate the most interesting formulations.

A third model was developed and was called “hybrid model” since it uses simultaneously the two types of main variables, traffic lights states at every time unit and traffic lights switchover dates. The hybrid model can therefore use the most interesting formulation for every constraint and criterion – corresponding to the italics in Tables 1 and 2.

The three models have been compared so as to select the one which would perform better within the interactive procedure. For this purpose, we experimented the three models on the junction described in Section 4.1 (see Fig. 2
                        ) using 486 instances generated by varying independently:

                           
                              •
                              The total time limit imposed to the solver to optimize.

The type of traffic, depending on arrival flows: fluid, dense or asymmetric. Asymmetric traffic occurs when arrival flows can be significantly different depending on the section.

The buses presence: either no bus is planned or conflicting buses from different sections are planned.

The traffic control policy: it basically changes the chosen compromise between the different criteria, and thus the objective function.


                        Table 3
                         gives the average value of the achievement function when optimized with an MILP solver (we used CPLEX, version 12.2, on a computer with an Intel Core 2 duo CPU 1.8 GHz, 2 Go RAM). Since the achievement function is to be minimized, the smaller the value, the better the performance. Moreover, small optimization limits are particularly important since the system is to be used in real time.

The hybrid model clearly outperforms the two other models. It has been thus chosen to be the MILP model used iteratively in our interactive system.

This section describes the proposed interactive procedure, which is guided by policy evolution rules taking into account the traffic situation in real-time, in order to adapt priorities given to the criteria.

The definition of a traffic control policy first requires to be able to assess the current traffic situation at any time. This assessment could be made through the criterion values of the current solution. However, traffic managers often resort to the two following indicators to assess the traffic situation.


                        Arrival rate. If we denote by L the set of the traffic lights of the junction, we suppose that for every l ∈ L we know an upper bound 
                           
                              Q
                              
                                 A

                                 max
                              
                           
                         of traffic flow on the section corresponding to l. Then, for every moment t, the arrival rate τA
                        (t) is defined as:

                        (t′) is the arrival flow given by the sensor at moment t′ on the section corresponding to the traffic light l, and Δt
                        0 > 0 is an arbitrary duration. Calculation of the rate takes into account past information so as to reduce the impact of isolated fluctuations.


                        Queue spillbacks. For a given section of the junction, we say that there is a queue spillback on this section, at a given moment, if the queue length on this section exceeds the section length on average during a certain time.

The policy evolution rules, based on these two indicators, can be designed according to the three following general principles:

                           
                              1.
                              When the traffic situation is dense or with queue spillbacks (situation denoted by S
                                 WT), the minimization of the criterion WT is highly desirable, particularly not to let the situation lead to a blockade of the junction, which finally would impact negatively every criterion.

When the traffic situation is flowing without any queue spillback (situation denoted by 
                                    
                                       
                                          S

                                       ¯
                                    
                                 ), priority is given to the criterion reflecting an environmental preoccupation NS and the criterion for public transport ERB.

In intermediate traffic situations, the three criteria are considered with an emphasis on criterion WT when the traffic becomes dense, and on criteria NS and ERB when the traffic becomes flowing.

A well-known family of aggregation function making use of reference points has been introduced in Wierzbicki (1986); 1980). Among these, we consider the standard augmented achievement function (already briefly introduced in Section 2.2).

The weighting vector λ is chosen such that

                        *.

In our specific context, (P) corresponds to the hybrid model described in Section 2.3, with p = 3, z
                        1 = WT, z
                        2 = NS and z
                        3 = ERB.

Policy evolution rules aim at defining, at each iteration, the reference point 
                           
                              z
                              ¯
                           
                         according to the current traffic situation. These rules implement the three principles given at the end of Section 3.1.

For this purpose, we need first to define two RPs corresponding to the extreme situations S
                        WT and 
                           
                              
                                 S
                                 WT
                              
                              ¯
                           
                        . A natural way to do this is to consider that:

Observe that, at each iteration, the set of feasible solutions is modified due to the evolution of the traffic. Therefore the ideal and anti-ideal points may also evolve. In order to avoid recomputing these points at each iteration, we consider respectively as points m and M, the ideal point when the instance is the most favorable and the anti-ideal point when the instance is the less favorable, based on a history. This way, points m and M correspond to reasonable lower and upper bounds on the criterion values.

A first type of requirement refers to the ability of the aggregation function to investigate the set of non-dominated points Wierzbicki (1986). More precisely, we wish to prove that:

The second type of requirement refers to the consistency between the evolution of the reference point and the evolution of the returned solution. Consider the general case with p criteria, where criterion 1 plays the role of criterion WS and the p − 1 other criteria play the same role as criteria NS and ERB. The extreme RPs are then

                                          1, implies that the new solution is at least as good as the current solution on criterion 1

Different scenarios of traffic evolution have been simulated in order to test the model in real-time during 1 hour, on the junction J presented in Fig. 2. Moreover, the results of our system have been compared to results obtained by using a real-time semi-adaptive system.


                        Fig. 2 describes the possible movements of vehicles crossing the junction allowed by traffic lights, numbered from 1 to 5. A traffic light can control one movement (dashed lines) or several movements (solid lines), but one movement can have only one origin and therefore only one related traffic light. Therefore, we can deduce immediately antagonist traffic lights from antagonist movements. The corresponding traffic light antagonisms are given by the graph in Fig. 3
                        , where each vertex corresponds to a traffic light, and two vertices are linked by an edge if and only if they are antagonist. Traffic lights that can be set to green simultaneously correspond to an independent subset of vertices of this graph.

Arrival flows evolution directly depends on the scenario and will be given for every scenario (Section 4.1.2).

At this step a very simple traffic simulation has been chosen: queue lengths are generated each second using the queue lengths of the previous iteration, the current arrival flows, the departure flows – chosen constant for the experiments –, and the current traffic light states provided by the optimization model. This last fact creates a loop between the simulation and the optimization model, as introduced in Fig. 1. Moreover, the resulting queue length values are slightly disturbed, using a multiplicative random factor corresponding to a normal distribution of mean 1 and standard deviation

                               so as to introduce a small noise. The goal of this noise is to reproduce the unpredictability of queue lengths in the real case.

Groups of three buses arrivals are simulated several times during the experiments. Buses arrival dates have been chosen such that several conflicting buses are involved simultaneously, every 15 minutes. Interaction with private vehicles is taken into account: at each iteration, simulated buses stop at the back of the current queue length of private vehicles on the bus section, and not at the traffic light stop line of the section. This interaction is also taken into account in the optimization model itself.

The policy evolution rules are those defined in Section 3.3. Queue spillbacks are considered in the first scenario.

Duration parameters are as follows, for every scenario: 10 seconds for the minimum green duration, 20 seconds for the maximum green duration and for the minimum red duration, and 50 seconds for the maximum red duration. The minimum duration between two antagonist traffic lights is 5 seconds. These are typical values for such a junction.

As in the comparison part between the three MILP models, we used the MILP solver CPLEX, version 12.2, on a computer with an Intel Core 2 duo CPU 1.8 GHz, 2 Go RAM. CPLEX was parametrized so as to stop optimization when a 5 percent gap between the upper bound and the lower bound of the optimal value is reached or when a time limit of 10 seconds is reached (these 10 seconds include overhead tasks).

We used “re-optimization” parameters of CPLEX to enable using the last obtained solution to determine the current solution, since, in general, two successive solutions do not differ radically.

In this section, we describe two tested scenarios.

This scenario is designed so as to represent a “real” situation, where the adaptive capacities of each system are potentially going to be used. To do this, we simulate arrival flows which are strongly variable and asymmetric. Moreover, these flows are relatively high on average. This leads to include moments when the junction is saturated.

Scenario 1 represents a period of the day where:

                                 
                                    •
                                    Vehicles arrivals, on Sections 1 and 2 are more important at the end of the simulation than at the beginning. This can be due, for example, to progressive return of users from work to home.

For some reasons, an event leads an important group of users to cross the junction J from south-east to west, and after some time, to go back to the opposite direction. First they take Sections 1 and 3. Then, for returning, they take Sections 4 and 5.

Flows evolution is represented in Fig. 4
                              .

Moreover queue spillbacks are taken into account as follows: if a queue length reaches a certain threshold, a queue spillback is declared. Queue spillbacks thresholds are the same for every section. In order to avoid too strong oscillations of the policy, the end of a (declared) queue spillback is declared only if the queue decreases under 90 percent of the threshold. The queue spillbacks are taken into account according to the policy evolution rules presented in Section 3.3.

Scenario 2 is a variant of Scenario 1 in which “returns” on Sections 4 and 5 occur earlier (see Fig. 5
                              ).

The purpose of this scenario is to observe the adaptation capacity of the two systems when faced with a quickly evolving traffic situation.

We compare for every scenario, results provided by our system, called system S from now on, and results provided by a semi-adaptive system S′. Both systems are compared under the same conditions (static constraints related to red and green durations, policy evolution rules).

System S′ is a phase-based system using the same heuristic as the well known SCOOT system Bretherton and Browen (1990). A phase corresponds to a maximal subset of mutually non-antagonist traffic lights set to green. A timing plan is a sequence of phases and their respective durations where each traffic light must be set to green a least once. For system S′, an initial traffic lights timing plan is computed off-line taking into account the structure of the junction and the average simulated arrival flows on each section. Then, at each iteration, system S′ tests the possibilities of keeping the duration of the current phase, or increasing or decreasing the duration by one second, up to + 4 or − 4 seconds respectively, while respecting the minimum and maximum green and red durations. The duration of the other phases is set to their last modified values. Among all (up to 9) resulting plans, the one optimizing function 
                              
                                 h

                                    ,
                                    λ
                                 
                              
                            is selected.

Given these relatively simple computations, system S′ is able to perform an optimization at every second. System S, which requires solving a MILP, performs an optimization every δ seconds. In our experiments, we set δ = 10 seconds in order to enable the solver to provide rather good solutions. Since iterations of system S are less frequent than the iterations of system S′, results are compared over δ seconds: in order to have comparable criterion values, the values provided by S are compared with the sum of the values provided by S′ during the corresponding δ seconds where S is performing optimization. To simplify, we will consider from now on that S′ provides criterion values each δ seconds too. It should be observed, however, that S′ is able to “adapt” at every second rather than at every δ seconds, taking into account new external information more frequently than system S, which should favor S′.

For every scenario and for every iteration we measure:

                                 The value of every “re-computed” criterion. That is we do not compare the criterion values as modeled and returned by the compared systems but the criterion values implied by decisions proposed by each system.

The computing time for system S. The limit imposed to our system to make every operations is δ = 10 seconds. No computing time for system S′ will be provided since the underlying heuristic is always very fast.

Policy indicators: we report the existence of queue spillbacks.

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we compare and analyze the different results obtained with our system S and system S′, respecting the presented methodology (Section 4.1).

We compare in this section results from system S and system S′ for scenario 1 taking into account queue spillbacks.

As we can see in Fig. 9, from iteration 185 for system S and iteration 175 for system S′, there are queue spillbacks, which imply a policy change favoring WT criterion minimization.

In Fig. 6
                              , the influence of this focus on the WT criterion of system S is directly observable. It appears clearly that system S′ is unable to adapt, and performances on criterion WT worsen, whereas system S succeeds in stabilizing the total waiting time.

System S is almost always better than system S′ for the NS criterion (see Fig. 7
                              ).

System S is always significantly better than system S′ for this criterion (see Fig. 8
                              
                              ).


                              Fig. 9 represents the evolution of the coefficient τA
                               which determines the current traffic control policy. This coefficient is equal to 1 if there is one or more queue spillbacks.

For system S′, at least one queue spillback is declared from iteration 175. Since the system does not succeed in decreasing queue lengths enough, even with a policy favoring WT minimization, the policy is blocked in the same state until the end. Conversely, system S declares the presence of several queue spillbacks which are all rapidly eliminated. For example, at iteration 185, the presence of a queue spillback is declared, which is eliminated only 5 iterations later.

Average computation time for system S is 2.39 seconds. Computing times of the different iterations are very variable (see Fig. 10
                              ), but they decrease rapidly on average during the 50 first iterations, because of the re-optimization.


                              Table 4
                               provides average criterion values for each system, and relative gaps in percentage. Moreover, in 68.33 percent of the iterations, system S provides a solution dominating the solution provided by system S′ on all criteria.

In this section we compare system S and system S′ on scenario 2. Queue spillbacks, which were detrimental to system S′ in scenario 1, are ignored here.

System S is better most of the time for this criterion (see Fig. 11
                              ).

System S is at least as good as system S′ during almost the entire duration of the simulation (see Fig. 12
                              ).

System S is significantly better than system S′ for ERB criterion (see Fig. 13
                              ).

Average computation time is 2.23 seconds.


                              Table 4 provides average criterion values for each system, and relative gaps in percentage. Moreover, in 66.66 percent of the iterations, system S provides a solution dominating the solution provided by system S′ on all criteria Table 5
                              .

We saw on this section that system S performs better in several respects than the phase-based system S′. First, system S adapts well to the traffic situation whatever the evolution of the arrivals. Second, even if system S′ gets information about this evolution very regularly, system S provides significantly better solutions which are even dominating for most iterations. This establishes clearly that system S is much more flexible than system S′.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have presented a multi-objective optimization interactive procedure which is able to take into account the traffic situation by modifying iteratively a traffic control policy, based on an adaptive optimization system. Three objectives have been taken into account: total waiting time and the number of stops of private vehicles (WT and NS), and the total “error on requested waiting times” ERB for public transport vehicles, while current systems generally use only one criterion or a simple weighted sum of criteria.

Moreover, a real-time use of the system has been presented in which the system has been compared to another multi-objective one using the same interactive procedure but whose optimization is based on semi-adaptive optimization principles. Experimental results show that our system provides better, and most of the time, dominating solutions.

Several extensions could be analyzed.

The presented interactive procedure considers two extreme situations to define the domain within which the reference point can move. A natural extension could be to consider more than two such extreme points. Proving consistency between the evolution of the reference point and the evolution of the returned point could also become more difficult.

The system proposed in this paper has been designed in order to optimize a single junction. It would be interesting to adapt the system to a network of several junctions in order to perform a global optimization. Such an extension would probably require additional linearizations, because the expression of the queue lengths would become quadratic. Decomposing the problem between low level optimizations for the junctions, where our system could be used, and high level optimization for the network, coordinating the results of low level optimizations would be an alternative approach.

Finally, another possible perspective is to consider a fourth criterion reflecting the pedestrians viewpoint. This raises, however, specific modeling issues. Superficially, each flow of pedestrians could be considered as a new section of the junction with its own antagonisms. Observe first that these antagonisms are sometimes not strict, e.g. between vehicles turning right and pedestrians. Above all, unlike vehicle flows, the evolution of pedestrian flows is more versatile. In particular, part of these flows can derive from one originally intended crossing to another one or to no crossing at all.
