                  As shortest path (SP) problem has been one of the most fundamental network optimization problems for a long time, technologies for this problem are still being studied. In this paper, a new method by integrating a path finding mathematical model, inspired by Physarum polycephalum, with extracted one heuristic rule to solve SP problem has been proposed, which is called Rapid Physarum Algorithm (RPA). Simulation experiments have been carried out on three different network topologies with varying number of nodes. It is noted that the proposed RPA can find the optimal path as the path finding model does for most networks. What is more, experimental results show that the performance of RPA surpasses the path finding model on both iterations and solution time.
