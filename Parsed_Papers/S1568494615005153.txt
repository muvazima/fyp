               Abstract
               
                  In this study, a multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem is investigated, in which decision makers provide their preferences over alternatives by using linguistic 2-tuple. In the process of decision making, we introduce the idea of a specific structure in the attribute set. We assume that attributes are partitioned into several classes and members of intra-partition are interrelated while no interrelationship exists among inter partition. We emphasize the importance of having an aggregation operator, to capture the expressed inter-relationship structure among the attributes, which we will refer to as partition Bonferroni mean (PBM). We also investigate the behavior of the proposed PBM operator. Further to aggregate the given linguistic information to get overall performance value of each alternative in MAGDM, we analyze PBM operator in linguistic 2-tuple environment and develop three new linguistic aggregation operators: 2-tuple linguistic PBM (2TLPBM), weighted 2-tuple linguistic PBM (W2TLPBM) and linguistic weighted 2-tuple linguistic PBM (LW-2TLPBM). Based on the idea that total linguistic deviation between individual decision maker's opinions and group opinion should be minimized, we develop an approach to determine weight of the decision makers. Finally, a practical example is presented to illustrate the proposed method and comparison analysis demonstrates applicability of the proposed method.
