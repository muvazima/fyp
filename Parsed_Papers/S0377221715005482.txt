                  This paper discusses univariate density estimation in situations when the sample (hard information) is supplemented by “soft” information about the random phenomenon. These situations arise broadly in operations research and management science where practical and computational reasons severely limit the sample size, but problem structure and past experiences could be brought in. In particular, density estimation is needed for generation of input densities to simulation and stochastic optimization models, in analysis of simulation output, and when instantiating probability models. We adopt a constrained maximum likelihood estimator that incorporates any, possibly random, soft information through an arbitrary collection of constraints. We illustrate the breadth of possibilities by discussing soft information about shape, support, continuity, smoothness, slope, location of modes, symmetry, density values, neighborhood of known density, moments, and distribution functions. The maximization takes place over spaces of extended real-valued semicontinuous functions and therefore allows us to consider essentially any conceivable density as well as convenient exponential transformations. The infinite dimensionality of the optimization problem is overcome by approximating splines tailored to these spaces. To facilitate the treatment of small samples, the construction of these splines is decoupled from the sample. We discuss existence and uniqueness of the estimator, examine consistency under increasing hard and soft information, and give rates of convergence. Numerical examples illustrate the value of soft information, the ability to generate a family of diverse densities, and the effect of misspecification of soft information.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is recognized that statistical estimates can be improved greatly by including contextual information to supplement the information derived from data. We refer to the contextual information as soft information, in contrast to hard information derived from observations (data). In this paper, we consider univariate probability density estimation exploiting, in concert, hard and soft information. Although our development, theoretical and numerical, makes no distinction based on sample size, not surprisingly, it is when the sample size is small that this fusion of hard and soft information plays a crucial role in producing quality estimates. We limit the scope to densities of random variables with distributions that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on a bounded interval.

The need for estimating probability density functions is prevalent across operations research and management science. For example, an essential step in simulation analysis and stochastic optimization is the generation of probability densities for input random variables; see for example Barton, Nelson, and Xie (2010); Chick (2001); Freimer and Schruben (2002). Density estimation is also needed when populating probability models and when analyzing simulation output beyond their typical first and second moments. In all these situations, however, the sample available is typically extremely small due to practical and computational limitations. One is usually forced to restrict the attention to parametric families of densities. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of an alternative approach that brings in soft information about problem structure and past experiences to obtain reasonable nonparametric density estimates even for very small sample sizes. The approach has been successfully applied in the context of simulation output analysis Singham, Royset, and Wets (2013), uncertainty quantification Royset, Sukumar, and Wets (2013), as well as estimation of errors in forecasts for commodity prices Wets and Rios (Under review) and electricity demand Feng, Gade, Ryan, Watson, Wets, and Woodruff (2013); see also Rios, Wets, and Woodruff (Under review).

A natural and widely studied approach to density estimation is to adopt an M-estimator with additional constraints to account for soft information. We continue this tradition by defining an estimator that is an optimal solution of a constrained maximum likelihood problem. An appealing property of such estimators is that for any sample size, an estimate is the best possible within the class of allowable functions according to the given criterion (likelihood).

We trace the consideration of soft information in terms of shape constraints at least back to Grenander (1956a), 1956b). More recent studies of univariate log-concave densities include Balabdaoui, Rufiback, and Wellner (2009); Dumbgen and Rufibach (2009); Groenenboom and Wellner (1992); Jongbloed (1998); Pal, Woodroofe, and Meyer (2007); Walther (2002), with computational comparisons in Rufiback (2007); see also the review Walther (2009) and, in the case of multivariate densities, e.g., Cule, Samworth, and Stewart (2010a), 2010b). Convexity and monotonicity restrictions are examined in Groenenboom, Jongbloed, and Wellner (2001); Meyer (2012b) and monotonicity, monotonicity and convexity, U-shape, as well as unimodality with known mode are studied in Meyer (2012b); Meyer and Habtzghib (2011). Unimodal functions are also covered in Hall and Kang (2005); Reboul (2005), with the former covering U-shape as well. Monotone, convex, and log-concave densities are dealt with in Birke (2009). Studies of k-monotone densities include Balabdaoui and Wellner (2007), 2010); Gao and Wellner (2009). Densities given as monotone transformations of convex functions are examined in Seregin and Wellner (2010). Convex formulation of a collection of shape restrictions is discussed in Papp (2011); Papp and Alizadeh (2014). We refer to the recent dissertation Doss (2013) and the discussion in Cule, Samworth, and Stewart (2010b) for a more comprehensive review and to Lim and Glynn (2012) for the related context of shape-restricted regression.

Although these studies address important cases, there is no overarching framework that allows for a comprehensive description of soft information formulated by a large variety of constraints. Initial work in this direction is found in Wang (1996), which deals with parametric nonlinear least-squares regression subject to a finite number of smooth equality and inequality constraints. That paper examines the asymptotics of the least-squares estimator using the convergence theory of constrained optimization, specifically epi-convergence. In the context of constrained maximum likelihood estimation, Dong and Wets (2007) establishes consistency of an estimator through a functional law of large numbers and epi-convergence. The latter work is an immediate forerunner to the present paper.

Having adopted a nonparametric constrained maximum likelihood framework, we face technical challenges along two axes. First, one needs to deal with constrained optimization problems. Of course, in principle, constraints can be handled through penalties and regularizations; see for example Good and Gaskin (1971); Klonias (1982); Leonard (1978); de Montricher, Tapia, and Thompson (1975); Silverman (1982); Thompson and Tapia (1990) and more recently Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011); Eggermont and LaRiccia (2001); Koenker and Mizera (2006), 2008), 2010); Meyer (2012a); Turlach (2005). However, the equivalence and interpretations of such reformulations depends on the successful selection of multipliers and penalty parameters which is far from trivial in practice, especially in the case of multiple constraints. In fact, poor selection of these multipliers and parameters may cause computational challenges due to ill-conditioning of the resulting optimization problem as well as significant deterioration of the quality of the resulting density estimate. Moreover, it becomes unclear in what sense, if any, an estimator is “best” when an otherwise natural criterion such as likelihood is mixed with nonzero penalty terms; see Dong and Wets (2007) for further discussion. It is also possible to devise specialized algorithms such as the iterative convex minorant algorithm Groenenboom and Wellner (1992); Jongbloed (1998) to account for certain constraints or modify “unconstrained” estimators such as those based on kernels; Hall and Kang (2005) handles unimodality, Birke (2009) considers monotonicity, convexity, and log-concavity, and Davies and Kovac (2004) aims to reduce the number of modes; see Racine (2015); Wolters (2012) for computational tools. Again, it is unclear in what sense, if any, such estimates are “best” in the case of finite samples. Moreover, it is challenging to generalize these approaches to handle other types of soft information. We direct the reader to Tsybakov (2009) and references therein for treatments of kernel estimators including a discussion of optimality.

The second challenge with a nonparametric constrained maximum likelihood framework is the infinite-dimensionality of the resulting optimization problem. Naturally, there is a computational need to consider families of approximating densities characterized by a finite number of parameters. The method of sieves Chen (2007); Geman and Hwang (1982); Grenander (1981) provides a framework for constructing, typically, finite-dimensional approximating subsets that are gradually refined as the sample size grows and that in the limit is dense in a function space of interest. However, difficulties arise from three directions. First, with our focus on small sample sizes, the linkage between sample size and sieves becomes untenable. Second, in order to allow for the possibility of discontinuous densities and exponential transformations, we choose as underlying space the extended real-valued lower or upper semicontinous functions, but neither is a linear space. Consequently, the mathematically inbred tendency to obtain a finite-dimensional approximation by relying on a well-chosen finite basis is problematic; see for example Delecroix and Thomas-Agnan (2000); Meyer (2012a) for such an approach based on splines. Third, despite progress towards handling shape restrictions on sieves (see for example Dechevsky and Penev (1997); DeVore (1977a), 1977b); Papp (2011); Papp and Alizadeh (2014)), there is no straightforward way of handling a comprehensive set of soft information.

In this paper, as in Dong and Wets (2007), we consider an arbitrarily constrained maximum likelihood estimator for densities. We appear to be the first to consider such general constraints (soft information) in the context of nonparametric density estimation. The soft information might even be random, i.e., the soft information may not be known a priori but is realized with the sample. We give concrete formulations of the constrained maximum likelihood problem in the case of soft information about support bounds, semicontinuity, continuity, smoothness, slope information and related quantities, monotonicity, log-concavity, unimodality, location of modes, symmetry, bounds on density values, neighborhood of known density, bounds on moments, and bounds on cumulative distribution functions. We allow for any combination of these, and essentially any other constraint too.

We overcome the technical difficulty caused by constraints through the theory of constrained optimization, specifically epi-convergence, and therefore avoid tuning parameters related to penalties and regularization. With the exception of the preliminary work Dong and Wets (2007), this paper is the first to utilize epi-convergence to analyze constrained density estimators. We overcome the difficulty of infinite dimensionality through the use of a new class of splines, epi-splines Royset and Wets (2014), which are highly flexible, allow for discontinuities, and enable convenient exponential transformations. Here, for the first time, the theoretical foundations for using epi-splines in density estimation are laid out. In contrast to sieves, epi-splines can be constructed independently of the sample and therefore handles small sample sizes naturally. The precursor Dong and Wets (2007) relies on a finite approximation of 
                        
                           
                              L
                           
                           2
                        
                      by Fourier coefficients. In this paper, we consider the spaces of extended real-valued semicontinuous functions, exponential transformations, and epi-spline approximations.

The reliance on epi-convergence and epi-splines allow us to view the constrained maximum likelihood problem as an approximation of a limiting optimization problem involving the actual probability density, correct soft information, and the full space of semicontinuous functions; we refer Pflug and Wets (2013) for a related study in the context of regression utilizing graphical convergence. Consequently, we not only approximate a certain function space or deal with finite sample size, but study the approximation of the whole estimation process as formulated by the limiting optimization problem. The approach facilitates the examination of families of estimators such as those that are near-optimal solutions of a constrained maximum likelihood problem.

Our primary motivation is to obtain reasonable estimates in situations with little hard information and we provide a consistency result as soft information is refined, quantify finite sample errors, and present a small computational study to motivate the estimator in that regard. Still, we also establish consistency and quantify asymptotic rates, as hard information is refined, under general constraints.

We focus exclusively on univariate densities that vanish beyond a compact interval of the real line. Although most of the results extend to the unbounded case and higher dimensions, technical issues will then become prominent and obscure the treatment of arbitrary random constraints and the supporting epi-spline approximations. Moreover, with a small sample, tail behavior can only come in via soft information, which is easily handled by our framework but omitted here for simplicity; a few experimental results can be found in Sood and Wets (2011).

The paper proceeds in Section 2 by defining the constrained maximum likelihood estimator, summarizing the underlying approximation theory, which is based on Royset and Wets (2014), and discussing existence and uniqueness. Section 3 exemplify the breadth of soft information that can be included and Section 4 provides consistency, asymptotics, and finite sample error results. A small collection of numerical examples are featured in Section 5. The paper is summarized in Section 6.

This section formulates a constrained maximum likelihood problem and presents a finite-dimensional approximation. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and computations. The section also includes the prerequisite approximation results.

                         which obviously can at most occur for x in a set of (Lebesgue) measure zero if

                         is a density. The exponential transformation (see Good and Gaskin (1971); de Montricher et al. (1975) for early use of such transformations and Seregin and Wellner (2010) for a broader treatment) automatically ensures that 
                           
                              exp

                         is nonnegative and explicit constraints for that purpose are redundant. In addition, some types of soft information are more easily formulated for f than for 
                           
                              h

                              )
                           
                        ; see examples in Section 3. Since we approximate lsc (usc) functions by the piecewise polynomial epi-splines, to be discussed shortly, further motivation for the exponential transformation is provided by the fact that many of the common densities are indeed exponential transformations of polynomials. We observe that the lsc and usc functions are measurable and consequently the integral in (Pn
                        ) is well-defined, but possibly infinite.

It is clear that a solution fn
                         of (Pn
                        ) generates a density 
                           
                              exp

                              −
                              
                                 f
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 (
                                 ·
                                 )
                              
                              )
                           
                         that, regardless of the sample size, possesses the properties embedded in Fn
                        , which presumably are the properties of the actual density (see Theorems 4.2 and 4.4 and Section 5.4 for a discussion of misspecification). Moreover, it will be a best possible density in terms of the maximum likelihood criterion and the set of allowable densities.

In view of the above formulation and discussion, we are unable to build on the extensive literature on sieves and follow a different path. We instead introduce a new class of functions called exponential epi-splines from which we can construct approximations independently of the sample. They allow us to substitute for the infinite-dimensional (Pn
                        ), a finite-dimensional problem, guaranteed to generate a solution that approximates, to any desired level of accuracy, a solution of (Pn
                        ).

We start by defining the central building block of our approximation framework; see Royset and Wets (2014) for details. A basic epi-spline is a function given in terms of an order p ∈ IN
                        0 ≔ {0}∪IN, where

Our focus on small samples and the use of highly flexible candidate densities in (Pn
                        ) and its epi-spline-based approximations can easily lead to overfitting. This might give the impression that the mesh m will become an important tuning parameter. However, since tuning the mesh might be challenging and easily could have become the subject of arbitrary decisions, we take another approach. We recall that (Pn
                        ) is the actual problem of interest and the estimator is 
                           
                              exp
                              (
                              −
                              
                                 f
                                 n
                              
                              )
                              ,
                           
                         with fn
                         being one of its solutions. Since such a solution is not directly available, our effort is directed towards obtaining an approximation through a “discretization” of the space 
                           F
                        . The mesh should therefore be selected fine enough to allow epi-splines to adequately approximate the underlying space 
                           F
                         of lsc (usc) functions, or possibly subsets of continuous or continuously differentiable functions, if such restrictions are warranted. With this perspective, it becomes Fn
                         that needs to be appropriately defined to ensure that (Pn
                        ) has reasonable solutions that avoid overfitting, among other things. Since we allow for arbitrary constraints, there are usually several ways soft information can be brought in to ensure reasonable solutions, which leads to flexibility for the analyst; see Section 5 for examples. In most of the paper, we therefore assume that the mesh m is fixed and sufficiently fine.

Obviously, basic epi-splines are structurally related to polynomial splines, widely used in engineering and statistical applications Delecroix and Thomas-Agnan (2000); Meyer (2012a); Wahba (1990), as both are piecewise polynomial functions. However, basic epi-splines are more flexible, with continuity not required at mesh points, and they can approximate any extended real-valued semicontinuous function (see Theorem 2.4 below). The formal definition is stated next.

                         is equivalent to a finite-dimensional optimization problem, usualy easily solved by standard algorithms. The next subsection provides the justification for approximating (Pn
                        ) by

                        . We note that this approximation is carried out for computational reasons, as a means to overcome the infinite dimensionality of (Pn
                        ). The hard and soft information are considered fixed.

Approximations of extended real-valued semicontinuous functions by epi-splines rely on the refinement of the mesh as made precise in the next definition. This subsection is based on Royset and Wets (2014).

It is clear from classical spline theory that continuous functions can be approximated by polynomial splines. We need to go beyond continuous functions to extended real-valued semicontinuous functions. We rely on the epi-topology and hypo-topology (sometimes called the Attouch-Wets topologies), which are reviewed here for completeness; see (Rockafellar and Wets, 1998, §7.I) for details. For any l < u ∈ IR, we denote by

Since the supremum of an usc function on a compact set is attained, the consideration of usc densities naturally arises in applications where the subsequent use of the densities involves maximization, such as for the purpose of finding their modes. Similarly, the lsc densities is the natural class to consider in the context of subsequent minimization. We next state an approximation results for exponential epi-splines.

We now turn to a convenient representation of epi-splines, also given in Royset and Wets (2014), which plays an essential role in computations and analysis. This leads to a finite-dimensional optimization problem for computing the estimator hn
                        , which we then analyze.

Since the value of a density at a finite number of points is immaterial for the characterization of the corresponding probability distribution, it may at first appear unnecessary to specify the value of an exponential epi-spline

                         one could simply focus on r
                        ess and this is certainly the case for continuous exponential epi-splines. However, in the discontinuous case the situation is more subtle. Since we consider functions in 
                           
                              lsc-fcns

                              ]

                         which are defined on the whole [l, u], their approximations should also be defined on the whole [l, u]. In addition, we would like to handle soft information such as bounds on the values of a density estimate at particular points, including at m. Hence, we find it most convenient to consider the value of epi-splines at the mesh independently and proceed with the more general framework involving r
                        mesh.

We note that convergence in the epi-spline parameter is equivalent to uniform convergence of the corresponding exponential epi-splines and, under a restriction to usc functions, also to convergence in the hypo-distance. Specifically, if hν, h

                        We observe that since the hypo-distance does not distinguish between a function and its usc regularization (see Proposition 7.4 in Rockafellar and Wets (1998)), uniform convergence cannot generally be implied from hypo-convergence, even for exponential epi-splines.

We next deal with existence and uniqueness of the estimator

                         is associated with the integral constraint. However, under broad conditions stated next, that constraint can be relaxed as utilized in other contexts earlier (see for example Groenenboom et al. (2001)). These conditions essentially imply that r can be improved whenever the corresponding function integrates to a number less than one.

In Theorem 4.7 below we show that even beyond loosely constrained realizations, the consideration of

                         is justified. In view of the preceding discussion and results, it is clear that the exponential epi-spline estimator is computationally tractable by means of well-developed convex optimization algorithms in many practical situations and by means of nonlinear programming algorithms in even more situations. In some cases, for example when Rn
                         is polyhedral, some further computational benefits may arise from utilizing the following reformulation, which is valid under additional assumptions; see Section 3 for examples.

In general, one cannot expect a unique optimal solution of a realization

                                    ˜

                         and consequently a unique exponential epi-spline estimate, due to the flexibility in the choice of values of the epi-spline on a mesh that is not a subset of the sample realization x
                        1, x
                        2,…, xn
                        . In fact, if the first 
                           
                              N

                              1
                           
                         components of the epi-spline parameter r are not constrained by Rn
                        , then there is an infinite number of optimal solutions whenever one exists. The next result shows that when these values are uniquely determined by the essential epi-spline parameter, uniqueness may still be achieved. Such a dependence on the essential epi-spline parameter is manifest, for example, in the case of continuous epi-splines used when dealing with densities known to be continuous.

In this section, we give a soft consistency theorem that, in part, explains these observations. We also give examples of constraints for specific instances of soft information. We start, however, with a convenient result regarding the Kullback–Leibler divergence.

                     (h||g) denote the Kullback–Leibler divergence from a density h to a density g defined on IR, i.e.,

An effective strategy for improving exponential epi-spline estimates is therefore to reduce the size of Rn
                     , of course, without eliminating the true epi-spline parameter.

We next illustrate the wide range of soft information that is easily included within the exponential epi-spline framework

                        2
                        Naturally, with the possibility of including incorrect soft information, there is a need for validation. Although important, we limit the discussion of this topic to Theorems 4.2, 4.4, and 4.7 as well as Section 5.4; see for example Silvapulle and Sen (2005) and Carroll, Delaigle, and Hall (2011) for tests in related contexts.

                     Support bounds and mesh. The choice of mesh

                           =
                           
                              
                                 {
                                 
                                    m
                                    k

                                 =
                                 0

                      accounts for support bounds and m
                     0 and mN
                      should, ideally, correspond to the lower and upper bounds of the support of the true density, respectively. If these are unknown, conservative values could be used as our ability to approximate extended real-valued functions does not rule out the possibility of vanishing densities on [m
                     0, mN
                     ], even for the exponentially transformed kind. In practice, m
                     0 and mN
                      can be selected such that the observed sample is well within [m
                     0, mN
                     ]. The mesh is often selected to be uniform, but the methodology offers much flexibility and soft information about possible locations of discontinuities, for example, could lead to other choices. Consequently, the mesh is selected essentially independently of the sample and one should simply focus on having a mesh that is sufficiently fine to allow epi-splines to approximate the underlying functions with a sufficient accuracy. Of course, some restrain on mesh refinement might be imposed by computational considerations. The number of decision variables in the resulting optimization problem grows linearly in N.


                     Semi-continuity, continuity and smoothness. It is straightforward to ensure usc, lsc, continuity, and various degrees of differentiability through linear constraints; see Royset et al. (2013) for details. The inclusion of such constraint will keep a problem loosely constrained as the sufficient condition for being loosely constrained in Proposition 2.8 is satisfied.

We recall that the epi-spline parameter is of the forms

However, an alternative “normalization,” which also squares the denominator, results in a convex constraint. Specifically, if

                     Symmetry. We ensure symmetry by designating a point of symmetry mk
                      and then solving only for the upper half of the density on [mk, mN
                     ], with trivial changes to the likelihood function and integral constraint. The process is repeated for each possible symmetry point. Again, auxiliary binary variables would obtain the same effect within one augmented formulation.

We next turn to the second part of the theorem. Since the additional assumption implies that Rn
                            becomes arbitrary close to r
                           0 a.s., item (i) follows by a similar argument as above. Items (ii) and (iii) are conclusions from the discussion following Definition 4.1.□

The first part of Theorem 4.2 shows that regardless of the soft information, which may even exclude the true density, the resulting exponential epi-splines tend to one that is as “close” as possible to the true density under the given constraints as the sample size increases. Specifically, the epi-splines computed from 
                        
                           
                              {
                              
                                 (

                                       m

                                 )
                              
                              }

                           ∞
                        
                      tend to a point in the Kullback–Leibler projection, relative to the soft information constraint set, of the true density on the class of epi-splines under consideration. We refer to Cule and Samworth (2010); Dumbgen, Samworth, and Schuhmacher (2011); Lim and Glynn (2012) for related results on model misspecfication. The second part shows that if the true density is not excluded by the soft information, then 
                        
                           
                              {
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    P
                                    
                                       p
                                       ,
                                       m
                                    
                                    n
                                 
                                 )
                              
                              }
                           
                           
                              n
                              =
                              1
                           
                           ∞
                        
                      eventually yields the true density, or possibly a closely related one that deviates at most on m.

The preceding results deal with the case when the true density can be exactly represented by an exponential epi-spline. If the true density is outside the class under consideration, one cannot expect to tend to the true density even if the sample size goes to infinity. However, as we see next, if two densities are close in the hypo-distance, then their Kullback–Leibler projections on e-spl
                        p
                     (m) must also be close in some sense. We will see that this has a direct consequence on the quality of density estimates when the true density is outside the class of exponential epi-splines. Before the main theorem, we give an intermediate result.

                           . The result then is a consequence of Corollary 7.55 in Rockafellar and Wets (1998).□

If we take the densities hn
                      in Theorem 4.4 to be exponential epi-splines, possibly defined on increasingly fine meshes, Theorem 2.4 shows that these densities indeed can be made to approximate with arbitrary accuracy any lsc or usc density h
                     0 with appropriate choice of the mesh. Consequently, the assumption of 
                        
                           
                              d
                              
                              l

                           −
                           
                              h
                              n
                           
                           ,

                              0
                           
                           )
                           →
                           0
                        
                      in Theorem 4.4 holds and, combined with Theorem 4.2, we find that for a fine mesh and a large sample size the resulting exponential epi-spline estimator is “close” to the true density, even if that density is outside the class of exponential epi-splines.

“Convergence” in the Kullback–Leibler divergence is closely related to other modes of convergence as stated next.

Asymptotic normality of the distribution of the exponential epi-spline estimator and corresponding moments may also hold when we limit the scope to the essential epi-spline parameters. As we see from the discussion before Proposition 2.9, one cannot expect a unique estimator — a prerequisite for asymptotic normality — unless the scope is limited in this manner

                        One could appeal to more sophisticated central limit theorems, such as those in King and Rockafellar (1990), but additional conditions and machinery is required and would require us to stray too far from our main theme.
                     . This focus on the essential epi-spline parameter requires additional notation that we introduce next.

Although Theorem 4.6 provides rates of convergence, it excludes the possibility of soft information in Rn
                      influencing the estimates for large samples and, in addition, deals only with the essential epi-spline parameter. We end the section by examining errors for a finite sample size under relaxed assumptions, which leads to another rate of convergence result. However, the treatment requires us to focus on ε-optimal solutions of

                            arises from that theorem. Proposition 3.1 yields the second conclusion.□


                     Theorem 4.7 shows that there are two sources of error in the estimation process corresponding to the two parts of K. The first source is sampling error, represented by the term involving α, which can be made small by selecting a small α and this error is only exceeded with a small probability if nα
                     2 is large. The second source is caused by d(r
                     0, Rn
                     ), the distance between the true epi-spline parameter and the constraint set Rn
                     . Of course, if only appropriate soft information is included, then r
                     0 ∈ Rn
                      and 
                        
                           d
                           (
                           
                              r

                           ,
                           
                              R
                              n
                           
                           )

                           0
                        
                     . Otherwise, incorrect specification of soft information induces a “bias” in the density estimator. We note that Theorem 4.7 provides additional support for considering

                      is obtained for the exponential epi-spline estimator even if soft information is “active.”

We illustrate the exponential epi-spline estimator through a series of examples using a freely available Matlab toolbox Royset and Wets (2013) that relies on the fmincon solver (Matlab 7.10.0); see also Buttrey, Royset, and Wets (2014) for a corresponding R toolbox. The focus is on showing the effect of including various sources of soft information in the context of small sample sizes. Section 5.1 shows estimates of an exponential density using 10 observation and an increasing collection of soft information. Section 5.2 provides an alternative to the Bayesian paradigm and demonstrates how a diverse family of densities can be generated. Section 5.3 examines the probability density of customer time-in-service for a modified M/M/1 queue. Section 5.4 shows the effect of incorrect soft information. The section ends with Section 5.5, where soft information about moments is examined for increasing sample sizes. It is beyond the scope of the paper to include a comprehensive comparison with alternative density estimators, which in any case have difficulties with incorporating an arbitrary set of soft information. Occasionally, we simply contrast with kernel estimates using “ksdensity” in Matlab, a Gaussian kernel, and default bandwidths, which are optimized in some sense for the normal densities. These estimates can possibly be improved with better bandwidth and kernel choices. In all cases, we use epi-splines of order two and if there is no soft information about support bounds, we set m
                     0 (mN
                     ) to two sample-estimated standard errors below (above) the smallest (largest) sample point, and use uniform meshes. The set Rn

We illustrate the effect of soft information in a simple example. For a true exponential density with parameter 
                           
                              λ
                              =
                              1
                           
                         (dotted black curves in Fig. 2
                        ) and a sample of size 10 (see green stems), Fig. 2 shows our exponential epi-spline estimates (solid red curves) under two classes of soft information: (a) continuously differentiable, nonnegatively supported, and log-concave density and (b) also nonincreasing density and a relative bound on the slope. The soft information about relative slope amounts to letting the quantity hn
                        ′(x)/hn
                        (x) be in the interval 
                           
                              [
                              −

For comparison, a kernel estimate, incorporating information about a nonnegative support, is displayed by dashed black curves. The exponential epi-spline estimates are obtained using a mesh with 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              10
                           
                        . In Fig. 2(a), MSE is 0.1144 and 0.3273 for exponential epi-spline and kernel estimates, respectively. The kernel estimate reaches well above 4.5 near zero, though the plots are truncated for the sake of clarity. Fig. 2(b) shows the visually improved exponential epi-spline estimate with a reduced MSE of 0.0416. The exponential epi-spline estimates miss the density peak at zero, but the present sample provides few indications about such a peak and its capture will naturally be difficult. Still, the exponential epi-spline estimate is both qualitatively and quantitatively close to the true density elsewhere. The ability to incorporate various kinds of soft information along the lines illustrated here offers the analyst a valuable tool for exploring assumptions and their consequences. One can attempt to improve the kernel estimate using various bandwidth as well as truncation (see for example (Tsybakov, 2009, p.19)). The effect on bandwidth in the kernel estimate is illustrated in Fig. 3
                        (a), where the case with default bandwidth (given in Fig. 2(a)) is supplemented by estimates using bandwidth 0.15, 0.2625, 0.375, 0.4875, and 0.6. The combination of a nonnegative support and few data points make it nontrivial to select an appropriate bandwidth and the estimates remain mostly qualitatively similar. In Fig. 3(b) we remove the requirement of a nonnegative support. Again, the choice of bandwidth appears challenging. However, truncation and renormalization of the portion of the density estimates to the left of the origin improves the situation; see the dashed blue lines kernel (trunc) in Figs. 2(a), (b), and 3(a) that give the resulting estimate when truncating the (default) density estimate in Fig. 3(b) (black line).

Our framework provides an alternative to traditional Bayesian updating. In addition to the inclusion of numerous types of soft information—which can be viewed as “prior” information—we may also directly restrict 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                         to a neighborhood of a reference density h
                        ref using (4). To illustrate the framework, consider a reference (prior) density that is standard normal and a sample consisting of 10 points from the same density; see Fig. 4
                        . We set 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              10
                           
                         and restrict the search to continuously differentiable densities. If no emphasis is placed on the reference density, i.e., 
                           
                              φ
                              (
                              10
                              )
                              =
                              ∞
                           
                         in (4), then we obtain the exponential epi-spline estimate marked with the red dotted line in Fig. 4. As proximity to the reference density is enforced more vigorously by setting 
                           
                              φ
                              (
                              10
                              )
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                           
                         0.1, and 0.01, we obtain the dashdot, dashed, and solid lines, respectively, in Fig. 4. The Kullback–Leibler divergence constraints dampen the oscillations caused by the sample by a degree determined by φ(10), which in practice should be selected based on the confidence in the correctness of the reference density.

A related situation arises when an analyst would like to generate multiple densities that span a range of possibilities, for example to account in some manner for questionable soft information. For example, when the estimated density is to be used as input in further simulation and optimization, it may be prudent to consider a set of densities and possibly let planning be based on the worst density in some sense. We illustrate this situation by returning to the exponential example of Section 5.1. Suppose that the second density generated there (see Fig. 2b) is considered plausible, but we would like to also generate relevant alternatives. Retaining a restriction to continuously differentiable, nonincreasing, and nonnegatively supported densities, we construct three alternatives by imposing (4) with ≤ replaced by ≥ and right-hand side 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, and h
                        ref being the original estimate in Fig. 2b. Consequently, we determine densities that are at least certain “distances” away from the original estimate in the sense of Kullback–Leibler divergence, while still maximizing the likelihood function of the sample. Fig. 5
                         shows the results with the solid red line and dotted black line showing the original estimate and true density as in Fig. 2b. The alternative densities are depicted with dashed, dot-dashed, and dotted red lines for right-hand sides of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, respectively. We observe that even though based on only 10 sample points, the original together with the alternative densities provide a “diversified” set of densities near the true density well suited as input for further studies.

Significant challenges arise when the density to be estimated is discontinuous. We illustrate this situation here by an example taken from Singham et al. (2013); see Royset and Wets (2014) for additional examples. Suppose that the random variable of interest is the customer time-in-service of a modified M/M/1 queue with arrival rate

Obviously, the true density is an equal mixture of the probability density of the customer time-in-service without a separate station (an exponential density) and the same density shifted to the right by two time units, yielding a discontinuous density.

                         shows aggregated results across 100 meta-replications for a variety of soft information. The first row of results shows MSE under no additional information beyond lower semicontinuity and bounds on the second-order derivatives. The second row corresponds to a restriction of the slope to be in the interval 
                           
                              [

                         and the third row assumes a nonnegative support. The last row incorporates bounds on the slope, nonnegative support, and log-concavity of the upper tail. We show that the average MSE (second column) decreases with increasing soft information and mostly also the standard deviation of the MSE (third column).

                         shows an instance corresponding to the last row in Table 1. The MSE of the exponential epi-spline (red line) estimate is 0.0016. The exponential epi-spline estimate captures the essence of the true density (dotted line) rather well.

                        0 relative to the set constructed by the soft information as the sample size grows. Consequently, in the presence of incorrect soft information that excludes h
                        0, we achieve the density “nearest” to h
                        0 within the set of densities satisfying the (incorrect) soft information. We illustrate this situation by considering a standard normal density and its exponential epi-splines estimates based on 
                           
                              N

                        . We adopt soft information about continuous differentiability and log-concavity. In addition, we impose the incorrect constraint that the expected value must be no larger than 
                           
                              −

                        a shows the resulting exponential epi-spline estimate (solid red line) and the kernel estimate (dashed black line) for

                        . Fig.7b displays the corresponding results for 
                           
                              n

                        . We observe that while the kernel estimator benefits from the larger sample size and obtains a nearly perfect estimate for

                         the unfortunate expectation constraint on the exponential epi-spline prevents it from approaching the true density. However, we obtain a “normal-looking” density with a shifted mean of 
                           
                              −

We end the section by presenting a summary of results over a range of sample sizes for a normal density with zero mean and standard deviation of two. We carry out 104 meta-replications and compute average and standard deviation of the resulting MSE for both an exponential epi-spline estimate and a kernel estimate. We use 
                           
                              N
                              =
                              20
                           
                         and soft information that amounts to continuous differentiability, log-concavity, and bounds on first and second moments that ensure estimates with moments within 20% of their correct values.


                        Fig. 8
                         shows the corresponding average and standard deviation of the MSE for a range of sample sizes. We see that the exponential epi-splines estimates result in smaller MSE, on average. However, the advantage decreases as the sample size grows as expected.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have developed a constrained maximum likelihood estimator that incorporates any soft information that might be available and therefore offers substantial flexibility for practitioners. In particular in situations with few (hard) observations, soft information can be brought in and reasonable estimates can be achieved with as little as 10 sample points. In simple but illustrative examples of estimating exponential, normal, and mixture of exponential distributions, we construct new estimates under a variety of soft information not commonly considered. The estimator requires the solution of an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, which we carry out approximately utilizing exponential epi-splines. The justification stems from the fact that exponential epi-splines can approximate to an arbitrary level of accuracy practically any density. We show that optimization over exponential epi-splines often reduces to convex programming. Our theoretical development establishes consistency, asymptotic normality, and finite sample error of order
