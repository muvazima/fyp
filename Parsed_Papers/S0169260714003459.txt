                  Telecare medicine information systems provide a communicating platform for accessing remote medical resources through public networks, and help health care workers and medical personnel to rapidly making correct clinical decisions and treatments. An authentication scheme for data exchange in telecare medicine information systems enables legal users in hospitals and medical institutes to establish a secure channel and exchange electronic medical records or electronic health records securely and efficiently. This investigation develops an efficient and secure verified-based three-party authentication scheme by using extended chaotic maps for data exchange in telecare medicine information systems. The proposed scheme does not require server's public keys and avoids time-consuming modular exponential computations and scalar multiplications on elliptic curve used in previous related approaches. Additionally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and realizes the lower bounds of messages and rounds in communications. Compared to related verified-based approaches, the proposed scheme not only possesses higher security, but also has lower computational cost and fewer transmissions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Telecare medicine information systems (TMIS) provide health care workers and medical personnel with accessing remote medical resources including electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic health records (EHR) through public networks, and help them to rapidly making correct clinical decisions and treatments [1,2]. To have efficient transmissions and to ensure information security and privacy protection are essential for TMIS. Thus, many related approaches in these research fields were recently developed to realize the requirements in security and efficiency. For example, the authentication schemes for HIPAA privacy and security regulations were proposed to provide authorization, authentication and key management. The software solution for sharing and querying of HL7 version 3 clinical documents was presented to provide security to data providers and protecting the patients’ privacy [3–9].

A verified-based three-party authentication scheme for data exchange in TMIS does not store actual password and only keeps a verifier computed from the actual password in an authentication server's database. The authentication server uses another method to verify the user's possession of actual password in order to oppose to a stolen verifier from the password file. Next, two legal users in hospitals and medical institutes agree a common session key via the help of an authentication server. Then these users can establish a secure channel and exchange EMRs or EHRs securely and efficiently. That is, verified-based three-party authentication schemes for data exchange in TMIS could provide patients at home, doctors at clinical centers, and home health-care agency with communicating platforms for accessing EMRs and EHRs securely, conveniently and efficiently [10].

Lee et al. [11] in 2005 developed an efficient verified-based three-party authentication scheme. The scheme of Lee et al. did not require server's public keys and can oppose to a stolen verifier from the password file. However, Wang and Mo [12] in 2006 showed that the scheme of Lee et al. [11] fails to withstand stolen verifier attacks and also presented a modified verified-based three-party authentication scheme as an alternative. In 2007, Kwon et al. [13] also proposed a secure verifier-based three-party authentication scheme which did not require server's public keys and had fewer rounds than other related schemes in transmissions. Chien [14] in 2011 proposed a verifier-based three-party key exchange protocol, which is proven secure in the random oracle model. Pu et al. [15] in 2013 demonstrated that the protocol of Chien is still vulnerable to a partition attack, and proposed an enhanced protocol that can defeat the possible attacks. In order to provide key confirmation and enhance computational efficiency, Lin and Lee [10] in 2014 proposed a proven secure verifier-based three-party authentication scheme and a round-efficient version for data exchange in TMIS. However, these verifier-based three-party authentication schemes [10–15] require many time-consuming modular exponential computations and thus cannot execute efficiently.

Cryptography based on chaotic map recently had been shown that it has better performance than traditional cryptography [16–18]. In order to have higher efficiency, many various approaches based on chaos theory were developed. For example, Tseng et al. [19] in 2009 proposed the authentication scheme based on chaotic map. Later, Niu et al. [20] and Xue et al. [21] proposed improved schemes based on Tseng et al.’s scheme in order to overcome the weaknesses in security. Guo et al. [22] in 2013 proposed a new authentication scheme based on chaotic map for providing anonymity and withstand various attacks. Hao et al. [23] in 2013 proposed a chaotic map-based authentication scheme for telecare medicine information systems. Besides, Xiao et al. [24] in 2007 presented a key agreement protocol based on chaotic maps. Then the related protocols based on Chebyshev chaotic maps were continuously presented [25–29].

This investigation develops an efficient verified-based three-party authentication scheme by using extended chaotic maps for data exchange in TMIS. The proposed scheme does not require server's public keys, is implemented by rearranging and sending the messages in parallel, and also includes the key confirmation without extra numbers of messages and rounds. Compared to related verified-based three-party authentication schemes, the proposed three-party authentication scheme not only retains the same security properties with the previous schemes, but also is more efficient in computations and in communications. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model [30–32] and realizes the lower bounds of messages and rounds in communications.

The remainder of this investigation is organized as follows. Section 2 lists the used notations and definitions. Section 3 presents the proposed efficient verifier-based three-party authentication scheme using extended chaotic maps. Section 4 provides the security and performance analyses. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.

This section presents an efficient and secure verifier-based three-party authentication scheme for TMIS. The proposed scheme promotes the mutual authentication and realizes the session key security by employing the extended chaotic maps-based Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and thus does not require time-consumer modular exponential computations and scalar multiplications on elliptic curves. Additionally, our scheme is implemented by rearranging and sending the messages in parallel, and includes the key confirmation without extra numbers of messages and rounds.

The proposed scheme is constructed from two two-party authenticated key exchange (2PAKE) schemes involving A and S and involving B and S, and then combines an extended chaotic maps-based Diffie–Hellman key exchange involving A and B and uses the hash function to realize key confirmation in final. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the proposed scheme, which is explained in details as follows.

This section provides the security proofs of the proposed verifier-based three-party authentication scheme and compares its performance with that of other related verifier-based three-party authentication schemes.


                           Communicating participants: The participants include two clients A and B, and a trusted third party S. A and B authenticate each other and establish a common authentication key SK via S in the scheme P. A participant may be involved in numerous instances, called oracles, of distinct concurrent executions of the scheme P. The instance i of participant U is denoted as

                            are called as long-lived keys. The verifiers v

                           ) are stored in S, where h is a cryptographic one-way function. A verified-based scheme only stores a verifier in server's database and uses another method to verify the user's possession of actual password in order to oppose to a stolen verifier from the password file [11,34,35].

                           Session key security (AKE security): This security definition defines that an adversary is allowed to ask many 
                              Test
                            queries as it wants. If a 
                              Test
                            query is asked to a client instance that has not accepted, then return the invalid symbol ⊥. If a 
                              Test
                            query is asked to an instance of an honest participant whose intended partner is dishonest or to an instance of a dishonest participant, then returns the real session key. Otherwise, the 
                              Test
                            query decides to return either the real session key or a random string via an unbiased coin c. The adversary aims to correctly guess the value of the hidden bit c used by the Test oracle. The ake-advantage of the event that an adversary violates the indistinguishability of the scheme P is denoted as

                           AKE security for the proposed scheme
                        

For proving the proposed scheme, we construct it from two 2PAKE schemes involving A and S, and involving B and S. The following theorem shows that the proposed 2PAKE scheme involving A and S has AKE security if the used hash function is secure and the extended chaotic maps-based decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption holds.

The proof of Theorem 2 can be concluded by using the same arguments of Theorem 1, and thus is not presented here.

The following theorem shows that if the used hash function is secure and the extended chaotic maps-based Decisional Decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption holds, then the proposed scheme has AKE security.

                           E

                           R

The first comparison item is used computational cost. All the Lee et al.’s schemes [11], the Wang and Mo’ scheme [12], the Kwon et al.’s scheme [13], the Chien's scheme [14], the Pu et al.’s scheme [15], and the Lin and Lee's scheme [10] required many time-consuming modular exponential computations. But, the proposed scheme is developed by using extended chaotic maps, and thus is more efficient than the other schemes.

The second comparison item is required messages and rounds in transmission. The Kwon et al.’s scheme requires four rounds. Both the Lin and Lee's scheme and the proposed scheme require six messages and four rounds. The Kwon et al.’s scheme, the Pu et al.’s scheme, the Lin and Lee's scheme and the proposed scheme are more efficient than the Lee et al.’s scheme and the Wang and Mo's scheme in communication. Moreover, in a nonce-based 2PAKE scheme [37] without using public keys, two communicating participants (A-S or B-S) authenticate each other and execute a challenge/response [38]. Then three messages and three rounds are required. Thus, to implement a nonce-based three-party authenticated key agreement scheme without using public keys requires at least six messages. Additionally, the originator (A) is the only one who initiates a message. The others (B and S) can issue messages only at the moment they receive one. Then B and S must authenticate each other and execute a challenge/response after A initiates a message in the first round. Hence, to implement a nonce-based three-party authenticated key agreement scheme without using public keys requires at least four rounds. The Kwon et al.’s scheme can be executed in four rounds. The Pu et al.’s scheme, the Lin and Lee's scheme and the proposed scheme can be executed in six messages and four rounds. Thus these schemes and the proposed scheme realize optimal in communications.

The subsequent comparison items are security properties including providing mutual authentication and session key security, resisting password guessing, password guessing and stolen verifier attacks, and providing key confirmation. The Pu et al.’s scheme, the Lin and Lee's scheme and the proposed scheme provide more security properties than other schemes. Therefore, the proposed scheme retains higher security and is more efficient in computation and in transmission than other related verified-based schemes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper develops an efficient and secure verified-based three-party authentication scheme by using the extended chaotic maps. The proposed scheme adopts rearranging and sending the messages in parallel, includes the key confirmation without extra numbers of messages and rounds, and thus can be executed in fewer messages and rounds. The proposed extended chaotic maps-based scheme possesses more security properties and is more efficient in computation and in transmission than other related verified-based schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is proven secure, realizes optimal in communications, is superior to the related verified-based schemes, and thus is more suitable for data exchange in TMIS.
