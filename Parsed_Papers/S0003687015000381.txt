@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  This study postulates that traditional human error identification techniques fail to consider motion economy principles and, accordingly, their applicability in operating theatres may be limited. This study addresses this gap in the literature with a dual aim. First, it identifies the principles of motion economy that suit the operative environment and second, it develops a new error mode taxonomy for human error identification techniques which recognises motion economy deficiencies affecting the performance of surgeons and predisposing them to errors. A total of 30 principles of motion economy were developed and categorised into five areas. A hierarchical task analysis was used to break down main tasks of a urological laparoscopic surgery (hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy) to their elements and the new taxonomy was used to identify errors and their root causes resulting from violation of motion economy principles. The approach was prospectively tested in 12 observed laparoscopic surgeries performed by 5 experienced surgeons. A total of 86 errors were identified and linked to the motion economy deficiencies. Results indicate the developed methodology is promising. Our methodology allows error prevention in surgery and the developed set of motion economy principles could be useful for training surgeons on motion economy principles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Extirpative and reconstructive laparoscopic techniques have become part of the standard approach in most urological surgeries (Pareek et al., 2005; Rane and Wolf, 2005). Manoeuvring laparoscopic instruments requires advanced skills (Pareek et al., 2005), increases fatigue and discomfort (Berguer, 1998) and, as a result, predisposes the surgical team to a wider range of potential errors (Etchells et al., 2003; Wiegmann et al., 2007). Literature in laparoscopy points to a variety of non-technical factors that affect the performance of and create fatigue and discomfort to surgical team during laparoscopic surgeries. These factors include, but are not limited to, posture, height of operating table, location and place of the display, level of instrument handles, level of surgical area and design of instruments. These factors fall within the scope of a ergonomics and human factors area, traditionally known as ‘motion economy’ (Barnes, 1980). Motion economy deals with the interaction of human operators with their workplace. In this study we use the terms ‘human factors’, ‘ergonomics’ and ‘motion economy’ interchangeably.

The literature refers to motion economy principles as ergonomics principles or guidelines (Wauben et al., 2006). Motion economy has been emphasised in the surgical literature (Philips, 2004). However, in a study conducted jointly with the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, 89% of the 284 surgeons surveyed were unaware of ergonomics principles, though all of them stated they find ergonomics important (Wauben et al., 2006). Barnes (1980) suggested 22 principles of motion economy categorised across three areas of analysis. These are ‘use of human body’; ‘arrangement of workplace’; and ‘design of tools and equipment’.

The first area of motion economy is related to the ‘use of human body’. This area comprises 9 principles orienting operators on efficient movement of the hands and other body parts. Examples include the preference of smooth continuous curved motions of the hand to straight-line motions involving sudden and sharp changes in direction; and having the two hands of the operator beginning and completing their motion simultaneously.

The ‘arrangement of workplace’ is the second motion economy area. It includes 8 principles necessary to organise the workstation and arrange the location of tools and instruments relative to the operator's position. Examples include the requirement to have defined and fixed places for tools and materials; and the importance of arranging tools and materials in a way that permits the best sequence of an operator's hand movements.

The third area of motion economy is the ‘design of tools and equipment’, which includes 5further principles that take into consideration tool and equipment handling and other design issues related to human factors. Notwithstanding its importance, this area requires extensive research and investigation and is beyond the scope of this study.

Examining the traditional principles of motion economy reveals that they were designed to facilitate the performance of a single worker implementing repetitive, mechanical work with definite steps. Accordingly, not all of these principles are applicable to the surgical environment. For instance, the principle requiring gravity feed to be used to deliver material close to the point of use is not applicable to deliver sterile material and surgical instruments. Further, some motion economy principles may require adaptation to become applicable and suitable for the operative environment. For example, the principle that the motion of the arms should be symmetrical and in opposite directions requires adaptation to include diverse directions (e.g., in opposite directions for each one of the operator's hands), (see Table 1
                         for a list of motion economy principles and their surgical application). In addition, surgery requires team effort, specific procedures for handling sterile material and instruments, updated and accurate information and is performed on the human body as a working object. Therefore, there may be a need to add new areas to the traditional three areas of motion economy as we will discuss later.

Specific approaches have been designed for reducing human errors known as Human Error Identification (HEI) techniques (Stanton et al., 2009). HEI uses a predefined error mode taxonomy to detect errors and requires breaking down the human–machine interaction into a series of actions. Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) is usually used for this purpose. Here we refer to the technique comprising both HTA and HEI as ‘HTA/HEI’.

HTA describes a work system in terms of its goals. It begins with a main task defined by its intended goal and breaks down the main task into its sub-tasks. Each sub-task has a sub-goal contributing towards achievement of the main task goal (Stanton, 2006). These sub-tasks may be further analysed to their constituent tasks and so on. The level of analysis depends on complexity and required description of the tasks or their goals (Lane et al., 2006; Phipps et al., 2008). Rules guide the sequence in which sub-goals are attained to achieve the ‘higher’ goals (Phipps et al., 2008) and, accordingly, higher levels in the hierarchy influence the manner in which lower levels behave (Shepherd, 2010). Task analysis is a useful way of looking at how people interact with a system in terms of work processes, technology (machines and instruments) and environment (Rose and Bearman, 2012). The error mode taxonomy of HEI is used to highlight potentially unforseen errors in the lowest level tasks of a HTA (Phipps et al., 2008; Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002; Stanton et al., 2009). Once the potential error or disruption is predicted, an error reduction strategy can be implemented (Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002).

HTA/HEI has been used to detect potential human errors across industries (Rose and Bearman, 2012; Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002; Stanton, 2006; Stanton et al., 2009). Recently, HTA/HEI techniques have been applied to predict potential errors in healthcare services, including medication administration (Lane et al., 2006), anaesthesia (Phipps et al., 2008), endoscopic surgery (Joice et al., 1998) and patient positioning for spinal surgery (Al-Hakim et al., 2014). However, HTA/HEI techniques fail to consider explicitly the principle of motion economy and, accordingly, this may limit their applicability in operating theatres. This study aims to address this gap in the application of HTA/HEI techniques.

HTA/HEI techniques are used to examine low-level sub-tasks of a task (e.g., surgery) (Stanton, 2006; Stanton et al., 2009). The HTA part is proposed as a means to describing a task (surgery) in terms of its goal and comprises a sub-goal hierarch linked by plans (Stanton, 2006). HEI includes the error taxonomy that detects errors during the execution of sub-goals or related plans. Error occurs where there is a failure to achieve the sub-goal of a planned sub-task (i.e., error of execution) or the use of a wrong plan to achieve a sub-goal (i.e., error of planning) (Etchells et al., 2003; Kohn et al., 2000). In order to use an HTA/HEI technique, the analyst or observer applies HTA in order to identify what the operator should do to perform sub-tasks, and uses HEI error taxonomy to identify what could go wrong (Kirwan, 1998; Shorrock and Kirwan, 2002; Stanton, 2006). Kirwan (1998) identifies 3 interrelated components of HEI error taxonomies. These are as follows:
                           
                              1.
                              External Error mode (EEM): The EEM taxonomy forms the ‘external’ manifestation of errors as observed by the analyst (e.g., using excessive force, omitting a critical check). EEM is a reference to ‘error mode’ as stated in some HTA/HEI techniques such as SHERPA (Embrey, 1989).

Performance Shaping Factors (PSP): This taxonomy refers to factors shaping the ability and capacity of the operators (e.g., surgeons) to perform specific tasks (e.g., their experience or training).

Psychological Error Mechanism (PEM): This taxonomy represents the ‘internal’ manifestation of errors in psychologically meaningful terms (e.g., lack of confidence, memory failure).

It is logical that PSP and PEM components have direct effect on the number of errors detected via the EEM component – such that one would hypothesise that errors are triggered by lack of expertise and associated lack of confidence, or erroneous omissions during a case. However, the literature reveals that errors also commonly occur in surgical procedures performed by experienced surgeons and operative teams (Al-Hakim, 2011; Joice et al., 1998; Sevdalis et al., 2008; Wiegmann et al., 2007). EEM identifies and describes errors (e.g., using wrong instrument) but does not provide the root cause or actual circumstance that drives or forces a surgeon to act erroneously. Accordingly, we argue that there are factors other than those covered in PSP and PEM that can affect the performance of experienced, highly trained surgeons and their wider teams.

This study, therefore, hypotheses that motion economy contributes to the causes of senior surgical errors. However, the principles of motion economy cannot be used as such to detect error during surgery, and thus we need to use HTA/HEI taxonomy for this purpose. On the other hand, without integrating the principles of motion economy as part of our HTA/HEI taxonomies we cannot identify the root causes of errors. It is important to note that violation of motion economy principles should have more impact and create more potential errors in surgeries with long operative time or where successive surgeries performed in one session – as problems accumulate and trigger these errors.

In this study, we adapted the motion economy principles presented earlier and developed additional principles to suit the operative environment. The developed principles can be used as part of error taxonomy of traditional HTA/HEI techniques, such as SHERPA (Embrey, 1989) to detect surgical errors. We use hand-assisted laparoscopy (HAL) for nephrectomy (HAL nephrectomy) as a case study to illustrate the importance of considering motion economy alongside HTA/HEI. HAL has been developed as an extension of conventional laparoscopic surgery and has been used to perform complex surgeries, including radical, donor and partial nephrectomy surgeries (Bishoff and Kavoussi, 2007; Stifelman et al., 2001). It provides tactile feedback allowing surgeon to use a hand to assist with performing surgical functions (Bishoff and Kavoussi, 2007; Stifelman et al., 2001), and can be used by surgeons with minimal laparoscopic training (Busby et al., 2003). The ability to use the hand also minimises the chance of injuries and permits rapid control of bleeding, if occurs (Yu and Miller, 1996). In essence, HAL combines the advantages of open and conventional laparoscopic surgeries (Stifelman et al., 2001). As an illustration of the application of motion economy principles to these procedures, manoeuvring an instrument with one hand and having the other inside the patient's cavity may cause fatigue to the surgeon as a result of asymmetrical movement of the two hands at different levels. Adjusting the operating table to achieve the optimal working level as suggested in principle A7 (Table 1) can considerably ease the work for surgeons, especially for long and complex procedures (Manasnayakorn et al., 2008).

Initially, an ethical approval was approved by the Research and Development Section of a large academic hospital in Bangkok to carry out the study and make observations in the hospital's operating theatres. The hospital assigned three experienced theatre nurses to facilitate the research work. The research methodology comprised three phases.

In the first phase, the literature of motion economy, HTA/HEI and laparoscopic surgery was reviewed to explore the principles of motion economy, errors occurring during laparoscopic surgeries and various HTA/HEI techniques and applications. The team selected HAL nephrectomy surgery as illustrative case study. The selection was made because of the long experience of surgeons in this type of surgery and the familiarity of the principal researcher with the lateral positioning and his previous observations of nephrectomies. In this phase, the research team explored tasks, potential errors and the role of motion economy associated with errors. Meetings were held with the theatre nurses to explore their opinions. The outcome of this phase was an initial task analysis and a draft of ergonomic requirements for the surgery and associated principles of motion economy.

In the second phase of the study, the initial HTA was further analysed, and its tasks broken down into further levels of sub-tasks. The relevant principles of motion economy for each task, and the potential errors that may occur during the implementation of these tasks, were explored. In addition, the error taxonomy based on principles of motion economy was formulated. We relied on literature on human factors, patient safety, and operating theatre techniques (Barnes, 1980; Dankanich; Karwowski and Salvendy, 2010; Meyers and Stewart, 2002; Philips, 2004; Wachter, 2012) as well as on our team's ergonomics and clinical experience to select and adapt the traditional principles. In addition, we consulted related research studies on surgery (Al-Hakim, 2011; Al-Hakim and Gong, 2012; Berguer, 1999; Etchells et al., 2003; He et al., 2013; Jaschinski et al., 1998; Manasnayakorn et al., 2009; Moorthy et al., 2005; Sevdalis et al., 2007; Stifelman et al., 2001; van Det et al., 2009; van Veelen et al., 2002; Vereczkei et al., 2004; Wiegmann et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2007) to develop new areas and principles for motion economy.

In the third phase, an actual HAL nephrectomy was observed by the principal researcher (LH). It was conducted in a large hospital at Bangkok, Thailand by an experienced surgeon (CD) who introduced the observer and the reason for observation to the patient and to members of the surgical team. The HAL nephrectomy was carried out to remove excessive tissues (tumour) built around the patient's kidney. At this phase, the HTA for the surgery was revised based on the observed tasks and the error taxonomy was applied to explore potential errors stem from the implementation of each observed task. Observations were subsequently carried out across 12 laparoscopic surgeries to test the applicability of our methodology in capturing the latent motion economy factors that predispose surgeons to errors.

The patient was brought from the pre-operative area to the operating theatre using a patient trolley. The patient and procedure were identified and the patient was initially positioned supine for IV access, anaesthesia induction and intubation. The patient was then transferred in supine position to the operating table. The anaesthetised patient was positioned on the operating table. The patient position was adjusted such that the flexion of the operating table was in line with the anterior superior iliac spine. The patient was then turned on to lateral position. A bag is used to raise the patient's hip as required – usually an operating table with kidney rest is used but, that table was not available at the time of surgery. The lower leg was flexed to 90° at the knee to prevent the body from rolling over and the upper leg was kept straight. An armboard was used to position the patient's upper hand. The patient was padded and his position secured on the operating table using cloth tape. The operating table was rotated toward the surgeon to expose adequately the surgical field. This type of position is known as Flank position, which is a modified version of lateral position (Bishoff and Kavoussi, 2007; Stifelman et al., 2001; Yu and Miller, 1996) (Fig. 1
                        ).

@&#RESULTS@&#

In this section, we describe our revision and further development of motion economy principles applicable to surgery; the development of a suitable HEI taxonomy; and what we found via our real-time observations of the 12 laparoscopies.

Among the traditional principles of motion economy stated in the literature (Barnes, 1980; Meyers and Stewart, 2002) we selected 11 principles; 5 principles from the area ‘uses of human body’ (we refer to it as Area A) and 6 principles from the area ‘arrangement of work place’ (Area B). Two principles from area A area and two principles from area B area have been modified to suit the surgical environment as shown in Table 1.

We further added an extra 3 principles to Area A and another 2 new principles to area B. We also developed 3 new motion economy areas, namely ‘work with sterile instruments and material’, ‘work on human body’ and ‘communication and team work’. The new areas are identified as ‘Area C’, ‘Area D’ and ‘Area E’, respectively. Principles within the area ‘design of tools and equipment’ are beyond the scope of this paper and will not be discussed further.

We added 3 new principles to area A. The first added principle deals with long-period static posture (Verdaasdonk et al., 2008), the second is related to the optimal working surface for incision area and surgery instrument handles relative to the surgeon's elbow level (Manasnayakorn et al., 2009; van Veelen et al., 2002), and the third focuses on surgeon's hand to manoeuvre instruments for HAL (Stifelman et al., 2001). For area B, we developed 2 new principles for motion focussing on location of the monitor displaying the surgical field relative to the surgeon's eye level (Jaschinski et al., 1998; van Det et al., 2009; Vereczkei et al., 2004) and the location of the sharp and delicate instruments (Dankanich; Philips, 2004).

The 6 principles for the new area ‘work with sterile instruments and material’ (area C) emphasise the following: the importance of having only sterile staff deal with sterile instruments and material, specifying the required quantity and specifications of the sterile instrument/material before surgery, checking the quality and quantity of the sterile instruments/material before use, prevent holding two instruments with one hand, handing over one tool at a time, and counting of sterile sharp instrument and sponges after use.

The 4 developed principles for area D ‘Work on human body’ deal with the transferring the anaesthetised patient from transfer trolley to operating table, moving patient's parts, achieving surgery requirements and safety of the surgical team. The new motion economy area E ‘communication and team work’ comprises 4 principles dealing with the availability and quality of the required information (Al-Hakim, 2011; Al-Hakim and Gong, 2012; Etchells et al., 2003; Sevdalis et al., 2007; Wiegmann et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2011), importance of satisfying surgeon requests during surgery, synchronising and coordination of the hand motion of the surgical team (He et al., 2013; Moorthy et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2007), and the relative position of the surgical team. In total, we have 30 motion economy principles that suit surgical performance in operating theatres. Table 1 lists the principles of motion economy for surgery with explanation, references and practical examples. The table also indicates whether the principle is original as originally developed by Barnes (1980), a modified or a new principle.

The available HEI taxonomies do not include the applications of motion economy. The exact causes of errors resulting from the violation of motion economy could be inferred wrongly by the current HEI taxonomies (we elaborate this point further in the Discussion section). Violation of motion economy principles may imply high potential safety risk, for which extra resources, effort, time and/or excess precaution is required to avoid errors. Al-Hakim et al. point to other limitation of the traditional HTA/HEI. HTA/HEI approaches consider human–machine interaction. This may not always be the case in surgical environments, where human–human interaction plays a major role. In addition, HTA/HEI assumes that the probability of making an error remains the same whenever the same operator performs a task. This may be not the case in a surgical environment. For instance, the probability of a surgical team making an error in moving an unconscious patient from the trolley (patient transportation table) to the operating table is higher when the patient is obese (Philips, 2004).

We thus propose that in order to use the traditional HTA/HIE techniques correctly, the HEI error taxonomy should comprise two parts; a motion economy error taxonomy (MEET) and a task error taxonomy (TET). MEET comprises principles of motion economy as stated in Table 1. TET includes the error taxonomy of the traditional HTA/HEI technique that intends to be used.

In this study, SHERPA (Embrey, 1989) was used as the traditional HTA/HEI approach for predicting potential errors for TET (Table 2
                        ) and the principles of motion economy listed in Table 1 form the elements of MEET. Table 3
                         shows the HTA/HEI analysis of the patient positioning for HAL.

In order to illustrate the applicability of our approach, data for 12 laparoscopic surgery were observed by the principal researcher. The observed surgeries were performed by 5 experienced surgeons who had each at least five years of experience in urological laparoscopic surgeriers. Operating time ranged from 64 min to 133 min with an average of 89 min per case. Table 4
                         lists the instances of observed errors captured by TET taxonomy during the operations (from initial incision to suturing the incision) and relates those errors to violation of the motion economy principles captured by the MEET taxonomy. A total of 86 errors across the 12 operations were captured by TET. The data indicate that the error rate is positively related to operative time – i.e., longer procedures were associated with higher error rate. The MEET (Table 1) shows that large number of errors captured by TET was associated with long-period non-physiological posture resulting from one or more of the following: (a) inadequate level of instrument handles/inadequate height of operating table, (b) poor position of monitor, and (c) inadequate patient positioning – poor exposure of surgical area. long-period, non-physiological posture creates musculoskeletal disorder and stress (Vereczkei et al., 2004) that could dispose surgeons to errors (Etchells et al., 2003; Wiegmann et al., 2007). Errors and delays resulting from inadequate arrangement of instruments and lack of communication and coordination were also noticed. Table 4 indicates that including the motion economy principles as part of the error mode taxonomy of the HTA/HEI techniques provides better understanding of the ergonomic deficiencies that dispose experienced, skilled surgeons (such as those we observed) to errors.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#


                     Stanton (2006) provides a comprehensive review on the development of HTA/HEI techniques and emphasises that since the first paper published in 1967 by Annett and Duncan (1967), HTA/HEI has remained a central approach for ergonomics. HTA/HEI has been used to detect potential human errors across industries (Joice et al., 1998; Phipps et al., 2008; Rose and Bearman, 2012; Stanton et al., 2009). However, HTA/HEI faces several limitations –as follows:


                     Practices: Al-Hakim et al. (2014) refer to the way in which an upper task is planned to achieve its goal as a ‘practice’. Different practices with different potential errors may be used to perform the same task. Al-Hakim et al. emphasise that one of the key limitations of HTA/HEI techniques is that they concentrate on examining potential errors in a predefined set of lower sub-tasks as performed, rather than examining the potential errors in the practice used to perform the upper tasks. These authors attempt to incorporate the practice adequacy as part of the error taxonomy for HTA/HEI.


                     Communication and teamwork: Research on the integration of teamwork with HTA/HEI is limited. Annett et al. (Annett et al., 2000) and Acton and Reinach (Acton and Reinach, 2003) show the possibility of integrating teamwork and communication as part of the task plan. However, their work lacks a taxonomy for predicting potential errors arising from failure to implement adequate communication and teamwork within a work environment.


                     Motion Economy: The traditional HTA/HEI approaches fail to take into account the principles of motion economy. Accordingly, an error resulting from such failure may be erroneously determined. The traditional principles of motion economy have been designed to suit mechanical work to be performed by single worker and, accordingly, require thorough revision and adaptation to suit the surgical environment – this is what we have attempted in this study.

There has been continual development on practices used to perform laparoscopic surgeries, including HAL surgeries. The practice selection mode taxonomy of Al-Hakim et al. (2014) provides a list of practices with higher potential errors (i.e., problematic practices) which may be applied to perform tasks in an operative environment and suggests alternative practices with lower error potential. Problematic practices require more resources, time or excessive precaution to avoid errors. This work offers an opportunity to surgeons to select most appropriate practices with minimal error potential. We intend to incorporate practice selection mode with motion economy in subsequent work, aiming to provide safer practice selection to surgeons from the perspective of motion economy.

The current study attempts to overcome HTA/HEI limitations through the following:
                        
                           a.
                           Revising and adapting the current principles of motion economy to suit the surgical environment.

Developing 3 new areas for motion economy principles, namely ‘work with sterile tools and material’, ‘communication and teamwork’ and ‘work on human body’.

Benefiting from the literature on ergonomics for surgery, this research develops 17 new principles that cover wider aspects of surgical environment.

Developing error taxonomy that comprises two sub-taxonomies; Motion Economy Error Taxonomy ‘MEET’, which focuses on violation of motion economy principles during surgery and Task Error Taxonomy ‘TET’, which considers the error modes of the traditional HTA/HEI approach.

The failure of HTA/HEI approaches to incorporate motion economy may confuse the exact cause of errors. Errors resulting from the violation of motion economy principles could be inferred wrongly by the exciting HEI taxonomies. To illustrate this, we consider the research of Joice et al. (1998) in which the error mode taxonomy of SHERPA is modified and used to detect human errors in 20 laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgeries conducted by 8 ‘fully trained’ surgeons. Joice et al. found that the highest number of errors was the failure to hold the gallbladder. Joice et al. attribute this error to the use of inadequate force or the use of wrong instruments (graspers, clip applicators and electrosurgical hook knives). Given the surgeons in their study were experienced and fully trained, we can conclude that there were factors other than ‘performance shaping factors’ (PSP) that led to such errors. The application of inadequate force or the selection of wrong instruments could be due to the following:
                        
                           1.
                           
                              
                                 Psychological Error Mechanism (PEM)
                              : Lack of confidence, difficulty to concentrate due to fatigue, lack of sleep or other psychological factors.


                              
                                 Inventory management
                              : Lack of availability of suitable instrument at the time of surgery.


                              
                                 Motion economy
                              : The recorded errors could be due to the violation of motion economy area ‘design of tools and equipment’, which is outside the scope of the current research, or the violation of principles of other areas of motion economy as we have defined them (Table 1). Possible contributing factors could thus be one or more of the following:
                                 
                                    (a)
                                    
                                       Height of operating table: Unsuitable height of operating table forces surgeon to have wrong posture which may create back and shoulder pain and affect the surgeon's hand and body motions (principles A1, A4, A5 and A9). As a result, surgeon's ability to manoeuvre correctly the laparoscopic instruments (or even select the correct instruments) could be affected.


                                       Location of the monitor: Inadequate location of the monitor violates the principle A7. It creates neck extraction and axial rotation of spine (van Det et al., 2009) and, as a result, may predispose surgeon to error.


                                       Blurred vision: impurities around endoscopic camera may transmit blurred image of the surgical field and create inadequate condition for seeing (Principle B6). Violation of principle B6 may affect the surgeon's ability to manoeuvre correctly the laparoscopic instrument and hold gallbladder adequately.


                                       Lack of coordination: Assistant surgeon may fail to coordinate the camera movement as required (principle D2) and affect the vision of the required surgical field.


                                       Long-period static posture: The prolonged static posture during surgery (principle A6) causes leg and back pain that may affect the surgeon performance (Vereczkei et al., 2004).

The above argument suggests that traditional HTA/HEI could capture various human errors during surgery but not necessarily the root causes that predispose experienced surgeons to errors. Needless to say that factors affecting the performance of experienced surgeons will also affect the performance of novice surgeons – likely even more, consistent with a significant body of evidence on surgical technical expertise.

Overall, in testing our methodology in 12 laparoscopic surgeries we found it promising in capturing errors and their root causes in terms of motion economy principles. It is important to note here that in developing our methodology we have intended to complement and improve rather than replace or discard the traditional HTA/HEI techniques. The introduction of motion economy principles as part of error mode taxonomy will allow us to recognise ergonomic deficiencies that predispose surgical team to errors and plan to reduce and eliminate future errors. Though errors captured during our observation were minor disruptive events that may not give rise to postoperative complications, the accumulation of these events, however, creates stress, fatigue and musculoskeletal problems and, as a result, affects the performance of the surgical team and endangers patient safety (Etchells et al., 2003; Vereczkei et al., 2004; Wiegmann et al., 2007). It should also be noted that non-technical errors could occur because of lack of experience and skill rather than ergonomic deficiencies. Such errors could also be captured by our methodology via TET elements. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use the principles of motion economy as part of HTA/HEI taxonomy. In addition to further analytical and empirical research, we believe that our developed list of principles (Table 1) can be used to educate surgeons in motion economy and other key ergonomic elements of working in the operating theatre.

There are some limitations in this study. The first limitation is that the study did not consider an important area in motion economy, that is, the area of ‘design of tools and equipment’. It is highly possible that an error could occur because of difficulty in handling or manoeuvring an instrument as a result of its poor design. The limited number of observations is another limitation. Only 12 laparoscopic surgeries were observed. With more observations, wider range of principles may be tested and indeed further additional principles may be discovered. The third limitation of this study is that there was no observations were made to test the applicability of the selected and developed principles in traditional open surgeries. Testing the applicability of motion economy principles on open surgeries is highly needed in order to develop more generalisable principles that could be applied across numerous procedures. The fourth limitation is that our study limits its focus on motion economy. There are other areas that may contribute to surgical errors, including for instance, the location of organs or tissues under treatment, and anatomical difficulties. Psychological factors such as lack of confidence and forgetfulness may contribute to errors and are worth of consideration. There is a possibility that some tasks are performed with practices that require excessive resources or extra precaution. Work practices are another aspect that requires further consideration (Al-Hakim et al., 2014). We are planning to consider these limitations in our future studies. We also plan to design an observational experiment to test the effect of improving motion economy according to the principles identified in this study on surgeons' performance and error reduction.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study asserts that traditional human error identification techniques fail to consider motion economy principles and, accordingly, their applicability in operating theatres may be limited. On the other hand, this study shows that traditional principles of motion economy were designed to facilitate the performance of a single worker implementing repetitive, mechanical work with definite steps. Accordingly, not all of these principles are applicable to the surgical environment and the applicable ones may require adaptation. Based on literature review and observations in theatres, this study considered two traditional areas of motion economy, i.e., ‘use of human body’ and ‘arrangement of workplace’, and created 3 new areas for motion economy, namely ‘work with sterile instruments and material’, ‘work on human body’ and ‘communication and teamwork’. A total of 30 principles of motion economy principles were identified (11 existing and 19 newly developed ones). These principles were integrated as part of an error mode taxonomy for human error identification techniques. The new error mode taxonomy comprises two parts; a motion economy error taxonomy (MEET) and a task error taxonomy (TET). A hierarchical task analysis was used to analyse the tasks of hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and the TET part of the developed taxonomy was used to identify the errors, while the MEET part was used to recognise the motion economy principles predisposing surgeons to errors. The newly developed taxonomy was prospectively tested in 12 laparoscopic surgeries performed by 5 experienced surgeons. A total of 86 errors were identified and successfully linked to motion economy deficiencies. This is a promising methodology for identifying and mitigating error-causing factors in operative environment. It is also a potentially useful way to educate surgeons about basic motion economy principles in their work.
