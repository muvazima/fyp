                  In recent years, hybridization of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with traditional mathematical programming techniques have received significant attention in the field of evolutionary computing (EC). The use of multiple strategies with self-adaptation manners can further improve the algorithmic performances of decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new multiobjective memetic algorithm based on the decomposition approach and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For brevity, we refer to our developed approach as MOEA/D-DE+PSO. In our proposed methodology, PSO acts as a local search engine and differential evolution works as the main search operator in the whole process of optimization. PSO updates the position of its solution with the help of the best information on itself and its neighboring solution. The experimental results produced by our developed memtic algorithm are more promising than those of the simple MOEA/D algorithm, on most test problems. Results on the sensitivity of the suggested algorithm to key parameters such as population size, neighborhood size and maximum number of solutions to be altered for a given subproblem in the decomposition process are also included.
