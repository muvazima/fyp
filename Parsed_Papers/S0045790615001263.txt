                  Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system plays a major role in the fourth generation wireless systems to provide high data rates. In this paper, a blind channel estimation approach has been proposed for finding the channel length based on the signals received from the MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) transceiver. The resultant MIMO channel length information is utilized for estimation of the channel impulse response of the system. The estimation is used for adaptation of the equalizer weights, based on the proposed Constant Modulus Algorithm which has reduced the fading and multipath propagation resulting from Inter Symbol Interference. The performance of the proposed system has been analyzed in terms of Mean Square Error and Symbol Error Rate for various Signal to Noise Ratio.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

MIMO is one of the most promising techniques for achievement of high data rates and reliability over the broadband wireless medium [1,2]. The major issues in wireless medium data transfer are limited transmit power, scarcity of spectrum and the inability to support high quality video streaming, owing to the limited data rates achievable over wireless links. MIMO technology has received considerable attention in wireless communication, since it offers a significant increase in data throughput and link range without the need for additional bandwidth or transmit power. MIMO technique can significantly enhance channel capacity by utilizing the spatial diversity provided by multiple paths.

The rising demand of data rate in wireless applications, shadowing, multipath propagation and various fading have introduced Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) in addition to the channel Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The blind equalization technique has been followed to minimize the effect of ISI distortion. In this technique, one or more properties of the transmitted signal have been used for estimation of the inverse of the channel. Many equalizers such as blind equalizer using High Order Statistics (HOS) [3], equalizer based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [4], Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) blind equalizer [5] and Turbo equalizer [6] have been introduced for enhancement of the system performance. The theoretical properties for blind equalizer such as the convergence of the blind equalization algorithm with respect to optimal condition and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with respect to equalizer’s length have been discussed in [7,8]. The heuristical experiments are generally used for determination of the equalizers lengths [9,10]. The general equalization scheme is not optimal for accuracy and computational complexity. The Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is well-established and frequently used blind equalization technique in many practical applications, since it does not require carrier synchronization [11–20]. The widely used CMA algorithms are Least Square CMA (LS-CMA) and Recursive Least Square CMA (RLS-CMA) for MIMO system. The LS-CMA can update the weight vector on a block by block basis, instead of each sample. When the block size is increased, the algorithm converges faster and the computational complexity increased due to the size increment in the estimated covariance matrix. The RLS-CMA requires more computations than the LS-CMA since the cost function is non-quadratic in the array weights. This algorithm provides greater convergence rate with the lagging ability to decrease the impact of interference contribution with equal modulus. A CMA approach has been utilized for suppression of the convergence error and for improvement of the equalization performance for multi-modulus symbols. In this approach, the channel length based on the statistics of the received signals from the MIMO transceiver has been used for the estimation of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) which in turn updates the equalizer weights to minimize the cost function for a better Mean Square Error (MSE) and reduced Symbol Error Rate (SER).

This paper is organized as follows: The system model is introduced in Section 2 and then the blind channel estimation scheme is briefly discussed in Section 3. The simulation results are presented in Section 4 and the Conclusion is given in Section 5.

                      is the additive noise at the j

At the receiver, the cyclic prefix is removed from the received signal and the channel is estimated using CMA for efficient retrieval of the signal. The detected signal is de-mapped and de-interleaved to obtain the estimate of the transmitted signal.

It is the process of converting the information from a source into symbols. In the transmitter, the Hamming code is used for encoding technique which can detect and correct the errors.

Interleaving is a method for arranging data in a non-contiguous manner for increasing performance. It is a technique commonly used in communication systems to overcome correlated channel noise such as fading or burst error. The input data are rearranged by the interleaver such that the consecutive data are spaced apart. At the receiver, the interleaved data streams are rearranged into the original sequence by the de-interleaver. The process of interleaving allows the correlated noise introduced in the transmission channel to be statistically independent at the receiver and hence improved error correction is obtained.

In Quadrature Amplitude Modulation technique, the data are developed by varying both the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal. Two carrier waves which are orthogonal to each other are chosen for this technique. Four bits are grouped by taking two bits from each carrier to form a symbol. The possible number of symbols is 24
                        =16 and one of these 16 possible signals is transmitted at each symbol period.

Cyclic prefix is prefixing the end of the symbol with a repetition in the beginning. The receiver is configured to discard the cyclic prefix samples and it is used to serve the following two purposes.
                           
                              (i)
                              The Inter Symbol Interference from the previous symbol is eliminated.

The linear convolution of frequency-selective multipath channel is modelled as the circular convolution and it can be transformed to the frequency domain using a discrete Fourier transform which is widely used for equalization and channel estimation.

The length of the cyclic prefix must be equal at least to the length of the multipath channel to achieve the effectiveness of the cyclic prefix. Though the concept of cyclic prefix is associated with OFDM systems, it can be extended to single carrier systems to achieve an improved robustness to multipath.

Transmission of the training symbols at the beginning can, in some applications, be impractical for the receiver initialization. The correct sampling points must be known in extracting the training symbols prior to the convergence of the equalizer. The information from the training sequences is required by the trained algorithm for convergence and hence consumes additional bandwidth. The blind equalization algorithms equalize the channel to rectify those demerits without the help of the training sequences and to provide higher data rates. They rely only on the constant modulus of the transmitted symbols and the statistical properties of the channel, in order to compensate the impairments caused by the channel [21–23]. Since there are no training sequences available, the blind equalization algorithm is adapted based on the weights of the equalizer by minimizing the cost function. Most of the communication signals exhibit the Constant Modulus (CM) property and experience loss of this property when corrupted by interference/noises. The CMA is the most widely used blind algorithm which restores this property without the source knowledge and can equalize both constant modulus and non-constant modulus (like QAM) signals.

In CMA, the envelope of the equalizer output can be restored to a constant by measuring the variation in the signals modulus and minimizing it by using the cost function defined as the difference between the present and the desired value of any property of the signal, which is a function for the error.

The conventional CMA expects the constellations with constant amplitude which can degrade the equalization performance when an M-QAM (M
                        >4) modulation is used. A novel CMA has been analyzed for improvement of the performance of the CMA for higher M-QAM (M
                        >4) in which the conventional CMA cost function is decomposed into real and imaginary parts allowing consideration of both the phase and the modulus of the equalizer output. The cost function is given through

Thus the proposed CMA algorithm has altered the cost function, making it dependent on the phase rotation, which has corrected the phase error and the Inter Symbol Interference effect is also reduced simultaneously and hence resulted in performance improvement.

The interference in the CP interval is estimated from the transmitted symbols and their cyclic prefix. The Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion is used with the estimated interference for blind detection of the channel length of the various paths [25]. This channel length information is used for estimation of the channel impulse response to evaluate the received signal.

The steps to be taken for the proposed blind channel estimation are as follows:
                           
                              (i)
                              Estimate the channel length blindly using MDL criterion.

With the estimated channel length, determine the channel impulse response.

From the received signal, calculate the equalized output signal.

Obtain the cost of the equalized signal using the proposed CMA cost function which specifies the signal noise level.

The equalizer updates its tap weights, when the cost is high.

The equalizer then calculates a new equalized signal using the updated tap weights and obtains a new cost and the process is repeated till the minimum cost is obtained.

A MIMO system employing two transmit and two receive antennas (Nt
                     
                     =
                     Nr
                     
                     =2) have been simulated using MATLAB. The various parameters used in this simulation are: (i) Hamming codes for encoding (ii) 16QAM as the mapping constellation (iii) the size of FFT/IFFT being 256 (iv) Step size of 0.01 with 4 taps and the threshold truncation error being chosen as 0.05. Fig. 2
                      depicts the frequency response of the proposed Constant Modulus Algorithm.

The performance analyses of the signal at the transmitter and at the receiver are shown in Figs. 3 and 4
                     
                      which depict the performance at each stage of the system.


                     Fig. 5
                      shows the scatter plots of the actual channel (H11, H12, H21 and H22) for the proposed 2×2 MIMO system. On determination of the characteristics of the channel, the impulse responses of the corresponding channels are estimated as depicted in Fig. 6
                     .

The theoretical weights of the taps with the channel impulse response being known, have been chosen with 0.1, 0, 1 and −0.5 and their simulated convergence characteristics are shown in Fig. 7
                     . From the sub-plots of the figure, it has been inferred that LS-CMA has been adapted faster with the increased cost function. It has also been observed that W3 has adapted faster than LS-CMA and followed LS-CMA with W4.

The proposed CMA has converged faster with reduced cost function and, when used with higher order taps, converges and remains constant, compared with other algorithms as depicted in Table 1
                     , whereby the constant modulus property is also achieved. Thus the convergence rate has been increased in the proposed CMA with four taps. The Mean Square Error (MSE) performance analysis of both LS-CMA and proposed CMA are depicted in Fig. 8
                     . From the characteristics, it is observed that the proposed CMA algorithm exhibits better MSE.

Thus the proposed CMA estimated output signal is in phase with the transmitted input signal without any offset and is shown in Fig. 9
                     .

The performance of the system has been analyzed in terms of Symbol Error Rate (SER) for various Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values as shown in Fig. 10
                     . The conventional CMA and LS-CMA require an additional SNR of 9dB and 6dB respectively, compared with the proposed CMA employing 2×2 MIMO system for achievement of a SER of 10−3. It has also been noticed that the desired SER of 10−3 can be achieved with the increased transmit and receive antennas (Nt
                     
                     =
                     Nr
                     
                     =4) even at 12dB which is about 27dB lower than LS-CMA due to its maximum diversity gain. The characteristic curve shows that the system employing the proposed CMA algorithm for channel estimation has obtained a lower Symbol Error Rate.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The transceiver for 2×2 MIMO system using the proposed Constant Modulus Algorithm has been implemented. The channel length has been detected blindly and the channel impulse response has been evaluated. The phase error offset has been corrected and the ISI effect has also been reduced simultaneously with decomposition of the cost function. The equalizer employing the proposed CMA algorithm has converged faster than the LS-CMA. The experimental results help realization of the fact that the proposed CMA can provide constant and minimized cost function compared to other algorithms. This algorithm can also provide better MSE and reduce the Symbol Error Rate.
