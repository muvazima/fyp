                  The present paper is devoted to the computation of optimal tolls on a traffic network that is described as fuzzy bilevel optimization problem. As a fuzzy bilevel optimization problem we consider bilinear optimization problem with crisp upper level and fuzzy lower level. An effective algorithm for computation optimal tolls for the upper level decision-maker is developed under assumption that the lower level decision-maker chooses the optimal solution as well. The algorithm is based on the membership function approach. This algorithm provides us with a global optimal solution of the fuzzy bilevel optimization problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

We discuss hierarchical problems of two decision makers, in which one – the so-called leader – has the first choice and the other one – the so-called follower – reacts optimally on the leader’s selection. It is important to note, that each decision-maker maximizes his/her own benefits independently, but is affected by actions of the other decision-maker (through externalities). The formulation of the bilevel programming problem for crisp (i.e. with exactly known and fixed) data can be found in, e.g. (Dempe, 2002).

Since its first formulation by Heinrich von Stackelberg in market economy (in the context of unbalanced economic markets), bilevel optimization has successfully been applied to many real world problems. For the past twenty years transportation problems have been benefiting from the formulation of advances in bilevel programming: (Ben-Ayed, Blair, Boyce, & LeBlanc, 1992; Brotcorne, Labbé, Marcotte, & Savard, 2001; Dempe, Fanghänel, & Starostina, 2009; Kim & Suh, 1988; Labbè, Marcotte, & Savard, 1998; Migdalas, 1995), which cover issues like network design, revenue management and other traffic control problems (where the transportation problem is on the lower level, depending on the parameter selected from the upper level).

Considering the inherently difficult nature of bilevel problems due to their nonconvexity, nonsmoothness and implicitly determined feasible set, it is difficult to design convergent algorithms, and the few algorithms that converge appear to be very slow most of the time. The reason that a global optimal solution of the bilevel optimization problem is difficult to compute is due to 
                        
                           NP
                        
                     -hardness of this problem (see Ben-Ayed & Blair, 1990; Blair, 1992).

More often than not we have to make decisions without being able to rely on precise information. Thus, it makes perfect sense to speak about fuzzy optimization problems from a vague predicate approach, as it is understood that this vagueness arises from the way we express the decision-makers’ knowledge and not from any random event. These problems proved to be very useful in many applied sciences, such as engineering, economics, applied mathematics, physics, as well as in other disciplines: (Chanas & Kuchta, 1996; Jiménez, Cadenas, Sánchez, Gómez-Skarmeta, & Verdegay, 2006; Peidro, Mula, Jiménez, & Botella, 2010; Shih & Lee, 1999; Weber, Werners, & Zimmerman, 1990; Zimmermann, 1976).

While some convergent algorithms for crisp bilevel problems already exist in the literature (see e.g. Bard, 1982; Bard & Moore, 1990; Bialas & Karwan, 1984; Dempe, 1987; Ishizuka & Aiyoshi, 1992; Önal, 1993; Tuy & Ghannadan, 1998; Wen & Huang, 1996; White & Anandalingam, 1993; Wu, Chen, & Marcotte, 1998), solution strategies for fuzzy bilevel programming problems are an emerging new field with a wide range of practical applicability.

The present work is devoted to the computation of optimal tolls on a traffic network that is described as a fuzzy bilevel optimization problem. As a fuzzy bilevel optimization problem we consider bilinear optimization problem with crisp upper and fuzzy lower levels.

An effective algorithm for computation optimal tolls for the upper level decision-maker is developed under assumption that the lower level decision-maker chooses the optimal solution as well.

The algorithm is based on the membership function approach (Dempe & Ruziyeva, 2012). The lower level fuzzy optimization problem is solved by a method of level-cuts (see Dempe & Ruziyeva, 2011; Ruziyeva & Dempe, 2012 for nonlinear case). Elements of the Pareto set of the corresponding biobjective optimization problem are interpreted as potential optimal solutions of the lower level fuzzy optimization problem on a certain level-cut. The optimal solution is selected due to the highest membership function value.

Then, this solution is used on the upper level such that, with respect to its region of stability, the optimal solution of the leader is found. For computation the regions of stability, Yager ranking indices are used (Liu & Kao, 2004; Ruziyeva & Dempe, 2013). Comparing all optimal solutions with respect to the upper level function value, the global optimal solution is found.

The roadmap of the present paper is the following. In Section 2 the general formulation of the fuzzy bilevel traffic network problem is given.

In Section 3 the solution approach to a fuzzy bilevel optimization problem is described.

The structured algorithm is presented in Section 4.

In Section 5 an illustrative example is solved with the help of the proposed approach.

The conclusions are presented in Section 6.

Let us assume that the government – as an upper level decision-maker – wants to restrict the traffic flow for the trucks on some streets near a certain landmark (e.g. a school, cultural heritage sites). One possible way is the use of tax-policy on some streets near this landmark. Certainly, the users of the network – the lower level decision-maker – try to minimize the overall costs and choose the cheaper path. But the price does not depend only on the taxes, but on, e.g. fuel, etc.

This is the pessimistic or strong approach (Dempe, 2002), which is used when the leader is not able to influence the follower and is forced to choose an approach bounding the damage resulting from an unfavorable selection by the follower. The resulting problem is:

In the case when none of the assumptions described earlier can be conceded, selection function approach (Dempe & Starostina, 2006) can be applied to the initial fuzzy bilevel optimization problem.

The selection approach 3. is quite new and it seems to be more appropriate for our needs. Let us denote some element of

                      describes the “environmental data” for the fuzzy lower level problem.

To compute the selection function the fuzzy linear optimization problem on the lower level has to be solved. We assume that an optimal solution of the fuzzy optimization problem has to be fuzzy and solve problem (2)–(6) using the membership function approach described in Dempe and Ruziyeva (2012) in detail.

The preferable optimal solution on the lower level

                      is supposed to have a maximal membership function value

                           (

                           )
                        
                     , i.e. according to Chanas and Kuchta (1994), the solution has the highest potential being realized by the follower. An algorithm for computation of values of the membership function of the elements of the fuzzy solution of the fuzzy linear optimization problem is also presented in Dempe and Ruziyeva (2012). With this innovative approach the decision-maker obtains a collection of some basic solutions, each accompanied by a measure of the extent to which it is the optimal solution of the fuzzy linear optimization problem on the lower level.

We are interested only in basic solutions of the fuzzy linear optimization problem (on the lower level) in view of the following

For computation regions of stability of each solution we have to compare fuzzy vectors. A problem of incomparability of the fuzzy vectors is solved by using Yager ranking indexes approach (Ruziyeva & Dempe, 2013).

The optimization problem on the upper level is a crisp linear optimization problem. Thus, it can easily be solved (see e.g. Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997).

Using of stability regions and a switch between two problems it is possible to find an optimal vector of coefficients at the upper level of the fuzzy bilevel optimization problem such that the chosen solution on the lower level stays optimal in the fuzzy bilevel programming problem. By examining all possible regions of stability, as it is proved below, we obtain the global optimal solution.

                            is a point, then the solution

                            is nonstable.


                           The algorithm is convergent.
                        

The feasible set X has a finite number of vertices, and according to Remark 1 we are interested only in the basic solutions. Let the total number of basic solutions be N. It is clear that 
                              
                                 N

                                 ∞
                              
                           . Thus, for each best solution on the lower level we obtain its region of stability. The total number of the regions of stability cannot exceed N. Taking into consideration Corollary 1 and Remark 5, the theorem is proved.□

In the present paper the algorithm solving the problem of optimal tolls on the traffic network is described. The problem itself is presented as the bilinear fuzzy bilevel optimization problem. At the lower level the fuzzy optimization problem is solved by methods of the level-cuts.

The optimal solution on the certain level is selected due to the highest membership function value as the best solution. Then, this solution is involved in a switch between upper and lower level problems such that, with response to the region of stability, the described algorithm gives a global optimal solution of the fuzzy bilinear bilevel optimization problem. Thus, the leader can see correlation of the tolls on the certain paths with solution of the follower.

This method is illustrated with the example of the traffic problem with given fuzzy costs. As the leader we can see the government that can use the tolls to motivate the users of the network to avoid certain regions, such as UNESCO world heritage sites on the path

                     . On the other hand, using the toll policy it is also possible to oblige the users to choose the certain path
