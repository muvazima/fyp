                  In this article, a novel technique for fixation prediction and saccade generation will be introduced. The proposed model simulates saccadic eye movement to incorporate the underlying eye movement mechanism into saliency estimation. To this end, a simple salience measure is introduced. Afterwards, we derive a system model for saccade generation and apply it in a stochastic filtering framework. The proposed model will dynamically make a saccade toward the next predicted fixation and produces saliency maps. Evaluation of the proposed model is carried out in terms of saccade generation performance and saliency estimation. Saccade generation evaluation reveals that the proposed model outperforms inhibition of return. Also, experiments signify integration of eye movement mechanism into saliency estimation boosts the results. Finally, comparison with several saliency models shows the proposed model performs aptly.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The role of eye movements in visual attention has been a subject of dispute for years. The argument on the importance of saccadic eye movements in visual perception dates back to the late 1960s. At that point, a group of scientists considered it of no use, while another group supported the essential role of saccadic eye movements in visual perception. Recent studies show that saccadic eye movements play a major role in visual attention [1].

Saccadic eye movements help to keep the object of interest in the center of vision and prevent sensory adaptation. Although saccadic head movements can be a replacement in the absence of eye movements, lack of any of these movements can result in temporal blindness [2]. This gives the intuition that saccadic movements (in the head or eye) might provide a sampling mechanism for the brain to perform visual perception.

We know that saccades occur during prolonged visual fixation. Recent studies show that saccades also happen during visual search, and their dynamics is under the influence of visual stimulation and viewing task [3]. Tatler and Vincent [4] provide evidence that eye movement information (e.g. saccade length and saccade duration) has great contribution to human perception and incorporating it into a model can improve prediction of where a human choose to fixate. This provides enough motivation for proposing a method for simulating saccadic eye movements and predicting fixation points.

The study of eye movements can be tackled from two perspectives, sciences, including psychology and neuroscience; and computer vision. Considering the first viewpoint, Koch and Ullman [5] defined a winner-take-all neural network over saliency maps to recognize the focus of attention while studying psychophysical evidences.

Brockmann and Geisel [6] studied human eye movements and simulated human scanpath using a Levy flight. Later, Najemnik and Geisler [7] showed that eye movement behavior can be simulated optimally using a Bayesian ideal observer in a search task for a specific target. They applied Kalman filtering which assumes the process is Gaussian.

Renninger et al. [8] probed the underlying decision strategies that govern eye movement planning. Their study proves the findings of [7] and reveals that an approximate local rule as well as minimization of global uncertainty may govern eye movement decisions.

In the annals of computer vision, Itti et al. [9] provided the first successful implementation of [5] where they simulated the inhibition of return mechanism to imitate eye movements. Boccignone and Ferraro [10] implemented the idea of [6] by a Metropolis algorithm to simulate human scanpath given a saliency map.

In [11], a dynamic visual attention mechanism was introduced. It utilized features' incremental code length to measure the entropy gain of each feature. In order to introduce dynamics to the system, fixation point locations are assumed to correlate by a Laplacian distribution over time. To derive a scanpath, each time a saliency map with foveal bias is generated and the next saccade toward a fixation point is computed. It is argued that this process will result to an inhibition of return like mechanism for still images.

Recently, Wang et al. [12] proposed a method of saccadic scanpath simulation which is based on information maximization principles and produces a dynamic saliency map. It depends on site entropy rate [13], which utilizes fully connected graphs to compute saliency maps after happening of each saccade.

In this paper, a model for simulating saccadic eye movement and fixation prediction is introduced. The proposed model tries to incorporate the underlying eye movement mechanism that exists in a human into saliency computation. Thus, we define a system model for saccade generation and apply it in a stochastic filtering framework. The proposed model will dynamically make a saccade toward the next predicted fixation and produces saliency maps. The main contribution is proposing a method for simulating eye movements using a stochastic scheme and embedding it in the process of saliency detection.

Accepting the role of eye movement in visual perception, we have to concur the dependence of the two on each other. Hence, in order to model the eye movements, we come up with a local visual perception metric based on visual attention theories.

Visual attention theories have been center of attention in psychology, and neuroscience for ages. There exist good publication records back to the 50s. Readers can refer to [14] for a good review of early works in psychology and a study of a computational method of visual attention.

Attention is under influence of both scene-driven stimuli and expectation-driven stimuli. Techniques that model the first one are recognized as bottom–up approaches and the latter as top–down. In computer vision, initial publications related to bottom–up approaches appear in the late 90s. Since publication of [9] as one of the earliest successful publications in computer vision, there has been a lot of research in this field (e.g. [15–26]). An in-depth analysis of visual attention models is provided by Borji and Itti [27,28], they classify the models based on thirteen criteria derived from behavioral and computational studies.

In this study, we are focusing on scene-driven stimuli and try to define a proper bottom–up measure. We believe a suitable visual stimuli measure should have the following factors, 1) locally estimableness, 2) fast computability, and 3) biological plausibility. Thus, we derive a method based on center-surround technique which has both biological and information theoric plausibilities [16].

In the center–surround technique, the hypothesis is that dividing a local region into a center and surround, the center will contain stimuli of interest and surround consists of a null hypothesis.

In order to estimate p(f|m, 1) and p(f|m, 0), unlike [16,29,30] who apply a general Gaussian model or [18] who apply histogram approximation, we perform a nonparametric kernel density estimation. This lets us express Eq. (2) in terms of kernel estimation formulation and Gaussian kernel as follows:

Different features (e.g. color, orientation, and motion) contribute to eye guidance in development of visual attention [32]. There exist methods reporting quite good results only using the Lab color space (e.g. [23,24]). So, the proposed method adapts the CIE-Lab color space as features and the final amount of visual stimuli is measured as follows:

The proposed eye movement model applies stochastic filtering to simulate saccades and predict fixation points. Fig. 2
                      provides a simplified high-level conceptual description of the proposed model. As depicted, starting from a random state, eyes are moved toward a new location where a fixation may happen. Depending on the fixation happening, visual memory is updated.

In the rest of this section, we will initially go through the basis of the proposed saccadic eye movement model explaining dynamics and observations of the system. Afterwards, a saccade and fixation generation algorithm is provided; followed by a method to derive saliency maps from fixations.

Although the underlying mechanism of human eye movement is complicatedly unknown, there exist convincing studies that suggest the influence of the immediate preceding saccade and fixation properties on one saccade [33,34,4]. This can be interpreted as if eye movement behavior is highly dependent on its current state. Thus, we can define the saccade process as a Markovian process of order one. This allows us to apply Bayesian filtering approaches to the above system [35] where we adapt a particle filtering approach [36]. Algorithm 1 provides a conceptual insight of the eye evolution using particle filters.

                              Eye state evolution using particle filtering.


                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              

It has been proven that saccadic eye movement happens in free-viewing task and during fixation [3]. Hence, the proposed model considers two states of saccade and fixation which can produce a scanpath. To extract saccade information at time k, we consider the particle that has the winning score. This provides saccade and fixation generation a greedy nature which is in compliance with global and local optimality proved by [7]. Algorithm 2 provides details on generating saccade and fixations using the proposed model.

In order to derive saliency maps, we adapt a method which is similar to production of fixation density maps from human observer eye tracking data [37]. It consists of three steps of filtering out saccadic eye movements during free viewing task, omission of fixation points without enough nearest neighbors and smoothing the obtained map.

Here, we directly obtain the fixation points from Algorithm 2 and make a fixation map. The saliency map is obtained by

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

In this section, we initially introduce running parameters of the model. Afterwards, we explain datasets, evaluation metric and finally evaluate the proposed model.

In order to run the model, we normalize input image size to 128×171. The proposed model consists of several parameters that we learn from human eye tracking data. To learn those parameters, we use two datasets of NUSEF [38] and MART [39]. The first parameter is p(d) where d is the length of a saccade. To learn p(d), we extract saccade length from the human eye movement. Afterwards, we fit a distribution to the extracted statistics to obtain p(d). Fig. 4
                         depicts human saccade length statistics and some fitted distributions. A Gaussian mixture which has fitted better to the underlying distribution is adapted in the experiments.

The other parameter is P
                        0 which is fixation probability. It is learnt by dividing the total number of fixation samples to that of recorded eye samples. This results in P
                        0
                        =0.4493 which means, in a free viewing task, less than 45% of eye positions consist of fixation points. There are two observation related parameters P
                        1 and τ. P
                        1 is estimated by computing the average number of fixations that fall within the 99% most salient human fixation map divided by the total number of fixations which reveals P
                        1
                        =0.7834. We set τ
                        =0.6673 which is the average human fixation map salience value of the fixation points belonging to the 99% most salient region.

Visual stimuli neighborhood size was selected randomly in the range of r
                        ∈[8,26]; σ
                        0 and σ
                        1 are set to 10 and 1, respectively, and always n
                        =8pixels are evaluated. The final smoothing kernel has σ
                        =0.2 and α
                        =0.4 to produce the saliency map. The parameters are optimized using the images provided by [37].

Performance evaluation is done using two publicly available datasets. The first dataset contains 120 images and their corresponding fixation data provided by Tsotsos and Bruce [40]. The dataset consists of everyday life images of size 681×511 and eye fixation density maps of 20 viewers. The second dataset consists of 1003 images gathered from Flicker creative commons and LabelMe provided by [41]. The images are of various contents and are accompanied by data for 15 human observers. In the rest of this paper, we will refer to them as ‘YORK’ and ‘MIT’, respectively.

For analysis of saccade generation, a dataset with more sparse fixation points would be harder to simulate. Inter-image fixation sparsity was analyzed by comparing a fixation density map of one image against itself using sAUC. This analysis reveals how many fixation points happen close to each other considering different images after eliminating the center bias effect. The result is summarized in Table 1
                        . As depicted, MIT has a sparser inter-image fixation statistics which makes it a more difficult dataset.

There exists a variety of evaluation metrics for scanpath and saliency analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) is a measure applicable for both scanpath analysis and saliency estimation evaluation [42,43]. Moreover, it is widely recognized in different societies and computer vision.

To compute AUC, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves shall be computed. It analyzes saliency values at human fixation (positive) and nonfixated (negative) points to discriminate them. In its original form, it suffers from border effect and center bias problem; thus, it is suggested to use all fixations over other images to take negative samples [44,29,28]. This approach is recognized as shuffled ROC curve (sROC) and the area under the curve is abbreviated sAUC. In this paper, we adapt sAUC to evade the aforementioned problems.

                           We use Borj et al. [28] sAUC implementation available at https://sites.google.com/site/saliencyevaluation/evaluation-measures.
                        
                     

@&#EVALUATION@&#

The evaluation of the proposed model consists of two parts. The first part emphasizes on the scanpath generation which is a major property of the proposed model. The last part is devoted to comparing the method regarding saliency estimation where it is shown how the proposed method can boost saliency detection. Eventually, we compare the method with several saliency techniques.


                           Fig. 5
                            presents several scanpaths obtained applying the proposed model and corresponding human scanpaths. As depicted, human scanpath varies from one observer to the other. The proposed model somewhat resembles human observers, though it is not an exact correspondence. This is fine because the proposed model is expected to behave generally similar to a human and is not supposed to replicate a specific observer. But it also highlights the necessity of quantitative assessment.

We assess the proposed model's ability of saccade generation by comparing it to the inhibition of return (IOR) [9]. It is not fair to compare IOR saccades generated using original saliency maps described in [9] with the proposed method because of the difference in the underlying salience measure. Hence, we also generate another saccade sequence using IOR and a saliency map obtained using the proposed visual stimuli. To this end, the proposed visual stimuli method is run using a sliding window procedure (VS_sliding) similar to that described in [31] and IOR mechanism is applied on it. The first sequence will be referred to as Original Inhibition of Return (OIR) and the latter one will be named Updated Inhibition of Return (UIR).

Saccade sequence generation assessment is done by obtaining fixation density maps from saccade sequences as described in Section 3.3 and computing sAUC score. Table 2
                            summarizes the results. As reported, the proposed model has the best sAUC performance on both datasets. This provides convincing evidence to support superiority of the proposed model in saccade sequence generation.

It is expected that the proposed saccade generation scheme boosts salience estimation. To investigate this, we compare the proposed model fixation density map and saliency maps obtained from VS_sliding. This reveals us that incorporating an eye movement mechanism to a saliency estimation scheme will boost the results.


                           Fig. 6
                            depicts sROC for the proposed model and VS_sliding. It clearly shows the boosting properties of incorporating an eye movement mechanism into saliency estimation and supports the proposed hypothesis of improving performance by means of incorporating eye movement mechanism into saliency estimation.

Finally, we compare both VS_sliding and the proposed model to evaluate saliency estimation power of the framework compared to other saliency estimation techniques using the sAUC evaluation provided by [28]. The comparison includes Itti et al. [9], Entropy [45], Torralba [46], Itti & Baldi (Surprise) [47], Saliency Toolbox (STB) [48], Le Meuret al. [37], Frintrop (Vocus) [49], Bruce & Tsotsos (AIM) [40], Gaussian [50], Harel et al. (GBVS) [25], Mancas (Local Rarity & Global Rarity) [51], Hou & Zhang (HouCVPR) [20], Hou & Zhang (HouNIPS) [11], Zhang et al. (SUN) [29], Kootstra et al. [52], Seo & Milanfar (SDSR) [53], Bian et al. [54], Marat et al. [55], Judd et al. [41], Diaz et al. (AWS) [56], Jia Li et al. [57], Guo et al. (PQFT) [58], Avraham et al. (ESaliency) [59], Yan et al. [60] and Yin Li et al. [61].


                           Fig. 7
                            compares the proposed model performance to the mentioned models on YORK and MIT. As shown, VS_sliding does not perform very good on neither datasets. However, the proposed model is the best after the human in case of YORK and is the third considering MIT. For clarity, we rank saliency models based on the average sAUC score distance to human in Fig. 8
                           . As depicted, the VS_sliding ranks 16th and the proposed model ranks the 2nd.

The only method that performs better is [56] which is based on the adaptation of the basis of low level features to the statistical structure of the images that provides strong visual discriminant properties. On the other hand, the proposed model utilizes a simple salience measure. Applying that salience measure by itself (VS_sliding) does moderate. However, incorporating it in the proposed model which gets advantage of eye movement mechanism, produces significant improvement.

To summarize, we evaluated the proposed model in terms of saccade generation and salience estimation. The experiments revealed that the proposed model has a better saccade generation power compared to inhibition of return. It was also shown that embedding eye movement mechanism in salience estimation boosts the results.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this article, we introduced a novel bottom–up technique to simulate saccadic eye movements and predict fixations. A visual stimuli measure based on biologically plausible center-surround theory was defined to estimate the salience measure. It utilizes kernel density estimation to evaluate pop-out property of a central pixel compared to the surrounding pixels.

To simulate eye movements, we considered a system model inspired by the mechanism of inhibition of return in visual working memory. The dynamics of the system accumulates the information of visited locations along with their fixation status and tries to inhibit revisits. The model's observations rely on the defined visual stimuli measure. Considering the evidence of the high contribution of the current eye state to the next saccade, the system was solved as a Markovian system of order one using a particle filter framework.

An algorithm was introduced to derive saccades and fixation points by investigating the places visited by a winning particle. Fixation prediction is achieved by marking an image coordinate as fixation, if the winning particle visited that coordinate having a fixation status. We used predicted fixation points to make a fixation map. Then, a saliency map was derived by smoothing the fixation map.

We evaluated the proposed model in terms of saccade generation and saliency estimation. We compared the method with inhibition of return mechanism to evaluate its saccade generation power. Experiments showed that the proposed model performs better than IOR. Saliency experiments indicated saliency estimation boosting by incorporation of eye movement simulation. Also, the proposed model was compared to a wide range of saliency estimation techniques which revealed that the proposed model performs aptly.

In the future research, we will target combining top–down information modulation (e.g. face detection, text recognition…) and investigating more sophisticated system models that incorporate more eye movement components (e.g. saccade orientation, saccade and fixation duration…).
