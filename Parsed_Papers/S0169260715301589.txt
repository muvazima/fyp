                  Background and objective
                  Transfer function (TF) is an important parameter for the analysis and understanding of hemodynamics when arterial stenosis exists in human arterial tree. Aimed to validate the feasibility of using TF to diagnose arterial stenosis, the forward problem and inverse problem were simulated and discussed.
               
               
                  Methods
                  A calculation method of TF between ascending aorta and any other artery was proposed based on a 55 segment transmission line model (TLM) of human artery tree. The effects of artery stenosis on TF were studied in two aspects: stenosis degree and position. The degree of arterial stenosis was specified to be 10–90% in three representative arteries: carotid, aorta and iliac artery, respectively. In order to validate the feasibility of diagnosis of artery stenosis using TF and support vector machine (SVM), a database of TF was established to simulate the real conditions of artery stenosis based on the TLM model. And a diagnosis model of artery stenosis was built by using SVM and the database.
               
               
                  Results
                  The simulating results showed the modulus and phase of TF were decreasing sharply from frequency 2 to 10Hz with the stenosis degree increasing and displayed their unique and nonlinear characteristics when frequency is higher than 10Hz. The diagnosis results showed the average accuracy was above 76% for the stenosis from 10% to 90% degree, and the diagnosis accuracies of moderate (50%) and serious (90%) stenosis were 87% and 99%, respectively. When the stenosis degree increased to 90%, the accuracy of stenosis localization reached up to 94% for most of arteries.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  The proposed method of combining TF and SVM is a theoretically feasible method for diagnosis of artery stenosis.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Artery stenosis is one kind of arterial disease in human cardiovascular system caused by the lesion of artery wall or congenital dysplasia disease, which usually occurs in the large and middle-sized arteries, such as carotid, cerebral, coronary and renal arteries [1,2]. This disease directly affects the normal operation of relevant organs, causes organ insufficiency or degradation, and results in serious consequences: stroke, myocardial infarction, renal function loss, etc [3,4]. Therefore, the early detection of arterial stenosis is very important for reducing the high morbidity and mortality caused by the kind disease.

The diagnosis technologies of artery stenosis mainly include digital subtraction angiography (DSA), transcranial Doppler (TD), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), etc [5–7]. Although these powerful technologies have advanced greatly, disadvantages still exist for each procedure. For example, DSA is an invasive method, though it is considered to be a gold standard; TD has low accuracy for the detection of stenosis of small arteries; CTA exposes patients to X-ray radiation and cannot completely prevent allergy to iodinated contrast agents; MRA is expensive. Moreover, pieces of equipment used in these technologies are mainly applied in hospitals and are not suitable for large area screenings. Therefore, a non-invasive, portable and simple technology has to be developed as a valuable complement to current methods, which is urgently needed for the large area screening of early artery stenosis [8–10].

The pulse-wave-based analysis method is a potential portable and noninvasive diagnosis technology of artery stenosis. Some useful parameters have been proposed based on this method, such as ankle brachial index (ABI) [11], pulse wave velocity (PWV) [12], transfer function (TF) [13], input impedance [14]. ABI is only used to detect the arterial stenosis of lower extremity, but not to detect the arterial stenosis of upper extremity, chest, abdomen, etc. Input impedance has been demonstrated numerically to be a valuable and useful parameter for the prediction of the artery stenosis in the human artery tree [15]. However, it is difficult to measure or calculate the input impedance of human arterial tree in clinic trials [14,16]. The measurement or calculation of TF is easier than input impedance and also represents the mechanical and geometrical features of human arterial tree like input impedance. Because it is not affected by the blood pressure and flow waveform, TF has been successfully applied to noninvasively measure central blood pressure by using blood pressure waveform of radial or brachial artery, and achieved some good clinical results [17,18].

Some researches have demonstrated there is a relation between TF and stenosis to some extent. Rajani [19] validated the central blood pressure and TF changed when some stenosis exist in human arterial tree. Gong [20] and Reinhard [21] evaluated the validity of the transfer function analysis in the assessment of human cerebral autoregulation in patients with carotid or basilar artery stenosis. Chao [22] conducted a study on comparisons of the baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability in patients with carotid stenosis and normal controls by using the method of TF analysis. Although a few valuable results and conclusions were obtained, the mathematical relation or model between TF and stenosis has not been established. In order to discover the potential of pulse-wave-based method for stenosis diagnosis, it is worthwhile to study the relation or modeling between of them.

In this paper, two aspects were mainly discussed: (1) A calculating method of TF was firstly proposed based on our previously presented transmission line model of 55 segment human arterial tree [23]. Then, one discussed the effects of arterial stenosis degree and position on the TF between ascending artery and carotid artery, radial artery and tibial artery. (2) Support vector machine (SVM) [24–27], a machine learning method based on statistics, was introduced into the diagnosis of artery stenosis with TF as the feature vector of SVM model, and was validated by numerical simulation experiments. In the experiments, firstly, we built a database of samples using the transmission line model of human artery tree. Secondly, TF for each sample was calculated by a serial multiplication algorithm. Finally, two prediction models, one for stenosis existence, other for stenosis localization, were built by SVM and TF, and used to predict artery stenosis. The effects of the degree and position of artery stenosis on the prediction accuracy were discussed.

The schematic diagram of the human arterial tree of this study is shown in Fig. 1
                           . The original physiology data of the arterial tree was compiled by Noordergraaf et al. [28], and subsequently modified by Westerhof et al. [29], Avolio [30], Stergiopulos et al. [31], Wang and Parker [32], Liang et al. [33], and Alastruey and Parker et al. [34]. The arterial model of this study is based upon Stergiopuloss version of data that has 55 segments. The detail vascular dimensions and elastic constants refer to Ref. [19].

A single segment of artery is the basic computational unit of arterial tree, which can be considered as a thin-walled cylindrical tube having internal viscous, elastic and inertial properties with external coupling to the surrounding tissue which produce a longitudinal constraint [35]. This presentation was commonly used in many references to research the wave propagation of pulsatile blood pressure and flow in a single artery by solving the Navier–Stokes equations.

The characteristic impedance of an arterial segment as derived by Womersley [36,37] is

                           where i represents the number of artery between ascending aorta and tibial artery.

According to the standard model of human arterial tree and Eqs. (1)–(12), the TF
                           
                              i
                            of each single artery can be calculated in frequency domain by sampling an arithmetic progression of ω from 0 to 10Hz. Then, TF between any two point in human arterial tree can be obtained via multiplying TF
                           
                              i
                            according to Eq. (13). The obtained TF is also an arithmetic progression which is used as a feature vector or a sample of database in frequency domain. By changing the parameters of the standard model, one can obtain the different feature vectors.

Because arterial length, diameter, wall thickness, Young's modulus, peripheral resistance parameters varies from person to person, it is important to reflect this diversity in the sample database. Therefore, these five parameters were specified to be 80%, 100% and 120% of the normal values. For each sample in database, only one stenosis segment exists in the arterial tree. Stenosis degree was changed from 10% to 90% of the cross-sectional areas of normal artery. In order to study the effect of stenosis position on the accuracy, we set a stenosis in the artery segment [1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 15, 25, 31, 49, 50, 53, 55], respectively. Each TF of different condition was calculated by Eq. (13) and put into the database as a sample with the information of the number and degree of stenosis.

According to stenosis degree and a specified threshold, all samples were divided into positive and negative samples. For example, if the threshold is specified to be 50%, the TF will be treated as positive sample when the stenosis degree is more than 50%, conversely negative sample. In database, each sample consists of TF and a label +1 or −1 representing a positive or negative sample. The total number of samples in database is shown in Table 1

Vapnik et al. developed the SVM based on the structural risk minimization principle of statistical learning theory [26,40]. The SVM has been widely used in the real world for classification and regression [26,41,42]. In linearly separable cases, the SVM is trained to construct a hyperplane H

In nonlinearly separable cases, SVM maps input vectors into a high dimensional feature space by using a kernel function K(P

                           ). Thus the nonlinearly separable problem is transformed as a linearly separable problem in the high dimensional space. In this case, the decision function of classification is changed into the following:

                              j

Both K-fold and leave one-out cross validation are very popular technique used to evaluate classifier or model performance as a strategy of validation in machine learning field [43–47]. Leave one-out cross validation could be considered to be the special case of K-fold cross validation when K is equal to the number of all samples. But it is commonly used in the case of small samples. On the contrary, K-fold cross validation usually is employed in large samples. In this study, the number of samples is too large to use the leave one-out cross validation. Therefore, we chose the K-fold cross validation in this paper, which is commonly used in some literatures.

There are two kinds of K-fold cross validation: stratified and shuffled (random) K-fold. In stratified K-fold, folds are selected to make the mean response value approximately equal in all the folds. A dichotomous classification means that each fold contains roughly the same proportions of the two types of class labels. But shuffled K-fold could not meet this hypothesis. In order to obtain an acceptable result, we usually select roughly the same proportions of the two types of class labels to build the model in reality diagnosis. So we chose the stratified K-fold in the study.

In normal case, there is no stenosis in 55 segment human arterial tree. Transfer function between any two points in arterial tree can be calculated by using Eqs. (1)–(13). Generally, the TF between ascending aorta and other artery is the hot spot of research, such as radial artery, carotid artery and tibial artery. Fig. 2
                            showed the normal modulus and phase of TF in low frequency domain between the No. 1 ascending aorta to the No. 11 radial artery, the No. 19 carotid artery and the No. 55 tibial artery.

In order to study the effect of artery stenosis degree on TF in the arterial tree, the No. 11, 25 and 49 were specified to be stenosis, respectively. The cross-section area was used to evaluate stenosis degree. For each stenosis artery, the stenosis degree was set to be 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90%. In addition, only one segment artery was specified as a stenosis artery in each simulation.

Their modulus and phase of TF are shown in Figs. 3–7
                           
                           
                           
                           
                            for the No. 11, 25 and 49 arterial stenosis, respectively. From Fig. 3, one could see that the influence is very obvious in the modulus and phase of TF by stenosis degree. With increasing stenosis degree, the high frequency part of modulus in greater than 4Hz decreased more obvious than the low frequency. The peak of modulus decreases slowly toward low frequency domain when stenosis degree is less than 80%, but decreases sharply when greater than 80%. The phase accelerates the decrease in the middle frequency domain. Besides, one found that the TF between ascending aorta and the No. 19 and 55 arteries were influenced slightly by the stenosis of carotid artery.

From Figs. 4 and 5, one found the similar results on the modulus and phase of TF between the No. 1 and 55 (or 19) arteries with different stenosis in the No. 25 artery. But the extent of impact by the No. 25 artery stenosis is less than the No. 11 on TF, especially for the phase of TF. An interesting phenomenon is that the modulus of TF increases in the high frequency domain and appears two peaks. The reason for this trend is that the stenosis of the No. 25 artery is outside the path between the No. 1 and 55 arteries. The results showed that aortic stenosis can influence both TF, regardless of whether the aortic stenosis exists inside and outside the path of the two arteries used to calculate TF.


                           Fig. 6 showed the modulus and phase of TF between the No. 1 and the No. 55 artery with different stenosis in the No. 49 artery. The changing tendency is also similar to Fig. 4. The change mainly focuses on the middle frequency domain, but there is no obvious change in phase. Fig. 7 showed the modulus and phase of TF between the No. 1 and 19 arteries with different stenosis in the No. 49 artery. From Fig. 7, one could see there is no obvious change in both modulus and phase of TF, which is quite different from the change tendency in Fig. 5. It means the artery stenosis in lower limbs only influences obviously TF between ascending aorta and tibial artery, but TF between ascending aorta and radial or carotid artery is quite different.

Arterial stenosis position is important information for the diagnosis and treatment in clinical trial. In order to reveal the relationship between TF and arterial stenosis position, the arterial stenosis degree were specified to be a same degree 70%. The arterial stenosis was set in the No. 12, 25, 31, 49, 50 and 53 arteries, respectively. The simulation results of TF between ascending aorta and 11, 19 and 55 were shown in Figs. 8–10
                           
                           
                           .

In Fig. 8, the modulus of TF has no obvious difference below 2Hz and has very difference above this frequency. The phase of TF has a little difference in the whole frequency domain, except for the No. 53 artery in the high frequency domain. The peak of modulus of TF decreases gradually with increasing the distance from the stenosis to heart, except the No. 12 artery.

In Figs. 9 and 10, one found the similar effect of the stenosis on TF. When the frequency is below 3Hz, the modulus of TF showed little change. When the frequency is above 3Hz, there is a large change in the modulus of TF for the No. 12, 25 or 31 arterial stenosis, but little change for the No. 49, 50 or 53 arterial stenosis. From the point of view of stenosis position, the peaks of the modulus of TF are increasing gradually with the distance of the No. 12, 25 or 31 arterial stenosis from the heart, which is opposite to the trend in Fig. 8. The main difference in the phase of TF occurred in the part of high frequency.

The threshold of artery stenosis was specified to be 10–90%, which represents the different stages of artery stenosis. According to a given threshold, all samples were divided into the positive and negative samples. Then, a diagnosis model of artery stenosis was built by SVM and the labeled samples of training and testing sets which were established by the method of 10 cross validation. Table 1 shows the results of SVM with 10-cross validation for the stenosis threshold 90%. The average accuracy of Q
                           
                              P
                           , Q
                           
                              N
                            and Q are 80.7%, 99.7% and 97.8%, respectively. The Q
                           
                              P
                            and Q
                           
                              N
                            columns show that the accuracies of positive samples are lower than the negative. It means the stenosis artery, in the case, is misclassified partially to be a normal artery. Conversely, the vast majority of normal samples are diagnosed accurately. Table 2
                            shows the average accuracies of SVM with 10 cross validation on the training set and testing sets of positive and negative samples as the stenosis degree are specified to be 10–90%. From the Q item of Table 2, one can see the accuracies are above 76% and increase with the degree of artery stenosis increasing. When the degree of arterial stenosis goes above 70%, the accuracy of diagnosis reaches over 90%. The Q
                           
                              P
                            and Q
                           
                              N
                            columns show the accuracies of positive samples are better than those of the negative when the threshold of arterial stenosis is below 30%. It means the normal samples are easily diagnosed to be a stenosis artery. But, the imbalance of the number of positive and negative samples may lead to those results. This phenomenon does not appear when the narrow threshold reaches over 30%.


                           Table 3
                            shows the diagnosis results of SVM for 50% stenosis in different artery segments. In this table, the accuracies Q of stenosis diagnosis are over 87% when a 50% stenosis exists in the No. 1, 2, 10, 13, 25, 31, 49, 50, 53 and 55 artery segments, respectively. However, the accuracy Q of diagnosis for the No. 11 and 15 stenosis artery are only 62.1% and 60.7%, respectively, and Q
                           
                              P
                            are 25.8% and 22.4%. The results demonstrate SVM is suitable for the diagnosis of arterial stenosis which exists between two detected points obtaining TF, but not suitable for the situation out of the two points. When the threshold of stenosis changes into 90%, the accuracies of SVM are shown in Table 4
                           . The total accuracies of the diagnosis are all beyond 99%, except 91.4% and 90.7% for the No. 11 and 15, respectively. The low accuracies mainly results from the item Q
                           
                              P
                            which dropped to 18% and 11.5%. It also indicated, as for severe stenosis artery, TF and SVM is a feasible method for the stenosis diagnosis of center artery but has a few limitations for the stenosis of branch artery outside the two detecting points used to obtain TF.

Because the stenosis position is an important information in the clinical diagnosis, a multi-classification model was built to predict the position of stenosis based on the above theory and a new database. The database was built by specifying a stenosis of length 2cm and stenosis degree 50–90% in the arteries 1, 2, 10, 11, 13, 15, 25, 31, 49, 50, 53, 55, respectively. Then, TFs between ascending aorta and tibial artery were calculated as a feature vector in the database. The five parameters of arterial tree: arterial length, diameter, wall thickness, Young's modulus and peripheral resistance, also were changed by the same manner mentioned in Section 2.2.1 to guarantee sample diversity.

In order to diagnose which segment exists a stenosis, a multi-classifier of SVM was built using the one-vs-all classification strategy [42] for this classification problem of 12 class in which each stenosis segment was regarded as a class. In this way, 12 classification models were built for this localization problem by using 90% samples for training and 10% samples for testing with a random strategy to select the samples from the whole database.

The results of 50%, 70% and 90% stenosis degree were shown in Table 5
                         as the representatives of medium, serious and very serious stenosis. Table 5 showed the number of total samples (N
                        
                           T
                        ) and accurate predicted samples (N
                        
                           A
                        ) of each artery and the localization accuracies (Q). From the item Q, one could see that most of prediction accuracies increase with increasing stenosis degree. When the stenosis degree increased to 90%, the accuracy reached up to 94% for most of arteries except the arteries 1, 11 and 15. The obvious decreasing accuracies maybe caused by the positions of the arteries 11 and 15 which are outside the way of calculating TF.

In order to observe the detail results of prediction for the three low accuracies, Table 6
                         showed the comparisons of real number and predicted number (i.e. Real No. and Predicted No. in Table 6) of arterial segments for artery 1, 11 and 15 with a arterial segment of 90% stenosis degree.

From the first and second columns in Table 6, one found most of the samples of No. 1 arterial stenosis were localized correctly. But one sample was predicted incorrectly to be a stenosis in the No. 2 artery, and five samples in the No. 10 artery. The adjacent location of the No. 1, 2 and 10 may be the main reason for the wrong prediction. If considering them as one long arterial segment or one class to re-modeling, the accuracy of prediction can increase. From the results of No. 11 and 15, one found several stenosis samples of them were localized incorrectly to be each other. The confusion may be caused by their similar positions which are outside the way between ascending aorta and tibial artery used to generating TF. There are 9 stenosises among 14 stenosis samples of No. 15 artery predicted to be the stenosises of No. 25, 50 and 55.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Based on the 55 segment human arterial tree, the effect of arterial stenosis on the modulus and phase of TF were discussed. In generally, the rule can be concluded as following four points: (1) for different arterial stenosis, the modulus of TF between any two points has a big difference, but the difference of phase is less obvious than the modulus; (2) when the stenosis occurs inside the path of two points for calculating the TF, there is a good correlation between the peak of modulus and the narrow position; (3) when the stenosis occurs outside the path of two points for calculating the TF, if the aortic stenosis, the peak of modulus of the TF has a good relationship with the stenosis position, but, it is not the same things if the branch artery stenosis. The results demonstrated TF can reflect the stenosis degree and position information of artery. Transfer function is a potential parameter of detecting artery stenosis.

The numerical study has demonstrated the feasibility of stenosis diagnosis by using SVM and TF. The results showed SVM performs a high accuracy of diagnosis for the stenosis existing between the two points which are detected to generate the TF. Unfortunately, the method often fails when the stenosis do not exist outside the two detected points. This defect could be overcome by adding more sensors to cover the stenosis artery. Although, the simulation of stenosis diagnosis obtained some good results by TF, the validation of clinic trial should be conducted in the further research. The major challenge is to collect a lot of positive and negative samples to meet the requirement of diversity of samples, which is a very important issue for an accurate diagnosis by machine learning methods, such as SVM and artificial neural network.

If applying the proposed method to a clinical situation of stenosis diagnosis, one should measure the blood pressure waveforms of ascending aorta and other peripheral artery to diagnosis the stenosis between of them, such as, radial artery, tibial artery. Then, TF can be calculated by transforming the two waveforms using the Fourier transform and dividing them. In clinical practice, it is easy to obtain the peripheral blood pressure waveform by pressure sensor and corrected by the cuff brachial blood pressure. But, the waveform of ascending aorta is difficult to obtain. Instead, one can measure the blood pressure waveform of carotid artery to replace that of aorta artery or with a correction, because both of them are similar in some degree.

The purpose of this study is to diagnosis whether or not a stenosis exists and the position in segment scale in the human arterial tree, which is important to quickly diagnosis stenosis in early stage. But, the diagnosis of artery stenosis is not only a classification problem of binary or multi classes. It also involves some other important aspects for a scientific diagnosis, such as the precise stenosis position, length, percentage. Therefore, this study is limitation and need to do further research.
