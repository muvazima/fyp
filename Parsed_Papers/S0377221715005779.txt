                  We introduce a novel metaheuristic methodology to improve the initialization of a given deterministic or stochastic optimization algorithm. Our objective is to improve the performance of the considered algorithm, called core optimization algorithm, by reducing its number of cost function evaluations, by increasing its success rate and by boosting the precision of its results. In our approach, the core optimization is considered as a sub-optimization problem for a multi-layer line search method. The approach is presented and implemented for various particular core optimization algorithms: Steepest Descent, Heavy-Ball, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution and Controlled Random Search. We validate our methodology by considering a set of low and high dimensional benchmark problems (i.e., problems of dimension between 2 and 1000). The results are compared to those obtained with the core optimization algorithms alone and with two additional global optimization methods (Direct Tabu Search and Continuous Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search). These latter also aim at improving the initial condition for the core algorithms. The numerical results seem to indicate that our approach improves the performances of the core optimization algorithms and allows to generate algorithms more efficient than the other optimization methods studied here. A Matlab optimization package called “Global Optimization Platform” (GOP), implementing the algorithms presented here, has been developed and can be downloaded at: http://www.mat.ucm.es/momat/software.htm

We consider a general optimization problem of the form:

                        
                           (1)

                                       ∈
                                       Ω
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    h
                                    0
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    x
                                    )
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     where 
                        
                           
                              h
                              0
                           
                           :
                           Ω
                           →
                           R
                        
                      is the cost function, x is the optimization parameter and 
                        
                           Ω
                           ⊂
                           
                              R
                              N
                           
                           ,
                        
                      with 
                        
                           N
                           ∈
                           N
                           ,
                        
                      is the admissible space.

When solving (1) by an iterative procedure the choice of the initial condition is essential. For instance, this is the case with the gradient methods such as the Steepest Descent algorithm (SD) (Luenberger & Ye, 2008), the Newton algorithm (Polyak, 2007) or with the Heavy-Ball algorithm (HB) (Attouch, Goudou, & Redont, 2000). When h
                     0 has several local minima these algorithms converge to one of those depending on their initialization. However, these algorithms can still find the global optimum if the initial condition belongs to the attraction basin of the infimum. Another example where the initialization is of prime importance is with Genetics Algorithms (GA) (Goldberg, 1989; Gonalves, de Magalhes Mendes, & Resende, 2005) where a lack of diversity in the individuals of the initial population can result to a premature convergence to a local minimum of h
                     0 (Rocha, Neves, & Ali, 1999).

Thus, developing methods that intend to generate suitable initial conditions is interesting in order to improve the efficiency of existing optimization methods. For a given convergence accuracy, a better initialization may lead to a reduction in the number of functional evaluations, which is particularly important when working with expensive functional evaluations as in industrial design problems (Carrasco, Ivorra, & Ramos, 2012, 2015; Gomez, Ivorra, & Ramos, 2011; Ivorra, Hertzog, Mohammadi, & Santiago, 2006; Ivorra, Mohammadi, & Ramos, 2009, 2014; Ivorra, Redondo, Santiago, Ortigosa, & Ramos, 2013; Muyl, Dumas, & Herbert, 2004).

The idea of improving optimization algorithms by choosing a suitable initialization is widely present in the literature. For instance, the Direct Tabu Search algorithm (DTS) (Hedar & Fukushima, 2006; Lamghari & Dimitrakopoulos, 2012) and the Tunneling algorithm (Gomez & Levy, 1982; Levy & Gomez., 1985), are based on a modification of the functional by the addition of penalty terms to avoid the algorithm to revisit previously explored regions. Other techniques, like the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) (Hirsch, Pardalos, & Resende, 2010; Mart, Campos, Resende, & Duarte, 2015) or the Universal Evolutionary Global Optimizer (Redondo, Fernández, García, & Ortigosa, 2009) are based on the construction of a greedy solution combined with a local search step.

Another technique consists in coupling line search methods (Luenberger & Ye, 2008; Vieira & Lisboa, 2014) with another optimization algorithm. For instance, in Gardeux, Chelouah, Siarry, and Glover (2011) the authors propose an optimization method, called EM323, well suited for the solution of high-dimensional continuous non-linear optimization problems. The algorithm EM323 consists in combining the Enhanced Unidirectional Search method (Gardeux, Chelouah, Siarry, & Glover, 2009) with the 3-2-3 line search procedure (Glover, 2010). Another example can be found in Grosan, Abraham, de Mello, and Yang (2007), in the context of Multi-Objective optimization problems. The authors develop a method combining several line search algorithms: one for determining a first point in the Pareto front and another one for exploring the front.

In this work, we propose a novel metaheuristic technique also based on line search methods to dynamically improve the initialization of a given optimization method. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we reformulate problem (1) as a sub-optimization problem where the initial condition of the considered optimization algorithm is the optimization parameter. This new problem is solved by considering an original multi-layer semi-deterministic line search algorithm. In Section 3, we focus on the implementation of our approach by considering two families of optimization algorithms: descent methods (in particular, SD and HB) and Evolutionary Algorithms (in particular, GAs, Controlled Random Search algorithms (CRS) (Price, 1983) and Differential Evolution algorithms (DE) (Price, Storn, & Lampinen, 2005)). In Section 4, we validate our approach by considering various test cases in both low (Floudas & Pardalos, 1999) and high (Li, Engelbrecht, & Epitropakis, 2013) dimensions. The results are then compared with those given by the following optimization algorithms: SD, HB, DTS, Continuous GRASP (CGR), CRS, DE and GA.

We consider an optimization algorithm A
                     0: V → Ω, called core optimization algorithm (COA), to solve problem (1). Here, V is the space where we can choose the initial condition for A
                     0 (various examples are given in Section 3, for simplicity we can consider 
                        
                           V
                           =
                           Ω
                        
                     ). The other optimization parameters of A
                     0 (such as the stopping criterion, the number of iterations, etc.) are fixed by the user. We omit them in the presentation in order to simplify the notations.

We assume the existence of v ∈ V such that, for a given precision

In order to solve problem (2), we propose to use a multi-layer semi-deterministic algorithm (called in the sequel the Multi-Layer Algorithm and denoted by MLA) based on line search methods (see, for instance, Luenberger & Ye, 2008; Mohammadi & Saïac, 2003; Vieira & Lisboa, 2014).

More precisely, we introduce

A geometrical representation of h

                     . We see that h
                     1(.) is discontinuous with plateaus. Indeed, the same solution is reached by the algorithm starting from any of the points of the same attraction basin. Furthermore, h
                     1(.) is discontinuous where the functional reaches a local maximum. One way to minimize such kind of functionals in the one dimensional case is to consider line search optimization methods (such as the secant or the dichotomy methods, see Mohammadi & Saïac, 2003).

Thus, in order to solve problem (4), we introduce the algorithm A
                     1: V → V which, for any v
                     1 ∈ V, returns A

                           Choose v
                              2 randomly in V.

                               using a line search method.

Return v.

In practice, as specified in Section 4, we run Ai
                      with a suitable stopping criterion and with v
                     1 ∈ V arbitrary (or v
                     1 ∈ V a good initial guess, if available).

The choice of the random technique used to generate v
                     2 in Step 1 of Ai
                      is important and depends on h
                     0. For instance, if we know that h
                     0 has several local minima in Ω with a small attraction basins, it seems appropriate to generate v
                     2 in a small neighborhood of v
                     1.

Also, the line search minimization algorithm used in Step 2 of Ai
                      depends on the properties of h
                     0, as discussed in Section 3.

In this Section, we present various MLA implementations, considering different COAs, in the particular case where h
                     0 is a non-negative function (or, equivalently, greater than a known real number). This specific situation often occurs in industrial problems (see, for instance, Ivorra et al., 2006; Ivorra et al., 2009, 2014; Ivorra, Ramos, & Mohammadi, 2007).

In particular, we consider two classes of implementations of the MLA associated with two kinds of COAs: gradient and evolutionary algorithms.

We consider a core algorithm A
                        0 that comes from the discretization of the following initial value problem (Attouch et al., 2000):

In the previous algorithm, the values i and ti
                            depend on the desired computational complexity. In Section 4, we check the efficiency of those algorithms for various set of values.

From a theoretical point of view, as the secant method is adapted to find the zeros of a function (Mohammadi & Saïac, 2003), those algorithms perform better if the minimum value of h
                           0, denoted by

                            is known (for instance, in some inverse problems, see Ivorra, Mohammadi, & Ramos, 2014). Indeed, we can assume that

                            (see Ivorra, 2006 for more details). However, in practice (see experiments presented in Section 4), if the only information available is that h

In order to determine a solution of problem (11), we can consider, for example, the same implementation of algorithms Ai
                           , with 
                              
                                 i
                                 ∈
                                 N
                                 ,
                              
                            as the one introduced in Section 3.1.1.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms which try to solve problems similar to (2) (Ashlock, 2010). From a general point of view, they start from a finite set of points in the search space Ω, called initial population, and intend to improve the value of the considered cost function by applying processes based on an analogy with the Darwinian evolution of species. For instance, we can cite some classical EAs (considered in the experiments presented in Section 4): the Genetic (Goldberg, 1989), the Controlled Random Search (Price, 1983) and the Differential Evolution (Price et al., 2005) algorithms. The EAs have many advantages, as for example: they generally do not require sensitivity computation, they can solve complex optimization problems (e.g., with high dimensional search space or function with various with local minima), and they are intrinsically parallel. However, they also have some important drawbacks as: slower convergence and lower accuracy than other methods (such as gradient algorithms (Ashlock, 2010)).

In the following, we propose a version of the MLA used to solve problem (18). This MLA is illustrated by considering a particular Genetic Algorithm (GA), validated previously in Ivorra (2006),Ivorra et al. (2006),Ivorra et al. (2014), as the COA. We note that the proposed algorithm can be easily extended to any other EA, as illustrated in Section 4 with the use of a Controlled Random Search algorithm (CRS) and a Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) as COAs.

As it is out of the scope in this paper, we do not describe the considered CRS and DE implementations, which are deeply detailed in Hendrix, Ortigosa, and Garca (2001) and Storn and Price (1997), respectively, but we give in Section 3.2.2 the implementation that we use for the GA.

We first describe the GA considered here:

Numerical experiments in Section 4 seem to indicate that considering algorithms Bi
                           , with i > 0, reduces the computational complexity of GAs. In particular, this allows to reduce both parameters Np
                            and Ng
                            in GAs. We will also analyze the application of algorithms Bi
                            with CRS and DE as the COA.

In order to check the efficiency of the MLAs presented in Section 3, we consider two sets of benchmark problems. The first set, described in Section 4.1, consists in low dimensional (i.e., dimension lower than 10) problems (Floudas & Pardalos, 1999). The second set, detailed in Section 4.2, focuses on high dimensional problems (with dimension from 50 to 1000) (Li et al., 2013). Our objective is to see how MLAs improve the efficiency of several COAs and to compare them with other metaheuristic methods.

We consider the following set of box-constrained benchmark optimization problems: Branin (denoted by Bra), Eason (Eas), Goldstein–Price (G–P), Shubert (Shu), Hartmann with 3 (Hm3) and 6 (Hm6) variables, Rosenbrock with 2 (Rb2), 5 (Rb5) and 10 (Rb10) variables, Shekel with 4 variables and 
                              
                                 m
                                 =
                                 5
                              
                            (Sk5), 7 (Sk7)and 10 (Sk10), and Zakharov with 5 (Za5) and 10 (Za10) variables. A complete description of those problems with the considered values of the box restrictions can be found in Floudas and Pardalos (1999). These problems well feature the difficulties of optimization problems and are frequently used to validate optimization algorithms (Hedar & Fukushima, 2006; Hirsch et al., 2010).

To solve numerically the problems introduced in Section 4.1.1, we consider the following MLAs:

                              
                                 •
                                 When the SD is the COA, we use the MLA implementation presented in Section 3.1.1. We apply this method with different number of layers i: 
                                       
                                          i

When the DE described in Storn and Price (1997) is considered as the COA, we use the algorithm B

The DE parameters used here are the following: the population size is set to 10, the crossover operator is rand/1/exp, the crossover constant is 0.95, the mutation parameter is 0.9 and the maximum number of iterations is 100. Those parameters have been determined experimentally. The Matlab implementation of the DE can be found here: http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html
                                 

When the CRS detailed in Hendrix et al. (2001) is considered as the COA, we use the algorithm B
                                    2 introduced in Section 3.2 with

                                    . This algorithm is denoted by CMA (CRS Multi-Layer Algorithm). The CRS parameters used here are the following: the population size is set to 60, the number of trial points is set to the size of the problem, the maximum number of iterations is set to 300 and the rate of success test is 0.55. These parameters have been determined experimentally.

Furthermore, at the end of the GMA, CMA and DMA, 10 iterations of the SD used in SMA1 are performed to improve the accuracy of the results.

Also, the performances of MLAs are compared with those of other metaheuristic methods available in the literature. We consider algorithms CGR and DTS whose implementation, parameters and results are presented in Hedar and Fukushima (2006) and Hirsch et al. (2010), respectively. We point out that there are other versions of Tabu Search and GRASP that may be superior for the problems tested (for example, particular choices of frequency-based memory have been found to significantly improve Tabu Search in various applications, see Bozkaya, Erkut, and Laporte, 2003 and Glover, 1997, and the hybridization of GRASP with Path Relinking has been found to significantly improve GRASP, see Piana, Plana, Campos, and Martí, 2004 and Resende, Ribeiro, Glover, and Mart, 2010). Furthermore, to see if applying the MLAs allows to improve the performances of the different COAs, we also solve the considered benchmark problems by considering the COAs alone with the following parameters:

                                 The SD and the HB are run starting from a random point in Ω, with the same parameters as in SMA1 and HMA except

                                    . The stopping criterion considered here is explained below. These parameters have been identified in previous works (Ivorra et al., 2006; Ivorra et al., 2014).

The DE is run with the crossover operator set to rand/1/exp, the crossover constant set to 0.9, the mutation parameters set to 0.5, the population size set to 5 times the dimension of the benchmark problem and the maximum number of iterations set to 5000. These parameters were suggested in the literature for low dimensional problems (Storn & Price, 1997).

The CRS is applied with a population size of 200, the number of trial points set to the size of the problem, the maximum number of iterations set to 3000 and the rate of success test set to 0.55. These choices have been suggested in Hendrix et al. (2001).

Again, at the end of the GA, CRS and DR, 10 iterations of the SD used in SMA1 are carried out.

In addition to this stopping criterion we have limited the maximum number of functional evaluations to 50,000 for each run (which can be considered as a high number, see Gomez et al., 2011; Ivorra et al., 2014; Ivorra et al., 2013; Muyl et al., 2004). If at the end of the algorithm, (19) is not satisfied, we consider that the algorithm has failed to solve numerically the considered problem.

As specified in Section 3, we recall that the MLAs presented previously are adapted to non-negative functions (or with a known lower bound value). So, the benchmark functions h
                           0 with negative values have been modified adding a real number

                            large enough to obtain a non-negative function. Here, in order to obtain a stopping criterion (19) comparable to the one used in Hedar and Fukushima (2006); Hirsch et al. (2010), we have considered

Due to the stochastic aspect of the algorithms, each benchmark problem has been solved 100 times with each of the optimization algorithm. We define the success rate of an optimization algorithm by the percentage of runs satisfying the stopping criterion (19).

However, in industrial applications, this information is generally not available (Carrasco, Ivorra, & Ramos, 2015; Debiane et al., 2006; Gomez et al., 2011; Ivorra et al., 2009; Ivorra et al., 2007; Muyl et al., 2004). Thus, we have decided not to use it. Furthermore, we deduce from the results presented in Section 4.1.3 that this hypothesis is not mandatory as our methodology is efficient also in cases when

                                  is unknown.

                                 . However, this algorithm exhibited a success rate of 0% in all benchmark problems. Thus, the precision of this algorithm seems to be extremely low and the obtained results are not reported in the next Section 4.1.3. This indicates that the use of a COA is necessary to generate an efficient MLA.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The average number of functional evaluations (considering only successful runs satisfying the stopping criterion (19)) needed by the optimization algorithms to solve the benchmark problems are shown in Table 1
                           . The algorithms success rates are reported in Table 2. The value of Imp for each MLA is shown in Table 3.


                           Table 2 shows that SD and HD have the worst success rates for various benchmark functions. However, we also observe on this table that considering these algorithms as COAs used together with MLAs always improve their success rates. The mean number of evaluations required to satisfy the stopping criterion, presented in Table 1, is generally lower for a MLA than for its COA alone. In cases where the number of evaluations is greater for MLA than for its COA alone, we have to take into account that we only consider here the runs for which the algorithms satisfy the stopping criterion. This increases the computational effort of the MLA as its success rate is improved in comparison to its COA alone, and thus, the additional
                            successful runs require a high number of functional evaluations. The advantage of using MLA can be also observed through the Imp values presented in Table 3. We can see that the improvement with MLA regarding the total number of evaluations required to solve all benchmark runs is increased from 33% up to 95%. Those results indicate that the MLA method improves the efficiency of the COA for all these low dimensional problems.

Also, when analyzing the global efficiency of all proposed algorithms, the results indicate that SMA2 and SMA3 give the best performances. Indeed, both algorithms have a success percentage of 100 (as CGR) and are more efficient with respect to the number of functional evaluations, compared to all other methods. These results can be explained by the secant method chosen to perform the line search: as specified in Section 3.1.1, this method is well adapted for quick search and allows to have a rapid idea of the functional behavior (for instance, the monotonicity of the function in a given direction). Once this is detected the SD performs a local optimization. The Shubert (Shu) and Easom (Eas) benchmark cases are the two functions which require the largest numbers of evaluations for SMA2 and SMA3. This is because both functions have several local minima with small attraction basins and none is coercive (a function f(x) is coercive if 
                              
                                 ∥
                                 x
                                 ∥
                                 →
                                 +
                                 ∞
                              
                            implies 
                              
                                 f
                                 (
                                 x
                                 )
                                 →
                                 +
                                 ∞
                              
                           ). This makes the global minimum attraction basin difficult to find using the secant method. As a conclusion, at this point SMA2 and SMA3 seem to represent the best choices.

When focusing on each MLA, SMA1 presents the lowest success rates of all MLAs. This is due to fact that in SMA1 the search for a suitable initial condition is only a 1D search while SMA2 and SMA3 introduce multi-directional explorations. With HMA the number of functional evaluations is higher and the success percentage is lower than with SMA2 and SMA3. This is because HB permits for better explorations of the admissible space due to its inertial features but too much inertia prevent from convergence. Finally GMA, CMA and DMA present interesting characteristics. Their success rates are generally equivalent to the GA and better than DTS, CRS and DE. Furthermore, depending on the cases, they generally require a lower number of functional evaluations than GA, CRS or DE alone. Therefore, these algorithms are good substitutes to classical evolutionary algorithms in cases where the gradient of the functional is difficult to access.

                              Remark 5
                              In addition to the low dimensional benchmark results presented above, SMA2 and GMA have been applied to the solution of several low dimensional design problems involving computationally expensive cost functions with often several local minima. The application domains concern: structural design (Carrasco et al., 2012, 2015), oil skimmer trajectory optimization (Gomez et al., 2011), synthesis of optical fiber (Ivorra et al., 2014), optimization of microfluidic mixers (Ivorra et al., 2006; Ivorra et al., 2013), temperature and pollution control in flames (Debiane et al., 2006), credit portfolio risk management (Ivorra et al., 2009), control of the solution for a PDE (Ivorra et al., 2007), optimization of the shape of coastal structures (Isebe, Azerad, Bouchette, Ivorra, & Mohammadi, 2008).

We now consider the following benchmark box-constrained optimization problems in dimension D (Floudas & Pardalos, 1999): Griewank (GrD), Rosenbrock (RbD) and Zakharov (ZaD). Following Li et al. (2013) 
                           D is set to 50, 100, 500 and 1000.

To solve the benchmark problems introduced in Section 4.2.1, we only consider those algorithms presented in Section 4.1.2 which have well performed in Section 4.1.3. More precisely, we only consider SD, GA, DE, CRS, SMA3, GMA, CMA and DMA. SMA1, HB and HMA are omitted due to their poor performances there. Also SMA2 is not reported as it has similar behavior than SMA3.

The differences when comparing the parameters with those used in Section 4.1.3 are:

                                    .


                                    GMA: The population size is set to 100 and the maximum number of iterations to 20.


                                    CMA: The population size is set to 50 and the maximum number of iterations is set to 1000.


                                    DMA: The population size is set to 60 and the maximum number of iterations is set to 100.

The parameters for SD, SMA3, GMA, CMA and DMA are determined experimentally. The same stopping criterion (19) used in Section 4.1.2 is considered here. The maximum number of functional evaluations is set to 150,000. Each experiment is repeated 100 times.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The average number of functional evaluations (considering only successful runs satisfying the stopping criterion (19)) needed by the optimization algorithms to solve the benchmark problems are shown in Table 4
                           . The success rate of the algorithms are reported in Table 5
                           . Furthermore, as suggested in Gardeux et al. (2011); Li et al. (2013), we also report in Table 6
                            the mean final value of the cost function returned by each optimization algorithm for each benchmark problem over the 100 runs. Finally, the Imp values (20) of SMA3, GMA, CMA and DMA are shown in Table 7
                           .

From Table 5, we see that the MLAs exhibit better success rates than their respective COAs. Furthermore, as observed in Table 4, if the stopping criterion (19) is satisfied, the average number of cost function evaluations is generally lower for MLAs than for their associated COAs. Those results indicate that, as in the low dimensional cases, MLAs seem to improve the efficiency of the considered COA. However, for these high dimensional cases the improvement is not as important as for the low dimensional cases. Indeed, we can see in Table 7 that the Imp values of considered MLAs are between 2% and 30% (instead of 33% and 95% as in the low dimensional cases). Furthermore, we see that when the cost function is difficult to minimize (such as, Rb-1000 or Za50–Za1000), MLAs do not improve the success rate, which stays at 0%. Thus, a COA well adapted to the considered optimization problem should be selected in order to create an efficient MLA.

Focusing on the global performances of the algorithms, results in Table 6 seem to indicate that the SMA3 gives the best results. In particular, for the Za50–Za1000 cases, SMA3 performs much better. For benchmark functions Gr50–Gr1000 and Rb50–Rb1000 all algorithms give similar solutions. When the gradient evaluation is not possible (as in some industrial problems where the cost function is computed by using a black-blox software, see Ivorra et al. (2006), Ivorra et al. (2013)) GMA, CMA and DMA present good alternatives to SMA3.

From a general point of view, the results reported in Table 6 are similar to other studies in the literature including different algorithms solving high dimensional cases (see, for instance, Gardeux et al., 2011): the solution of the Griewank case can be approximated with a good precision whereas the minimum of the Rosenbrock function is difficult to evaluate.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A new multi-layer line search method, denoted by MLA, has been developed. This metaheuristic algorithm solves a sub-optimization problem in order to improve the initialization of existing optimization procedures considered as core optimization algorithm (COA). A particular implementation of the approach, well suited for minimizing non-negative functions, has been presented and coupled with various COAs: Steepest Descent, Heavy-Ball, Genetic, Differential Evolution and Controlled Random Search algorithms. The MLAs have been validated on various benchmark problems from low (with dimension less than 10) to high (with dimension up to 1000) dimensional cases. The numerical results seem to indicate that our methodology improves the performances of the COAs. The general conclusion is that MLAs with COAs given by gradient descent algorithms (SMA2 and SMA3) and evolutionary algorithms (GMA, CMA and DMA) should be preferred. These latter are good alternatives to other metaheuristic algorithms such as DTS, DE, CRS and CGR.

Our current effort is on parallel MLAs (Gomez et al., 2011).

A Matlab version of some of the algorithms presented in this paper has been implemented in the free optimization package “Global Optimization Platform”, which can be downloaded at http://www.mat.ucm.es/momat/software.htm
