                  The investigation of the umbral calculus based generalization of Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves is continued in this paper: First a generalization of the de Casteljau algorithm that uses umbral shift operators is described. Then it is shown that the quite involved umbral shifts can be replaced by a surprisingly simple recursion which in turn can be understood in geometrical terms as an extension of the de Casteljau interpolation scheme. Namely, instead of using only the control points of level 
                        r
                        −
                        1
                      to generate the points on level r as in the ordinary de Casteljau algorithm, one uses also points on level 
                        r
                        −
                        2
                      or more previous levels. Thus the unintuitive parameters in the algebraic definition of generalized Bernstein polynomials get geometric meaning. On this basis a new direct method for the design of Bézier curves is described that allows to adapt the control polygon as a whole by moving a point of the associated Bézier curve.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In Winkel (2014) the properties of generalized Bernstein polynomials and generalized Bézier curves introduced earlier (Winkel, 2001) have been investigated. For the convenience of the reader we repeat here the definition of generalized Bernstein polynomials of order n for the sequence of real parameters

The main purpose of the present paper is a detailed elaboration of the claim of Winkel (2014) that the generalized recursion (1.6) can be used to generalize the ordinary de Casteljau algorithm

                     , and in Section 3 the generalization of the de Casteljau algorithm with umbral shifts. In Section 4 the complicated umbral shifts are replaced by a surprisingly simple recursion that can be understood in geometrical terms as an extension of the de Casteljau interpolation scheme. Namely, instead of using only the control points of level 
                        r
                        −
                        1
                      to generate the points on level r as in the ordinary de Casteljau algorithm, one uses two or more or all previous levels down to the control points at level 0. Thus the unintuitive parameters in the algebraic definition of generalized Bernstein polynomials get geometric meaning that is illustrated extensively. In Section 5 a new direct method for the design of Bézier curves is described that uses the additional freedom of the parameters

The appearance of derivations in the form of umbral shift operators in the above formulas seem to preclude a discrete generalized de Casteljau algorithm directly on the control points

The next section will show that the elimination of differentiation yields a surprisingly simple and geometrically meaningful generalized de Casteljau algorithm.

Now the laborious metamorphosis of the generalized de Casteljau algorithm that transforms the caterpillar with umbral shifts into the butterfly without umbral shifts can be completed with the next theorem. We emphasize the difference between functions and their differentiation in Theorem 3.3 and the elementary algebraic operations on points in Theorem 4.6 with the suggestive notations

In principle, the dependence of points on some level on more than just the previous level points can be achieved in many ways — but usually not in a way that doesn't sacrifice important properties such as affine invariance. Probably the only possible way to retain all the properties listed in Winkel (2014) is to use generalized Bézier polynomials as introduced in Winkel (2001). With formula (4.14) it is now easy to deduce an additional property that was hard to see from the algebraic definition (1.1)–(1.3): Though the generalized Bernstein polynomials do not in general respect the convex hull property — they include for example as special case the Lagrange polynomials with equidistant nodes —, they have the property of linear precision by an easy induction using (4.14). In other words, if the basic control points

                     Figs. 4 and 5
                     
                      show for two different control polygons how the intermediary and final generalized Bézier curves look like in comparison with the ordinary intermediary and final Bézier curves. (The points on the curves for

                     , whereas the higher parameters are zero. This draws the (intermediary) generalized Bernstein polynomials closer to the control polygon. In Fig. 5 the parameter sequence for the interpolation of the control polygon is used as determined in Winkel (2014). The control polygon starts and ends at the point most to the right. Note that the intermediary curves are not interpolating, because the parameter sequences for interpolation are different for different numbers of control points.


                     Fig. 6
                      shows more intermediary Bézier curves to give an impression how versatile these curves are (and because they look nice). I each case the end of the control polygon overlaps suitably with the beginning to achieve perfect symmetry.

Finally in this section we note that from the proof of Theorem 4.6 one gets immediately a down recurrence as (3.5) for bivariate generalized Bernstein polynomials but now without umbral shifts.

Usually the designer of a Bézier curve sets up in an intuitive way a control polygon and inspects the resulting Bézier curve. If the curve is not as desired, then the control points are moved interactively one by one, until the result is satisfying. In the past there have also been invented a number of direct methods for curve design, that allow to change the whole Bézier curve by picking a point on the curve and changing its geometric constraints, e.g., its position in ambient space, the tangent direction and magnitude, or the magnitude of the curvature at the point (see for example Bartels and Beatty, 1989; Fowler and Bartels, 1993; Gleicher, 1992). The purpose of the present section is to indicate, how the additional freedom gained by the parameters

                      can be used to extend the known direct methods. Note that by the generalized de Casteljau algorithm of Theorem 4.6 these parameters do not describe local differential–geometric properties, but global properties of the generalized Bézier curves, e.g., an

                      leads to a global decrease resp. increase (cf. Fig. 4) of curvature compared to the ordinary Bézier curves. We hope that other researchers can apply this approach to their particular problem.

The new direct method is described and illustrated first from the perspective of the designer, then we discuss the mathematics behind the working steps. (Note, that also a weighting of control points can be done in the usual way in the generalized setup.)
