                  This article discusses the applicability of the three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized equation to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in fractal heterogeneous porous media, during numerical simulations of waterflood operations in oil reservoirs. For that purpose, for the first time this equation was incorporated into a model that describes immiscible flows of incompressible two-phase fluids in porous media. Results were generated from intensive simulations, and viscous fingers were visualized graphically for three different well patterns, typical of oil fields: Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot. Such results suggest that this generalization of the Kozeny–Carman equation can be used in numerical simulations of oil recovery processes susceptible to hydrodynamic instability phenomena.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

During a secondary petroleum recovery process, conducted under water injection, the formation of immiscible viscous fingering in the oil reservoir is the product of an interfacial instability phenomenon that occurs in porous media, when the oil (the high-viscosity fluid) is displaced by the water (the low-viscosity fluid). In the presence of this instability phenomenon, part of the invading water advances through the porous medium at velocities much higher than those of the average front, bypassing the oil and rapidly approaching the production wells [3]. Thus, the appearance of such immiscible viscous fingers can cause considerable problems for the oil industry, due to poor recovery of hydrocarbons during a waterflood process.

Hence, appropriate phenomenological models, stability analyses of immiscible flows and numerical simulators able to capture the formation of immiscible viscous fingers are very useful tools, not only to predict the viscous fingering but also to assist in the proposal of a possible stabilization process of this phenomenon of hydrodynamic nature, which has (over the past several decades) attracted the attention of many researchers [5,6,8,10,13,17,19,20,22,23].

Studies that discuss the formation of viscous fingers during surfactant injection in heavy oil reservoirs, in the presence and absence of polymers, can be found in the recent works by Yadali Jamaloei et al. [28–32].

In an oil reservoir, when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one, immiscible viscous fingers are triggered primarily by natural geologic heterogeneities, such as the heterogeneities of the real permeability field. In numerical simulation, there are two basic approaches to trigger viscous fingers: (a) small perturbations of the front at time 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        
                     , commonly used in the simulation of flows in homogeneous media, and (b) the effective use of a mathematical model to describe (even in an approximate way) the heterogeneity of the porous material [10]. In the second case, the communities working with reservoir simulations often use synthetic permeability fields, generated randomly from a log-normal distribution with a specified variance [12,18].

Recently, Henderson and co-authors proposed the so-called three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized (TPKCG) equation [15], which was used in the modeling of heterogeneous permeability fields. More specifically, the TPKCG equation was developed to allow the use of a Kozeny–Carman type model to a broad class of porous media with fractal nature, generalizing various models previously reported in the literature, which commonly are employed to describe specific porous media, including oil reservoirs with fractal heterogeneities.

The objective of this work is to verify the ability of the TPKCG equation to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in a fractal porous medium during numerical simulations of waterflood operations, with adverse mobility ratios. For this, we consider a two-dimensional rectangular porous medium having a random porosity field, with porosity values uniformly distributed in a given interval. Then, the absolute permeability of the porous material is modeled as a function of the porosity, using the TPKCG equation. This approach yields a heterogeneous permeability field, whose fractal nature is described by this mathematical model equipped with three fixed parameters. Assuming this rectangular heterogeneous porous medium as the oil reservoir, in order to observe the effects of well locations on the geometric structure of the viscous fingering, we present results of flows of two immiscible incompressible fluids (water and oil) using three flooding patterns [11], Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot.

Fingering phenomena also can be observed in miscible flows in porous media [9,14,16,25–27]. However, as noted by King et al. [20] the instability of an immiscible flow it is more difficult to model numerically than a miscible flood. In fact, as emphasized by these authors, in an immiscible fingering the so-called Buckley–Leverett mixing zone leads to enhanced stability compared to the corresponding miscible flood. Accordingly, the choice of the present immiscible process incorporates an additional challenge to the use of the TPKCG equation.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the characterization of the porous medium via the TPKCG equation. Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the mathematical model for immiscible incompressible fluid flows in porous media. In Section 4, we summarize the numerical methods. In Section 5, we report the results. The conclusions are given in Section 6.

The characterization of porous materials using a Kozeny–Carman type equation necessarily considers the existence of a functional relationship of the form [3]

                     , this choice results in a heterogeneous porous medium where the permeability varies roughly between 0.0028 and 0.0648 darcy (0.002837 and 0.065659

In this section, we present the mathematical model used to describe the immiscible flow of an invading fluid (water) plus a resident fluid (oil), which flow together as incompressible two-phase fluids in a porous medium, where the water is considered the wetting phase, while the oil is the nonwetting phase. This flow is described by the mass conservation equations for the wetting phase and for the two-phase fluid, and by Darcy’s law for the phase velocities.

In what follows, S denotes the saturation of the wetting phase (the portion of pore volume filled with water), and P is the pressure of the nonwetting phase (oil). The constants

                      is a sufficiently small number chosen to ensure the numerical stability of the used explicit scheme. In present work, Eq. (20) is solved using the fourth order Runge–Kutta method [2].

The spatial derivatives in Eq. (9) are approximated by centered finite differences. Thus, we obtain the discretized form of the so-called pressure equation:

In waterflood operations, water is injected in a pattern of wells to displace oil towards producer wells arranged in said pattern. There are several well patterns that are generally used, which influence the geometric aspects of the viscous fingers. In this work, we consider three typical processes, employing the following patterns [11]: Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot.

In what follows, all the diagrams showing viscous fingers were obtained by plotting a color corresponding to the water saturation for each block of the grid.

In this example, water is injected into wells located at grid nodes pertaining to all border blocks on one given side of the rectangular domain, and production wells are on the nodes located in all opposite border blocks.

In each injection well, we assume the flow rate

                        Fig. 3
                        a shows the instability phenomenon after 1.5s of water injection, in a section of the porous medium near to discontinuity line of the initial saturation. For this time instant, a Buckley–Leverett mixing zone [20] is highlighted in Fig. 3b, where we can clearly observe the formation of viscous fingers triggered and described by the TPKCG equation.

The evolution of the instability phenomenon along the porous medium is shown in Fig. 4
                        a and b, after 3.0 and 4.5s of water injection, respectively. The geometrical characteristics of the saturation fingers shown in these figures are typical of an immiscible flow in a line-drive pattern [10].

In view of the relatively small values of capillary pressure defined by Eq. (30), the convection–diffusion flow of this example is dominated by convective transport, where the physical diffusion is therefore small. Thus, the saturation equation (Eq. (18)) has a characteristic predominantly hyperbolic [1]. This can be noticed by observing the form of the water saturation surface shown in Fig. 5
                        , obtained after 4.5s of water injection. In fact, this solution presents a shock (where are the ends of the water saturation fingers), typical of a hyperbolic problem, preceded by a rarefaction wave.

In this example, water is injected into a well located at the node of a corner block of the rectangular grid, while the producer is in the diagonally opposite corner block.

In the injection well we use the flow rate

                        Fig. 6
                        a and b show the viscous fingers described by the TPKCG equation in five-spot pattern, after injection times of 500 and 1000s, respectively. The geometric aspects of these saturation fingers are in agreement with a comment made by Perkins and Johnston [21], after experimental results obtained with immiscible flows. In fact, one can notice the formation of a dendritic network of wetting fluid. The evolution of this dendritic network can be seen in Fig. 7
                        a and b, relating to the instants 1500s and 2000s, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 8
                        a, after 2500s of water injection, we can note the appearance of a pronounced viscous finger, which points towards the production well. For this same instant, Fig. 8b shows the water saturation surface in five-spot pattern. This surface displays a shock wave that propagates at relatively high velocities, where the water phase bypasses the oil.

In this example, water is injected into a well located in a grid block near the center of the rectangular domain, where we consider

The viscous fingering triggered by the TPKCG equation in inverted five-spot pattern are shown in Fig. 9
                        a and b, for, respectively, 350 and 500s after the start of water injection. For this flood pattern, such figures clearly show that initially the viscous fingers are presented in the porous medium along some directions preferred to the flow, which are not necessarily those directly associated with the production wells, while the average front essentially expands in a radial form. Again, we can observe the formation of the dendritic network of wetting fluid.

The description of this instability phenomenon by the TPKCG equation is shown in Fig. 10
                        a, after 1500s of water injection. Fig. 10b shows the water saturation surface in inverted five-spot pattern, for this same instant, where we can note the highlight of a radial shock wave evolving in the heterogeneous porous medium.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Many porous materials (where the permeability is presented as a function of porosity) can be characterized by the Kozeny–Carman equation. In order to overcome some limitations of this classical equation, recently the present authors developed the TPKCG (three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized) equation. The TPKCG equation is a new permeability–porosity relationship that has proved to be appropriate to allow the use of a Kozeny–Carman type model to a broad class of porous media with fractal nature, including oil reservoirs.

Viscous fingers are interfacial instability phenomena that occur in porous media, when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one. Customarily, such a phenomenon takes place in oil reservoirs during waterflood operations, causing considerable damage to the oil industry. Thus, in the last several decades, employing different approaches several researchers have studied the occurrence and/or stabilization of viscous fingering. Among the approaches commonly used are the direct simulations, which are carried out using numerical solutions of the partial differential equations that describe the evolution of viscous flows in porous media, along with the characterization of the porous material from a possible geostatistical model for the permeability field, which is essential to trigger viscous fingers in simulations of flows in heterogeneous porous media.

In this study the TPKCG equation was used to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in a fractal porous medium during simulations of waterflood operations. Thus, for the first time, the TPKCG equation was incorporated into a model that describes immiscible flows of incompressible two-phase fluids in porous media, formed by nonlinear differential equations. Then, this difficult problem was successfully solved using accurate numerical methods based on an improved implicit pressure and explicit saturation (IMPES) strategy.

Numerical results were generated from intensive simulations, and viscous fingers were visualized graphically for three different well patterns: Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot.

Our results, which constituted the major challenges of this work, show that the TPKCG equation is a mathematical model able to describe viscous fingering in simulation of immiscible flows of incompressible fluids in heterogeneous porous media.

These results motivate us to indicate the TPKCG equation as a theoretical tool to be used in numerical simulations of oil recovery processes, including those susceptible to hydrodynamic instability phenomena.
