                  We extend the literature on risk preferences of a representative bettor by including odds-dependent bet sizes in our estimations. Accounting for different bet sizes largely reduces the standard errors of all coefficients. Substituting the coefficients from the model with equal bet sizes into the model with odds-dependent sizes leads to a sharp decline in the likelihood which shows that accounting for different amounts is important. Our estimations strongly reject the hypothesis that the overbetting of outcomes with low probabilities (favorite-longshot bias) can be explained by risk-seeking bettors. Depending on the exact specification within cumulative prospect theory, the data can best be described by an overweighting of small probabilities which is more pronounced in the gain domain. Models allowing for two parameters for probability weighting each in the gain- and in the loss domain are superior.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Sports betting data is useful for estimating risk preferences due to the fact that the risk of different bets is uncorrelated, and because returns are realized soon after the bets are placed. Consequently, sports betting data has often been applied for estimating which of the canonical models for choices under risk (in particular expected utility theory, EUT, and cumulative prospect theory, CPT) fits the data best. A rather robust result is that different specifications of CPT perform better than EUT, a finding that coincides with most experimental results on behavior under risk (see Harrison & Rutström (2008), for a comprehensive overview).

Most of the literature adopts the so-called representative bettor approach which estimates the parameters of the bettors’ utility functional under three assumptions: (i) odds are explained by the bettors’ indifference condition between the available choices for an event, (ii) all bettors are identical, and (iii) bet sizes are independent of odds. Straightforwardly, assumptions (ii) and (iii) are counterfactual and are mainly adopted due to data limitations. A few recent studies drop assumption (ii) and estimate individual preferences either by using data on individual betting behavior (Andrikogiannopoulou & Papakonstantinou, 2013) or by estimating heterogeneity from aggregated data (Chiappori, Gandhi, Salanié, & Salanié, 2012). Our work is complementary to these papers as we keep the assumption of a representative bettor but drop assumption (iii): we estimate the representative bettors’ utility functional from the indifference condition between choices which differ both in odds and bet sizes. We can do so as our data set includes the actual amount for each bet placed.

To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that estimates risk preferences within the representative bettor approach for CPT with different bet sizes. The descriptive statistics for our large data set that includes approximately 800,000 observations already reveals that accounting for different bet sizes is important. Bet sizes are decreasing in odds to such a large degree that the correlation between odds and the variance of return, which may be seen as a rough proxy for risk, is negative. Although this is not surprising as few (non-professional) bettors would be willing to bet large amounts on longshots, it is an important observation which implies that it cannot be taken for granted that those betting on longshots take higher risks than those betting on favorites.

We find that specifications including the actual bet sizes reduce the standard errors considerably. Furthermore, when we substitute the coefficients estimated from the model with equal bet sizes into the model with actual bet sizes, we find a strong decline in the likelihoods. This shows that accounting for different bet sizes is important.

In line with most of the data utilized in the literature (see the overview in Ottaviani & Sørensen (2008)),
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Only few papers find a reversed FLB, i.e. markets where average returns are higher when betting on longshots (see in particular Woodland and Woodland (1994), and Sobel and Raines (2003)). Boulier, Stekler, and Amundson (2006) find no significant impact of odds on returns.
                      we observe a pronounced favorite-longshot bias (FLB) expressing that returns are, on average, decreasing in odds. When we define favorites as the bottom fifty percent lowest odds placed and longshots as the other fifty percent, losses with longshots are on average around 21 percent, compared to only 8 percent for favorites. When estimating the preferences based on EUT, the existence of a FLB necessarily leads to the result that bettors are risk-seeking. EUT, however, performs rather poorly both for equal and with actual bet sizes, i.e. it leads to likelihoods far above those for CPT. The CPT-estimations suggest risk-neutral bettors, so that EUT can contribute little to our understanding of the FLB. By contrast, models including overweighting of small probabilities, separated by the gain- and the loss domain, fit the data well.

Our findings depend to some degree on the exact specification of the probability weighting functions, but the following results can be seen as robust (see Section 4 for details): First, low probabilities are overweighted relative to high probabilities. This holds both in the gain- and in the loss domain, and is consistent with the existence of a pronounced FLB. Second, probabilities in the gain domain are overweighted relative to probabilities in the loss domain. This sheds (some) light on why people invest at all in risky assets with negative expected value. In line with this, specifications including loss aversion show that the representative bettor puts more weight on gains compared to losses. Third, the performance of models, captured by the likelihood, improves when we allow for two parameters for probability weighting each in the gain- and in the loss domain. Thereby, we need to take into account that models with more parameters automatically lead to a (weakly) higher likelihood. To correct for this effect, we apply the widely used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but we still find that more complex weighting-functions are superior for reasons we will discuss in Section 4.

Besides the preference-based approach, there are several other important explanations of the FLB, including those considering the profit-maximization of poorly- (Shin, 1991, 1992) or well-informed (Levitt, 2004) bookmakers, and those based on the heterogeneity in the beliefs of bettors with respect to the winning probabilities (Ali, 1977; Gandhi & Serrano-Padial, 2014; Ottaviani & Sørensen, 2009). In Section 5, we will briefly relate our findings to these approaches. To streamline the following literature review, we now restrict attention to the preference-based approaches.

The early literature estimated the parameters of the representative bettor’s utility functional only for EUT (Ali, 1977; Weitzman, 1965). Jullien and Salanié (2000) have shown that models based on CPT outperform EUT (see the overviews in Jullien & Salanié, 2008; Ottaviani & Sørensen, 2008). In the part of their paper in which they replicate the Jullien and Salanié (2000)-approach, Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014) find no evidence for risk-seeking preferences, something that coincides with our results. Snowberg and Wolfers (2010) use exotic bets (for instance bets on the winner and the second best horse, called “exacta”) for discriminating between explanations based on utility functions and on probability weighting. They also confirm that non-linear probability weighting explains the data best.


                     Bradley (2003) develops a theoretical model that allows for odds-dependent bet sizes, but has no data on those. With data from betfair.com, Kopriva (2009) also reports that bet sizes are largely decreasing in odds, but he estimates the representative bettor’s preferences only with EUT but not with CPT. To our knowledge, there is no other paper that extends the comparison of EUT and CPT within the representative bettor approach to different bet sizes.

There are at least two caveats in assessing our results: with any other paper on betting, we first share the problem that bettors are unlikely to be representative for the population as a whole, so that there is a sample selection bias. In particular, while the overweighting of small compared to large probabilities is a well-known phenomenon, the overweighting of gains compared to losses might be specific for betting markets. Thus, our results indicate in which respects betting markets are similar and different to other choices under risk. Second, we interpret CPT as a statistical tool rather than as an explanation for the underlying cognitive processes of bettors. In other words, we find that bettors behave as if they overweight small probabilities, but our analysis keeps silent on whether this is attributable to systematic misperceptions of probabilities, to preferences for weak contestants, or to other reasons not accounted for in our estimations. We will get briefly back to this in Section 5. Here, we emphasize that, whenever we talk of e.g. the “overweighting of small probabilities”, we use it in the cautious sense just mentioned.

The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data set. Section 3 explains the methodology. Section 4 presents our results for the benchmark model, and discusses robustness checks. Section 5 compares our findings to other approaches. We conclude in Section 6.

Our data set was compiled in close cooperation with the ‘New Zealand Racing Board’ (NZRB) which is the only licensed betting agency in New Zealand. The initial data contain all 5,136,660 fixed-odds bets placed at the agency between August 2006 and April 2009. By contrast to parimutuel betting where the total amount is shared among all successful bettors, odds in fixed-odds-betting are set by bookmakers. An advantage of fixed-odds-betting for our purposes is that bettors know the final odds at the time of betting. A disadvantage is that odds are not solely determined by the demand of bettors, but also by strategic considerations of bookmakers (see Direr, 2013; Levitt, 2004; Shin, 1991, 1992). Data with fixed-odds-betting is also used by Jullien and Salanié (2000), Kopriva (2009) and Andrikogiannopoulou and Papakonstantinou (2013).

For each event included in our analysis, we have information on odds, the number of bets on each possible outcome, the outcome itself and the bet sizes for each bet. From outcomes, we calculate success probabilities for odds. To include bet sizes in the representative bettor approach, we calculate the average bet sizes for the respective odds.

Many events in our data set have more than two possible outcomes, for instance games where draws are possible as in Soccer, or competitions with many contestants such as sailing and golf. As the estimation of risk preferences is based on the indifference condition for all outcomes, the processor time is disproportionately increasing in the number of possible outcomes.
                        2
                     
                     
                        2
                        Each estimation took around thirty minutes, and the number of indifference equations with n outcomes is 
                              
                                 (
                                 
                                    n
                                    2
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           .
                      Therefore, we restrict attention to events with a maximum of six outcomes.

When calculating the number of bets and average bet sizes per outcome, we furthermore excluded all bets where either the average bet size or the average potential gain exceeded 500 NZ dollar.
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        The exchange rate of the NZ dollar to the US dollar fluctuated over the observation period, but on average, 1NZ dollar was about 65 Cent.
                      There are two reasons for this: first, we are interested in the risk preferences of the average casual bettor, and we do not want to mix up casual and professional bettors. Second, large single bets would otherwise dominate (and potentially distort) the results when using average bet sizes. We also ran estimations with many different thresholds and for a model including all bets. Results are qualitatively robust and several specifications are presented in the Appendix. We exclude events with less than five bets and events with irregularities that could not be clarified with the bookmaker.

The data set we finally work with contains 24,266 events and 791,906 bets, on average 32.63 bets per event and 10.12 bets per outcome. Table 1
                      shows descriptive statistics, disaggregated by sports, and reveals a pronounced FLB.

To illustrate the impact of odds on the return of bets, we distinguish between favorites defined as the bottom fifty percent lowest odds placed and longshots defined by the other fifty percent. As shown in Table 1, the return on favorites is 
                        −
                     8 percent compared to 
                        −
                     21 percent for longshots. In the last two columns, we define favorites as bets with odds below two (i.e., neglecting the take-out rate, with a winning probability above 50 percent), and the results are qualitatively the same. Except for American Football, there is a FLB for all kinds of sports, but average losses differ largely among them.

As our paper is concerned with the impact of bet sizes, it is next instructive to consider the relation between odds and bet sizes as shown in Fig. 1
                     .


                     Fig. 1 confirms the intuition that bet sizes are to a large extent decreasing in odds. When we adopt the variance of return as a rough indicator for the risk associated with a bet, we find that the correlation between odds and variance for our data set is significantly negative with a correlation coefficient of 
                        −
                     0.0665. Thus, our data shows that it may be misleading to presume that those betting on longshots take larger risks than those betting on favorites. These simple observations reinforce our view that it is important to account for bet sizes when estimating risk preferences from betting data.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

Following the representative bettor approach, we estimate the risk preferences of bettors by assuming that, for odds given, they are indifferent among all outcomes for a specific event. As usual, we do not require that bettors need to be indifferent among the outcomes of different events. Thus, we assume that they first decide between events, and only then on outcomes and bet sizes. Also following the literature, we do not model why people bet at all. We will briefly get back to this in Section 5.

We estimate two kinds of models. In the first model, we assume that bet sizes are the same for all odds. We then turn to our new model where the representative bettor is indifferent between lotteries consisting of odds and bet sizes. For bet sizes, we use the average bet size in the data after excluding bets where either the bet size or the potential return exceeds 500 NZ dollar for the reasons discussed in Section 2.

To model the indifference condition of the representative bettor, two main decisions need to be made. The first decision refers to the value- and weighting functions. In our benchmark estimations, we restrict attention to CARA for two reasons: First, we have no information about the wealth of bettors, so that CARA is the only non-linear value function that we can use for EUT. Second, Jullien and Salanié (2000), Snowberg and Wolfers (2010) and Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014) all use CARA as well, so that this allows for a direct comparison of our findings to the literature. For CPT, we can also use the powerfunction for values as robustness check as constant absolute risk aversion is not required. Thereby, we use the well-performing weighting function Prelec II as an example. Based on a comprehensive analysis by Stott (2006), we consider more alternatives for weighting functions than Jullien and Salanié (2000) do, and we demonstrate that allowing for different probability weightings in the gain- and in the loss domain is important.

The second decision to be made refers to the probability distribution over outcomes used in the indifference conditions. To see the point, consider the simplest model with identical bet sizes, and take expected utility as an example. Define W as the representative bettor’s initial wealth, and pG
                      and 
                        
                           
                              p
                              L
                           
                           =
                           1
                           −
                           
                              p
                              G
                           
                        
                      as the probability of gain and loss for a specific outcome. Furthermore, denote q as odds, b as bet size, θ as a parameter that captures the risk preferences, and u(·) as the utility of a specific outcome. Then, the value U(·) of betting on the outcome for a representative bettor is

For each model, the parameters of the utility functional are estimated so as to minimize the difference between the utilities from the different bets.

                        A detailed description of our programming is available on request.
                      An important question is then how pG
                      should be calculated. If odds perfectly reflected success probabilities, then the ratio of success probabilities for two bets would simply be the inverse of odds, i.e.

                                 p
                                 
                                    G
                                 
                                 2
                              
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 q
                                 2
                              
                              
                                 q
                                 1
                              
                           
                        
                     . However, as betting markets are not efficient and since our data exhibits a strong FLB, we follow part of the literature including Snowberg and Wolfers (2010), Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014), and Chiappori et al. (2012) by using the actual percentage of successful bets for the respective odds. These probabilities can be seen as the “correct” probabilities over all events in our data set. We thereby stipulate that bettors are aware of the actual success probabilities, and hence also of the FLB.

Two other ways of calculating the success probabilities deserve discussion. Jullien and Salanié (2000) estimate the probabilities from the indifference conditions themselves by using the adding-up constraint over all outcomes i, 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              i
                           
                           
                              p
                              i
                           
                           =
                           1
                        
                     . We could have followed this procedure for the model with identical bet sizes, but not so for the model with different bet sizes as solving explicitly for the probabilities in the indifference conditions is only feasible when bet sizes cancel out. Andrikogiannopoulou and Papakonstantinou (2013) use the inverse of odds, corrected by the bookmaker’s commission, to calculate the probabilities for the different outcomes in her estimation of individual risk preferences. We have also run our benchmark estimations with this alternative assumption, and we will get back to this in Section 5.

For the reasons just discussed, we here restrict attention to the CARA-value function 
                        
                           u

                              ·
                              )
                           
                           =
                           
                              
                                 1
                                 −
                                 
                                    e

                                       θ
                                       x
                                    
                                 
                              
                              θ
                           
                        
                      where x is the return. With b as bet size and q as odds, the return is 
                        
                           b
                           ·
                           
                              (
                              q
                              −
                              1
                              )
                           
                        
                      in case of success and 
                        
                           x
                           =
                           −
                           b
                        
                      in case of losses. θ > 0 (θ < 0) expresses risk-averse (risk-loving) preferences. As mentioned, our benchmark model excludes odds where the potential average gain exceeds 500 NZ dollar.

For all estimations of the benchmark model, we have 98,527 observations compared to 791,906 observations in Table 1. The reason for the difference is that each single bet is an observation in Table 1, while each indifference condition is an observation in our estimations.
                        5
                     
                     
                        5
                        For instance, in a soccer match with three outcomes and ten bets on each outcome, we have thirty observations in Table 1, but only three indifference conditions (observations) for our estimations.
                      For all preference functions, the first column in Table 2 presents the results with equal bet sizes, and the second column the results for the estimations with the average bet sizes for the respective odds in our data set.

In order to compare the performance of different probability weighting functions with likelihoods, we need to account for the fact that models with more parameters lead to (weakly) higher likelihoods. We correct for this by applying the widely used Akaike Information Criterion defined as 
                        
                           A
                           I
                           C
                           =
                           −
                           2
                           L
                           n
                           λ
                           +
                           2
                           k
                           ,
                        
                      where k is the number of free parameters in the model. The respective values are shown in Table 2. Furthermore, the third column shows which coefficients differ significantly for the specifications with equal and with different bet sizes.

With identical bet sizes, the existence of a FLB necessarily leads to the result that bettors are risk-loving (see already Ali, 1977), and we estimate

This is qualitatively in line with the literature, and quantitative differences can be attributed to different data sets and sports. Jullien and Salanié (2000) consider only horse races and find a somewhat higher degree of risk-loving (

With bet sizes, the representative bettor must be indifferent between all combinations of odds and actual average bet sizes observed in our data. Note that it can then no longer be taken for granted that risk-loving individuals prefer longshots. To see this, suppose a bettor invests 1 dollar on a longshot. Then, for all bets with lower odds, one gets a bet size such that the bettor is indifferent between this bet and betting 1 dollar on the longshot.

With the actual average bet sizes, the estimated degree of risk-loving is lower than with identical bet sizes (
                        
                           θ
                           =

                           0.002
                        
                     ), but still significant at the 1 dollar-level. This is in line with findings by Kopriva (2009) who also reports lower degrees of risk-loving when taking different bet sizes into account. For his data set, the assumption of risk neutrality can only be rejected for horse races with 
                        
                           θ
                           =
                           −
                           0.0005
                        
                     . Recall that Kopriva (2009) is the only other paper estimating the preferences or a representative bettor with different bet sizes, but for EUT only.

The difference between our results with and without bet sizes is significant at the 1 dollar-level. Furthermore, the standard error is far lower with bet sizes. For a better understanding of the differences of the two estimation procedures in all subsequent models, let us consider the simple case of EUT in greater detail: when we assume identical bet sizes and estimate the risk attitude-parameter θ from the indifference condition, then we implicitly measure the product bθ, because the bet size b is not considered explicitly. And since bet sizes are larger for favorites, this underestimates the risk of betting on favorites. Therefore, we estimate a rather large negative θ as bettors could otherwise not be indifferent between high-risk bets on longshots and apparently low-risk bets on favorites. Adding the actual bet sizes drives θ closer to risk neutrality as it reduces the risk gap between longshots and favorites. At the same time, even low changes in the risk attitude parameter θ lead to large changes in the likelihood as they are multiplied with 
                        
                           b
                           
                              (
                              q
                              −
                              1
                              )
                           
                        
                      in the gain- and with b in the loss domain. Consequently, standard errors are lower with bet sizes.


                     Model II. Powerfunction with loss aversion
                  

We now proceed to several probability weighting functions for CPT. We start with a simple powerfunction where the probabilities assigned for gains and losses are 
                        
                           
                              π
                              i
                           
                           =
                           
                              p
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 α
                                 i
                              
                           
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           i
                           =
                           G
                           ,
                           L
                        
                     .
                        8
                     
                     
                        8
                        We acknowledge that, from a theoretical point of view, the specifications used in this and in other papers are not free of problems (see Law & Peel, 2007). In a model with fixed-amounts gambling, Law and Peel (2009) demonstrate that, in CPT, the relationship between the skewness of return and expected return is far from clear-cut. By use of examples, they show that, depending on the probability levels, the trade-off between expected return and win probability may change signs.
                      For αi
                      < 1, small probabilities are overweighted compared to large probabilities. Therefore, αi
                      < 1, 
                        
                           i
                           =
                           G
                           ,
                           L
                           ,
                        
                      makes betting on longshots more attractive.

We allow for loss aversion by assuming that gains are weighted with one and losses with λ, so that λ > 1 expresses loss aversion. With identical bet sizes, loss aversion makes favorites more attractive as losses are the same in both cases, and because the loss probability is higher for longshots. For identical bet sizes, all parameters except λ are insignificant, but 
                        
                           λ
                           =
                           0.781
                           ,
                        
                      significant at the 1 percent-level, expresses that losses are considerably underweighted compared to gains. We view this result as not too surprising for betting markets as bettors invest in risky assets with negative expected values.

                        Comparing the finding of a negative loss aversion to the literature is rough as there are no comparable papers (Jullien and Salanié (2000), do not estimate powerfunctions with loss aversion). The more general literature on powerfunctions with loss aversion yields mixed results. Our finding is in line with Harrison and Rutström (2008) who report 
                              
                                 λ
                                 =
                                 0.732
                                 ,
                              
                            and Harinck, Van Dijk, Van Beest, and Mersmann (2007) who also report λ < 1, while several other studies find coefficients which do not significantly differ from one (Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2008; Ert & Erev, 2008; Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2006; Nicolau, 2012; Yechiam & Telpaz, 2013) or coefficients supporting loss aversion (Gill and Prowse (2012); see Camerer (2000), for an overview).
                     
                  

Adding different bet sizes has no strong impact on the coefficients, but the model performs much better. First, all standard errors are now far lower than with identical bet sizes. By contrast to identical bet sizes, this leads to significant coefficients for the probability weighting both in the gain- and in the loss domain. In the gain domain, 
                        
                           
                              α
                              G
                           
                           =
                           0.993
                        
                      expresses that all probabilities are overweighted, but to a larger degree for small probabilities. 
                        
                           
                              α
                              L
                           
                           =
                           0.964
                        
                      means that the overweighting of small probabilities is even more pronounced in the loss domain. While this would ceteris paribus favor favorites, it is countervailed by the underweighting of losses (
                        
                           λ
                           =
                           0.781
                        
                     ). Let us briefly explain why standard errors decrease with actual bet sizes. First, as θ is close to zero, the indifference condition between longshots and favorites is based on probability weighting rather than on attitudes towards risk. For identical bet sizes, the curvature of the likelihood-function is low and standard errors are large, i.e. other parameters would lead to comparably good estimations. This means that, as already emphasized by Jullien and Salanié (2000), the estimations with identical bet sizes are not very trustworthy. By contrast, even small changes in the parameters lead to considerable changes in the likelihood when taking the actual average bet sizes into account, so that the results are more reliable. Furthermore, when we substitute the coefficients estimated from the model with equal bet sizes into the model with actual bet sizes, we find that they perform rather poorly with considerably lower likelihoods as shown in brackets. The values for the AIC are displayed in the row beneath.

For all subsequent specifications, we illustrate by means of a simple numerical example that our findings are consistent with the existence of a pronounced FLB. In the example, we assume a favorite with a winning probability of 80 percent and a longshot with 20 percent. Then, we derive the expected utilities for the two alternatives under the probability weightings calculated for the respective specifications, and when assuming that odds are fair. For all specifications, we find that the representative bettor would strongly prefer the longshot.

Next, we consider two specifications suggested by Prelec (1998). The first one allows for just one probability weighting parameter each in the gain- and in the loss domain, and is given by

                      we would be back to linear probability weighting. Similar to powerfunctions, the overweighting of small probabilities is larger when αi
                      is small. Concerning the likelihood and the AIC, the model performs far worse than the powerfunction with loss aversion, but the results are qualitatively close. First, the model with bet sizes strongly suggests that bettors are risk-neutral, and the standard error for θ is remarkably small. Second, the overweighting of small probabilities is far more pronounced in the loss- compared to the gain domain. Third, the model with different bet sizes again performs much better with respect to the standard errors. The results on probability weighting are comparable to those in Jullien and Salanié (2000) who, however, find risk-loving preferences, significant at the 1 percent-level. In any case, we do not put much emphasis on the Prelec I-model as it performs poorly compared to the subsequent, more complex models. Compatible with the existence of the FLB, our example yields

The results of the Prelec II-model are in many respects similar to those before. With average bet sizes, we again find clear evidence for risk neutrality. Standard errors are far lower than with identical bet sizes. The likelihood for the Prelec II-model is basically the same as for the powerfunction with loss aversion. To check the importance of different bet sizes, we substitute the coefficients from the model with equal bet sizes into the model with different bet sizes. Then, the likelihood decreases sharply from

                      express that all probabilities are overweighted, but to a larger degree so for small probabilities. This implies an overbetting of longshots.

                      expresses that all probabilities in the loss domain are underweighted. This adds to our understanding on why bettors might bet at all as an underweighting of probabilities for losses relative to gains overestimates the betting return.

In the loss domain, small probabilities are more strongly underweighted than large probabilities, which makes betting on favorites ceteris paribus more valuable compared to betting on longshots. However, it can easily be shown that the overweighting of small probabilities in the gain domain dominates, so that the coefficients are in line with the existence of a pronounced FLB in the data set. Our example yields

                      and

                     .

Not only the likelihood, but also the AIC shows that Prelec II strongly outperforms Prelec I. The intuition is as follows: the lower the explanatory power of the value function is, the more important it is to allow for additional parameters in the weighting function in order to get a good fit for the data. And since we find strong evidence for risk neutrality which means that the value function adds little for explaining the data, more complex models perform better. Thus, correcting by the AIC has no strong impact when we compare the performance of the different models. This general insight will be reinforced by our next specifications.

                      which has been applied by many authors including Tversky and Kahneman (1992) and Camerer and Ho (1994). In the specifications used so far, all probabilities are necessarily either over- or underweighted (albeit at a different degree which allows capturing the overweighting of small probabilities relative to large probabilities). The Tversky and Kahnemann-specification allows to overweight small probabilities and to underweight high probabilities (for instance, for 
                        
                           α
                           =
                           0.5
                           ,
                        
                      all probabilities up to around 0.278 are overweighted). Where the underweighting kicks in depends quantitatively on αi
                     : the higher αi
                     , the fewer probabilities are overweighted. The smaller αi
                     , the lower is the relation between high and small probabilities, and the more attractive is betting on longshots.

Compared to the powerfunction and the Prelec II-model, the likelihood is rather low which we attribute to the fact that just one parameter each is used for estimating the probability weighting in the gain- and loss-domain, respectively. With bet sizes, the degree of risk-loving is significant due to an extremely low standard error, but economically meaningless. Consequently, this specification also supports explanations based on the overweighting of small probabilities with coefficients of around 0.95 for gains and lower coefficients for losses.

Consider again the model with different bet sizes for a closer interpretation of the coefficients.

                      makes betting on longshots more attractive due to the overweighting of small probabilities for gains and losses. To a large degree, results are similar to the other well performing probability weighting functions. There is no evidence for risk-loving preferences, and the FLB is explained by probability weighting. The coefficients for probability weighting do not significantly differ from each other with and without bet sizes, but are significant at the 1 percent-level with bet sizes and insignificant without. The likelihood is similar to the Prelec II-specification.

For an interpretation of the coefficients, consider again the model with different bet sizes. In line with the Prelec II-specification, all probabilities in the gain domain are overweighted, while all probabilities in the loss domain are underweighted. The distortion in probabilities is more pronounced for small probabilities compared to high probabilities, and the effect in the gain domain dominates.

                           0.216
                        
                      illustrates the more general finding that the probability weightings in the Prelec II- and in the Lattimore et al. (1992)–specifications are pretty close for the model with different bet sizes.

Summing up, the three well-performing models II, IV and VI share the following results: First, allowing for different bet sizes reduces the standard errors for all coefficients to a large degree. As a consequence, most coefficients for probability weighting are insignificant for identical bet sizes, but highly significant with the bet sizes from our data set. Second, all estimations suggest that bettors are risk-neutral since θ is close to zero and insignificant, even though standard errors are extremely small. Third, modeling loss aversion explicitly or allowing for two parameters each for probability weighting in the gain- and the loss domain is crucial for improving the model’s explanatory power. Fourth, considering the AIC instead of the likelihood does not change the performance ranking of the different specifications, because the marginal utility of complex weighting functions in explaining the data is high for risk-neutral bettors.


                     Different thresholds for bet sizes
                  

We now turn to several robustness checks. Starting with different thresholds for the bets included in our estimations, Table A1 in the Appendix reports the results for lower thresholds of 100 and 300 NZ dollar and for all bets (no threshold). For the three well performing specifications, the coefficients are robust for all thresholds, which holds for equal and for different bet sizes. For our less well performing specifications (EUT, Prelec I, and Tversky and Kahnemann), results are only partially robust. This reinforces our view of the superiority of models II, IV and VI.


                     Restricting attention to odds above 2
                  


                     Fig. 1 in the data description shows that the odds-dependency of bet sizes is most pronounced for low odds. Although this is not surprising as one hardly bets 1 dollar on a quota of 1.1, it suggests to check whether integrating the actual bet sizes remains important when we exclude low odds. We thus estimated our three well-performing benchmark models for a reduced data set where we exclude odds below two. Table A2 in the Appendix presents the results for the Prelec II-specification as an example and shows that our results remain qualitatively the same: With bet sizes, all coefficients are highly significant, while they are insignificant with identical amounts due to the large standard errors. When we use the coefficients with identical bet sizes for the estimation with average bet sizes, the likelihood increases sharply, i.e. the model performs poorly. The findings for the other two well-performing models are similar and available on request.


                     Powerfunction for values
                  

In our benchmark estimations, we restricted attention to the CARA-value function as this is the only one we can use for EUT, and also in order to compare to the literature. For CPT, however, it is interesting to consider in addition a powerfunction for values where the utility of gains (x > 0) is xβ
                      and the utility of losses (x < 0) is 
                        
                           −
                           
                              
                                 (
                                 −
                                 x
                                 )
                              
                              β
                           
                        
                     . In line with prospect theory, β < 0 would imply risk-averse preferences in the gain- and risk-seeking preferences in the loss domain. This function is also widely used in the literature (see Andrikogiannopoulou and Papakonstantinou (2013), for betting markets, and Harrison and Rutström (2008), p. 190, for the experimental estimation of preferences).

For our estimation procedure based on the indifference condition of the representative bettor, the problem arises that the difference between any two bets becomes small if β converges to zero: in this case, even high gains and losses enter only with weight one, so that the expected net utility is close to zero for all probabilities and probability weightings. As 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           0
                        
                      does not make sense contentwise, we need to impose exogenous restrictions for β, as the program otherwise establishes the indifference condition by picking 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           0
                        
                     .

Moreover, for any exogenously imposed minimum value of β, the estimation converges to this lower bound. While this limits benefits of the powerfunction for values, it is still interesting to observe the coefficients for probability weighting for moderate lower bounds of β . In Table A3 in the Appendix, we again use the Prelec II-probability weighting as an example and show the results for lower bounds of 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           1.01
                        
                      and 
                        
                           β
                           =
                           0.99
                           ,
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           β
                           =
                           0.98
                           ,
                        
                      where the latter two cases express risk-aversion in the gain domain. Not surprisingly, the parameters for the Prelec II-specification come close to those for the CARA-value-function as the imposed risk preferences are not too pronounced.

                      mean that probabilities in the loss domain are underweighted. We acknowledge that these results are not too valuable as, with the estimation procedure for the representative bettor approach, we cannot properly estimate the risk preferences with the powerfunction for values. However, even when we impose rather high lower bounds such as 
                        
                           β

                      the probability weighting coefficients are still close to those for risk-neutrality.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In our analysis, we needed to make several decisions that are worth being discussed. We first consider an alternative specification of the probabilities bettors assign to bets. Then, we turn to restrictions of CPT with respect to our understanding of the behavior in betting markets. Finally, we relate our findings to other explanations of the FLB, and in particular to a recently published paper by Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014) which relies on the interplay of informed and uninformed bettors.


                     An alternative on probabilities assigned by bettors
                  

As mentioned in the methodology section, an alternative for the probabilities assigned by bettors is the inverse of odds, corrected by the bookmaker’s commission (see Andrikogiannopoulou & Papakonstantinou, 2013). Note first that this does not make sense for equal bet sizes, because risk-neutral bettors with linear probability weighting are then always indifferent between all bets. For fair and non-distorted odds, this would also be the case with unequal bet sizes. With a positive take-out-rate, however, expected losses are increasing in the amount invested, so that the alternative approach can be applied.

The main conceptual difference can most easily be illustrated for EUT: if bettors believe that odds reflect probabilities, then the parameters we estimate do not need to explain the distortion of odds towards favorites, and this reduces the degree of risk-seeking preferences. EUT then even leads to a slight degree of risk aversion, but again performs very poorly with respect to the likelihood.


                     Table A4 in the Appendix presents our results for the benchmark model with a threshold of 500 NZ dollar. Even though the results differ for the reasons just discussed, the most important findings for CPT still hold: First, we find no economically meaningful deviation from risk neutrality. Second, small probabilities are overweighted, albeit to a lower degree as expected. Third, more complex models again perform considerably better with respect to the AIC.


                     Limits of CPT
                  

By extending the seminal paper of Jullien and Salanié (2000) to odds-dependent bet sizes, the main purpose of our study is to analyze how EUT and different variants of CPT perform in fitting the data. For assessing the value added of such an approach, let us briefly discuss the benefits and limits of CPT in explaining the FLB. In line with Jullien and Salanié (2000), Snowberg and Wolfers (2010) and many papers analyzing data outside of betting markets,
                        12

                        See the discussion in Glöckner and Pachur (2012).
                      we interpret CPT as a statistical tool for fitting the data rather than as a cognitive process model for identifying information processing steps underlying people’s choices (see e.g. Booij & van de Kuilen, 2009; Fehr-Duda, Gennaro, & Schubert, 2006; Gonzalez & Wu, 1999; Harbaugh, Krause, & Vesterlund, 2002). 
                        13
                     
                     
                        13
                        We are grateful to an anonymous referee for emphasizing that we need to clarify our use of CPT.
                      Our findings clearly show that weighting functions with two parameters each in the gain- and in the loss domain fit the data well, but our analysis keeps silent on whether this finding is attributable to a cognitive process leading to systematic misperceptions of probabilities,
                        14
                     
                     
                        14
                        Recently, Hwang and Kim (2015) support the perception-based approach. They use sports betting data from volleyball games to test if people correctly understand the probabilities when outcomes follow a binomial distribution. They find that bettors consistently underestimate probabilities of outcomes located at the extreme ends of the distribution.
                      to preferences for small probabilities, or to something different not accounted for in our model. CPT emerges as a reasonable model in summarizing the data, but this does not mean that it also provides a good description of the reasoning underlying people’s choices (Glöckner & Pachur, 2012; Pachur, Hertwig, Gigerenzer, & Brandstätter, 2013; Roberts & Pashler, 2000). This is a limitation that needs to be taken into account.

A second and related limitation is that there are many possible specifications both for the value- and for the weighting function. Stott (2006) has demonstrated that the performance of the different models in explaining the data depends on the combination of both functions. For weighting functions, we replicate the specifications in Stott (2006), and those entail all weighting functions in the related betting market papers by Jullien and Salanié (2000), Snowberg and Wolfers (2010) and Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014). For value functions, however, we mainly confine attention to CARA for the reasons discussed above. However, as CPT assesses outcomes with respect to reference points which we assume to be zero, we do not need to restrict attention to CARA for CPT, but consider the prominent powerfunction as an alternative.


                     Other explanations of the FLB
                  

As CPT fits the data by the interplay between attitudes towards risk and probability weighting, all other factors which may influence the choice of specific bets are ultimately reflected in the parameters of these functions. As this is an important limitation, we discuss briefly how other explanations of the FLB are related to our study.


                     First and in line with all betting papers estimating risk preferences, we implicitly assume that bettors bet for realizing financial gains. As average returns are negative, this is far from obvious, and several papers hence introduce a direct utility from consumption to explain why bettors bet at all. In Ottaviani and Sørensen (2010), this direct utility is an exogenous parameter, while it depends on the money values and probabilities in Conlisk (1993). Simon (1998) introduces a “dream” function to rationalize why people invest low stakes in lotteries with high potential payoffs but largely negative expected returns. The 2010 British Gambling Prevalence Survey (see Gambling Commission, 2010) reports that the chance of winning big money (83 percent) and fun (78 percent) are more often mentioned as motives than the chance of earning money (59 percent). While these motives may easily contribute to an overbetting of longshots, they all show up in an overweighting of small probabilities in our estimations. Irrespective of those concerns, however, the merit of CPT is to demonstrate that the data can well be explained by a model in which bettors behave as if they overweight small probabilities.


                     Second, the preference-based approach explains the odds exclusively by the behavior of bettors, and thereby neglects that bookmakers may fix odds strategically. Shin (1991, 1992) demonstrates that the FLB can also be rationalized by uninformed bookmakers with market power who reduce odds on longshots to avoid that informed insiders take advantage of a possible mispricing of underdogs. Levitt (2004) conversely assumes that bookmakers with superior knowledge increase their profits by fixing relative odds that deviate from the probability ratios. As our data set is provided by a monopolistic betting agency, we cannot exclude that this aspect contributes to the large FLB in our data.


                     Third, an important branch of the literature explains the FLB by bettors with heterogenous beliefs. Ali (1977) provides a nice intuition why this can lead to a FLB. Consider an event with only two outcomes and suppose that the probability distortion is symmetric in the sense that 50 percent over- and 50 percent underestimate the favorite. It can then be shown that the success probability 
                        
                           
                              p
                              ˜
                           
                           F
                        
                      the marginal bettor assigns to the favorite is identical to the percentage of those bettors who assume a higher probability than she does. And as 
                        
                           
                              
                                 p
                                 ˜
                              
                              F
                           
                           >
                           50
                        
                      percent by definition of a favorite, it follows that more than 50 percent assume a higher probability than the marginal bettor, which hence also includes at least some of the 50 percent bettors who overestimate the longshot and who hence only bet on favorites if those are overrated.
                        15
                     
                     
                        15
                        In Ottaviani and Sørensen (2009), bettors have ex ante identical beliefs, and then up-date them according to private signals. Rational bettors infer the true probabilities from the behavior of other participants, but the FLB cannot be eliminated since bettors cannot withdraw their bets placed on longshots after the market is closed.
                     
                  

Recently, Gandhi and Serrano-Padial (2014) extend the information-based approach to the interplay of sophisticated bettors with correct beliefs and unsophisticated bettors whose beliefs are idiosyncratically distributed around the correct probabilities. For extreme longshots, the FLB arises independently of the probability distribution, and the basic intuition is close to the one described by Ali (1977). Empirically, they also find evidence for risk-neutral bettors. They show that the FLB is mainly triggered by extreme longshots, and demonstrate that their model with two betting types outperforms the representative bettor approach with equal bet sizes. For our data set, the FLB is also most pronounced for extreme longshots, but basically prevails for the whole probability distribution. For instance, when we remove the 10 percent observations with the highest and the 10 percent observations with the lowest odds, and then define favorites as the bottom fifty percent lowest odds placed, then losses with longshots are on average still 116 percent higher than those with favorites. Furthermore, recall that we exclude bets where either the average bet size or the average potential gain exceeded 500 NZ percent, so that large single bets by professionals do not enter our benchmark-estimations. Given the current state of the art, it seems fair to view approaches based on heterogenous beliefs and on preferences as equally justified.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Due to a lack of data, the literature that estimates the preferences of a representative bettor has assumed that bet sizes are independent of odds. Our data shows that bet sizes are largely decreasing in odds, and that there is no reason to assume that those betting on longshots take higher risks than those betting on favorites. We show that accounting for different bet sizes largely reduces the standard errors of all coefficients. Substituting the coefficients for the models with equal bet sizes into the models with different bet sizes leads to pure-performing models, which reinforces the view that accounting for different bet sizes is important.

Our estimations strongly reject explanations of the FLB based on risk-seeking, and show that the data can well be fitted by models that allow for two coefficients for probability weighting each in the gain- and in the loss domain. Generally speaking, the overestimation of small probabilities in both domains explains the FLB, while the overweighting of probabilities in the gain- compared to the loss domain contributes to our knowledge on why bettors bet at all.

In this paper, we have closely followed the literature, in particular the canonical paper by Jullien and Salanié (2000), in order to focus exclusively on the importance of integrating odds-dependent bet sizes into the representative bettor approach. For further research, and instead of extending the representative bettor approach by adding different bet sizes, we next aim at estimating individual preferences which can then be aggregated by different attributes such as age and gender. We are only aware of one such analysis (Andrikogiannopoulou & Papakonstantinou, 2013) and due
                     
                      to the size of our data set, our analysis will allow for far more robust results.
