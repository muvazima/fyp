                  The linguistic term set is an applicable and flexible technique in qualitative decision making (QDM). To further develop the linguistic term set, this paper proposes a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS) based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics, which belongs to an asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and can be used to address the QDM problems involving risk appetites of the decision maker (DM). Then, a value-at-risk fitting (VARF) approach is designed for obtaining the risk appetite parameters of the GALTS and six desirable properties of the GALTS are analyzed, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Based on the above approaches and the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs), a QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM is designed. Because the GALPRs consist of subjective information provided by the DM, the process is not perfectly consistent and is usually difficult to change or repeat. Thus, a transitivity improvement approach is investigated, and the corresponding calculation steps are provided. Finally, an example dealing with the problem of investment decision making is provided, and the results fully demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods for QDM involving risk appetites.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Qualitative decision making (QDM) is an important decision field and can be substituted for quantitative decision making (DM) when data and quantitative information are unavailable. Meanwhile, our daily life is repeated with qualitative information, which could be considered a database of information as it closely resembles human subjective cognition. Therefore, many related QDM theories and methods have been proposed and applied (Brugha, 1998; Sabbadin, Fargier, & Lang, 1998; Ngwenyama & Bryson, 1999; Türkşen, 2002; Paul et al., 2002; Lee & Hurst, 2007; Willow, 2007; Montibeller & Belton, 2009; Wu, Zhang, Wu, & Olson, 2010; Ramey, 2013; Liao, Xu, Zeng, & Merigó, 2015; Cabrerizo, 2015).

The complexity of objectives, the fuzziness of human thought, and the uncertainty associated with the qualitative information have led to the proposal of a specific technique allowing computing with words (CWW) by Zadeh (1975, 1996) and its subsequent application to the area of QDM (Rubin, 1998; Herrera & Martinez, 2000; Ying, 2002; Herrera, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Zadeh, 2012; Yager, 2014; Massanet et al., 2014). Different from general QDM methods, the CWW method processes words and expressions that form the basis of natural or artificial languages and provides a methodology for narrowing the gap between the human brain mechanisms and the machine processes to address imprecision. Thus, the main element of the CWW method is the linguistic variable, which is defined by Zadeh (1975) as a “variable whose values are not numbers but words or sentences in a natural or artificial language.” Therefore, although these linguistic variables are less specific than numerical ones, they more closely capture the notion of human thoughts. For example, the decision makers (DMs) may prefer and consider the linguistic terms such as “good”, “fair”, and “poor” straightforward to evaluate the “comfort” of a house, instead of using numerical values. Generally, the linguistic values of a linguistic variable are collected in the form of a finite term set, referred to as a linguistic term set. As the main component and key technology of the QDM based on the CWW method, the linguistic term sets have been successfully applied in many fields (Wang, Chang, & Wang, 2009; Cabrerizo, Herrera-Viedma, & Pedrycz, 2013; Estrella, Rodriguez, Espinilla, & Martinez, 2014; Wang, Wang, Chen, Zhang, & Chen, 2014a; Pérez-Asurmendi & Chiclana, 2014; Dong & Herrera-Viedma, 2015; Merigó et al., 2015). Furthermore, various linguistic term sets have been proposed, such as the asymmetric and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set (Torra, 1996; Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000), the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set (Herrera & Martínez, 2000; Dong, Xu, & Yu, 2009), the virtual linguistic term set (Xu, 2004a), the uncertain linguistic term set (Xu, 2004b), the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set (Xu, 2004c), the proportional 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang & Hao, 2006), the unbalanced linguistic term set (Herrera-Viedma & López-Herrera, 2007; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Martinez, 2008), the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Rodriguez, Martinez, & Herrera, 2012), the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang, Wu, Wang, Zhang, & Chen, 2014b), and the extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang, 2015).

Actually, these linguistic term sets can be classified into four basic types, according to their representation forms and linguistic values, including the symmetric and uniform linguistic term set, the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set, the symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and the asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. The first two of these term sets are simple and easy to use; however, in reality, the linguistic variables of linguistic term sets are neither uniformly nor symmetrically distributed (Wang & Hao, 2006; Herrera et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2008, 2009; 2013, 2015). Herrera et al. (2008) addressed this problem by introducing the unbalanced linguistic term set and developed a methodology to process the unbalanced linguistic information. Dong et al. (2009), Dong, Hong, Xu, & Yu, 2011 proposed the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach to select the individual numerical scales and the prioritization methods in Analytic Hierarchy Process. This approach focuses on the numerical scale and the prioritization method, but not on the linguistic term sets. Note that Dong's approach can capture the asymmetry, variability, and non-uniformity by using different individual numerical scales; however, its linguistic term set is the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set. Thus, the above approaches do not fully capture some desired properties of the linguistic term sets provided by the DMs, such as generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Here, the generalized property refers to the ability of a linguistic term set to depict the above four basic linguistic term sets; the variability indicates that the considered linguistic term set should be variable for different DMs; the range consistency requires the linguistic values of a linguistic term set to be in a constant domain; and the diminishing-utility property reflects the usual law of diminishing marginal utility in economics. Therefore, this paper focuses on the construction of a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS) capable of capturing the above-listed six desirable properties, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Based on these properties, the proposed decision making method is shown to be more suitable for application to the QDM process involving risk appetites than other QDM methods, and this also demonstrates the applicability of this new method by practitioners in real decision making problems.

As mentioned above, the main purpose of this paper is to construct a generalized and asymmetric linguistic term set and to apply it to the QDM involving risk appetites. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the four basic linguistic term sets and their representations for CWW are analyzed in Section 2. Section 3 proposes the GALTS based on a developed asymmetric semantic form, and then its six desirable properties are demonstrated. Furthermore, the QDM process involving risk appetites based on the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs) is constructed and a transitivity improvement approach is designed in Section 4. Then, in Section 5, a numerical example concerning the investment decision making is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, the conclusions are provided in Section 6.

A linguistic term set is defined by a syntactic form and a semantic form, and is distributed on a predefined ordered scale (Yuen, 2012; Rodriguez & Martinez, 2013). Here, the syntactic form is a linguistic descriptor of the verbal words or sentences and can either be selected by an approach based on context-free grammar or an ordered structure (Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000). The semantic form is a mathematical representation and is described by membership functions such as the trapezoidal membership function (Delgado, Vila, & Voxman, 1998) and the triangular membership function (Xu, 2008). In the following text, the four aforementioned basic linguistic term sets are analyzed and compared from the perspective of syntax and semantics.

Formally, a general linguistic term set S (known as the symmetric and uniform linguistic term set) with syntax and semantics can be represented as:

                        
                           (1)

                                 =

For Eq.(1), Bordogna, Fedrizzi, and Pasi (1997) pointed out that

                      should be neither too large nor too small. If 
                        
                           τ
                           +

                      is an odd number, then S is usually used to represent a symmetrically distributed term set, based on which Xu (2004b) defined the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set as:

It is easily found that both the general linguistic term set and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set are symmetrically and uniformly distributed. Xu (2004b) pointed out that, among these two linguistic term sets, the latter is more logical than the former. Liao, Xu, and Zeng (2014) subsequently provided the semantics of the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set.

Next, based on the unbalanced linguistic term set (Herrera-Viedma & López-Herrera, 2007), Xu (2009) provided a simplified unbalanced linguistic term set denoted as follows:

It can be found that the unbalanced linguistic term set is a symmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set.

Furthermore, an asymmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set was proposed by Torra (1996) and Herrera and Herrera-Viedma (2000). Because the particular sub-domain may be more informative than the remaining sub-domains, this linguistic term set assumes that the density of terms in a sub-domain is greater than that in the other sub-domains of the reference domain. It is noteworthy that, in this situation, the negation function may not involve one-to-one mapping and should be designed according to the semantics of terms in the reference domain. However, the specific form of the asymmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set is not provided.

Thus, four basic linguistic term sets, which include the general linguistic term set, the subscript- symmetric linguistic term set, the symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and the asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, have been presented. Figs. 1–4
                     
                     
                     
                      demonstrate their differences and properties:

Based on Figs. 1–4, the following conclusions are derived: (1) both the general linguistic term set and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set belong to the category of symmetrical and uniform linguistic term sets, which are two simple linguistic term sets; (2) the unbalanced linguistic term set belongs to the category of symmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term sets; (3) the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set is a more generalized linguistic term set; however, its syntax and semantics are still not defined rigorously, which prevents it from being effectively applied to CWW. For this reason, a new asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set, namely the generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS), is developed in the next section.

As mentioned above, the basic element of a linguistic term set is the semantics. Therefore, in the following, the asymmetric sigmoid semantics is designed first, based on which the GALTS is proposed. Then, the risk appetites and six desirable properties of the GALTS are presented and calculated for theoretically demonstrating the advantages of the GALTS.

The semantic form of the linguistic term set is a mathematical representation and is described by a membership function such as the trapezoidal membership function (Delgado et al., 1998) or the triangular membership function (Xu, 2008). Therefore, in what follows, an extended sigmoid function is developed, forming the basis for the definition of an asymmetric semantic form and the development of the GALTS.

It can be found that the extended sigmoid function g(t) ∈ [0, 1] is asymmetric when θ
                        1 ≠ θ
                        2. Then, an asymmetric semantic form can be defined as follows:


                        
                           Definition 2
                           Let the extended sigmoid function be the mathematical representation of a semantic form, in which case it is defined as the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.

Moreover, based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set (Xu, 2004b), the following asymmetry and non-uniformity GALTS is constructed:

                         is an asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. Of course, if the DM accepts that her/his risk appetites for “good” and “poor” are equal, then

                         is a symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. Thus, the proposed GALTS is a generalized linguistic term set. The above phenomena and properties are illustrated and proven in figures and mathematical equations in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.


                        Definition 3 shows that there are two risk appetite parameters (“good” and “poor”) in the GALTS, namely θ
                        1 and θ
                        2, where θ
                        1 is defined as the profitable risk appetite parameter and θ
                        2 is defined as the loss-causing risk appetite parameter. Additionally,

                        . Then, the GALTS can capture the DM preferences and risk appetites by the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. However, the question becomes deciding how to obtain suitable and accepted risk appetite parameters for the DM. This problem is addressed by designing the following value-at-risk fitting (VARF) approach for calculating θ
                        1 and θ
                        2. This approach is defined as follows:

The Euclidean distance is found to be the basis of Eq. (6), and can also be replaced by the normalized Euclidean distance, the Hamming distance, or the normalized Hamming distance, and the calculation processes are consistent. Next, the following three examples are provided to demonstrate the VARF approach.

Based on Example 1 and Fig. 5, the following conclusions can be derived:

                           
                              •
                              By comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 4, we find that the GALTS belongs to the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set, exhibiting the asymmetry and non-uniformity.

The GALTS can present the DM risk appetites by using the two risk appetite parameters,

                                 . In this example, the DM provides his/her accepted linguistic term values, which form the basis for obtaining the specific semantics and the GALTS.

The above GALTS also shows that this DM is a risk seeker because the larger values are assigned to profitable risks than lose-causing risks.

                        Fig. 8
                         shows the fitting results of Examples 1, 2, and 3. The fit errors for these three examples are below 10%, which demonstrates that the VARF approach can be used to effectively fit the linguistic term values provided by a DM, including the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic terms, the symmetrical and non-uniform linguistic terms, and the symmetrical and uniform linguistic terms. Therefore, the GALTS based on the proposed asymmetric sigmoid semantics is a generalized linguistic term set.

As a new and generalized linguistic term set, the GALTS has some desirable properties such as asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. The first three properties, including asymmetry, non-uniformity, and generality, are illustrated in Examples 1 to 3. The remaining three properties are presented and proven as follows:

                        Property 4 shows that the GALTS varies for different DMs according to their risk appetites even though the syntactic form and the linguistic variables are invariable. Obviously, this setting is more reasonable than the linguistic term sets with unchanged syntactic and semantic forms.

Similar to the above proof, (2) can be easily obtained, and thus, the proof is completed. ■

As a behavior rule, the law of diminishing marginal utility applies in our daily life. Therefore, this rule is suitable to be applied to the linguistic values of a linguistic term set in the QDM process. It is noted that only the unbalanced linguistic term set and the proposed GALTS exhibit this property.

With regard to the six properties, the asymmetric sigmoid semantics and the GALTS are suitable for depicting the linguistic terms and for obtaining the qualitative evaluation information.

A common and feasible approach to apply the linguistic terms to the QDM process is to construct the preference relations of the corresponding linguistic terms (Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata, & Chiclana, 2005; Xu, 2005; Alonso, Cabrerizo, Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Tan, Wu, & Ma, 2011; Xu, Ma, Tao, & Wang, 2014; Haghighi et al., 2014; Sun & Ma, 2015; Yan & Ma, 2015). Therefore, in this section, the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs) are constructed by combining the preference relations and the GALTS, and then apply it into the corresponding QDM process involving the risk appetites of the DM. For this, the GALPRs are first proposed and analyzed as follows:

To construct the GALPRs, two preference matrices, namely a generalized asymmetric linguistic preference term (GALPT) matrix and a generalized asymmetric linguistic preference value (GALPV) matrix, are defined as follows:

                                 t(i, j) based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.

Because the GALPRs are based on subjective information provided by the DM, these relations may not be perfectly consistent, and the lack of consistency may lead to an unreasonable result. Meanwhile, the original generalized asymmetric linguistic preference information provided by the DM is usually difficult to change or to provide again. Thus, to enable the GALPRs to be used for the QDM, in the following, a transitivity improvement approach is provided:

From Definitions 4 and 5, it is found that the GALPV matrix

                         to present his/her individual risk appetites. Then, the optimal alternative which satisfies the DM risk appetites is obtained by applying the following QDM process:


                        Step 1. Use the VARF approach to calculate the DM profitable and lose-causing risk appetite parameters θ
                        1 and θ
                        2, respectively, and obtain the asymmetric sigmoid semantic form g(t).


                        Step 2. Use the transitivity improvement approach to calculate and obtain the virtual GALPT matrices

To further illustrate the application of the above-mentioned approaches, an investment decision making example is introduced and analyzed as follows:


                        
                           Example 4
                           An investor desires to place an idle fund on the New Tertiary Board as a long-term risk investment with the aim of obtaining high returns. The New Tertiary Board (i.e., the National Equities Exchange and Quotations) was rebuilt in 2012 as a new stock exchange market in China and as the Growth Enterprises Market board expanded, with the aim of activating the multiple-level capital market and services for small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, it is obviously characterized by a high-risk and high-return market. This particular investor considers six newly listed companies xi
                              
                              
                                 
                                    (
                                    i
                                    =
                                    1
                                    ,
                                    2
                                    ,
                                    …
                                    ,
                                    6
                                    )
                                 
                               on the New Tertiary Board to be very promising. These represent the following six potential businesses: a multinational law company x
                              1, a civilian drone company x
                              2, a new materials company x
                              3, an e-commerce company x
                              4, an immigration consultant industry x
                              5, and an off-shore gas recovery company x
                              6. Furthermore, the investor prefers using three criteria to compare and select the companies, i.e., technical feasibility y
                              1, profitability y
                              2, and team capability y
                              3. However, as the six companies are newly listed, reliable financial data and quantified material about these companies and criteria are limited. Thus, the QDM method based on linguistic preference relations is suitable. Moreover, the QDM method based on the GALTS with risk appetites proposed in this paper could be more reasonable than other methods for this type of investment decision making. Thus, this QDM process presented in Section 4.2 is applied in this example.

Based on the calculations in Section 5.1, the optimal alternatives are different for the risk-seeking and risk-neutral investors in this example. Therefore, to further analyze the different results for the DMs with different risk appetites and demonstrate the necessity of introducing the GALTS, the following calculations and comparisons are given:

Firstly, based on the asymmetric linguistic semantics and the GALPVs, the DMs can be classified according to nine risk profiles, including the strong risk seeker (SRS), the strong income-risk seeker (SIS), the general risk seeker (GRS), the general income-risk seeker (GIS), the risk neutral (RN), the general cost-risk averter (GCA), the general risk averter (GRA), the strong cost-risk averter (SCA), and the strong risk averter (SRA). These nine types of DMs and their corresponding asymmetric linguistic semantics are illustrated in Figs. 9–17
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                         according to the first five columns of Table 2
                        . Note that the risk appetite parameters of these DMs are set based on the distribution of the extended sigmoid function. Secondly, by using the same calculations as in Example 4, the optimal alternatives can be obtained for the DMs with different risk appetites, and the results are listed in Table 2.
                     

From Example 4, Figs. 9–17, and Table 2, the following conclusions are derived:

                           
                              (1)
                              The results are inconsistent for the DMs with different risk appetites. For SRS, SIS, GIS, GCA, GRA, SCA, and SRA, the optimal alternative is x
                                 4. However, for GRS and RN, the optimal alternative is x
                                 1. Actually, for GRS, GIS, RN, and GCA, the alternatives x
                                 1 and x
                                 4 are approximate, because their differences are less than 0.025; thus, both of these alternatives can be taken as their optimal alternatives. Therefore, the DM appetite for risk critically affects the process of decision making in terms of risk, and the proposed GALTS is a suitable approach for the QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM.

The GALTS based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics can effectively depict a variety of DMs with different risk appetites, which is illustrated in Figs. 9–17. These figures indicate that the linguistic values of a risk seeker are larger than those of a risk neutral DM, but the reverse is true for a risk averter. Moreover, the risk seekers and the risk averters can be classified according to their risk appetite parameters. Thus, if the VARF approach proposed above is unavailable, then the DM can provide his/her subjective risk preferences and obtain the corresponding risk appetite parameters based on Figs. 9–17 and Table 2.

                                  with the original linguistic terms in Table 1, it is clear that some linguistic terms are changed by the transitivity improvement approach. This means that the accepted linguistic terms provided by the DMs are changed to ensure consistency. Therefore, if the original linguistic information provided by the DMs remains unchanged and is only provided once, the transitivity improvement is requisite and effective; otherwise, it is suggested that the original linguistic information should be obtained again from the DMs until the consistency is satisfied.

The six desirable properties of the GALTS are fully demonstrated in Figs 9-17 and Table 2. Meanwhile, the GALTS is capable of providing the optimal alternative according to the risk appetites of different DMs.

Based on the above calculations, the GALTS is more rational than the other linguistic term sets, and is more suitable for describing the QDM process involving risk appetites than other similar approaches, including Dong's approach. This study also demonstrates three advantages of the proposed approach, namely, capturing the six desirable properties, accounting for the DM risk appetites, and the suitability for the QDM process involving risk appetites.

The QDM approach based on the linguistic term set is an intuitional and applicable method and has been used in many fields. Because of this, various linguistic term sets have been proposed to develop this QDM approach, such as the general linguistic term set, the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set, the unbalanced linguistic term set, and the asymmetrically and non-uniform linguistic term set. To further develop the linguistic term set, in this paper, the GALTS has been proposed which is a generalized linguistic term set and a specific asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set. Then, six desirable properties of the GALTS, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility, are proved. An obvious advantage of the proposed GALTS is its accounting for the DM's risk appetites. Thus, the QDM process based on the GALTSs is more suitable for application to the qualitative risk-preference decision making than other QDM approaches. This leads us to propose the asymmetric sigmoid semantics based on the extended sigmoid function followed by designing the VARF method to obtain the risk appetite parameters of the DM.

However, the linguistic term preference information provided by the DM is usually inconsistent. This problem has been addressed by proposing the transitivity improvement approach, which can be used to improve the consistency of the GALPT preference relations provided by the DM, and thus, the partial linguistic terms provided by the DMs could be changed to ensure consistency. Therefore, if the original linguistic information remains unchanged and is only provided once, then the transitivity improvement is requisite; otherwise, it is suggested that the original linguistic information will be re-obtained from the DMs until the consistency is satisfied.

Next, the modeling process for the QDM involving the risk appetites based on the proposed GALTSs has been provided, after which it has been applied to an investment decision making example to further demonstrate its feasibility. This result demonstrates that the proposed method of decision making can be suitably applied to model the QDM process involving risk appetites of the DMs.

Admittedly, the proposed QDM process involving risk appetites is curbed by certain limitations; i.e., the values of the risk appetite parameters θ
                     1 and θ
                     2 of the GALTS are uncertain. Even though the VARF approach is designed for obtaining these parameters in this paper, the solutions depend on the accepted linguistic term values provided by DMs and are difficult to verify. Thus, in future work, it would be interesting to determine whether a better algorithm exists for obtaining the risk appetite parameters in the GALTS and the corresponding QDM process.
