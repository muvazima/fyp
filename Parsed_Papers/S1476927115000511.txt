                  Objectives
                  To explore molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer (BC), network strategy was used to find biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis.
               
               
                  Methods
                  The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between bladder carcinoma patients and normal subjects were screened using empirical Bayes method of the linear models for microarray data package. Co-expression networks were constructed by differentially co-expressed genes and links. Regulatory impact factors (RIF) metric was used to identify critical transcription factors (TFs). The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and clusters were obtained through molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm. Centralities analyses for complex networks were performed based on degree, stress and betweenness. Enrichment analyses were performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
               
               
                  Results
                  Co-expression networks and TFs (based on expression data of global DEGs and DEGs in different stages and grades) were identified. Hub genes of complex networks, such as UBE2C, ACTA2, FABP4, CKS2, FN1 and TOP2A, were also obtained according to analysis of degree. In gene enrichment analyses of global DEGs, cell adhesion, proteinaceous extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix structural constituent were top three GO terms. ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and cell cycle were significant pathways.
               
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our results provide some potential underlying biomarkers of BC. However, further validation is required and deep studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of BC.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Radical radiotherapy of bladder cancer (BC) is associated with a relatively high rate of incomplete response or local recurrence with salvage cystectomy for treatment failures. While synchronous chemotherapy combined with radio-therapy improve locoregional control of BC (James et al., 2012), it may be time to further clinical trials and considered for certain specific patient groups (Stenzl et al., 2011). Although radical surgical removal of the bladder is considered as the standard treatment, many BC patients have a substantial number of coexisting illnesses that pose risks for radical surgical approaches (James et al., 2012).

Numbers of studies have been performed to explore molecular markers along progression of BC. For example, Sanchez-Carbayo et al. (2003) identified gene expression changes of early stage bladder tumors based on cDNA microarrays. FGFR3 and TP53, which associated with change of tumor grade, tumor stage, and recurrences, were confirmed as molecular markers of urothelial neoplasms and recognized as key genetic pathways in the carcinogenesis (Cheng et al., 2011). PCNA is a 36kDa nucleic–acidic protein essential for nuclear proliferation and appeared to increase gradually when the grade and stage of the tumor escalated (Yıldırım et al., 2014). When comparing BC vs. controls, as well as in non-muscle invasive vs. muscle invasive tumors and in low vs. high grade tumors, osteopontin (OPN, SPP1) are with at least 2-fold differential expression due to its multiple biological functions (Zaravinos et al., 2011). Besides Hung and Chiu (2015) have suggested potential pathways and potential gene fragments of pathways related to progress of BC based on protein networks with gene expression changes. These genes and pathways were promising cancer markers for early detection of BC, but mechanism of BC development and genes associated with the process were still unclear.

In this paper, we identified global differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and DEGs in different stages and grades of BC by empirical Bayes method of the linear models for microarray data package. Next, co-expression networks were constructed by differentially co-expressed genes and links based on these genes and regulatory impact factors (RIF) metric was introduced to identify critical transcription factors (TFs). Afterwards, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed based on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. We selected molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm to analyze the subsets of PPI network. Centralities analyses of complex networks were performed mainly based on degree, stress and betweenness. Meanwhile, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed based on Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) test to illuminate the biological pathways and processes which generally affected BC patients. We may light the further insight of BC development at molecular level.

The microarray expression dataset from the study conducted by Lindgren et al. (2010) was used for identifying DEGs of BC. A total of 57 BC samples existed in the dataset (ArrayExpress online database, E-TABM-147). We selected gene expression profiles (52 BC samples and 10 normal samples) from only one platform (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U95A) which contained healthy controls in E-TABM-147 to avoid the bath effects between the different platforms. In this dataset, BC patients could be divided into 5 groups according to invasive depth stage (Ta, T1–T4) or 3 groups relied on malignancy grade (G1–G3) of the tumor.

The probe-level data in cell files were converted into expression measures. Background correction was performed by the robust multi-array average (RMA) algorithm (Irizarry et al., 2003). Quantiles method was carried out for normalization and “median polish” method for summarization (Kim et al., 2007). The platform annotation files provided by Affymetrix Company were used to map the relationship between the probes and gene symbols. A probe would be filtered if there is no corresponding gene symbol. We obtained the average value of gene symbol with multiple probes.

Genes differently expressed between BC patients and normal subjects were identified using the empirical Bayes method of linear models for microarray data package (Smyth, 2004). The approach could be used for the analysis of factorial data with high density oligonucleotide microarray data. The false discovery rate was controlled by Benjamini-Hochberg test (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Only the genes which met our criterion (P
                        <0.05, |log fold change|>2) were selected as DEGs in this study. We identified the global DEGs between all the BC patients and normal subjects. Subsets of the global DEGs were also obtained by intersection of the global DEGs and DEGs between different groups (different stages or grades, respectively) and normal subjects.

In this work, co-expression networks were constructed by differential co-expression genes and links (Yang et al., 2013) and visualized by Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Briefly, a typical differential co-expression analysis workflow involves three successive procedures: gene filtration, link filtration and identification of differentially co-expressed genes and links. For gene filtration, it was carried out based on the expression level (only global DEGs were retained). For link filtration, the co-expression values, associated with corresponding P-values (Student’s t-test of the zero nature of the Pearson correlation coefficient), was wrapped in link filtration module to filter gene co-expression links in co-expression networks. Then, the P-values were sorted and transformed to q-values (false discovery rates) under each of the two experimental conditions. In this way, each gene link was associated with a pair of q-value, and those links with q-values in two conditions higher than the threshold (P
                        =0.05) were filtered out. Co-expression network based on global DEGs was constructed. Moreover, co-expression networks at different stages and grades were also constructed respectively based on expression profiles of global DEGs in different stages and grades.

The key TFs in the network were identified by RIF metric. RIF metric was originally developed to identify causal regulators from gene expression data contrasting 2 conditions (Reverter et al., 2010). The threshold of P
                        <0.05 was considered significant for the RIF metric. RIF could combine the change in co-expression between the TFs and the DEGs. The expression for PIF was shown in Eq. (1).

                        <0.05 was considered significant for the RIF metric.

We identified the global TFs using the gene expression profiles of DEGs between all BC patients and normal subjects. The subsets of TFs in different stages or grades were also identified.

PPI networks may represent molecular complexes. For protein interaction data, we utilized a human PPI dataset from STRING. Besides, the molecular complex in the global PPI network was obtained by the MCODE, which theoretically cluster algorithm that selects densely connected regions in large PPI networks (Bader and Hogue, 2003).

The MCODE algorithm mainly includes three stages: vertex weighting, complex prediction and optional post-processing. At the stage of vertex weighting, all vertices based on their local network density were weighted using the highest k-core of the vertex neighborhood. At the stage of complex prediction, the vertex weighted graph was taken as input, a complex with the highest weighted vertex was seeded, and moved outward from the seed vertex recursively. It owned vertices in the complex whose weight was above a given threshold, a given percentage away from the weight of the seed vertex. Complexes with the core less than 2 (graph of minimum degree 2) are filtered, ‘fluff’ option and ‘haircut’ option may be run as options. ‘Fluff’ option was used to increase the size of the complex according to a given ‘fluff’ parameter between 0.0 and 1.0. ‘Haircut’ option could remove the vertices which were connected to the core complex singly, and the complexes obtained were 2-cored in all. Both the options were performed, fluff run first, then haircut. In our experiment, we set degree cutoff=2, k-core=5, max. depth=100 as the parameters in MCODE for the detection of clusters in co-expression network. In addition, clusters with nodes fewer than 5 were discarded. Besides, the PPI networks were also visualized by Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011).

We identified the global PPI network and molecular complex in the global PPI network using the DEGs of all BC patients and normal subjects. Moreover, the PPI sub-networks of different stages or grades using DEGs between corresponding BC patients and normal subjects were also identified.

To evaluate DEGs in a biological network, three centrality parameters of the networks were computed.

The degree of a node (gene or protein) is the average number of edges (interactions) incident to this node. Degree quantifies the local topology of each gene, by summing up the number of its adjacent genes (Haythornthwaite, 1996). It gives a simple count of the number of interactions of a given node. The genes at the top of degree distribution (≥90% quantile) in the significantly perturbed sub-networks (including global network or sub-networks) were defined as hub genes.

Stress centrality is considered as the number of nodes in the shortest path between two other nodes, the stress is a node centrality index (Fekete et al., 2005). Stress is calculated by measuring the number of shortest paths passing through a node. The “stress” (C
                        str(v)) of a node v is calculated as follow:

                        str(v) of a node v, all shortest paths in a graph G are calculated and then the number of shortest paths passing through v is counted. A “stressed” node is a node traversed by a high number of shortest paths.

Betweenness centrality is another topological metric in graphs for determining how the neighbors of a node are interconnected (Freeman, 1982). It is considered as the ratio of the node in the shortest path between two other nodes. The betweenness centrality of a node v is given by the expression:

To investigate the biological functions of global DEGs and DEGs in different stages and grades, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed by Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (Huang et al., 2008). DAVID bioinformatics resources could systematically extract biological meaning from a large number of genes or proteins. GO terms with P-value<0.01 and KEGG pathways with P-value<0.05 were chosen based on EASE test applied in DAVID. EASE analysis of the regulated genes indicated molecular functions and biological processes unique to each category (Ford et al., 2006). The EASE score was used to detected the significant categories. In both of the functional and pathway enrichment analysis, the threshold of minimum number of genes for the corresponding term >2 were considered significant for a category.

@&#RESULTS@&#

After normalization and preprocessing of the expression profile dataset, a total of 332 global DEGs were identified between 52 BC samples and 10 normal samples, based on the research criterion (P
                        <0.05). Global DEGs identified from the microarray datasets are showed in Table 1
                        . COL4A2 (P
                        =4.29E-33), IGFBP7 (P
                        =1.13E-31), SPARC (P
                        =1.77E-28), ACTA2 (P
                        =1.90E-27) and COL4A1 (P
                        =6.26E-19) were top five significant genes (minimum P-value) of BC.

In addition, we explored the subsets of global DEGs by identifying whether they were differentially expressed in the BC patients from different tumor stages (Ta–T4). Within the 332 global DEGs, we identified 110 DEGs in Ta stage (9 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples), 171 DEGs in T1 (10 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples), 209 DEGs in T2 (12 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples), 293 DEGs in T3 (13 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples) and 280 DEGs in T4 (8 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples). When BC patients were divided by malignancy grade of tumor, we obtained 92 DEGs in G1 (15 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples), 218 DEGs in G2 (18 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples) and 299 DEGs in G3 (19 BC samples vs. 10 normal samples). The amount of DEGs increased with tumor grades and stages deepen. The DEGs of different stages (Ta–T4) and grades (G1–G3) are shown in Supplement material S1.

Co-expression network of global DEGs was constructed by differential co-expression genes and links, as shown in Fig. 1
                        . The global network revealed 6 TFs (TCF3, REL, FOS, GATA2, STAT6 and MECOM), which are shown in Table 2
                        .


                        Fig. 2
                         is the co-expression networks based on DEGs of different stages (T1–T4), and we could find that with increase of muscle infiltrating extent (stage), the amounts of differentially co-expressed links increased obviously. Meanwhile, Fig. 3
                         is the co-expression networks of DEGs in different grades (G1–G3). Increase of differentially co-expressed links were observed clearly with the deepened tumor grade. Hub genes which are at the top of degree distribution (≥90% quantile) of co-expression networks in different stages and grades are listed in Table 3
                         separately. ACTA2 was the common hub gene of T1–T4 stages, and FABP4 was the common hub gene during G1–G3 grades. The relationship between TFs and stages or grades is also listed in Table 2.

Gene sets could approximately reflect biological clusters. To obtain a PPI network, the relationship of the proteins encoded by global DEGs was matched, according to the PPI database (Fig. 4
                        ). There were 324 nodes and 1701 edges in the global PPI network. CKS2, TRIP13 and FOXM1 were the top three genes with high degree. We used MCODE algorithm to analyze the subset of PPI network, five clusters were identified in our PPI network, as shown in Fig. 5
                        .

PPI networks based on DEGs in different grades are shown in Fig. 6
                        . PPI networks based on DEGs in different grades are shown in Fig. 7
                        . Hub genes of the PPI networks in different stages and grades are shown in Table 4
                        . UBE2C and FN1 were the common hub genes in different stages. FN1, COL3A1, VIM and COL1A2 were the common hub genes in different grades.

By assessing centrality of degree, stress centrality and betweenness centrality, centralities of 332 global DEGs were obtained. For degree centrality, top 10% genes (≥90% quantile, hub genes) were UBE2C, CKS2 and TOP2A. For stress centrality, top 10% genes were CDH1, FOS and FN1. For betweenness centrality, top 10% genes were CDH1, FOS and VIM. Top 10% gene sets in various centralities analyses were not consistent.

For GO enrichment analysis, the results showed that the global DEGs were significantly enriched in 115 GO biological processes (BP) terms, 39 cellular components (CC) terms and 31 molecular function (MF) terms. The most significant term of BP was response to chemical stimulus with a P-value of 8.41E-10. The most significant term of MF was protein binding with a P-value of 2.81E-9, while the most significant term of CC was extracellular region part (P
                        =1.19E-11). The most significant pathways of GO (top 10) are shown in Table 5
                        . All the enriched functional terms including terms of different grades (G1–G3) and different stages (Ta–T4) are showed in the Supplementary material S2.

For KEGG pathways enrichment analysis, our results showed that the global DEGs were significantly enriched in 7 terms (Table 6
                        ). The most significant term was ECM-receptor interaction (P
                        =7.17E-8). All the enriched KEGG pathways including pathways enrichments of different grades (G1–G3) and different stages (Ta–T4) are showed in the Supplementary material S3.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Diagnostic or prognostic markers are usually obtained by identification of the most significant DEGs in the high-throughput case–control studies of a disease. In this paper, 332 global DEGs had been detected between normal controls and BC patients. Among these genes, several genes had been identified as BC associated genes, such as DEK, NRP2, UBE2C and CKS2. Sanchez-Carbayo et al. compared the expression profiles of early-stage and advanced BC samples and identified DEK and NRP2 associated with BC progression (Sanchez-Carbayo et al., 2003). UBE2C participated in proliferation of bladder cancer cells and associated with progression to muscle-invasive BC (Fristrup et al., 2013; Morikawa et al., 2013). Chen et al. revealed that CKS2 was related to BC progression, and was a potential biomarker for predicting superficial BC progression (Chen et al., 2011). Our results were consistent with these previous studies, and further it confirmed the validity of our study.

A study of Ein-Dor et al. showed that the most significant DEGs obtained from different studies for a particular cancer are typically inconsistent (Ein-Dor et al., 2005). To overcome this problem, one could evaluate DEGs for disease-association using a network strategy (Zhang et al., 2013). In E-TABM-147, Lindgren et al. (2010) refined the classification of urothelial carcinoma by combining information on gene expression, genomic, and gene mutation levels by carrying out gene expression analysis, whole genome array-CGH analysis and mutation analysis. While in present paper, co-expression networks and PPI networks were utilized to score DEGs and explore hub genes from global DEGs and DEGs in different stages and grades. The results showed that ACTA2 and FABP4 was the common hub gene of co-expression networks in different stages and grades. Hub genes of global PPI networks were also obtained, such as UBE2C, CKS2, FN1 and TOP2A. ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion were the significant enriched pathways not only in global DEGs, but also in DEGs of different stages and grades.


                     UBE2C and TOP2A were hub genes of the global PPI network. UBE2C, which participated in proliferation of bladder cancer cells, was associated with progression to muscle-invasive BC and a novel independent prognostic biomarker of BC (Fristrup et al., 2013; Morikawa et al., 2013). Moreover, studies suggested that bladder urothelial carcinoma patients with UBE2C positivity were independently associated with unfavorable prognosis after surgery (Morikawa et al., 2013). Expression of TOP2A increased at the end of the S to G2/M phase and declined at mitosis ends in bladder urothelial carcinoma (Koren et al., 2003). It has been suggested that a high expression level of TOP2A, which was a predictive biomarker for prognostic of bladder carcinoma, indicated a greater probability of unfavorable survival and invasion, as well as a recurrence of BC (Koren et al., 2003; Raspollini et al., 2013).

Nowadays, histological grade and stage are considered to be basic parameters that determine the prognosis of BC. However, grades of BC have a significant role in the biological behavior and tendency for recurrence, tumor with a high histological grade are predisposed to have a higher stage when compared to tumors with a low grade (Yıldırım et al., 2014). BC comprises of highly heterogeneous tumors, approximately 70% of tumors are superficial (stage Ta, T1), whereas the remaining are muscle infiltrating (T2–T4) at the time of initial presentation (Blaveri et al., 2005).

We discovered that CKS2 was the hub gene in co-expression and PPI networks of BC in different stages. The previous studies showed for superficial (stage Ta, T1) BC patients, CKS2 was related to BC progression, and was a potential biomarker for predicting superficial BC progression to muscle-invasive cancer (Chen et al., 2011). Moreover, it played a clinical role in discriminating between BC and controls, and thus might participate in the early stages of BC (Mezzasoma et al., 2010). Highly over-expressed in invasive (stage T2–T4) than in superficial BC, CKS2 was correlated with the progression of human BC (Kawakami et al., 2006). Based on the reports above, it was obvious that CKS2 was a potential biomarker for diagnosing and staging for human BC.


                     ACTA2 and FABP4 was the common hub gene in co-expression network of T1–T4 stages and G1–G3 grades, respectively. ACTA2 (alpha-smooth muscle actin) played a role in cell motility, structure and integrity and was a major constituent of the contractile apparatus (Guo et al., 2007). Lee et al. investigated the prognostic and functional significance of ACTA2 expression in cancer cells and indicated ACTA2 could be a promising prognostic biomarker (Lee et al., 2013). FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) gene also showed elevated expression in the non-carcinoma in situ (CIS) group compared with the group with adjacent CIS. Fatty acid binding protein has been shown to be down-regulated in invasive bladder tumors (Celis et al., 1996; Dyrskjøt et al., 2004).

Consequent functional analysis of GO revealed that cell adhesion was the most significant BP term based on DEGs of different stages and grades. Adhesion of bladder smooth muscle cells was enhanced as polymer surface feature dimensions were reduced into the nanometer range, the polymer nanometer surface roughness was the primary design parameter that increased the bladder smooth muscle cell adhesion (Thapa et al., 2003).

ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion was the significant enriched pathways not only in global DEGs, but also in DEGs of different stages and grades according to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Aitken suggested that structural ECM proteins, in concert with adhesive proteins, provide crucial structural support to the bladder. Both structural and nonstructural components of the bladder have major effects on smooth muscle function, through effects on matrix rigidity and signaling through ECM receptors (Aitken and Bägli, 2009).

In conclusion, we discovered the hub genes of complex networks, such as UBE2C, ACTA2, FABP4, CKS2, FN1 and TOP2A, which played important roles in development of BC. ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion were the significant pathways of global DEGs and DEGs in different stages and grades. Our results provide some potential underlying biomarkers of BC. However, further validation is required and deep studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of BC and treat it more effectively.
