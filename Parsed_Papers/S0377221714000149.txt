                  The paper deals with the two most important mathematical models for sequencing products on a mixed-model assembly line in order to minimize work overload the mixed-model sequencing (MMS) model and the car sequencing (CS) model. Although both models follow the same underlying objective, only MMS directly addresses the work overload in its objective function. CS instead applies a surrogate objective using so-called sequencing rules which restrict labor-intensive options accompanied with the products in the sequence. The CS model minimizes the number of violations of the respective sequencing rules, which is widely assumed to lead to minimum work overload. This paper experimentally compares CS with MMS in order to quantify the gap in the solution quality between both models. The paper studies several variants of CS with different sequencing rule generation approaches and different objective functions from the literature as well as a newly introduced weighting factor. The performance of the different models is evaluated on a variety of random test instances. Although the objectives of CS and MMS are positively linearly correlated, results show that a sequence found by CS leads to at least 15% more work overload than a solution found by MMS. For none of the considered test instances and for none of the three different objective functions, CS is able to produce competitive results in terms of solution quality (work overload) compared to MMS. The results suggest that decision makers using CS should investigate whether MMS would lead to better sequencing orders for their specific instances.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

On a mixed-model assembly line, different car models are produced in facultative sequence with a lot size of one. The models vary in the number of options and therefore require different processing times at the line’s stations. Since a station is balanced in terms of average production time, a sequence with consecutive work-intensive models could lead to a work overload of the line operators if an assembly task cannot be finished within the station limits. Work overload has to be compensated, e.g., by employing additional utility workers or stopping the line.

In order to minimize the amount of work overload, two approaches are present in the literature mixed-model sequencing (MMS) and car sequencing (CS). Although both follow the same underlying objective, their approaches are different. MMS (Tsai, 1995; Wester & Kilbridge, 1964) directly minimizes the amount of work overload by explicitly considering processing times, worker movements, station borders and other operational characteristics of a line. This level of detail results in a high effort for data collection and computation time. CS (Drexl & Kimms, 2001; Parrello, Kabat, & Wos, 1986) uses a more simplified surrogate objective for work overload and applies sequencing rules. A sequencing rule restricts the maximum occurrence of options in any subsequence of defined length. The aim is to find a production sequence with a minimum number of rule violations. Since CS is more aggregated than MMS, its data requirements are lower and the evaluation of sequences is faster. Furthermore, sequencing rules seem to be more intuitive to human decision makers.

In the past decade, CS experiences more attention in the literature, mainly due to its practical relevance. For instance in 2005, the automobile manufacturer Renault launched the ROADDEF’2005 contest, where the aim was to optimize real-world CS instances from Renault’s plants (Solnon, Cung, Nguyen, & Artigues, 2008). Puchta and Gottlieb (2002) presented several other real-world CS instances from a German car manufacturer. However, the CS literature almost exclusively deals with different solution approaches, leaving the question open: to what extent does the surrogate objective function (minimizing rule violations) lead to the underlying goal of minimizing work overload. The accuracy of CS in identifying sequences with minimum work overload depends on the type of sequencing rules used and the manner in which rule violations are evaluated by the objective function. In the literature, two rule generation approaches – one by Bolat and Yano (1992b) and another by Golle, Boysen, and Rothlauf (2010), the multiple sequencing rule approach (MSR) – and three commonly used objective functions for CS have been proposed.

In this paper, we examine and compare the solution quality (work overload) of CS and MMS. CS is applied with different combinations of objective functions and different types of sequencing rules as well as with a newly introduced weighting factor. As CS objective functions we use the sliding window (SW) objective function (Fliedner & Boysen, 2008; Gagne, Gravel, & Price, 2006; Gottlieb, Puchta, & Solnon, 2003), an objective function introduced by Fliedner and Boysen (2008), and another introduced by Bolat and Yano (1992a). All three objective functions aim to minimize work overload. First, we perform a correlation analysis in order to investigate the linear relationship between both objectives, the number of sequencing rule violations (CS), and the amount of work overload (MMS). Second, by analyzing optimal solutions and evaluating the performances of both models on various test instances, we determine the gap in the solution quality between CS and MMS. Our results reveal the following insights:
                        
                           •
                           The objectives of CS and MMS are positively linearly related using Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient.

The best sequence found by CS causes on average at least 23% more work overload than a solution found by MMS. If inadequate sequencing rules and/or objective functions for CS are used, this gap can increase to 75%.

The gap in the solution quality can be decreased to 15% by using a new weighting factor for CS.

Overall, our results show that the surrogate objective of CS aggregates too strongly from the underlying objective of minimizing the work overload. Therefore, the CS model is not able to produce competitive results in terms of solution quality compared to MMS for problem instances studied in this work. Therefore, we encourage both researchers and practitioners to focus more on detailed comparisons between MMS and CS taking also other performance measurements than work overload into account. Furthermore, we suggest practitioners to publish real-world MMS scenarios which would allow researchers to validate the findings of this work.

Section 2 states the MMS approach and some assumptions made for this paper. The CS model is introduced in Section 3 together with rule generation approaches, objective functions and the additional weighting factor. Section 4 presents the computational study and results, followed by a critical discussion of the advantages of CS in Section 5. The paper ends with concluding remarks.

MMS was introduced by Wester and Kilbridge (1964); it aims to find a sequence of different models 
                        
                           m
                           ∈
                           M
                        
                      with minimum total work overload based on a detailed schedule. Work overload occurs whenever an operator is unable to finish assembly operations on a workpiece within the station’s boundaries. MMS explicitly takes several operational characteristics of the line into account, such as processing times, station borders, operator movements and others (for an overview see Boysen, Fliedner, & Scholl, 2009). The range of different characteristics and resulting MMS models makes it impossible to study all possible MMS settings. Therefore, we apply the basic MMS problem as our benchmark model, which is based upon the following assumptions (see Boysen et al., 2009; Scholl, 1999, p. 96):
                        
                           •
                           Without loss of generality, assembly lines are assumed to flow from left to right.

All stations are closed, i.e., operators are not allowed to work beyond the station borders.

All stations are consecutively arranged along the line and models move with constant speed through the stations.

The processing of a model starts early, i.e., as soon as operator and model meet within the station boundaries.

An operator has zero return times, i.e., when he has finished one model he moves with infinite speed to the next model. This assumption is adequate, since the speed of the conveyor is usually much slower than the operators walking speed. If not, the cycle time c can be reduced to include the average return time.

A fixed rate launching is applied, i.e., consecutive models are placed on the conveyor at the same interval equal to the cycle time c.

Work overload is required to be nonnegative (7). The line is assumed to be in an initial condition before processing the entire sequence (8), thus, an operator awaits the first model at the left-hand station border. Note that for comparative reasons we do not require this initial condition to be reached again after processing the entire sequence, since this constraint cannot be modeled with CS.

Processing times are represented by horizontal lines, return times by diagonal dashed lines. The operator starts processing at the left-hand station border at position 0. The example sequence contains a copy of model 0 at the first slot. After assembling this model, the operator returns back to position 0 and processes model 1 at slot 2. Since model 1 requires a processing time of

Instead he meets the subsequent model, which already crossed the left-hand station border, at position 5. A copy of model 1 needs to be processed once again which in turn leads to a work overload of 3. It is assumed that the work overload is immediately compensated, therefore, the operator meets the 4th model at position 7 in the station and so on. Note that the example sequence leads to a total work overload of 8, since the operator is unable to finish the respective models at slots 3 (work overload

Compared to MMS, CS is a more aggregated approach for finding a production sequence with minimum work overload. It assumes that a car contains different options and different models can be distinguished by their (often binary) options (such as a car having air conditioning, or not). CS employs

                      for the option “air conditioning” requires that in any subsequence of three consecutive models at most two models contain this option, otherwise a violation occurs. The objective of CS is to minimize the number of sequencing rule violations over all scheduled options.

The existing CS literature implicitly assumes that the surrogate objective of minimizing the number of rule violations is associated with the minimization of work overload. However, to our best knowledge, this assumption has never been evaluated. In any case, suitable sequencing rules and an appropriate objective function are required in order to accomplish the underlying objective of minimizing work overload. In this paper, we identify and consider two sequencing rule generation approaches and three recently applied objective functions from the literature.


                           Bolat and Yano (1992b) derive sequencing rules for CS based on operational characteristics of the assembly line. For this purpose, they assume that exactly one option 
                              
                                 o

                            is processed at each station 
                              
                                 k
                                 ∈

                           , therefore we use the notations o and O synonymously for k and K, respectively. Since CS applies binary options, each option has merely two processing times. A model requiring option o has processing time

The BYSR approach has some limitations (Golle et al., 2010). Denoting a sequence to be feasible if no work overload occurs, the BYSR approach does not correctly identify all feasible sequences. Indeed, usually a number of feasible sequences violate at least one sequencing rule. Therefore, since the BYSR approach excludes feasible solutions from consideration, it can be problematic for optimization approaches that search for feasible sequences. To overcome the problems of BYSR, Golle et al. (2010) introduce the Multiple Sequencing Rules (MSR) approach. This approach ensures that no feasible solution violates a sequencing rule and any infeasible solution violates at least one sequencing rule.

MSR builds on the same assumptions as the BYSR approach. Hence, exactly one option

A number of objective functions for CS have been proposed in the literature (for an overview see Boysen et al. (2009)). In this paper, we consider the three most widely used objective functions: the sliding window (SW) objective function (Fliedner & Boysen, 2008; Gagne et al., 2006; Gottlieb et al., 2003), an objective function introduced by Fliedner and Boysen (2008), and another introduced by Bolat and Yano (1992a). In addition, we modify these objective functions to incorporate more than one sequencing rule per option and introduce additional weights that allow us to differentiate between the violations of different options and their impact on the resulting work overload.

CS evaluates a sequence by sliding through the sequence and summing up the violations of each relevant subsequence, also called window. A violation occurs if a window of size

                         occurrences of the option o. The three objective functions differ in the windows considered as well as in the amount of violations a single window can provoke. The SW objective function counts all windows of size

                        , the SW objective function results in the following model (Fliedner & Boysen, 2008; Gagne et al., 2006; Gottlieb et al., 2003):

                         considers our aforementioned example sequence from Fig. 1 together with the 1:4 sequencing rule obtained by the BYSR approach. The first window from slot 1 to 4 is violated due to three occurrences of option o. So is the second window from slot 2 to 5. Overall, the SW objective function amounts to three violations.


                        Fliedner and Boysen (2008) introduce a different objective function (FB), which is similar to a function proposed by Gagne et al. (2006). The FB approach eliminates some defects of the SW approach which considers less violations either at the beginning or at the end of a sequence since fewer windows are violated. Thus, the FB objective function uses windows of size

                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                           
                         at the end of the sequence. Furthermore, it only considers a violated window if the first model in the window contains the respective option. Thereby, the FB objective function counts the option occurrences that actually lead to a violation of a subsequence. The associated model is as follows (Fliedner & Boysen, 2008):

Again, (18) minimizes the total number of violations over all options. (19) evaluates all violated subsequences with 1 if the first model in the subsequence has option o, and 0 otherwise. We slightly modified the formula of Fliedner and Boysen (2008), since the first sum of (19) only needs to run until

                         evaluates the example sequence using the FB objective function. Although the first window contains excessive option occurrences, it induces no violation since the first model in the window does not require the option. The second window from slot 2 to 5 is counted with one violation since the first model in the window has the respective option. Note that the evaluation runs up to slot

                        , and thus also considers subsequences of size less than 4 at the end of the sequence. Overall, the FB objective function counts two violations.

In order to capture the extent to which a window is violated, Bolat and Yano (1992a) propose an objective function (BY) where each excessive option occurrence in a window leads to one additional violation. Therefore, a window can induce at most

                         are included. All models beyond the sequence are assumed not to have option o. Fig. 4
                         evaluates the example sequence with the BY objective function. The evaluation starts at slot 
                           
                              -

                         with the first window not being violated. The second window is violated since it has one excessive occurrence of option o which leads to one violation. The third window even has two excessive option occurrences and is evaluated with two violations. The BY objective function also considers two models after the actual sequence at slots 12 and 13, both of which do not require the respective option but are considered for the last two windows starting at slot 9 and 10, respectively. The BY objective function calculates six violations.
                           Example
                           We use the example from Section 2 with the sequencing rule 
                                 
                                    1
                                    :
                                    4
                                 
                               according to the BYSR approach. Table 3
                               shows two example sequences together with the number of violations calculated by the three different objective functions. The different objective functions lead to different evaluations. While the SW objective function evaluates sequence 2 better than sequence 1, the BY objective function evaluates sequence 1 better than sequence 2. The FB objective function does not differentiate between the two sequences. In this example, the BY objective function is more appropriate since the work overload 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          obj
                                       
                                       
                                          wo
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               for sequence 1 is lower than for sequence 2.

To apply the MSR approach with the three objective functions, we have to adjust (17), (19) and (21) such that

We consider our example with four sequencing rules 1:3, 2:6, 3:10 and 4:13 generated by the MSR approach. Table 4
                               shows the same two example sequences as used in Table 3 as well as the violations according to the three objective functions. Using the MSR approach, all three objective functions correctly evaluate sequence 2 better than sequence 1.

The use of objective functions that treat each rule violation as equal leads to two problems. First, we are unable to determine to which extent the amount of imminent work overload caused by excessive occurrences of option o depends on the position of the excessive options in a window. Succeeding option occurrences, which lead to a violation, usually result in a higher work overload than non-succeeding options (for an example see Table 4, where sequence 2 leads to a higher work overload than sequence 1). Second, the amount of work overload caused by the violation of a sequencing rule can considerably vary between different options 
                           
                              o
                              ∈
                              O
                           
                         since different stations that assemble different options often have different operational characteristics such as station length. The three objective functions only partially address these issues. The SW and BY objective function favor non-succeeding violations, since such violations lead to less window violations (except for the SW function, when violations occur at the beginning or end of the sequence; see Fig. 3 for an example). Furthermore, both of these functions also implicitly choose between options. Each option occurrence, for instance, affects at most

                                    o
                                 
                              
                           
                         windows, which thus can lead to at most

                         violations. Therefore, violations of an option o with lower

                         are favored and implicitly assumed to cause less work overload. However, there is no justification for this assumption. The FB objective function does not differentiate between violations at all. Each option occurrence that causes a violation is always assessed with one violation in the objective function.

To distinguish between option violations, we propose to use explicit weights

                         for each option

                         should be associated with the induced work overload, if a violation occurs. We suggest using the maximum work overload that can be caused by one violation of option o. The maximum work overload occurs if an operator reaches the right-hand station border while assembling a model and the next model in the line also contains option o. In this case, the operator reaches the next model at time

We examine to what extent the different CS variants are able to achieve the underlying goal of minimizing work overload. First, we describe the problem instances applied throughout this section. We generate random MMS instances according to Scholl (1999). Then, we derive CS instances from the MMS instances using the sequencing rule generation approaches discussed in Section 3.1. Following this, we conduct a correlation analysis to examine the linear relationship between the amount of work overload (objective of MMS approaches) and the number of sequencing rule violations (objective of CS approaches). Finally, we compare the solution quality and performance of the different CS and MMS variants.

In order to evaluate the different CS approaches and to compare their performances to MMS, we define three sets of random MMS instances from which the respective CS instances are derived. Set 1 includes small instances, Set 2 larger ones, and Set 3 instances of real-world size. We vary the sequence length T, the number of stations K, and the number of models M according to the parameters in Table 5
                        . A full-factorial design of these parameters is performed leading to

The test instances are created following the suggestions of Scholl (1999), who presented a general instance generator for MMS, which is also used in other recent publications (e.g., see Boysen, Kiel, & Scholl, 2011; Cano-Belmn, Ros-Mercado, & Bautista, 2010).

In our experiments, we only consider MMS instances where the optimal solution leads to work overload (for results on feasible instances of CS and MMS, we refer to Golle et al. (2010)). Thus, we optimally solved all instances of Set 1 using CPLEX 12.2 and verified that all optimal solutions lead to overload. For the larger instances in the Sets 2 and 3, we could not verify if optimal solutions lead to overload since, due to their size, we were unable to calculate them. For all MMS instances, the corresponding CS instances are derived using either the BYSR or MSR rule generation approach (see Section 3.1). In addition, for MSR we vary the number of sequencing rules

                         we apply all generated rules per option. We combine each derived CS instance with the three aforementioned objective functions (Section 3.2) once with and once without the weighting function (Section 3.3). Hence, this leads to

We use the first two sets of problem instances and generate 10,000 random sequences per instance. For each sequence, we compute the amount of work overload as sample X and evaluate the number of sequencing rule violations according to CS variant v as sample

For all CS variants, the number of rule violations is positively correlated with the amount of work overload. However, there are differences in the degree of correlation. Using BYSR leads to a low correlation since the generated rules are too restrictive. MSR1 leads to the highest correlation over all objective functions. When options are restricted by more rules, violations of these options are overvalued, and thus the correlation decreases. Therefore, MSR2 is slightly inferior to MSR1, and there is an even larger gap between MSR
                           n
                         and MSR1.

For approaches that generate only one rule per option (BYSR and MSR1), the BY objective function is slightly superior to the SW and FB objective function. Depending on the size of the sequence window and to what extent the window is violated, the BY objective function is able to better differentiate between violation occurrences and, thus, implicitly also between work overload scenarios. However, the more rules are applied, the more the BY objective function amplifies the effect of overvaluation of violations. When increasing the number of rules per option (

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    MSR
                                 
                                 
                                    n
                                 
                              
                           
                        ), the FB function outperforms the other objective functions, since the aforementioned effect of overrating option violations applies less to it.

Using the additional weighting factor

                                    o
                                 
                              
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                                 
                                    +
                                 
                              
                              -
                              c
                           
                         increases the correlation for nearly all CS variants, especially for those combined with BYSR or MSR1. It only has a minor negative effect for the objective functions SW and BY when they are combined with MSR2 and MSR
                           n
                        . It seems that for these CS variants the weighting factor slightly increases the effect of overrating option violations. The resulting correlation differences between the independent variables (rule generation approach, objective function and weighting factor) have been found to be statistically significant on a 0.05 level using a multi-factorial analysis of variance.

Now, we analyze the solution quality of the different CS variants and compare it to MMS. The quality of an approach is determined by the amount of overload caused by an optimal solution and the number of optimal solutions. We start with Set 1 and compare optimal solutions of MMS and CS. For each instance, we determine all optimal sequences of MMS and each CS variant using an iterative beam search approach (Golle, Rothlauf, & Boysen, 2011). For MMS, Table 6
                         lists the average amount of work overload

In general, the solution quality of CS is worse compared to MMS. Since CS assigns the same objective value to solutions that actually induce a different amount of work overload, it has more optimal solutions than MMS. Among these solutions are sequences which not even come close to the optimum as can be observed in the resulting average amount of work overload

                        , which is always higher than that of MMS. Thus, an optimal solution found by one of the CS variants (with

                        ) leads to at least 33% (MSR2 and BY) more work overload than the optimal MMS solution. Furthermore, there are differences regarding the CS variants. As previously stated, the sequencing rules generated by the BYSR approach are very restrictive. Therefore, it finds less solutions than the MSR approaches, and also excludes good sequences resulting in a higher

                        . In contrast, MSR1 assigns the same objective value to more solutions, and thus, obtains more optimal solutions than BYSR, but these solutions contain less work overload, which leads to a better average solution quality. MSR2 and MSR
                           n
                         are able to further exclude non-optimal solutions and, thus, reduce the number of solutions as well as increase the solution quality. For the instances in Set 1, MSR
                           n
                         works well since the number of generated rules depends on the sequence length T, which is relatively low. Thus, MSR
                           n
                         generates not many more rules than MSR2 and the aforementioned effects of overrating violations do not apply.

Comparing objective functions, the BY objective function performs best, since an optimal solution found by this function leads on average to the lowest amount of work overload. By considering the weighting factor

                              =

                              -
                              c
                           
                         the performance of CS can be increased. The weighting factor leads to a further exclusion of solutions with a high amount of work overload and therefore reduces the overall number of CS optimal solutions as well as the average work overload induced by one of these solutions.

Next, we compare the performance of the different CS variants with MMS on problem Set 2. Due to their size in terms of sequence length T, number of stations K, and number of models M, these instances cannot be solved to optimality. To obtain high-quality/optimal solutions, we use a metaheuristic proposed by Puchta and Gottlieb (2002), which was originally introduced for CS and comprises six different move operators (insert, swap, transposition, SwapS, Lin2Opt, and Random). Originally, Puchta and Gottlieb (2002) used a quadratic penalty function with five different types of constraints aiming at minimizing work overload. We left the functionality of the metaheuristic untouched but replaced the original quadratic objective function by the objective function of MMS and the different CS variants as discussed in Section 3.2.

For each instance in Set 2, we randomly create 20 initial sequences. We apply the metaheuristic on each of these initial sequences using either the MMS model or one of the 24 different CS variants. Since Set 2 contains 180 instances, we conduct 
                           
                              180

                         runs overall. Beginning with the initial sequence, a move is randomly chosen from one of the six operators with equal probability. The move is applied to the current sequence and the resulting sequence becomes the new current sequence if its objective value is equal to or lower than that of the current solution. After a given maximum number of moves the search stops and returns the current sequence as the best (found) solution.

In order to avoid strong disruptions of solutions and thus intensify the search process, Puchta and Gottlieb (2002) restrict the size of the subsequence affected by a move operator to at most 
                           
                              T

                        . We stop each single search after 100,000 moves and assess the best sequence found using the MMS objective function. Thus, the resulting amount of work overload for MMS as well as the different CS variants can be compared. We again determine the average amount of work overload

                         show the results of MMS and CS, respectively. We want to note that the performance of the metaheuristic was tested in preceding experiments on problem Set 1, where it found an optimal solution for MMS as well as for each of the 24 CS variants in all of the

The results in Tables 8 and 9 confirm our previous findings. The gap in the solution quality between CS and MMS is at least 22% (MSR1, BY,

                        ). Again, the MSR approach is better than the BYSR approach. For the instances in Set 2, MSR1 leads to the best solutions among the CS approaches and requires the shortest time. MSR2 and MSR
                           n
                         also result in a better solution quality compared to BYSR. MSR1 and BYSR are a little faster than MMS, which needs on average 3.3seconds (Table 8). This stems from the faster evaluation of an altered sequence by CS, since only parts of the sequence need to be reassessed. However, as both MSR2 and MSR
                           n
                         apply more than one sequencing rule this advantage disappears. While MSR2 is slightly faster than MMS, MSR
                           n
                         is much slower and returns worse solutions in comparison to MSR1 and MSR2. The BY objective function performs better than the other objective functions, although it requires a little more time due to the higher effort for computing its objective values. Using the weighting factor increases solution quality for all CS variants (significant at 0.05) without changing the solution time considerably. Due to the results obtained on problem Set 2, we exclude MSR
                           n
                         in further experiments, since its solution quality and solution time is worse compared to the other MSR approaches.

Next, we study the performance of MMS and CS on problem Set 3, which consists of instances of real-world size. Again, 20 initial sequences for each instance are created and optimized with the aforementioned metaheuristic, leading to

                         runs overall. We apply the metaheuristic with the same setting as for problem Set 2. Tables 10 and 11
                        
                         show results for MMS and CS.

The results are similar to those for problem Set 2. The MSR1 rule generation approach as well as the BY objective function show a superior solution quality among the CS approaches. The use of an additional weighting factor

                         further improves the solution quality. Although the absolute gap in work overload between MMS and CS increases, the relative gap between the overload of MMS and CS decreases in comparison to problem Set 2, e.g., from 22% down to 15% (MSR1, BY,

This is due to the higher sequence length T of problem Set 3. After each move, the CS variants only have to reassess windows where a change occurred, which are at most 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    o
                                 
                              
                           
                         for each option and change. In contrast, MMS has to reassess the entire sequence beginning at the position of the first change. Thus, with increasing sequence length T, the CS variants become faster in comparison to MMS.

Finally, we study how the solution quality of MMS and CS depends on the number of moves and the solution time for ten representative instances of Set 2 with 
                           
                              T

                              =

                        , and 
                           
                              M
                              =

                        . As before, we create 20 initial solutions for each instance and optimize each of them using the metaheuristic. This leads to 200 runs for MMS and each CS variant. We examine the effect of different stopping criteria of the metaheuristic and vary the number of moves and the amount of time after which the metaheuristic is stopped between 1 and 100,000 moves and 0.01 and 60seconds, respectively. Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         show the respective results. For increased clarity, we show the results for each of the three CS objective functions in a separate figure. We only consider CS variants with

                                    o
                                 
                                 
                                    +
                                 
                              
                              -

                        , since the weighting factor leads to superior results.


                        Fig. 7a–c show that the differences in the solution quality between MMS and each of the CS variants increases with the number of moves. The order of the different approaches with respect to solution quality remains unchanged. Independently of when the search process is stopped, MMS always produces sequences that contain on average less work overload than sequences found by CS variants. Also, the results of MSR1 are always better than those of the other rule generation approaches regardless which objective function is applied. Fig. 8a–c plot the solution quality against the running time. At the beginning of the search, MSR1 results in better solutions than MMS, since it can evaluate more sequences in the same amount of time. However, this advantage fades away after 0.05seconds, when the MMS approach finds superior solutions. Then, the solution gap between MMS and MSR1 continuously increases over time. MSR
                           n
                         results in low solution quality at the beginning of the search due to the large number of sequencing rules considered. However, for the SW (Fig. 8a) and FB (Fig. 8b) objective function it is able to compensate this disadvantage later in the search, since it produces better results than BYSR.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It is not surprising that CS leads to a lower solution quality compared to MMS since it is a much more aggregated model. However, for the instances considered in this paper, the minimum resulting gap in the amount of work overload between CS and MMS is about 15% (CS with MSR1 rule generation, BY objective function, and weighting factor

                     ). This gap increases if CS is applied with other sequencing rules and/or objective functions. For instance, sequencing rules created by the BYSR approach combined with the SW objective function and no weighting factor lead to a solution gap of about 75%. The question arises which advantages of CS justify such a large gap in the solution quality?

The literature puts forward that CS is supposed to avoid the significant effort of data collection accompanied with MMS (Boysen et al., 2009). However, this is only the case when sequencing rules for CS are created by rules of thumb or intuitively as in the following example by Drexl and Kimms (2001): “Assume that 60% of the cars manufactured on the line need the option ‘sun roof’. Moreover, assume that five cars (copies) pass the station where the sun roofs are installed during the time for the installation of a single copy. Then, three operators (installation teams) are necessary for the installation of sun roofs. Hence, the capacity constraint of the final assembly line for the option sun roof is three out of five in a sequence, or 3:5 for short.” The use of such intuitive sequencing rules is very likely to inject more inaccuracy into CS and thus increase the gap in the solution quality between CS and MMS. If sequencing rules are derived analytically and operational characteristics of the line are considered, as in the BYSR and MSR rule generation approaches, the same amount of data as that for MMS has to be collected in advance. As another advantage Drexl, Kimms, and Matthieen (2006) mention that CS does not require an explicit definition of open and closed stations. In fact, the definition of 
                        
                           H
                           :
                           N
                        
                      sequencing rules implicitly assumes that all stations on the line are closed since no interaction between stations can be represented with this kind of sequencing rules. The literature sometimes claims that sequencing rules simultaneously also balance the allocation of the required material (Drexl & Jordan, 1995; Drexl et al., 2006), which is actually the goal of the just-in-time related level-scheduling model (Miltenburg, 1989). However, Boysen (2005, p. 233) experimentally revealed that CS does not implicitly optimize the objective of level-scheduling.

To our best knowledge, only two advantages of CS compared to MMS with regard to minimizing work overload remain. First, sequencing rules are more intuitive to human decision makers. Indeed, evaluating a sequence by hand counting rule violations seems easier than computing the entire schedule. However, practical instances with up to 1.000 models to be sequenced are far too complex to be verified by human decision makers. Second, CS evaluates sequences faster compared to MMS, since it considers only combinatorial aspects of the problem and not the detailed time schedule and operator movements (Bolat & Yano, 1992a; Drexl et al., 2006). We also observed this in our experiments, since CS variants that use only one sequencing rule per option can evaluate sequences faster than MMS by a factor of about 1.5–2. However, Fig. 8 reveals that a faster evaluation does not result in a superior solution quality of CS compared to MMS, if both approaches use the same amount of time (>0.05seconds) to solve an instance. Since the solution time in practical applications and in the literature on CS and MMS is often fixed to 600seconds (Fliedner & Boysen, 2008; Puchta & Gottlieb, 2002; Solnon et al., 2008), the solution quality of MMS is supposed to be superior in these scenarios as well.

We must keep in mind that CS actually benefits from the assumptions made for the test instances in this paper, namely in terms of using only closed stations and allowing only two processing times per station. In practical applications, stations are often open, hence, the operator is allowed to work beyond the station borders to a certain extent. Furthermore, most real-world options have more than two characteristics and a station often assembles more than one option at a time, which leads to more than just two processing times per station. Both aspects are not addressed by CS, whereas they can quite easily be adopted by MMS. Thus, the solution gap between CS and MMS most likely increases when both are applied to practical settings.

We are wondering why many researchers as well as practitioners hold onto CS models using surrogate objectives instead of MMS, which directly minimizes work overload. We want to provide several possible explanations. First, the concept of mixed-model assembly lines with a lot size of one has been adapted very early by European and Japanese car manufacturer. However, twenty or more years ago computer power was relatively low and CS models were the more promising and faster way to solve the sequencing problem as MMS approaches always include some kind of simulation of a production sequence, which is more expensive than looking only at violated car sequences as in CS. Although computer power strongly increased in the last years and meanwhile also large MMS models can be solved with reasonable time effort (see discussion above), car manufacturers sticked with and refined CS models instead of trying new planning paradigms like MMS. However, there are some indicators for at least some parts of industry realizing this coherency. We are aware of a major German car manufacturer, who after decades of sequencing with a multi-objective approach combining CS rules with level scheduling recently changed to an MMS approach. Second, the tendency to stick with CS models has been enforced by the publication of real-world CS test instances (compare the ROADDEF’2005 challenge (Solnon et al., 2008) or Puchta & Gottlieb (2002), who presented a real-world CS scenario from a German car manufacturer). The publication of CS instances inspired research on CS models and made them attractive for the operations research community leading to improvements in solving CS models. Third, car manufacturers are not willing to publish details on their real-world assembly lines, which would be necessary for researchers to apply MMS approaches. Such details would also be interesting for competitors and provide them with relevant information on the efficiency of the assembly process. As car manufacturers do not want to unhide such information, only car manufacturers using CS models publish their instances containing only sequencing rules and no competitor-relevant production data. However, the non-availability of real-world MMS instances hinders the development of MMS approaches and makes studies directly comparing the performance of CS and MMS approaches difficult. Our hope is that the current work will inspire a public discussion on the benefits of MMS and CS and moves the focus from solving CS models to the question of what is the best model for generating production sequences.

Finally, we want to emphasize that minimizing work overload is not the only guideline for selecting a suited sequencing approach in the real-world:
                        
                           •
                           CS rules might be helpful for ensuring technical restrictions. For instance, at a major German truck manufacturer the largest truck assembled on their mixed-model line is simply too long, such that two successive models of this kind would outreach the stations.

Furthermore, a CS rule is also a very simple and easily comprehensible communication standard for coordinating different departments related to the assembly process. For instance, if some special skill is scarce, a CS rule can, on the one hand, be applied to specifically avoid a work overload of the respective workers, but also to hinder the planning department from the release of excessive orders requiring this specific skill into each work shift.

The logistics department is also heavily influenced by the production sequence, because they have to ensure the timely arrival of all parts required during the assembly process. In this context, a CS rule can be applied to relief the pressure on Just-in-Time logistics, if, for instance, a truck delivers

                                          o
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               units of part o in any 
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          N
                                       
                                       
                                          o
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               time units.

In real life, assembly lines are often split into (and later on merge from) multiple parallel line segments. In such a setting, CS rules can be applied for coordinating these line segments, so that a starvation or congestion of (the buffers connecting) successive line segments is avoided.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Our work is the first that compares the solution quality of CS and MMS. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive computational study with random MMS instances of various sizes. Based on these instances, we derive the related CS instances using different sequencing rule generation approaches and also apply various objective functions for CS discussed in the literature. Furthermore, we introduce an additional weighting factor for CS in order to distinguish between the effects of different option violations. A full factorial design of the rule generation approaches, objective functions and weighting factor is performed which leads to 24 different CS variants. The number of rule violations is positively linearly related to the amount of work overload using Pearson’s product moment coefficient. Moreover, the solution quality of MMS and the different CS variants is assessed by computing the resulting amount of work overload when each model is applied on the various test instances. For the problem instances, CS results in solutions that contain at least 23% more work overload than solutions of the related MMS problem. This gap can be decreased to 15% by considering our weighting factor for CS. The difference in the solution quality between CS and MMS increases, if CS is applied with inadequate sequencing rules and/or objective functions. For instance, using sequencing rules created by the BYSR approach in combination with the sliding-window objective function even leads to a solution gap that is higher than 75%.

Our experimental results show that the surrogate objective followed by CS aggregates too much from the underlying goal of minimizing work overload. For the studied problem instances, the solution quality of CS is not competitive compared to MMS. Based on our experimental findings and the discussion of the advantages of CS against MMS, we encourage decision makers to study whether MMS is an alternative to CS for future applications, at least until new developments increase the solution quality of CS. Thus, future research should address the following issues:
                        
                           1.
                           As there are no real-word MMS scenarios publicly available, we use test instances generated by the test MMS instance generator of Scholl (1999). This generator is widely used and expected to produce test instances resembling real-world instances. For further validation and generalization of our findings, we recommend to publish real-world MMS instances and to validate our findings on these scenarios.

New sequencing rule generation approaches and objective functions for CS that better reflect the underlying goal of minimizing the work overload could be developed. However, we have doubts that either of these would considerably improve the solution quality of the CS model.

The simple CS model needs to be extended in order to incorporate more practical characteristics of the line, e.g., to consider open stations and more than merely two processing times per stations. A first approach regarding multiple processing times can be found in Golle et al. (2010). Another idea to consider multiple processing times could be to set up a non-binary CS model, which uses the displacement (processing time minus cycle time) a model induces instead of just the binary options. A sequencing rule for this kind of problem could check if the sum of the displacements in any window of a certain length amounts to zero.


                              Solnon et al. (2008) present an unelaborated idea that uses cross ratio constraints instead of simple

                               rules to allow for an interaction between option/station constraints and thus allow the modeling of open stations. Another idea could be to use multidimensional sequencing rules of the kind

                               occurrences of option 2 are allowed in any 2-dimensional window of length N incorporating both options. Maybe some insights on these issues can be drawn from the literature on system reliability (Chao, Fu, & Koutras, 1995) as well, where sequencing rules of type 
                                 
                                    H

                               are also applied in consecutive ”k-out-of-m-from-n” systems.

We conclude that the choice of a suited sequencing approach is a central decision task influencing many departments of each manufacturer, so that sequencing mixed-model assembly lines will remain a fruitful field of research in the foreseeable future.
