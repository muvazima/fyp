                  Background and objectives
                  The diagnosis of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in infants is currently made primarily by ultrasound. However, two-dimensional ultrasound (2DUS) images capture only an incomplete portion of the acetabular shape, and the alpha and beta angles measured on 2DUS for the Graf classification technique show high inter-scan and inter-observer variability. This variability relates partly to the manual determination of the apex point separating the acetabular roof from the ilium during index measurement. This study proposes a new 2DUS image processing technique for semi-automated tracing of the bony surface followed by automatic calculation of two indices: a contour-based alpha angle (α
                     
                        A
                     ), and a new modality-independent quantitative rounding index (M). The new index M is independent of the apex point, and can be directly extended to 3D surface models.
               
               
                  Methods
                  We tested the proposed indices on a dataset of 114 2DUS scans of infant hips aged between 4 and 183 days scanned using a 12MHz linear transducer. We calculated the manual alpha angle (α
                     
                        M
                     ), coverage, contour-based alpha angle and rounding index for each of the recordings and statistically evaluated these indices based on regression analysis, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA).

                  Conclusions
                  The rounding index provides complimentary information to conventional indices such as alpha angle and coverage. Calculation of the contour-based alpha angle and rounding index is rapid, shows potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of DDH diagnosis from 2DUS, and could be extended to 3D ultrasound in future.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a common congenital musculoskeletal condition affecting up to 3% of the population [1], characterized by a lax or dislocated hip joint, which if not treated early enough leads to premature osteoarthritis. About 1/3 of hip replacement surgeries in patients less than 60 years old are due to DDH [1]. Diagnosis of hip dysplasia is usually based on the shape of the acetabulum (the “socket” of the ball-and-socket hip joint) and the position of the femoral head relative to it. Although DDH can be diagnosed on physical examination via Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers, these are highly subjective and lack sensitivity for mild dysplasia [2–5], hence image aided diagnosis is preferred. Ultrasound imaging is recommended over radiographs since it avoids ionizing radiation and can visualize cartilage, while femoral heads are non-ossified in infancy and thus not visible on radiographs [2].

Ultrasound diagnosis of DDH most commonly uses the Graf technique, which is based on measurement of a bone angle (alpha) and a soft tissue angle (beta) from a coronal 2D ultrasound image of the hip. The Graf technique classifies alpha angles greater than 60° as normal and less than 43° as severely dysplastic [6]. A fundamental limitation of this approach is that it uses a 2D image to represent a complex 3D structure, leading to subjectivity in measurement and consequently high inter-scan variability. Since the ultrasound probes are handheld, no two ultrasound scans are exactly alike and a slight variation in probe orientation can give a vastly different view of the acetabulum. Jaremko et al. [7] have shown that this variability can lead to incorrect classification of DDH in half of infants and up to three-quarters of neonates. Another source for inter-observer variability in the Graf technique arises from variations in manual selection of the apex point. The apex point, which marks the separation of the ilium and the acetabulum, is used as the vertex to calculate the alpha and beta angles. The radiographic angles most similar to the alpha angle, the center-edge angle (CEA) and acetabular angle (AA), also have values dependent on definitions of lateral acetabular margin [8].

Other indices that could avoid these difficulties, and consider other aspects of the deformity of hip dysplasia, have been investigated. An alternate technique that measures a γ-angle in ultrasound images to assess the femoral head coverage was proposed by Yavuz et al. [9]. Supplementary measures to the alpha angle such as arc length, coverage and acetabular radius of curvature have been examined by Cheng et al. [10]. These methods of quantifying acetabular rounding had higher inter-observer variability than alpha angle and femoral head coverage.

All of these alternative indices quantifying DDH are still susceptible to inter-scan and inter-observer variance as they depend on manually determined landmarks. This study proposes an alternative method of ultrasound image processing: instead of the user making measurements on the image, he/she supervises generation of the acetabular surface contour, and indices of dysplasia that are geometric properties of the acetabular shape are automatically generated. We propose two such automated indices: a contour alpha angle α
                     
                        C
                      and the rounding index M.

The rounding index M is based on kurtosis and skewness of acetabular convexity, a way to mathematically quantify the intrinsic rounding of the acetabulum that can classify the acetabular shape. The index is independent of apex point (or any other manual landmarks) and hence is less subjective. It is modality-independent and can be easily computed from 2D contours of the acetabulum derived from any imaging modality. The index can also be extended to surface models generated from 3D ultrasound [11,12].

In this study, we assess the feasibility and potential value of automated 2D ultrasound image processing in DDH by this approach, measuring reliability and diagnostic accuracy of: (i) a contour-based alpha angle (α
                     
                        A
                     ); and (ii) the rounding index (M), compared to conventional ultrasound indices of DDH, namely alpha angle (α
                     
                        M
                     ) and acetabular coverage (AC).

@&#METHODS@&#

An overview of our computational approach is shown in Fig. 1
                        . The algorithm was implemented using MATLAB 2012 (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and calculations adapted to open-source Python (Anaconda Distribution 2.1.0, Continuum Analytics Inc. Austin, TX, USA). The initial step in the workflow is to obtain a contour (in 2D) or point mesh (in 3D) representing the acetabular surface. Each point on the contour or mesh has a convexity value associated with it. These calculated convexity values are automatically clustered by magnitude using k-means clustering [13]. The cluster of points with highest convexity values are then used to calculate the rounding index (M), comprised of terms denoting kurtosis (K), skewness (ψ) and the convexity ratio (C). The normalized value of the index is used to classify the hips into diagnostic categories from normal to dysplastic.

The acetabular contour is segmented automatically based on 2 user defined end points of the acetabulum (shown in Fig. 1) placed at the edge of the acetabular roof and ilium (where the acetabulum is closest to the femoral head). The graph based segmentation algorithm determines acetabular contour as shortest path between the two endpoints based on a customized cost function [11].

The convexity cluster is determined automatically from the acetabular surface contour from a 2D image or from a 2D slice obtained from 3D ultrasound data. Convexity value at a point is defined as the perpendicular distance (Fig. 2(a), line D) from that point to the line segment joining the end points of the contour on that slice (Fig. 2(a), line L). The endpoints are the edges of the echogenic line representing the acetabular contour on the ultrasound image or slice of interest. The collection of all points on the contour is clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm [13] based on the convexity values. K-means clustering is a two-step iterative algorithm. In the first step it sets cluster centers randomly and assigns each point to one of the clusters based on minimum Euclidian distance and in the second step it recalculates the cluster center based on the points in the cluster. The algorithm converges when point assignments remain constant between subsequent iterations. Fig. 2(b) shows an illustration of acetabular contour points clustered based on convexity values using k-means.

The rounding index M(S) is defined for the surface S as follows:

                        where the terms C(S), K(S) and ψ(S) represent the mean convexity ratio, kurtosis and Fisher–Pearson coefficient of skewness, respectively. These individual terms can be computed as follows.

Kurtosis K(S) for a set of points p in the maximum convexity cluster can be calculated as:

We also calculated the two main conventional indices of hip dysplasia: manual acetabular angle and acetabular coverage (Fig. 3a–3c). Acetabular coverage was calculated as the ratio C
                        2/C
                        1 where C
                        1 represents the diameter of the femoral head and C
                        2 is the portion of the femoral head that is covered by acetabulum (Fig. 3c).

The proposed algorithm was tested on a 2D ultrasound image dataset obtained prospectively with institutional ethics review board approval and with parental written informed consent. Infants suspected of hip dysplasia presented for clinically indicated hip ultrasound to our tertiary pediatric hospital radiology department. Inclusion criteria were clinical suspicion of DDH due to hip laxity, asymmetric skin creases, and/or risk factors such as positive family history; high quality ultrasound images meeting Graf standards for interpretation; and at least 3 months clinical follow-up. We enrolled 114 patients, 60 (71%) female, average age 56 days (range 4–183 days) at the time of scanning.

Images were acquired for both hips using a 12-MHz L12-5 linear transducer on Philips iU22 (Philips Healthcare, Andover, Mass). Conventional b-mode ultrasound of both hips was performed including static coronal imaging in the Graf standard plane conforming to the recommended clinical protocol [14]. Each of the 2D ultrasound scans contained 411×192 pixels of dimension 0.11×0.20mm.

The 2DUS images were interpreted in routine practice by one of seven pediatric radiologists, with results and images made available to referring clinicians. After a follow-up interval averaging 291 days (range: 94–801 days), chart review was performed to categorize patients into three groups: (i) normal at first clinical assessment (category 0, 40 hips); (ii) questionably abnormal initially but resolved spontaneously on follow-up (category 1, 34 hips); and (iii) dysplastic requiring treatment by Pavlik harness and/or surgery (category 2, 40 hips).

To compare the inter- and intra-observer variability of the quantitative indices an inter-rater study was conducted. We had two experienced readers, a pediatric musculoskeletal radiologist (XX) and a research associate (YY) with three years dedicated study of 3D hip ultrasound. Each reader traced the acetabular contours twice on the each of 114 scans at different reading sessions, blinded to previous sessions and to each other's work.

We used the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, MATLAB 2012 (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) for the analysis. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients, performed linear and polynomial regression between indices, and calculated the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 3, 1) between readings. We also performed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test whether differences between diagnostic groups were statistically significant for each index.

Processing time for the user to generate the acetabular contour (by drawing 4–7 points on the echogenic line representing the acetabulum) was similar to the time spent drawing the lines to compute the manual alpha angle, approximately 30s per image. Computer processing times were negligible for both methods, on a Windows 7 laptop with Intel Core i5 processor.

The manual and automated alpha angles (α
                     
                        M
                      and α
                     
                        A
                     ) were similar in value, differing by 7.8±2.1°. Both alpha angles were higher in normal than dysplastic hips, as was acetabular coverage. These indices varied linearly. The rounding index M varied nonlinearly, and was much lower in hips with rounding (Fig. 4b) than normal hips with a sharp apex (Fig. 4a). We normalized M to with respect to the maximum value (0.40 for our dataset).

                        M
                      and α
                     
                        A
                      were similar to each other in information content. In contrast, the correlations between the new index M and other indices, acetabular coverage, α
                     
                        M
                      and α
                     
                        A
                     , were moderate (r
                     =0.57–0.68), implying that these indices provided somewhat different information content.

                     . The relation between manual and contour alpha angles can be linearly approximated (r
                     2
                     =0.92) as shown in Fig. 5a. The relation between the rounding index (M) and the alpha angle (α
                     
                        A
                     ) was non-linear and could be approximated using a third order polynomial as shown in Fig. 5b, r
                     2
                     =0.48. Similarly the relation between M and acetabular coverage could be approximated by a third order polynomial, r
                     2
                     =0.49 (Fig. 5d). The values of acetabular coverage and α
                     
                        A
                      were best related linearly, r
                     2
                     =0.49 (Fig. 5c).

At one-way ANOVA, all four indices separated the subjects with significant differences in mean values between diagnostic categories (p
                     <0.001; Fig. 6a–d). Note that differences in means between categories were linearly distributed except for the rounding index M, which typically showed much higher values in normal (non-rounded) acetabulae than in the other categories.

The ROC curves of each of the four indices for diagnosis of DDH requiring treatment are shown in Fig. 7
                     . Since all the cases in category 1 were found to be normal on clinical follow-up these were grouped with category 0 (i.e. normal) for ROC analysis. Areas Under the Curve (AUC) were α
                     
                        A
                     
                     =0.930, α
                     
                        M
                     
                     =0.927, rounding index M
                     =0.916, coverage=0.894.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for linear combinations of the indices are shown in Fig. 8
                     . As expected from the high correlation ratio in Table 1 the combination of manual and automatic angles did not show significant improvement in AUC (93.11%, ∼0.11%). Combination of proposed metric M with the manual and contour alpha angles gave an AUC of 95.57% and 96.19%, respectively (shown in Fig. 8a). Similarly the ROC curves for linear combinations of the α
                     
                        M
                     , α
                     
                        A
                      and M with coverage gave an AUC of 94.67%, 94.56% and 93.42% (as shown in Fig. 8b). The combination of all three indices i.e. α
                     
                        A
                     , M and coverage gave an AUC of 95.74%.

In order to examine the influence of noise on the acetabular contour and the indices we added random noise to the contour points. An example of the shape of the contour altered by different levels of noise (ranging from 1 to 10 pixels) is shown in Fig. 9
                     (a). The corresponding variation in the area under the ROC curve for α
                     
                        A
                      and M is shown in Fig. 9(b). The AUC values varied from 92.76±0.71 and 91.84±0.41 for α
                     
                        A
                      and M for noise levels less than 5 pixels and 91.85±0.79 and 90.22±1.86 for noise levels greater than 5 pixels.

The variation in the acetabular contour due to variations in the end points was examined by placing the end points through a large neighborhood (of 20 pixels) around the initially chosen end point. The contours and maximum convexity clusters generated from three different sets of end points are shown in Fig. 10
                     . Note that the variation in the maximum convexity cluster (shown in yellow) was less than the actual variation in the end points. The standard deviation of the contour alpha angle due to these changes in the endpoints was 1.9±0.8°, vs. 6.3±1.2° for the conventional alpha angle calculated using the end points and the apex point, a difference which was statistically significant at p
                     <0.001 on paired t-test.

We also varied the number of clusters used to determine the maximum convexity cluster and calculated the AUC values for each case. As reported in Fig. 11
                      optimal results were obtained while using 2 clusters (AUC=0.92).

The results of our reliability study are shown in Table 2
                     . As acetabular coverage is known to be less reliable than the alpha angle [15] we did not investigate reliability of that index. The manual and contour alpha angles had similar reliability. The rounding index had a higher coefficient of variation (CoV) than the alpha angles but ICC was in similar range. We calculated the variation of alpha angle with apex point by moving the apex point over the segmented curve of the acetabulum. The mean variation in alpha angle was substantial at 1.2° per millimeter variation in apex point.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This paper proposes a new approach to analyze 2D ultrasound images in hip dysplasia: rather than measure angles directly, the user traces the acetabular surface, then indices of dysplasia are generated as properties of the surface shape, in particular an contour-based alpha angle α
                     
                        A
                      and a rounding index M.

Selection of endpoints is the only user interaction involved in extracting the acetabular contour and calculating the indices. Points in acetabular contour are clustered based on convexity and those that are not in the maximum convexity cluster are discarded while calculating the contour alpha angle (α
                     
                        A
                     ) and rounding index (M). The contour-based alpha angle was equivalent in reliability and diagnostic classification ability to the manual alpha angle when performed by experts. The rounding index (M) was measured with only slightly more variability (CoV 0.08–0.13), and its addition to the alpha angle improved diagnostic classification by up to 3% (confidence interval 0.90), allowing one-third of cases mis-classified using the alpha angle alone to be correctly classified.

Various approaches to quantify different aspects of acetabular shape have been explored in literature. Our approach is novel: (i) it calculates indices from the geometric representation of the surface (in the form of a 2D contour or 3D mesh) rather than relying on landmarks; and (ii) it is designed to work directly with 3D surface models, with potential to reduce the inter-scan variability and errors intrinsic to 2D ultrasound. Both new indices are modality-independent and are based on convexity of acetabular points (or mesh vertices) obtained from a segmented mesh. By clustering mesh vertices based on convexity, the edges of the acetabular model are eliminated from the calculation, removing points of little diagnostic value which are prone to relatively high inter-observer variability.

The rounding index M is defined as a function of kurtosis, skew and convexity ratio of the all mesh points in the maximum convexity cluster. When seen from the principal axis of the acetabulum (i.e., the line segment joining the end points) a normal hip model has a higher kurtosis (‘steepness’) than a dysplastic hip. Similarly a normal hip typically has a positive skew while a severely dysplastic hip often has close to zero skew. The third term used in M is the ratio of the maximum acetabular convexity to the distance between the endpoints, which is generally higher for a normal hip and lower for a dysplastic hip (Fig. 4a and c).

The rounding index M accurately separated hips into the three diagnostic categories, although the AUC was slightly lower than for the alpha angle indices. The conventional DDH indices (alpha angle and acetabular coverage) showed low correlation with M, indicating that it measures a different aspect of acetabular shape. Visually, high M values are inversely related to acetabular rounding, i.e., the more rounded the acetabulum, the lower M becomes (Fig. 4c). M has the advantage of being independent of the apex point.

This study also proposes a contour-based alpha angle which determines an apex point based on convexity of the shape, thereby eliminating manual apex point selection and significantly reducing sensitivity to error based on variation of user selection of endpoints. We found apex point location had a non-trivial impact on alpha angle calculations: moving the apex just 8mm could alter the alpha angle by 10°, enough to cross into another diagnostic category. The automatic and conventional alpha angles correlated highly, indicating they contain similar information. The AUC of the contour alpha angle was slightly greater than that for the conventional alpha angle. Since all indices gave large AUC (>89%) in this research setting, all indices were discriminative. Rounding index gave a wide separation between normal and dysplastic cases (Figs. 6 and 4a and c (sample case)). For example, in Fig. 4b and c a borderline hip and a dysplastic hip have similar alpha angles, but Fig. 4c is visually more rounded, which corresponds to a much smaller M value (0.01 vs. 0.12). In this case the combination of alpha and M is more helpful in reaching the correct clinical diagnosis than alpha alone.

The proposed index relies on a segmented mesh which limits its application to 3D ultrasound since the manual segmentation of the acetabulum is cumbersome. However with semi-automated contouring techniques such as the one mentioned in [11] segmented surface models can be generated accurately and rapidly with minimal user interaction. A more significant limitation of the index is that it completely relies upon the shape of the acetabulum which in some cases can be misleading, if the acetabular ‘socket’ has a sharp non-rounded angle but is dysplastic mainly because it is shallow (Fig. 4d). In such cases, the acetabular coverage is a more useful diagnostic index.

Variation in the contour due to noise can have an impact on the values of the proposed indices. In our study using simulated random noise we found that variations up to 5 pixels in the image did not result in substantial variation in the area under the ROC curve, while larger variation >10 pixels had significant impact on this area. In our earlier work on graph search based acetabular segmentation [11] we have shown that the maximum RMS error was less than 1mm (or ∼3 pixels) for 15% salt and pepper noise and less than 0.7mm (∼2 pixels) for speckle noise (with noise variance of 0.4). Since these are similar to the actual image noise encountered in ultrasound images, we conclude that the indices are relatively insensitive to noise in routine use.

Variations in the manually chosen endpoints can cause variations to the segmented contour. However the consequent variation in the contour alpha angle is small (<2°) since it is calculated from the maximum convexity cluster which does not include the endpoints. This could be the reason for significantly lower variation in our approach compared to the conventional method of alpha angle calculation, which is more dependent on endpoint locations. As future work we plan to develop a fully automated segmentation algorithm that would obviate the need for manually chosen end points. We also found that clustering the points into two groups was optimal for this application based on the highest AUC.

We caution that the diagnostic accuracy of these indices may be lower in clinical use than in this research setting, in which scan protocols were rigorously controlled. For example, the 2D ultrasound alpha angle had AUC 84% in a retrospective review of non-research scans performed at our institution [10], lower than the ∼93% observed here. Prospective clinical studies are warranted and planned. As a future study we plan to compare the reliability of the manual alpha angle and the contour alpha angle when measured by inexperienced readers. Note that the focus of our study was on initial diagnosis of hip dysplasia, typically done in the setting of screening all infants in a population or screening selected high-risk infants, via a neonatal or perinatal preventive health program. Hence we have classified the hips as normal, dysplastic and borderline. Sub-diagnosis of level of severity of DDH, which is currently done in conjunction with pediatric orthopedic clinics, has not been examined in this study. We plan extensive future studies to refine diagnosis and risk stratification based on severity of DDH.

Although the rounding index M has been explained and evaluated only for 2D images, it can be extended to 3D ultrasound data. In the present 2D formulation the new indices do not solve the problem of interscan variability. In order to extend the concept to 3D the convexity of each point in the 3D volume can be calculated as the perpendicular distance from the best fit plane passing through the endpoints of all slices. The kurtosis and skewness terms can be directly calculated from the convexity values of the segmented 3D surface. However a slice histogram based approach may be more suitable as this would take into account variations in the shape of acetabulum in the anterior and posterior half. Since the proposed index does not rely upon any anatomical landmarks, it can also be computed from surface models generated from other modalities such as CT and MRI.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new approach to analyze 2D ultrasound images in hip dysplasia focuses on user tracing of the acetabular shape, followed by automated calculation of an alpha angle and rounding index as properties of this shape. This is rapid (less than 30s), and the contour-based alpha angle has reliability and accuracy equivalent to the conventional alpha angle. The rounding index is a reliable supplementary index of a different aspect of hip dysplasia, which improved diagnostic accuracy. The technique and indices can be directly extended to CT or MRI data in future, with potential to improve inter-scan and inter-modality reliability in diagnosis and monitoring of DDH.
