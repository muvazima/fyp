                  A connected dominating set (CDS) is commonly used to model a virtual backbone of a wireless network. To bound the distance that information must travel through the network, we explicitly restrict the diameter of a CDS to be no more than s leading to the concept of a dominating s-club. We prove that for any fixed positive integer s it is NP-complete to determine if a graph has a dominating s-club, even when the graph has diameter 
                        
                           s
                           +
                           1
                        
                     . As a special case it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter two has a dominating clique. We then propose a compact integer programming formulation for the related minimization problem, enhance the approach with variable fixing rules and valid inequalities, and present computational results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is common to represent a wireless communication network as a graph, where nodes in the wireless network correspond to vertices in the graph and edges denote the ability to communicate directly. Any given pair of nodes may not be close enough to communicate directly, but a message can be transmitted through intermediate nodes. In the wireless network, these intermediate nodes form a virtual backbone structure, which is a connected dominating set (CDS) in the graph setting. It may be important to transmit these messages quickly. This requirement of low-latency can be enforced in the graph by requiring that the vertices from the CDS induce a subgraph of small diameter. This leads to the notion of a dominating s-club—a dominating set whose induced subgraph has diameter at most s. It can be seen that dominating s-club generalizes dominating clique (let 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ), and if we allow s to be instance-dependent it generalizes CDS (let 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           n
                           -
                           1
                        
                      for an n-vertex graph).

A dominating clique (i.e., a dominating 1-club) introduced by Brandstädt and Kratsch (1985) (see also Brandstädt & Kratsch, 1987; Cozzens & Kelleher, 1990) can provide a virtual backbone structure for a wireless communication network that has the shortest communication time. Since the members of the dominating clique can communicate directly, a message departing from any source can reach any destination in at most 3 hops. On the other hand, ensuring the existence of a dominating clique in a wireless network may be too costly. Moreover, this may result in excessive interference.

A dominating s-club provides a compromise, possibly offering advantages over the commonly used CDS in terms of speed of communication, energy consumption, and reliability (Kim, Wu, Li, Zou, & Du, 2009). Small diameter dominating sets facilitate quick communication between each pair of vertices, as any two vertices are at most 
                        
                           s
                           +
                           2
                        
                      hops apart: 1 hop to reach the backbone, s hops within the backbone, and 1 hop to the destination. All else being equal, smaller dominating sets contribute to improved energy consumption, as the number of transmissions required to pass a message from one vertex to another is small. Also recognize that long transmission paths can increase the chance of message transmission failure (Mohammed, Gewali, & Muthukumar, 2005), meaning that a smaller-diameter backbone may be more reliable. In contrast to a dominating s-club, a CDS D ensures little in terms of the diameter (the worst case diameter is 
                        
                           |
                           D
                           |
                           -
                           1
                        
                     ), possibly resulting in excessively long transmission paths between vertices.

The minimum dominating s-club problem, which is the focus of the present paper, is defined as follows. Given a graph 
                        
                           G

                           E
                           )
                        
                      and a positive integer constant s, find a smallest dominating set 
                        
                           D
                           ⊆
                           V
                        
                      such that 
                        
                           diam
                           (
                           G
                           [
                           D
                           ]
                           )
                           ⩽

                     , or decide that none exist. When a dominating s-club exists in G, we call the size of a minimum dominating s-club the dominating s-club number of G and denote it by

                        . An s-club that forms a dominating set is called a dominating s-club.

The minimum dominating clique problem has been shown to be polynomial-time solvable in strongly chordal graphs (Kratsch, 1990), undirected path graphs (Kratsch, 1990), and circle graphs (Keil, 1993). In general, however, the minimum dominating clique problem is NP-hard (Kratsch & Liedloff, 2007). In fact, it is NP-complete to determine the existence of a dominating clique in a graph (Brandstädt & Kratsch, 1985, 1987). An exact, exponential-time algorithm has been developed for arbitrary graphs (Kratsch & Liedloff, 2007).

Since we want to restrict the diameter, the notion of s-club is important. Several papers in literature consider a different problem: the maximum s-club problem. Even though this problem is different from ours, it provides useful insights for complexity and IP formulations. The maximum s-club problem asks for a maximum size subset of vertices whose induced subgraph has diameter at most s. The decision version of the maximum s-club problem has been shown to be NP-complete (Bourjolly, Laporte, & Pesant, 2002), even when restricted to graphs of diameter 
                           
                              s

                         (Balasundaram, Butenko, & Trukhanov, 2005). Some exact approaches for the maximum s-club problem are based on integer programming formulations with 
                           
                              O

                              O

The NP-hard minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) problem and the related maximum leaf spanning tree problem have received significant attention in the literature. A wide variety of approaches have been considered, including exact approaches (Fan & Watson, 2012; Fernau et al., 2011; Fomin, Grandoni, & Kratsch, 2008; Fujie, 2003; Fujie, 2004; Lucena, Maculan, & Simonetti, 2010; Simonetti, Salles da Cunha, & Lucena, 2011), approximation algorithms (Guha & Khuller, 1998; Lu & Ravi, 1998), and polynomial-time approximation schemes for unit disk graphs (Cheng, Huang, Li, Wu, & Du, 2003; Hunt et al., 1998) and unit ball graphs (Zhang, Gao, Wu, & Du, 2008).

Considerably less work has been done for restricted-diameter dominating sets. Researchers have proposed heuristics (Mohammed et al., 2005) and approximation algorithms (Kim et al., 2009) with constant ratios for both CDS size and diameter (for disk graphs). Schaudt (2013) has shown that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter 
                           
                              s
                              +
                              2
                           
                         has a dominating s-club. To the best of our knowledge, there are no exact approaches for the minimum dominating s-club problem in previous literature (for general s).

In Section 2, we prove that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter two has a dominating clique. We extend this for any fixed positive integer s, showing that it is NP-complete to determine if a graph of diameter 
                           
                              s
                              +
                              1
                           
                         admits a dominating s-club. We consider the minimization problem in Section 3, showing that it is NP-hard to approximate within a logarithmic factor, even when a dominating s-club is known to exist. We also relate the dominating s-club number to other domination-related graph invariants, and demonstrate that restricting the diameter by just one unit can be very costly. In Section 4, we present a compact integer programming formulation for the minimum dominating s-club problem and develop associated valid inequalities and variable fixing rules. Section 5 discusses the potential applicability of the formulation to solving the classical MCDS problem. Section 6 reports the results of numerical experiments with the proposed formulation for the minimum dominating s-club problem on a set of random unit disk graphs and MCDS instances from literature. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.

In this section we consider the questions: (1) which graphs have a dominating s-club? and (2) what is the computational complexity of determining if a graph admits a dominating s-club?
                  

It is clear that not every graph has a dominating s-club, as evidenced by the class of disconnected graphs. However, even when the graph is connected, a dominating s-club may not exist; the cycle on six vertices has no dominating 2-club. Some have attempted to find sufficient conditions for a dominating s-club to exist. Cozzens and Kelleher (1990) show that a dominating clique exists if the graph has no induced

This remark shows that requiring a smaller diameter may come at the cost of a larger set. Given that a smaller diameter dominating set is usually preferred, it would be nice to bound this extra cost. Unfortunately, this cost can be very large indeed. This claim, stated formally in Remark 2, is demonstrated in the appendix.

Now we consider the complexity of the minimum dominating s-club problem. Of course this is a difficult problem, because it is NP-complete to determine if any feasible solution exists. However, it could be that the difficulty lies only in finding a feasible solution. Remark 3, below, states that this is not the case. The minimization problem remains hard to approximate when a feasible solution is known.

Recall that the minimum set cover problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of 
                        
                           c
                           log
                           n
                        
                      for c constant (Alon, Moshkovitz, & Safra, 2006; Raz & Safra, 1997), where n refers to the number of elements that must be covered. Guha and Khuller (1998) have shown that the MCDS problem is hard to approximate to within a factor of 
                        
                           c
                           log
                           Δ
                        
                     , where 
                        
                           Δ
                        
                      is the maximum degree of the graph, via a reduction from the minimum set cover problem. We note that the same reduction from (Guha & Khuller, 1998) shows that the minimum dominating s-club problem is hard to approximate for any fixed 
                        
                           s

                     , even when a feasible solution is known to exist. This holds because their construction ensures that

Proposition 2 and Remark 4 below will show that this classical domination constraint can be replaced with a stronger open neighborhood inequality

Next, we explore some valid inequalities for dominating s-club. Note that any feasible solution to dominating s-club is feasible to CDS. Accordingly, the convex hull of feasible solutions to dominating s-club is a subset of that of CDS. Therefore, an inequality which is valid for CDS is valid for dominating s-club. A subset of vertices in a connected graph is called a cutset if its removal disconnects the graph.

It should be noted that Yuan (2005), in fact, shows that the collection of all minimal cutset inequalities (along with binary constraints on the variables) gives a proper formulation for CDS.

                        The open neighborhood inequalities for dominating s-club and CDS subsume the classical domination constraints.

The previous proposition shows how to create valid inequalities and fix certain variables for CDS (and consequently, dominating s-club). We can establish stronger, analogous results for dominating s-club.
                        Proposition 3
                        
                           Suppose a graph G has a dominating s-club, and let x be the characteristic vector of an arbitrary dominating s-club. Then the following statements hold.

Similar statements for closed neighborhood inclusion are well-known for the minimum dominating set problem (Alber, Fellows, & Niedermeier, 2004) and the MCDS problem (Lucena et al., 2010).

Consider a generalization of the minimum dominating s-club problem in which we let the parameter s depend on some input, such as the number n of vertices in the graph G. Then the MCDS problem can be solved via the minimum dominating s-club problem. In the naive approach, simply let

The last two propositions lead to two different ways to solve the MCDS problem. In the first approach (using Proposition 5), use any MCDS heuristic to find a decent upper bound U on 
                        
                           
                              
                                 γ
                              
                              
                                 c
                              
                           
                           (
                           G
                           )
                        
                     . Then solve the minimum dominating s-club problem with 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           U
                           -
                           1
                        
                      to solve the MCDS problem.

In the second approach, use Proposition 6 and solve a series of minimum dominating s-club problems for various values of s. Small values of s, which typically warrant applicability of effective scale-reduction techniques, may not give a small enough dominating s-club to apply Proposition 6. In a simple approach, start with 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           diam
                           (
                           G
                           )
                           -
                           2
                        
                      and solve the minimum dominating s-club problem. If Proposition 6 applies, then we have an optimal solution to the MCDS problem. Otherwise, increment s by 1 and repeat. This approach has the advantage that an optimal solution for one stage constitutes a feasible starting solution for the subsequent problem. On the other hand, Proposition 6 may not be applicable for any value of

Our preliminary numerical experiments with these approaches yielded results that were generally outperformed by other methods for MCDS proposed in the literature (Fan & Watson, 2012; Lucena et al., 2010), especially on instances with large diameter. However, our results were competitive on instances with a small CDS. We leave an in-depth investigation of the suitability of the proposed formulation for the MCDS problem for future work.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

All computational experiments were conducted on Dell Precision Workstation T7500® computers, each with eight 2.40gigahertz Intel Xeon® processors, and 12gigabyte RAM. The solver used was ILOG CPLEX 12.1®. Before sending an instance to the solver, we checked if a single vertex or pair of adjacent vertices dominated, in which case the problem is solved. If neither of these conditions were satisfied, then a heuristic CDS solution was generated as described by Butenko, Cheng, Oliveira, and Pardalos (2004). This CDS was used as the initial feasible solution for the minimum dominating s-club problem if it satisfied the diameter constraint.

In the computational experiments, variable fixing based on neighborhood inclusion was applied in the following way. Let 
                        
                           V
                           =
                           {
                           1
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           n
                           }
                        
                     . Then if the closed (open) neighborhood of i is a strict subset of the closed (open) neighborhood of j, we set 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . If the closed (open) neighborhoods of i and j are equal, then fix 
                        
                           
                              
                                 x
                              
                              
                                 min
                                 {
                                 i
                                 ,
                                 j
                                 }
                              
                           
                           =
                           0
                        
                     . Then by Proposition 4 there exists an optimal solution that remains feasible after this variable-fixing procedure.

A motivating application for dominating s-club occurs in wireless sensor networks, where nodes can communicate with each other when they are within the transmission range (unit distance) of each other. This leads to a graph-theoretic model called a unit disk graph, where nodes lie in the Euclidean plane and an edge joins two nodes if the Euclidean distance between them is below the unit distance (i.e., one node is in the unit disk centered at the other node). We created several random unit disk graphs, where the points lie in a 2-dimensional box, and the number of points and communication threshold are specified by a set of parameters. Each point was generated from a random ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinate, each uniformly distributed between 0 and the length of the box side. If the unit disk graph generated by these points was not connected, it was discarded and another graph was created. The parameters used to generate these graphs are the same used by Butenko et al. (2004).

The aim of our first set of experiments was to explore the value of employing the variable fixing rules and valid inequalities described in Section 4. For this purpose, we used a set of 100-vertex random unit disk graphs with the length of the box side set at 100 and the unit disk radius ranging between 20 and 50, with the increment of 5. In addition to executing the basic version of formulation (14)–(20) (labeled “Basic” in the table), we considered the following variations of the IP approach.

                     , with detailed results provided in Table C.4 of the appendix. As can be seen from the tables, it is typically most beneficial to include all three of the considered enhancements to the basic implementation, therefore this was made the case in our remaining experiments reported below. The setting “NIF” also works pretty well, which we suspect is because this can reduce the dimension of the problem (particularly, when fixing

                      for a vertex i that lies near an edge of the box).

We tested the approach using three of the lowest feasible values of s for each graph, namely

                     , none of the instances were solved within the 3600-s time limit. Detailed results are presented in Appendix C. Table C.5 shows the results for the random UDGs, whereas Table C.6 reports the results of experiments on a set of MCDS instances from Lucena et al. (2010) and Simonetti et al. (2011). As one can observe from these tables, the best results in terms of solution time occur when s is small and when the edge density of a graph is relatively high. Each of the 100-vertex instances was solved to optimality when the edge density was at least 25%. Similarly, each of the 150 vertex instances was solved to optimality for densities of at least 30%. However, sparse instances appear to be more difficult to solve. This has also been noted for the MCDS problem (Simonetti et al., 2011) and for the maximum s-club problem (Veremyev & Boginski, 2012).

We consider the problem of finding a smallest diameter-restricted dominating set (i.e., dominating s-club). We show that determining if a diameter

                     , filling a gap in the knowledge about the problem’s complexity. Moreover, we remark that (for 
                        
                           s
                           ⩾

                     ) the minimum dominating s-club problem remains hard to approximate within a logarithmic factor even when a dominating s-club is known to exist. We provide a compact integer programming formulation for the minimum dominating s-club problem and develop some variable fixing rules and valid inequalities.

In the future, one may seek to make the dominating s-club robust under edge and vertex failures. Veremyev and Boginski (2012) explore various ways to ensure robustness of the s-club. One proposed structure, an R-robust s-club, not only remains connected after

                      vertex failures, but also maintains diameter s. Similar avenues may be pursued to make the dominating s-club more robust. An interesting concept to explore may be an R-robust dominating s-club: a structure which maintains its dominating nature and diameter s despite the failure of 
                        
                           R

                      dominating vertices.

The complexity of the minimum dominating s-club problem in unit disk graphs is an open question. Since the MCDS problem remains hard in this class of graphs, we suspect that it also remains challenging. Other authors (e.g., Kim et al., 2009) have proposed approximation algorithms for similar problems in disk graphs, providing evidence that the problem remains difficult, or that an appropriate NP-completeness reduction would be nontrivial.
