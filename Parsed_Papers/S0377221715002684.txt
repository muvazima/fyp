                  In stochastic optimal control, one deals with sequential decision-making under uncertainty; with dynamic risk measures, one assesses stochastic processes (costs) as time goes on and information accumulates. Under the same vocable of time-consistency (or dynamic-consistency), both theories coin two different notions: the latter is consistency between successive evaluations of a stochastic processes by a dynamic risk measure (a form of monotonicity); the former is consistency between solutions to intertemporal stochastic optimization problems. Interestingly, both notions meet in their use of dynamic programming, or nested, equations.
                  We provide a theoretical framework that offers (i) basic ingredients to jointly define dynamic risk measures and corresponding intertemporal stochastic optimization problems (ii) common sets of assumptions that lead to time-consistency for both. We highlight the role of time and risk preferences — materialized in one-step aggregators — in time-consistency. Depending on how one moves from one-step time and risk preferences to intertemporal time and risk preferences, and depending on their compatibility (commutation), one will or will not observe time-consistency. We also shed light on the relevance of information structure by giving an explicit role to a state control dynamical system, with a state that parameterizes risk measures and is the input to optimal policies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

You come across time-consistency in two different mathematical fields. You are time-consistent if, as time goes on and information accumulates, you do not question the original assessment of stochastic processes (dynamic risk measures) or planning of policies (stochastic optimal control).

We propose a general mechanism to build up time-consistent dynamic risk measures, that serve as criteria for optimal control problems under uncertainty, which henceforth inherit time-consistency. We show how in a few words.

We will show that nested-aggregation produces both time-consistent dynamic risk measures and optimal control problems, and that so does block-aggregation when a commutation property holds true. For example, sum and integral are commuting operators and a block-aggregation is equivalent to a nested-aggregation as shown in the following equality

Now, let us be more specific.

In stochastic optimal control, one deals with sequential decision-making under uncertainty; with dynamic risk measures, one assesses stochastic processes (costs) as time goes on and information accumulates. We discuss the definition of time-consistency in each setting one after the other (see also Rudloff, Street, & Valladão, 2014 for another analysis of links between both notion).

In optimal control problems, we consider a dynamical process that can be influenced by exogenous noises as well as decisions made at every time step. The decision-maker (DM) wants to optimize a criterion (for instance, minimize a net present value) over a given time horizon. As time goes on and the system evolves, the DM makes observations. Naturally, it is generally more profitable for the DM to adapt his decisions to the observations. He is hence looking for policies (strategies, decision rules) rather than simple decisions: a policy is a function that maps every possible history of the observations to corresponding decisions.

The notion of “consistent course of action” (see Peleg & Yaari, 1973) is well-known in the field of economics, with the seminal work of (Strotz, 1955–1956): an individual having planned his consumption trajectory is consistent if, reevaluating his plans later on, he does not deviate from the originally chosen plan. This idea of consistency as “sticking to one’s plan” may be extended to the uncertain case where plans are replaced by decision rules (“Do thus-and-thus if you find yourself in this portion of state space with this amount of time left”, Richard Bellman cited in Dreyfus, 2002): Hammond (1976) addresses “consistency” and “coherent dynamic choice”, Kreps and Porteus (1978) refer to “temporal consistency”.

In this context, we loosely state the property of time-consistency in optimal control problems as follows (Carpentier, Chancelier, Cohen, De Lara, & Girardeau, 2012). The decision maker formulates an optimization problem at time t
                     0 that yields a sequence (planning) of optimal decision rules for t
                     0 and for the following increasing time steps t
                     1, …, tN
                      = T. Then, at the next time step t
                     1, he formulates a new problem starting at t
                     1, that yields a new sequence of optimal decision rules from time steps t
                     1 to T. Suppose the process continues until time T is reached. The sequence of optimization problems is said to be time-consistent if the optimal strategies obtained when solving the original problem at time t
                     0 remain optimal for all subsequent problems. In other words, time consistency means that strategies obtained by solving the problem at the very first stage do not have to be questioned later on.

Now, we turn to dynamic risk measures. At time t
                     0, you assess, by means of a risk measure

                                    0

Dynamic or time-consistency has been introduced in the context of risk measures (see Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, Heath, & Ku, 2007; Cheridito, Delbaen, & Kupper, 2006; Cheridito & Kupper, 2011; Detlefsen & Scandolo, 2005; Riedel, 2004 for definitions and properties of coherent and consistent dynamic risk measures).

We observe that both notions of time-consistency look quite different: the latter is consistency between successive risk assessments of a stochastic process by a dynamic risk measure (a form of monotonicity); the former is consistency between solutions to intertemporal stochastic optimization problems. We now stress the role of information accumulation in both notions of time-consistency, because it highlights how the two notions can be connected. For dynamic risk measures, the flow of information is materialized by a filtration

                     . In stochastic optimal control, an amount of information more modest than the past of exogenous noises is often sufficient to make an optimal decision. In the seminal work of (Bellman, 1957), the minimal information necessary to make optimal decisions is captured in a state variable (see Whittle, 1982 for a more formal definition). Moreover, the famous Bellman or Dynamic Programming Equation (DPE) provides a theoretical way to find optimal strategies (see Bertsekas, 2000 for a broad overview on Dynamic Programming (DP)).

Interestingly, time-consistency in optimal control problems and time-consistency for dynamic risk measures meet in their use of DPEs. On the one hand, in optimal control problems, it is well known that the existence of a DPE with state x for a sequence of optimization problems implies time-consistency when solutions are looked after as feedback policies that are functions of the state x. On the other hand, proving time-consistency for a dynamic risk measure appears rather easy when the corresponding conditional risk measures can be expressed by a nested formulation. In both contexts, such nested formulations are possible only for proper information structures. In optimal control problems, a sequence of optimization problems may be consistent for some information structure while inconsistent for a different one (see Carpentier et al., 2012). For dynamic risk measures, time-consistency appears to be strongly dependent on the underlying information structure (filtration or scenario tree). Moreover, in both contexts, nested formulations and the existence of a DPE are established under various forms of decomposability of operators that display monotonicity and commutation properties.

Our objective is to provide a theoretical framework that offers (i) basic ingredients to jointly define dynamic risk measures and corresponding intertemporal optimization problems under uncertainty (ii) common sets of assumptions that lead to time-consistency for both. We wish to highlight the role of time and risk preferences, materialized in one-step aggregators, in time-consistency. Depending on how you move from one-step time and risk preferences to intertemporal time and risk preferences, and depending on their compatibility (commutation), you will or will not observe time-consistency. We also shed light on the relevance of information structure by giving an explicit role to a dynamical system with state x.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define dynamic uncertainty criteria (“cousins” of dynamic risk measures) and their time-consistency. Then, we introduce the notions of time and uncertainty-aggregators, define their composition, and show two ways to craft a dynamic uncertainty criterion from one-step aggregators: in the nested-aggregation case, we prove time-consistency; in the block-aggregation case, we have to add a commutation property for this. In Section 3, we introduce the basic material to formulate intertemporal optimization problems under uncertainty from dynamic uncertainty criteria, and define their time-consistency. In the nested-aggregation case, we prove time-consistency by displaying a DPE; in the block-aggregation case, we have to add a commutation property for this. We end with applications in Section 4, before concluding.

In Section 2.1, we lay out adapted uncertainty processes and dynamic uncertainty criterion, cousins of adapted processes and dynamic risk measures, then propose a definition of time-consistency. Then, in Section 2.2, we introduce the notions of time and uncertainty-aggregators, define their composition, and outline general ways of building a dynamic uncertainty criterion from one-step aggregators. Further, in Section 2.3 we define nested criterion and give a time-consistency result relying on monotonicity of one-step aggregators. Finally, in Section 2.4 we define a commutation property between time and uncertainty aggregators. This commutation property allow to give a time-consistency result for a block-aggregated dynamic uncertainty criterion.

Inspired by the definitions of risk measures and dynamic risk measures in mathematical finance, and motivated by intertemporal optimization, we introduce the following definitions of dynamic uncertainty criterion, and Markov dynamic uncertainty criterion. Such criteria are not restricted to assess measurable mappings (as stochastic processes would be), and we pay the price by letting +∞ be a possible assessment (for instance, the “mathematical expectation” of a non-measurable function is +∞).

Mimicking the definition of adapted processes in probability theory, we first introduce the following definition of adapted uncertainty processes.

We provide a definition of time-consistency for Markov dynamic uncertainty criteria, inspired by the definition for dynamic risk measures. If two streams of random costs coincide up to time t, but that the tail streams can be ranked pointwise, so will their risk measure.

We introduce the notions of time and uncertainty-aggregators, define their composition, and outline general ways of constructing a dynamic uncertainty criterion from one-step aggregators.

For notational clarity the argument of time-aggregators are written between curly braces ({·}) whereas the argument of uncertainty aggregators are written between straight brackets [·].

                                 It is shown in (Leclère, 2014, Chap. 2) that monotonicity is also sufficient to yield time-consistency.

Nested uncertainty criteria carry the time-consistency property in the very manner they are built. However, nested uncertainty criterion are not the most natural candidates to assess risk and their economic interpretation is delicate. In practice, uncertainty criterion are more often given in block-aggregation form — integrate with respect to all times, then with respect to all uncertainties — than in nested form.

We first propose a commutation property that will allow to go from one formulation to the other, and that will stand as one of the key ingredients for a DPE and lead to the time-consistency result in Theorem 14.

In Definition 13, we build block-aggregators, first starting by aggregating with respect to time, second with respect to uncertainty. If we aggregate first with respect to uncertainty, second with respect to time, we obtain another dynamic uncertainty criterion. However, to show time-consistency would require monotonicity and another notion of commutation, less widespread than Definition 11. See (Leclère, 2014, Chap. 2) for more details on the subject.

In (Leclère, 2014, Chap. 2), the construction of this Section 2 is extended to Markovian aggregators. Roughly speaking, the time-step time and uncertainty aggregators are parametrized by a state, that follows a control dynamical system. All results remain true if the commutation property holds true for every possible value of the underlying state.

In Section 2, we considered dynamic uncertainty criterion that value (the risk of) a stream of costs. We now use such criteria to formulate intertemporal optimization problems under uncertainty. In Section 3.1, we lay out the basic material to formulate intertemporal optimization problems. Then, we provide definition of time-consistency in Section 3.2, and time-consistency results in Section 3.3.

In Section 3.1.1, we recall the formalism of Control Theory, with dynamical system, state, control and costs. In Section 3.1.2, we show how to produce adapted uncertainty processes of costs, that will be the inputs to dynamic uncertainty criteria.

Let T ≥ 2 be an integer. We define a control T-stage dynamical system as follows. We consider sequences of sets of states (

                           expresses the fact that we can stop anywhere along a state trajectory and start again.

With a policy and a scenario, we obtain state and control trajectories that we plug into the instantaneous cost functions Js
                            to deliver streams of costs.

                        . In other words, you “stick to your plans” (here, a plan is a policy) and do not reconsider your policy whenever you stop along an optimal path and optimize ahead from this stop point.

To account for non-uniqueness of optimal policies, we propose the following formal definition.

We stress that the above definition of time-consistency of a sequence of families of optimization problems is contingent on the state x and on the dynamics

                         by the flow (18). In particular, we assume that, at each time step, the control is taken only in function of the state: this defines the class of solutions as policies that are feedbacks of the state x (such restriction is justified in the Markovian case, for example).

We now provide time-consistency results, differing whether in the nested-aggregation or in the block-aggregation case.

We define the nested Markov optimization problem formally by

It may be difficult to prove the existence of a measurable selection among the solutions of (29). Since it is not our intent to consider such issues, we make the assumption that an admissible policy π
                                 ♯ ∈ Π
                                 ad exists, where the definition of the set Π
                                 ad is supposed to include all proper measurability conditions.

The proof of Proposition 22 is detailed in the appendix.

The following Theorem 25 is our main result on time-consistency in the block-aggregation case. We do not give the proof since it directly follows from Theorem 9 and Theorem 14.

                                 Theorem 24 and 25 are given for criteria obtained via time followed by uncertainty aggregation. When uncertainty precedes time aggregation, we can obtain similar results, at the price of a different definition of commuting aggregators (Leclère, 2014, Chap. 2).

In (Leclère, 2014, Chap. 2), the time consitency result is extended to Markovian aggregators, made of one-step time and uncertainty aggregators parameterized by the state. All results remain true if the commutation property holds true for every possible value of the state.

We end by providing classes of dynamic uncertainty criteria and corresponding intertemporal optimization problems that display time-consistency, as well as examples of applications.

We introduce a class of dynamic uncertainty criteria, that are related to coherent risk measures, and we show that they display time-consistency. We thus extend, to more general one-step time-aggregators, results known for the sum (see e.g. Ruszczyski, 2010; Shapiro, 2012).

The one-step uncertainty-aggregators

                         with θ ∈ [0, 1], and even to more complex convex combinations of infima and suprema as shown in Proposition 31 in Appendix A.

Our result extends to a Markovian setting where one-step aggregators 
                           
                              G
                              t
                           
                         and Φt
                         are indexed by the state x. More precisely, the coefficient αt
                         and βt
                         and the set of probability 
                           
                              P
                              t
                           
                         can depend on the state x.

Our result differs from the work of Ruszczyski (2010, Theorem 2) in two ways. On the one hand, Ruszczyński provides arguments to show that there exists an optimal Markovian policy among the set of adapted policies (that is, having a policy taking as argument the whole past uncertainties would not give a better cost than a policy taking as argument the current value of the state). We do not tackle this issue since we directly deal with policies as functions of the state. Where we suppose that there exists an admissible policy π
                        ♯ ∈ Π
                        ad such that (29) holds true, Ruszczyński gives conditions ensuring this property. On the other hand, where Ruszczyński restricts to the sum to aggregate instantaneous costs, we consider more general one-step time-aggregators Φt
                        . For instance, our results applies to the product of costs.

We introduce a class of dynamic uncertainty criteria, that are related to convex risk measures (see Föllmer & Schied, 2002), and we show that they display time-consistency. We consider the same setting as in Section 4.1, with the restriction that βt
                         ≡ 1 in (33) and an additional data (Υ

                         in (40b) correspond to a convex risk measure (see Föllmer & Schied, 2002). Moreover, Proposition 31 shows that we could also consider any positive linear combination of suprema and infima of expectation.

A special case of coherent risk measures consists of the worst case scenario operators, also called “fear operators”. For this subclass of coherent risk measures, we show that time-consistency holds for a larger class of time-aggregators than the ones above.

Such an optimization problem, where both discounting and beliefs depend on the state, falls into the framework developped in Section 4.1 in its Markovian version.

In environmental economics literature, when time spans across generations (like with climate change issues), scholars discuss the use of additive time preferences. Indeed, additivity implies possible compensations between distant generations, and discounting can lead to myopic decisions (Clark, 1990; Weitzman, 2007). The so-called Rawls or maximin criterion (De Lara & Doyen, 2008)

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have provided basic ingredients — one-step time and uncertainty aggregators — to make up dynamic uncertainty criteria and corresponding intertemporal optimization problems under uncertainty. Nested criteria carry the time-consistency property in the very manner they are built, only relying on monotonicity property. Block-aggregated are more natural candidates than nested ones as dynamic uncertainty criteria. However, we prove that they display time-consistency at the additional price of commutation between one-step time and uncertainty aggregators.

Thus equipped, we have tools to cook up time-consistent dynamic uncertainty criteria and intertemporal optimization problems under uncertainty. Moreover, our framework extends to the Markovian setting, where the one-step time and uncertainty aggregators are parametrized by the state, that follows a control dynamical system. This is how our results cover a large class of applications. However, our results also point to the fact that, in practice, time-consistency is mostly related to linearity and expectation (see (Shapiro, 2012) for some comments on the subject). Other ways to obtain time-consistent formulation consist in using either a worst case approach, or a nested formulation from the beginning.

We think that an interesting question for further research is the following. Given a dynamic risk measure or an intertemporal optimization problem under uncertainty, can we identify a state or a new state such that time-consistency holds true with this new information setting? A first set of answers can be found in (Pflug & Pichler, 2012). We think that our analysis provides insight to look after the properties expected from such a state.

We show that we can construct new commuting one-step uncertainty aggregators either as linear combination of suprema or infima of one-step commuting aggregators.
