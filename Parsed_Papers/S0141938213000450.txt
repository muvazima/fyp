                  A series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ without or with alkali metal ions doping at a low sintering temperature were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The XRD pattern shows that all samples exhibit Zn3(BO3)2 crystalline phase. The samples co-doped with alkali metal ions have better crystallinity compared with the un-compensated ones. The different charge compensation approaches have no influence on the shape and position of the emission and excitation spectra. However, the luminescent intensity of samples has been obviously enhanced with different alkali metal ions co-doping. The introduction of Li+ can increase the red emission of Eu3+ compared with the others. Thus, the volume compensation and the equilibrium of mole number can be taken into consideration by charge compensated (CC) approaches.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well known that the dominant commercial routine for fabrication of white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) is the phosphor-converted LEDs (pc-LEDs) in which a single blue/NUV (near ultraviolet) LED chip is combined with multi-color phosphors. Yet the current populated phosphors, such as the red light emitting Y2O3:Eu3+ do not show an acceptable excitation respond in near UV (350–400nm) range [1]. Though this red phosphor is widely used in our daily life, it still has many disadvantages, for example, it is uneconomical because of the high price of the rare earth elements. Therefore, it is urgently to search a new red phosphor in low cost for near-UV InGaN-based WLEDs.

Nowadays, borate materials capture an increasing attention because of unique properties and specific features. For examples, among the borate compounds, zinc borates with different ratio of ZnO, B2O3 and H2O have attracted much attention because of their potential applications as fluorescent lamp phosphors due to their advantages, such as their low price, environmental friendliness, high thermal stability promote them into the application in fluorescent lamps. In the past decades, the spectroscopy of zinc borate doped with Eu3+, Pr3+ and Er3+ has been reported frequently [2–4]. Recently, taking the low sintering temperatures and good luminescence properties into consideration, many efforts have been devoted to studies of Zn3(BO3)2. The crystal structure of the materials is characterized by a monoclinic structure in which BO3-triangles share common vertices with the Zn4O-tetrahedra. Due to the intrinsically luminescent, Zn3(BO3)2 compounds show thermoluminescence and other optical properties [5,6], which makes it a promising candidate for numerous practical applications. Zou et al. [7] have studied the effect of Mn2+ ions on the photoluminescence characteristics of Eu3+-doped Zn3(BO3)2 nanoparticles.

However, the increment of emission intensity of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2 brought by the introduction of Mn2+ ions is still insufficient [7]. So, it is very urgent for us to enhance the red emission of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2. In this paper, we aim to prepare a series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ phosphors without or with alkali metal ions doping, and report their novel luminescence characteristics such as strong and stable visible-light emission. This observation is of great interest not only for understanding a number of fundamental physical phenomenon, but also for commercial applications in the field of the fluorescence lamps, display devices and so on. The optimum doping concentration of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2 was 8% according to our experiments. The discussion of the influence on the structure of Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ with alkali metal ions (A=Li, Na, K) doping will be also carried out.

                         (A=Li, Na, K). Then they were mixed evenly and milled thoroughly for 1h in agate mortar. The mixed powders were placed into corundum crucibles and calcined at 875°C for 4h in a muffle furnace in air. Eventually, after cooling down to room temperature naturally, a series of expected samples in the form of white powder were obtained. To distinguish from them, these samples are denoted as S0–S5 respectively in the following depiction.

The phase identification of the samples was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ
                        =1.5406Å) at 36kV tube voltage and 20mA tube current. The excitation and emission spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with 2.5nm slit width and 60nm per minute scanning rate under 400V. A Xe lamp with 360nm wavelength was utilized as an excitation source. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In order to determine the crystalline phase structure, the identification was carried out. Fig. 1
                         shows the XRD patterns of the samples. All the patterns are compared with the JCPDS standard values of the possible phases which have been marked using different symbols. JCPDS card No. 27-0983 is also listed for the purpose of comparison. As seen in Fig. 1, from S0 to S5, all the patterns of the samples are quite similar to each other and very consistent with the PDF#27-0983(Zn3(BO3)2). The results indicate that these phosphors are isotypic to the monoclinic Zn3(BO3)2.

It can be observed that the intensity of the main diffraction peaks is different from Fig. 1, implying different crystallization of the sample. As can be seen, the strongest diffraction peaks locates at 27.98°. The diffraction intensity of pure Zn3(BO3)2 is the strongest, indicating the most effective crystallization, presenting that it has the best crystallinity. According to the sequence of the diffraction intensity of S0>S3>S4>S5>S2>S1, the crystallization of S3, S4 and S5 is preceded by S0. This suggests that the incorporation of Li+, Na+ and K+ ions could be to some extend conducive to crystallization.

It is well known that the radii of involved ions can lead to the difference of crystallization among various samples. According to the studies on the effective radii of ions [8], we can learn the radii of all ions referred to this work as follows: R(Zn2+)=74pm, R(B3+)=21pm, R(Eu3+)=94.7pm, R(Li+)=59pm, R(Na+)=99pm, R(K+)=137pm. As the radius of B3+ is much smaller than those of the other ions, it is almost impossible for doped ions to substitute for B3+ ion in Zn3(BO3)2. Therefore, it is believed that all the doped ions replace Zn2+ in the host lattice. On the basis of Figs. 1 and 2
                        , S1 presents the poorest crystallization. For S1, introducing Eu3+ions into Zn3(BO3)2 host gives rise to not only charge but also volume imbalance of the crystal lattice. On the other hand, the crystallization of the sel-compensated S2 is better. A certain extent by decreasing the content of Zn2+ can solve charge imbalance, which has been demonstrated by experiments. In addition, it is common to introduce some defects in the crystal lattice for the substitution of two Eu3+ ions for three Zn2+ ions. Comparing S3, S4 and S5 to S0, it presents that the samples with alkali metal ions have better crystallization, because the three charge compensated (CC) approaches take the equilibrium of both charge and mole number into account. Among these approaches, the one co-doping Li+ presents the best effective compensation. As Li+ can easily enter into the host lattice to substitute for Zn2+, the introduction of Li+ can relief the volume imbalance to most extent.

When the doped ions occupy the Zn sites in the host, the smaller radii result in smaller crystal plane spacing d. According to the Bragg equation, 2dsin
                        θ
                        
                        =
                        
                        λ (where λ is the wavelength of employed X-ray, θ is the diffraction angle of the corresponding diffraction peak), we calculated d of (2,0,4) crystal planes and the results are listed in Table 1
                        . From this table, it can be seen that all doped ions make the crystal planes spacing change obviously.

In order to study the photoluminescence of the phosphors, the emission (λ
                           ex
                           =393nm) and excitation (λ
                           em
                           =592nm) spectra of the samples were measured and the results were shown in Figs. 3 and 4
                           
                           , respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, O2−–Eu3+ charge transfer band (CTB) from 200 to 300nm can be observed. Moreover, the excitation spectrum contains a series of sharp peaks in the range of 300–550nm, which belong to the intraconfigurational f–f transitions of Eu3+. The strongest excitation peak locates at 393nm which is good agreement with the emission used InGaN-based UV LEDs. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the major emission peaks locate at 592nm and 616nm, which are originated from the magnetic dipole (MD) transition (5D0–7F1) and the electric dipole (ED) transition (5D0–7F2) of Eu3+, respectively. Other emission peaks shown in Fig. 4 are relatively weak. Furthermore, it can be shown that the intensity of the peak at 592nm is stronger than that at 616nm. On the basis of the Judd-Ofeld theory [9], the ED transition 5D0

                           can be calculated to measure the symmetry of Eu3+ site. Obviously, the emission intensity of 5D0
                           →
                           7F1 transition is much higher than that of 5D0
                           →
                           7F2 transition, the value of ED/MD for Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ sample is 0.74. This suggests that Eu3+ ions mainly occupy the lattice site of centrosymmetric environment in the Zn3(BO3)2, a few occupy the other lattice. In addition, the emission spectra exhibit broadened bands. There are two main factors: (1) There exists various Eu3+ symmetry sites in the host with the replacement of Zn2+ ions by Eu3+ ions. (2) Due to the phonon and the crystal field, it can been seen that 7F
                              J
                            (J
                           =1,2) states were degenerated and split. The former is the most probable reason to explain it. Magnetic-dipole transitions within the 4f configuration are only-field splitting (relaxed by spin–orbit interaction) [10], owing to crystal-filed splitting for 7F1 level, the 5D0–7F1 transition produces three lines. The other splitting components of 5D0–7F2–4 of Eu3+ transitions can also be observed, but not totally resolved due to the limited experimental conditions.

It can be observed that in the excitation intensity of the phosphors changes effectively with different CC approaches from Fig. 5
                           . Compared with the excitation intensity of S1, the self-compensated S2 shows a higher intensity. Alkali metal ions compensated samples have the more significant influence on the excitation intensity at both 393nm and CTB. The sequence of the excitation intensity is S3>S4>S5>S2>S1. This order of their compensation effort is well consistent with crystallization mentioned above, implying the relationship between optical properties and crystallization of the phosphors.


                           Fig 6
                            shows the emission spectra of the phosphors without and with different CC approaches under an excitation at 393nm. It is shown that the shape and position of the emission spectra keep unchanged, whereas, the intensity exhibits obvious difference. The emission of Eu3+ in Zn3(BO3)2 can be strengthened by all CC approaches mentioned. The compensation effect of Li+ is the optimal followed by Na+, K+ and self-compensation. We also take the strongest emission peak at 592nm as a probe. From Table 2
                           , it can be clearly observed that self-compensated approach can enhance the emission intensity by 2.0 times and alkali metal ions compensated approaches by 3.3, 2.5 and 2.4 times, respectively.

Most lighting specification refers to color in terms of the 1931 CIE chromatic color coordinates which recognizes that the human visual system uses three primary colors: red, green and blue [11,12]. In general, the color of any light source can be represented on the (x, y) coordinate in this color space. The chromatic coordinates (x, y), was calculated using the color calculator program radiant imaging [13]. The location of the color coordinates of the zinc borates powder on the CIE chromaticity diagram presented in Fig. 7
                         indicates that all the samples can emit orange red light under excitation at 393nm. The color purity was compared to the 1931 CIE Standard Source C (illuminant Cs
                         (0.3101, 0.3162)). The dominant wavelength is defined as the single monochromatic wavelength that appears to have the same color as the light source. The color purity is weighed average of the (x, y) coordinates relative to the coordinates of the illuminates and dominant wavelength. The form of the equation is as follows:

                        [14]. The chromatic coordinates, dominant wavelength and color purity for each phosphor were determined from the spectra in Fig. 4 and they are listed in Table 2.

It is obvious that the color purity of samples gets better with the increment of red emission intensity from Fig. 7b and Table 2. The co-doping Li+ sample (S3) has the best chromatic properties. Consequently, it is obvious that alkali metals doping can not only enhance the red emission of Eu3+ ions but also improve the color purity of the luminescence of phosphors.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In the analysis of photoluminescence we find that one Eu3+ is expected to substitute for one Zn2+ in the uncompensated S1, which will introduce a excess positive charge. Increasing the substitution content of Eu3+ for Zn2+, some Eu3+ ions may accumulate at the boundary of the host lattice. The luminescence can be quenched by the energy migration among identical Eu3+. Therefore, the luminescent property of uncompensated sample is the smallest one. In the self-compensated phosphor of S2, it is in favor of Eu3+ to come into crystal lattice with the charge imbalance relieving. Thus it presents stronger luminescence performance than S1. Supposed the substitution of two Eu3+ for three Zn2+ occurs, it must introduce some defects in the crystal lattice.

The alkali metal ions co-doping can not only solve the problem of charge imbalance more effectively but also maintain the equilibrium of mole number. Therefore, the samples with the alkali metal ions doped have better crystallinity and luminescence performance than the self-compensated sample. The sample with Li+ ion doping has better luminescent property than the others. Thus the relative fluorescence intensity of co-doped sample is remarkably increased, which is a key factor for the practical application. Besides, Li+ compensated sample presents a best crystallization except for controlling sample Zn3(BO3)2. This is due to the similar radius of Li+ and Zn2+, indicating the most effective occupation of Li+ in Zn2+ sites.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In summary, a series of the Zn3(BO3)2:Eu3+ phosphors with alkali metal ions doping were prepared via traditional solid-state reaction. According to the XRD analysis, all the prepared samples can be indexed to pure phase. The samples co-doped with alkali metal ions have better crystallization than the one with sole Eu3+ doping. The different charge compensation approaches have no influence on the shape and position of the emission and excitation spectra, yet the luminescent intensity of samples has been obviously enhanced with different alkali metal ions co-doping. The introduction of Li+ can increase the red emission of Eu3+ compared with the others. Thus, the volume compensation and the equilibrium of mole number play an important role on the enhanced intensity.
