                  Agents are connected each other through a tree. Each link of the tree has an associated cost and the total cost of the tree must be divided among the agents. In this paper we assume that agents are asymmetric (think on countries that use aqueducts to bring water from the rainy regions to the dry regions, for example). We suppose that each agent is entitled with a production and demand of a good that can be sent through the tree. This heterogeneity implies that the links are not equally important for all the agents. In this work we propose, and characterize axiomatically, two rules for sharing the cost of the tree when asymmetries apply.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The study on the structure of service networks (such as power grids, gas pipelines, telecommunications or transportation infrastructures) has become more and more important. Those networks are costly (some times that cost is the amount to pay for its construction, and some other times it refers to the needed money for its maintenance). Quite often the structure of the network is a tree, because it allows to have all agents connected in the cheapest way. The problem of allocation the cost of a network, and particularly of a tree, has been widely studied in the literature.

Let us consider the simplest problem we may define, that is, two agents with a link connecting them. To divide the cost of the link equally between the two extremes, is a quite reasonable outcome when there is no more information and agents are assumed to be homogeneous. However, there are many cases where that homogeneity does not apply, and the link is much more important for one of the agents than for the other. The electrical interconnection between France and Spain is a quite illustrative example of this situation. These two countries decided to communicate their national power grid with a link crossing the Pyrenees. The cost of this connection has to be split between both countries, taking into account that Spain will obtain more beneficial than France from the construction of the link. This is because France produces enough electricity to cover, in case of failure in Spain, both its own demand and the Spanish one. The question then arises: How should the cost of the new connection be distributed between France and Spain considering all the elements? Similar questions emerge in the construction of the gas pipelines between Europe and Africa or Russia and Germany. Another situation that reflects this asymmetry is the network of aqueducts and pipelines that bring water from the rainy regions to the arid areas. The first ones use to have enough water to cover its demand and to even send the surplus to where it is needed, whereas the arid regions hardly have enough resource to fulfilled its own demand. Until which point is fair to oblige to the rainy areas to contribute to the cost of the pipelines? This paper deals with these situations, where the agents in the tree are asymmetric. This asymmetry will be induced by different demand and production for different agents.

In its general formulation, we consider a set of agents, each of them able to produce and demand a service like water. All agents are connected to each other forming a tree. Through this tree agents can send and receive water (or any other good). Hence, if the production of one agent fails, its demand can still be satisfied by obtaining the water from another agent. This can be obviously done only if the production of the other agent is high enough to compensate the failure. We assume that the tree is given and that each link of the tree has an associated cost that should be paid by the agents. This cost could be interpreted as a construction cost, maintenance cost (the tree already exists there but there are recurring maintenance costs, otherwise cannot be operative) or usage cost (the tree is there but we must pay a cost for using it). To sum up, a problem has five elements: a set of agents, a tree that describes the communication structure, a cost function that sets the cost of each link, a vector of demands (one demand for each agent), and a vector of productions (one production for each agent). A rule is a mechanism to distribute the cost of the tree among the agents.

Our paper belongs to literature on the axiomatic analysis of cost allocation rules. Some papers of this literature focus on general problems like Moulin and Shenker (1992), Sprumont (1998), and Tijs and Driessen (1986). Other papers study some particular situations associated with networks, like Estevez-Fernandez (2012), Moulin and Laigret (2011), Norde, Fragnelli, Garcia-Jurado, Patrone, and Tijs (2002). Other papers focus on situations associated with a tree, like Bird (1976), Bogomolnaia, Holzman, and Moulin (2010), Littlechild and Owen (1973), and Ni and Wang (2007).

The particular case of trees has been a focal point (mostly because it is the most efficient way to communicate all the agents, regardless other aspects like flows and capacities). In the so-called minimum cost spanning problem several agents (nodes) need a good (water, for example) which can only be provided by a special node called the source (a water tank, for example). Thus, agents have to be connected to the source. Bird (1976), probably the seminal paper on this field, studies how to share the cost of a given tree among its nodes. Several papers came after in this field, proposing new solutions and analyzing the properties such solutions may satisfy. We can mention, for instance, the papers of Kar (2002), Dutta and Kar (2004), Tijs, Branzei, Moretti, and Norde (2006), Bergantiños and Vidal-Puga (2007, 2010), Bergantiños and Lorenzo-Freire (2008), Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2010), Bergantiños, Lorenzo, and Lorenzo-Freire (2011), Hougaard and Tvede (2012) and Trudeau (2012). In a parallel way other papers propose rules in problems arising from extensions of the minimum cost spanning tree problem. For instance, Fernandez, Hinojosa, and Puerto (2004) study multicriteria cost spanning tree games; Bergantiños and Gómez-Rúa (2010) study situations where agents are grouped; Dutta and Mishra (2012) study situations where costs are asymmetric; and Bergantiños, Gómez-Rúa, Llorca, Pulido, and Sánchez-Soriano (2012, 2014) study situations where the computation of the optimal tree is NP hard. In this paper we consider situations where each node can provide the service. Thus each node has a demand and a capacity production. As far as we are aware no other work has studied the problem presented in this paper. A real example captured by our model, but not by the previous ones, is the transfer of water from Tagus river to Segura river in Spain.

Our paper belongs to literature on the axiomatic analysis of cost allocation rules in networks. See Sharkey (1995) and Thomson (2001) for two surveys of this literature. In the axiomatic method, rules are justified in terms of the axioms they fulfill. In general, suitable combinations of desirable axioms are used to differentiate among rules. Thus, we introduce a collection of axioms that are adequate for the framework we study.

The first group of axioms are: Fairness for two agents says that, when there are only two agents and one link between them, the cost of the connection is paid by the agent that gets profit from its existence. Symmetry states that symmetric agents should pay the same. Independence reallocation requires that if the cost of connecting two individuals is zero, both cannot benefit from reallocating productions and demands between themselves. Network-cost independence of extra costs refers to how to allocate punctual increments of the cost of a single link. Our first result identifies the rule that satisfies these four axioms. We call it the equal division across components rule, which works as follows. For each link l, if we remove l from the tree we have two connected components. The cost of l is divided among the components following the idea of fairness for two agents, but applied to each component. We compute the aggregate production and demand of both components. If the link is profitable for only one component, then this component pays the cost. If the link is profitable for both or nobody, then each component pays half of the cost. Once this is done, the payment of each component is equally allocated among the agents belonging to it. We apply the same reasoning to all the links of the tree and the contribution of an agent is the sum of his contributions in the removal of all links.

The second group of axioms we propose is the following. Cost additivity simply says that the rule is additive with respect to the cost function. Stand alone core states that the rule must select allocation within the core (whenever the core is not empty). An agent is safe in a tree when, in case of failure of his production, the other agents can fulfill its demand. After the removal of a link in the tree, the safe status of an agent may change. Balanced contributions with respect to the safe status requires that if the cost of a link increases, all agents with the same status with respect to such a link should be affected in the same way. In our second result we characterize the rule that fulfills the three previous properties. We call it the equal safety rule. This rule also specifies how to divide the cost of each single link. Now, the cost of a link is equally split among all the agents for whom such a link is necessary for their safety. If some link is not necessary for any agent then, the cost of the link is equally divided among all the agents. Again, the contribution of an agent is the sum of his contributions to all links of the tree.

We apply both rules to the design of a tariff system for the water transferred from Tagus river to Segura river in Spain. Even both rules are different, in this particular case coincide.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the model and the elements of the problem. In Section 3 we introduce the axioms we use in the rest of the paper. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the characterizations we aforementioned. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

                      denote the set of all problems.

The following situation is proposed. A set of agents have a demand for a good, for example water, given by d. They also have a capacity production given by p. In general, agents have enough capacity for producing all their own demand. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, it could happen that there is not enough production to cover its demand (for instance the production fails). When this happens, agents can receive water from other agents through t. Thus, we can think on t as a network that allows agents to obtain water when their production fails. But t has associated a cost (construction, maintenance, use, etc.) which should be paid by agents.

R1 means that the cost of t should be paid by all agents.

R2 means that there are no externalities among different connected components, that is, the amount that each agent has to pay depends only on the situation inside the connected component 
                        
                           N

                      to which the agent belongs to.

By R2 we can restrict to problems

                      where t is a tree.

Now, we present some examples of rules. The first one, the half–half rule, simply says that the cost of each link is equally split between agents on its extremes.

                     The following two rules divide the cost proportionally either by demand or by production, with the proviso that, when we consider the demand, agents who demand more also contribute more, while when we consider the production, agents who produce more contribute less.

                           . In case of failure of the production of agent 1, the production of agent 2 is enough to cover the demand of both 1 and 2. On the contrary, if the production of agent 2 fails, the production of agent 1 is not enough to cover the demand of agent 2 (assuming that agent 1 has to cover his demand). Thus, it seems reasonable that only agent 1 pays the cost of the link. According to the previous rules, the cost is distributed as follows:

                           In all the three rules, agent 2 has to contribute to the construction of the link; however, this agent gets no profit from the existence of the connection. Later on we will introduce two rules that avoid this shortcoming.

We end this section by presenting a real situation that could be modeled as one of our problems.
                        Example 2.2
                        In Spain there are some canals for transferring water from rainy areas to arid areas. We focus in the Tagus–Segura transfer. The information used in this example was obtained through the web page of “Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentación y Medio Ambiente”, http://www.chsegura.es/chs_en/cuenca/resumendedatosbasicos/recursoshidricos/trasvaseTajoSegura.html which is the office of the Government of Spain devoted to this issue.

Typically, the Tagus is a river with many water, which means that the people living around this river have all the water they need. Nevertheless, Jucar and Segura rivers, typically, have not enough water for covering the needs of peel living around them. Thus, the government of Spain constructed some canals for transferring water from Tagus to Jucar and Segura (it is called aqueduct). The government also constructed canals for transferring water from Jucar to some areas and from Segura to some other areas (they are called distribution canals). Let us explain how the system works. The source is Bolarque reservoir, located in Tagus river. From this reservoir the water is pumped to the Alarcón reservoir located in the Jucar river through the aqueduct. From Alarcón Reservoir the water flows in three ways. First, through Jucar rivers until the customers. Secondly, through a distribution canal until some other customers. Third, it is pumped through the aqueduct until Talave reservoir, in the Segura river basin. From Talave reservoir the water flows in three ways. First, through Segura rivers until the customers. Secondly, through the south distribution canal until some other customers. Third, through the north distribution canal until some other customers. Notice that the way in which the water flows from Bolarque reservoir until the customer can be modeled as a tree.

According with the Spanish regulation the tariffs for using the water that comes from Tagus river must consider the construction costs of the aqueduct and the distribution canals and the maintenance costs of such infrastructures. This part of the tariff is decided by the government. The last update was in March 7th, 2012. The government propose several kind of tariffs, depending on the canals needed for providing the service to the users. For each one of these tariffs, it is also considered if the water is used for domestic use or for irrigation.

We model this situation as

With 3 we represent the set of customers obtaining the water directly from the Jucar river basin after Alarcón reservoir. With 4 we represent the set of customers obtaining water from the distribution canal starting at Alarcó n reservoir. 5 will be the Talave reservoir, namely, the customers obtaining water directly from this reservoir. With 6 we represent the set of customers obtaining water from the south distribution canal starting at Talave reservoir. With 7 we represent the set of customers obtaining the water directly from Segura river basin after Talave reservoir. The north distribution canal is relatively long. Thus we have divided it in two parts. With 8 we represent the set of costumers obtaining water form the north distribution canal between Talave reservoir and Pedrera reservoir. With 9 we represent the set of costumers obtaining water from the north distribution canal between Pedrera reservoir and the end of the canal (see Fig. 1
                                    ).

                            says how to divide the cost of the tree among the different nodes. In our case how to divide the construction and the maintenance cost of the transfer infrastructures among the nodes. Since each node represents a set of customers, the cost assigned to each node should be divided among their customers. A reasonable way for doing it is that each customer l associated to node i should pay in proportion to the water he consumes, namely customer l will pay

In this section we introduce several properties that rules may satisfy. Most of them will be used later in the axiomatic characterizations.

The first property refers to a very simple situation. Suppose that there are only two agents and one link between them. Assume that the link is only profitable for one agent, then this agent pays the whole cost of the link. If the link is profitable for both or neither (recall that we are assuming that t is given), the cost of the link is equally divided between both agents.

                           The definition of fairness for two agents is given under the assumption that agents produce enough good (namely

                              ) and they will receive the good only when their production fails. We can give this definition assuming that agents can produce less than their demand and receive the good from agents producing more than their demand. In this case the property of fairness for two agents should be rewritten as

                        In our model agents produce and demand a good. They can send and receive the good through the tree t. Thus we can consider that agents i and j are symmetric if both have the same production, both have the same demand, and for any other agent k the cost of sending (or receiving) the good from i to k is the same as from j to k. Symmetry simply says that symmetric agents should pay the same.

Formally, we say that i and j are symmetric if three conditions hold:

The removal of link l from the tree t may change the safety of some agents. Those agents can be classified into two categories: agents whose status changes and agents whose status does not. The first category is formed by the agents that are safe in t but not in 
                           
                              t
                              ⧹
                              l
                           
                        . Thus, the first category contains agents that need link l. The second category is formed by agents that are safe in t and in 
                           
                              t
                              ⧹
                              l
                           
                        , as well as the agents that are not safe in t (which also remain not safe in 
                           
                              t
                              ⧹
                              l
                           
                        ). Thus, the second category contains the agents that do not need link l, because they continue to be safe after removing it or because they are never safe. The next property says that if the cost of link l increases, all agents needing link l should be affected in the same way, and all agents that do not need link l should be affected also in the same way.

The next property requires that, when the core is non-empty, the rule selects an allocation within it.

The non-emptiness of the core is related to the existence of irrelevant links. Given a problem a and a link

                        , assume that the set of safe agents is the same in a as in 
                           
                              a

                         (namely 
                           
                              S

                              a

                              l
                              )
                           
                        ). Thus, we can consider that link l is irrelevant because deleting l no agent is damaged. Next proposition states that the core is non-empty if and only if the cost of all irrelevant links is cero.

Finally, we introduce three monotonicity properties: over the cost, the production, and the demand.

Cost monotonicity says that if the cost of some link increases, no agent can pay less.

Notice that the link 12 divides the tree into two components. As a first step, we collapse each component in a virtual node, whose demand and production are the sum of the demands and productions of the agents that it contains.


                           
                              
                                 
                              
                           
                        

As result, we get a simple tree with only two nodes and one link. Now, in application of fairness for two agents,

More generally, the EC rule is based on the following reasoning (which we formally state below). For a problem 
                        
                           a
                           =
                           (
                           N
                           ,
                           t
                           ,
                           c
                           ,
                           p
                           ,
                           d
                           )
                        
                      let us consider a link 
                        
                           l
                           ∈
                           L
                           (
                           t
                           )
                        
                     . Since t is a tree, l divides the tree in two connected components. The cost of 
                        
                           l
                           ,
                           c
                           (
                           l
                           )
                        
                     , is divided among the components following the idea of fairness for two agents, but applied to each component. We compute the aggregate production and demand of both components. If the link is profitable for only one component, then this component pays the cost. If the link is profitable for both or nobody, then each component pays half of the cost. Once this is done, the payment of each component is equally allocated among the agents belonging to it. We apply the same reasoning to all the links and the contribution of an agent is the sum of his contributions in the removal of all possible links.

In the proposition below we examine which properties the EC rule fulfills.
                           Proposition 4.1
                           
                              The EC rule satisfies fairness for two agents, network-cost independence of extra costs, symmetry, independence reallocation, cost additivity, cost monotonicity, production monotonicity, and demand monotonicity. The EC rule does not satisfy stand alone core and balanced contributions with respect to the safe status.
                           

The EC rule satisfies fairness for two agents. It is obvious from the definition.

The EC rule satisfies network-cost independence of extra cost. Let t be a tree such that

The next result gives a characterization of the EC rule.
                           Theorem 4.1
                           
                              EC is the unique rule satisfying fairness for two agents, network-cost independence of extra costs, symmetry, and independence reallocation.
                           

By Proposition 4.1 we know that the EC rule satisfies these properties. We now prove the uniqueness.

Notice that the proof of the result has a constructive structure, which has several advantages. Firstly, it helps to understand the effect of each single property. Secondly, it illustrates the family of rules that would emerge if we get rid of some of the properties.

As the following collection of rules shows, the properties in Theorem 4.1 are independent.

Firstly we should note that this example corresponds to the situation described in Remark 3.1. Remember that all nodes have less water than they need but node 1 who can produce enough water for fulfill the extra needs of the other nodes. Let

                               is equally split divided among the nodes that need the link ij to be connected to node 1 (Bolarque). Hence, node 1 pays nothing, which seems reasonable. Next table shows the allotment of the cost of each link among the nodes (we avoid 23 and 57 because they are rivers and the costs are zero).

We now introduce a new rule, called the equal safety rule (ES rule, for short). Our main result is a characterization of this rule in terms of stand alone core, balanced contributions with respect to safe status, and cost additivity.

Similarly to the solution we presented in the previous section, the equal safety rule, is based on deciding which is the contribution of each agent to every single link. More specifically, the cost of a link is equally split among all the agents for whom such a link is crucial for their safety. Consider link 12 in Example 4.2. We first note that all agents are safe in t. What happens if we remove link 12? Agent 1 is not safe anymore because he will be isolated from the other agents. Agent 2 is still safe because if his production fails, then he can obtain the good from agent 4 through the link 24. Agent 3 is still safe because if his production fails, then he can obtain the good from agent 2 through the link 23. Agent 4 is still safe because if his production fails, he can obtain the good from agent 2 through the link 24. Thus, the cost of link 12 is paid only by agent 1.

                      keep their status before and after the removal of l. In this case the cost of link l is divided equally among agents in 
                        
                           
                              
                                 N

                     . Eventually, there may exist some link l that is not necessary for any agent 
                        
                           (

                                 l
                              
                           
                           (
                           a
                           )
                           =
                           ∅
                           )
                        
                     . However, even in this case, the link has to be paid. In those circumstances, the cost of l is equally divided among all the agents.

Now, we introduce the equal safety rule formally. For each link

In the proposition below we examine which properties the

                              rule satisfies fairness for two agents, symmetry, cost additivity, balanced contributions with respect to the safe status, stand alone core, and cost monotonicity.
                           


                              The ES rule does not satisfy network cost independence of extra costs, independence reallocation, production monotonicity, and demand monotonicity.

The next theorem provides a characterization of the ES rule.
                           Theorem 5.1
                           
                              ES is the unique rule satisfying cost additivity, balanced contributions with respect to the safe status, and stand alone core.

                              . Now it is obvious that, in this particular case, the ES and EC rules coincide.

Unfortunately, we cannot compare directly the tariffs obtained with our rules with the ones proposed by the government because for applying our rules we need to know some information which is not available. Nevertheless we can say something. In both tariffs people from Tagus pays nothing and the more infrastructures you need for obtaining water, the more you pay. The main difference is that the government tariffs only considered two cases for costumers located after Talave reservoir: the one who use the south distribution canal and the ones who use the north distribution canal. Our tariffs will consider more cases because we have considered it explicitly when we define the problem.

There are other rules that can be applied to divide the cost among agents. A quite natural rule is the Shapley value of the game 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    v
                                 
                                 
                                    a
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The study of this rule is out of scope of this paper. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy to mention that the Shapley rule is different to the two rules studied in this paper, shown by the following example.

We can also compare the Shapley value with the equal rules we define by mean of the properties they fulfill. In this sense, the Shapley value satisfies fairness for two agents and symmetry; but it violates network-cost independence of extra costs, independence reallocation, cost additivity, balanced contributions with respect to the safe status, and stand alone core.

In this paper we study how to allocate the cost of a tree where agents are heterogenous. The heterogeneity emerges as a consequence of the different levels of production and consumption of a good. The model we propose has five elements, a set of agents, a tree that represents the possibilities of communication among the agents, a cost function, and the production and demand of each agent. The goal is to determine how to divide the overall cost of the tree among the agents taking into account all the elements of the problem. As far as we know, existing literature has focused on situations that involve only the first three ingredients, without using the information on production and demand to discriminate among agents. For example, what it may be considered as “fair” in the traditional setting, it may not necessarily be in our framework. This idea is very well captured by the property of fairness for two agents (which is satisfied by the two rules we present in the paper).

We introduce a collection of properties which we believe may result suitable to solve the problem of allotting the cost. Some of them are quite standard and can be easily applied to the traditional framework (without demand/production). For instance, this is the case of cost additivity. Others however, are more specifically applied to our setting. We show that two combinations of these properties characterize the corresponding two rules: the equal division across components rule and the equal safety rule. Both are based on a process that divide the cost of each single link (each rule using different criteria), and the final contribution is the sum of the contributions of each link. The two rules we define clearly differ both in their nature and the properties they satisfy.

For this work we have focused on trees, as a particular case of networks. The existing literature (see the wide list of papers mentioned in the Introduction) shows trees, unlike other structures like cycles, lines or hubs, deserve a special analysis. We should mention that the extension of our analysis to more general networks is far from being straightforward. For example, the equal across components rule exploits the fact any link in a tree divides the tree into to components, which is not true for general networks. From a practical point of view there are real situations that could be modeled as a tree. In this paper we have considered the tariff system for the water transfer from Tagus river to Segura river in Spain.
