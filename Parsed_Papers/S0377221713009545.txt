                  This paper aims at resolving a major obstacle to practical usage of time-consistent risk-averse decision models. The recursive objective function, generally used to ensure time consistency, is complex and has no clear/direct interpretation. Practitioners rather choose a simpler and more intuitive formulation, even though it may lead to a time inconsistent policy. Based on rigorous mathematical foundations, we impel practical usage of time consistent models as we provide practitioners with an intuitive economic interpretation for the referred recursive objective function. We also discourage time-inconsistent models by arguing that the associated policies are sub-optimal. We developed a new methodology to compute the sub-optimality gap associated with a time-inconsistent policy, providing practitioners with an objective method to quantify practical consequences of time inconsistency. Our results hold for a quite general class of problems and we choose, without loss of generality, a CVaR-based portfolio selection application to illustrate the developed concepts.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dynamic decisions under uncertainty are very common in financial planning and financial engineering problems. Based on Bellman’s equations and on the well behaved properties of the risk neutral formulation, several models have been developed for different applications such as portfolio selection, asset and liability management, scheduling and energy planning. Indeed, some important works, for instance Pereira and Pinto (1991), Rockafellar and Wets (1991), Guigues and Römisch (2012a, 2012b), Philpott and de Matos (2012), Philpott, de Matos, and Finardi (2013), developed efficient algorithms to solve these problems. However, in order to have a risk aversion extension, such as in Ruszczyński (2010), Shapiro (2011), Shapiro, Tekaya, da Costa, and Soares (2013), one should choose carefully how to introduce the well known risk measures into these problems.

In this context, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) became one of the most widely used risk measures for three reasons: first, it is a coherent risk measure (see Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath (1999)); second, it has a clear and suitable economic interpretation (see Rockafellar & Uryasev (2000) and Street (2009)); and last, but not least, it can be written as a linear stochastic programming model as shown in Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000). For these three reasons, the CVaR has been applied to static (see e.g. Krokhmal, Palmquist, & Uryasev (2002), Mansini, Ogryczak, & Speranza (2007), Sawik (2012) among many others in the context of portfolio optimization) and even to dynamic models. However, to choose a coherent risk measure as the objective function of a dynamic model is not a sufficient condition to obtain suitable optimal policies. In the recent literature, time consistency is shown to be one basic requirement to get suitable optimal decisions, in particular for multistage stochastic programming models. Papers on time consistency are actually divided in two different approaches: the first one focuses on risk measures and the second one on optimal policies.

The first approach states that, in a dynamic setting, if some random payoff A is always riskier than a payoff B conditioned to a given time 
                        
                           t
                           +
                           1
                        
                     , than A should be riskier than B conditioned to t. It is well known that this property is achieved using a recursive setting leading to so called time consistent dynamic risk measures proposed by various authors, e.g., Bion-Nadal (2008), Detlefsen and Scandolo (2005), Riedel (2004), Cheridito, Delbaen, and Kupper (2006), Roorda and Schumacher (2007), Kovacevic and Pflug (2009). Other weaker definitions, like acceptance and rejection consistency, are also developed in these works (see Cheridito et al. (2006), Kovacevic & Pflug (2009) for details).

The second approach, formally defined by Shapiro (2009), is on time consistency of optimal policies in multistage stochastic programming models. The interpretation of this property given by the author is the following: “at every state of the system, our optimal decisions should not depend on scenarios which we already know cannot happen in the future”. This interpretation is an indirect consequence of solving a sequence of problems whose objective functions can be written recursively as the former cited time consistent dynamic risk measures. It is shown in Shapiro (2009) for instance that if, for every state of the system, we want to minimize the CVaR of a given quantity at the end of the planning horizon, we would obtain a time inconsistent optimal policy. Indeed, this sequence of problems does not have recursive objective functions and the optimal decisions at particular future states might depend on scenarios that “we already know cannot happen in the future”. However, if for 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        
                      we want to minimize the CVaR of a given quantity at the end of the planning horizon and for 
                        
                           t
                           >
                           0
                        
                      we actually follow the dynamic equations of the first stage problem, then we obtain a time consistent optimal policy even though it depends on those scenarios we already know cannot happen. On the other hand, one can argue that this policy is not reasonable because for 
                        
                           t
                           >
                           0
                        
                      the objective function does not make any sense economically speaking.

In this paper, we use a conceptual definition for time consistency of optimal policies: a policy is time consistent if and only if the future planned decisions are actually going to be implemented. In the literature, time inconsistent optimal policies have been commonly proposed, in particular Bäuerle and Mundt (2009) in Sections 3 and 4.1 and Fábián and Veszprémi (2008) have developed portfolio selection models using CVaR in a time inconsistent way. In our work, we show with a numerical example that a time inconsistent CVaR based portfolio selection model can lead to a suboptimal sequence of implemented decisions and may not take risk aversion into account at some intermediate states of the system. Then, we propose a methodology to compute the sub-optimality gap as the difference of the objective function evaluated with two different policies: the one planned at our current stage and the one actually implemented in the future. We use the time consistent risk-averse dynamic stochastic programming model with a recursive objective function and compare its optimal policy to the time inconsistent one. Other alternatives have been proposed by Boda and Filar (2006) and Cuoco, He, and Issaenko (2008), however none of them used the recursive set up of time consistent dynamic risk measures.

Since the lack of a suitable economic interpretation for this recursive set up is one of the main reasons why it is not commonly used, we prove for a more general set of problems that this objective function is the certainty equivalent w.r.t. the time consistent dynamic utility defined as the composed form of one period preference functionals. Then, with a clear economic interpretation for the objective function of a general set of problems and consequently of the portfolio selection application, we discuss the developed results with a numerical example.

This paper aims at closing a conceptual gap between theory and practice regarding time-consistent risk-averse policies in a stochastic programming framework. The first contribution of this work is an intuitive economic interpretation for the complex time-consistent recursive objective function. Based on rigorous proofs provided in the paper, the proposed economic interpretation is entirely new in the dynamic risk-averse stochastic programming context. Additionally, we discourage time-inconsistent models by arguing that the associated policies are sub-optimal. Thus, the second contribution is the development of a new methodology to compute the sub-optimality gap associated with a time-inconsistent policy, providing practitioners with an objective method to quantify practical consequences of time inconsistency. Our results hold for a quite general class of problems and we choose, without loss of generality, a CVaR-based portfolio selection application to illustrate the developed concepts. Numerical results presented in the paper aim at reinforcing intuition and interpretation of the reader regarding theoretical results.

The major reason for developing dynamic (multistage) models instead of static (two-stage) ones is the fact that we can incorporate the flexibility of dynamic decisions to improve our objective function. In other words, the possibility of changing a policy after the realization of some random variables increases the objective function (for a maximization problem) and allows the first stage decisions to be less conservative than their counterpart in the static case. However, it does not make any sense to incorporate this flexibility if the intermediate decisions are not actually going to be implemented.

In this context, we based our findings on the following definition of time consistency: an optimal policy is time consistent if and only if the future planned decisions are actually going to be implemented. Only under this property we guarantee that the flexibility and optimality of a dynamic policy will not be polluted by any spurious future planned decisions. Thus, the first stage decisions of a time inconsistent policy are in general suboptimal considering that this policy would not be followed in the future.

In a multistage stochastic programming context, a policy is a sequence of decisions for each stage and for each scenario (a realization of the uncertainty). As in Shapiro (2009), one has to define which (multistage) optimization problem should be solved when the current time is a particular stage 
                        
                           t
                           ∈
                           H
                        
                      of the planning horizon. When the current time is 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           0
                        
                     , we solve the corresponding optimization problem and obtain the first stage optimal decision and the future planned optimal policy. This policy is time consistent if and only if these future planned decisions for each scenario are also optimal for each problem when the current time is 
                        
                           t
                           >
                           0
                        
                     .

In order to motivate this discussion, we develop a CVaR-based portfolio selection model which incorporates the well known mean-risk trade-off presented by Markowitz (1952). As a coherent risk measure, the CVaR should be a suitable way to assess risk, however we want to point out the fact that if one chooses a dynamic model, time consistency should also be take into account. Assessing risk in a time inconsistent way may lead to a time inconsistent policy and therefore to a suboptimal sequence of implemented decisions.

In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we compare a time inconsistent formulation to the recursive time consistent alternative developed for a CVaR-based portfolio selection problem. Numerical results are presented to reinforce intuition and interpretation of the reader. For sake of simplicity, we consider a small instance with three stages and two assets where the solution is obtained with standard linear programming techniques. In Section 2.3, we propose a new way of computing the sub-optimality gap induced by an inconsistent policy. We then perform in Section 2.3 a sensitivity analysis of the sub-optimality gap by varying planning horizon T and risk aversion level 
                        
                           λ
                        
                      for the same portfolio selection problem proposed in Section 2.1.

The portfolio selection problem is normally formulated to consider the mean-risk trade-off. Some models use the expected value as the objective function with a risk constraint while others minimize risk with a constraint on the expected value. In this paper, we follow the well known approach to combine these two methods by defining our objective function as a convex combination of the expected value and the acceptability measure previously stated. In other words, the investor wants to maximize its expected return and also minimize risk, given his current state. It is very important to note that the planning horizon is a fixed date in the future and, depending on the investor’s current state, he/she solves a different optimization problem.

                        .This example points out that a time inconsistent policy may lead to a sequence of optimal decisions where a risk-averse decision maker shows a risk neutral preference at some intermediate state. In other words, risk aversion may not be taken into account at some intermediate states of the system. Therefore, we propose a time consistent alternative that has significant advantages over the time inconsistent one since it incorporates the flexibility of a dynamic decision model ensuring that the future planned decisions are actually going to be implemented.

In this section, we propose an alternative to the previous time inconsistent policy. We base our formulation on Ruszczyński and Shapiro (2006) and develop dynamic equations. For

For comparison purposes, we solve this model for the numerical example proposed in Section 2.1. To do so, we use the result shown in Blomvall and Shapiro (2006) that, for stage-wise independent returns such problem has a myopic optimal policy which is obtained as the solution of the following two-stage problem for

The optimal policy is always to invest the total wealth in the risk free asset. Note that this strategy is more conservative compared to the time inconsistent one, because it takes risk into account at every state of the system. Since this difference may lead to a sub-optimal solution for the time inconsistent problem, we develop in the following section a systematic way of measuring this effect on the objective function.

In Section 2.1, we presented a time inconsistent example where planned and implemented policies are different. However, what we do want to know is how a time inconsistent policy impacts our objective function. The way of measuring it is computing the sub-optimality gap that concerns the disparity of the objective function we expect to obtain with our planned policy, denoted by

                        , we observe that the sub-optimality gap increases with the planning horizon until it stabilizes around a certain value. Nonetheless the gap for a smaller

                         stabilizes at a higher gap value.

To sum up, for the most aggressive and the most conservative allocation strategies, time inconsistency would not be a problem. On the other hand, for 
                           
                              0

                        , time consistency do matter and can have a significant impact on the objective function. For this reason, we reassure the importance of time consistency which can be achieved by the recursive formulation illustrated in Section 2.2. The major problem of utilizing this formulation in practice is the difficulty to economically interpret it. Therefore, we develop a suitable economic interpretation for this recursive objective function based on the certainty equivalent of the related preference function.

When choosing the proposed recursive set up, the problem is usually the lack of a suitable economic interpretation of the objective function. How can a investor choose a policy if he/she does not know what is actually going to be optimized? For this reason, we prove that the objective function is the certainty equivalent w.r.t. the time consistent dynamic utility generated by one period preference functionals.

The objective function of the proposed model at t is the certainty equivalent w.r.t. the time consistent dynamic utility function generated by the one period preference functional of the investor. This recursive formulation ensures time consistent optimal policies and it is also motivated by Corollary 4. The objective at

This paper contributes on closing the gap between theory and practice regarding time consistency and stochastic programming. It motivates and resolves one of the main conceptual issues regarding practical usage of time consistent risk-averse dynamic stochastic programming models: The complex objective function given by the recursive formulation that ensures time consistency has no clear/direct interpretation. Practitioners resist on using time consistent models because they have no intuition about what is being optimized. They rather choose a simpler and more intuitive formulation, even though it may lead to a time inconsistent and, consequently, sub-optimal policy. Therefore, we developed an intuitive economic interpretation for the complex time-consistent recursive formulation as well as a new methodology to compute the sub-optimality gap of a time inconsistent policy. Our results hold for a quite general class of problems and we choose, with loss of generality, a portfolio selection application to illustrate the developed concepts. Numerical results presented in this paper aims at reinforcing intuition and interpretation of the reader regarding our theoretical results.

We prove that the recursive objective function is the certainty equivalent with respect to the time consistent dynamic utility function. We also prove that this objective is the composed form of certainty equivalents with respect to one-period preference functionals. This result gives us the intuition that at stage t the agent is maximizing the certainty equivalent with respect to his/her one-period preference functional.

Moreover, we consider the conceptual definition: a policy is time consistent if and only if the future planned decisions are actually going to be implemented. Based on that, we discouraged time-inconsistent models by arguing that the associated first-stage decision is, in general, sub-optimal. With the purpose of providing practitioners with an objective way to quantify time inconsistency, we proposed a methodology to compute the related sub-optimality gap as the difference of the objective function evaluated using planned and implemented policies.

For the proposed CVaR based portfolio selection problem, we compared a time-consistent formulation to an inconsistent one for the sake of showing that an inconsistent policy may not take risk aversion into account at some intermediate states of the system. We show a sensitivity analysis on the sub-optimality gap with respect to planning horizon size and risk-aversion level. We concluded that, for this example, the most aggressive and the most conservative allocation strategies, time inconsistency would not be a problem. On the other hand, for intermediate cases, time consistency does matter depending on the planning horizon.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that future research regarding the assessment of the sub-optimality gap deserves attention. Applying this methodology in different modeling frameworks, applications, risk measures, and in the context of large-scale approximative algorithms, constitute relevant extentions to this subject.
