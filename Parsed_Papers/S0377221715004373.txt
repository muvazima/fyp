                  This paper develops a slack-based decomposition of profit efficiency based on a directional distance function. It is an alternative to Cooper, Pastor, Aparicio, and Borras (2011).
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1998) introduced an additive decomposition of profit efficiency based on the directional technology distance function.
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        Luenberger introduced this function as a “shortage function”, see e.g., Luenberger (1995).
                      Under suitable regularity conditions on technology, this distance function has the indication property that it equals zero if and only if the input–output vector belongs to the g-isoquant (see Färe & Grosskopf, 2010). A Leontief technology is an example for which the isoquant may be larger than the Pareto–Koopmans efficiency set. Thus the Chambers et al. decomposition does not account for slacks.

This observation has prompted Cooper, Pastor, Aparicio, and Borras (2011) to “...show that the usual measure of profit inefficiency can be decomposed into its technical component, measured through a weighted additive model, and its allocative component derived as a residual. Our findings are all based on Fenchel–Mahler inequality using duality theory (see Färe and Grosskopf, 2000, p. 411)”.

In this paper we introduce an alternative model to Cooper et al. (2011) using a slack-based directional technology distance function introduced by Färe and Grosskopf (2010). We combine this function with the fact that the profit maximum is at least as large as the profit from any feasible input–output vector.

In the next section, after discussing profit-maximization, we recall the Chambers et al. (1998) decomposition. Then we introduce our new decomposition of profit efficiency using a slack-based directional technology distance function.

                     and adding allocative efficiency to the right hand side closes the inequality. This is the Chambers et al. decomposition.

Note that if all prices (on the left hand side of (6)) are scaled by λ > 0, the efficiency score does not change, thus we may use US Dollar or Swedish kroner as the unit and the results will be the same. Again, this decomposition would result in slacks being captured by the residual rather than by technical inefficiency.

Following Färe and Grosskopf (2010), the slack-based directional technology distance function, when the direction vector is chosen to be the unit vector, i.e.,

                        In this paper we focus on efficiency measurement, so we consider only points that belong to the technology set and this requires the non-negativity constraint, to ensure that the reference point on the frontier is obtained by not increasing any of the inputs (i.e., contracting or keeping constant) and by not decreasing any outputs (i.e., expanding or keeping constant). It is possible to extend this measure to the case when a point does not belong to the technology set (e.g., for measuring productivity changes), and for such points the non-negativity constraints should be changed to a non-positivity constraint for analogous reasons, in addition to feasibility of the solution assumption. We thank an anonymous referee for this remark and leave further details for future work.
                      It is worth noting that the g vector here equals one unit for each element,

                        5
                        To clarify the notation further, note that we explicitly write the multiplication by 1 to emphasize that in each instance it is multiplication by the unit of measurement corresponding to each different input or output, e.g., the first element in 1 could stand for 1 litre of petrol, the second could stand for 1 hour of labour, the last two could stand for 1 kg of apples and 1 kg of oranges, respectively, etc. Also, see appendix for the proof of independence from units of measurement of this measure.
                      and so has a unit measure, making β’s and γ’s independent of units of measurement and hence they can be summed.

                            then we have a Russell-type efficiency measure defined on T. See Färe, Fukuyama, Grosskopf, and Zelenyuk (2015) for a related discussion.

                        Note that the left hand side of (12) is the ratio of profit differences and the value of the directional vector, hence it is independent of the units of measurement.
                     
                  

Obviousely, (10), (11) and (12) are equivalent, however, (12) allows us to identify the contribution of each input and output as a share of the total technical inefficiency.

                           ) appears both inside and outside the parentheses of the decomposition on the right hand side of (12). Such mathematical rearrangement is commonly used in other instances in performance measurement. For example, the same distance functions appear inside and outside of parentheses to arrive at decompositions of Malmquist productivity indexes (e.g., see Färe, Grosskopf, Norris, and Zhang (1994)).
                     
                  

To take a closer look at the results, note that the right hand side of (12) is a product of two parts, the

                      then the Chambers et al. decomposition is obtained as a special case. Also note that this decomposition is new to the literature and it is possible to adapt it to produce a similar decomposition for the Russell-based directional distance function (see Fukuyama & Weber, 2009).

Finally, a natural approach to estimate these measures in practice from data is to adapt the data envelopment analysis approach (see Farrell (1957), Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984); Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) for the origins) in a similar fashion as in Cooper et al. (2011) and Färe et al. (2015).
