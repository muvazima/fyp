                  Using a ray tracing technique, we investigate the dependence of the moiré effect on the crossing angles between touch screen panels (TSPs) and display panels, the metal grid structures (spacing and width), and metal grid shapes (non-uniform and random grids). Of those design parameters, adjusting the crossing angle (∼45°), reducing the grid width (∼1μm), and employing a random grid in the shape of irregular hexagon are found to suppress the moiré phenomenon to a great extent. We also provide the simulation scheme that can capture the moiré patterns observed experimentally and useful design guidelines for metal grids.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The moiré phenomenon is induced by an interaction between the overlaid repetitive structures such as screens, mesh grids, or gratings [1]. It can be used for the measurement of noncontact profile, object movement, etc. [1,2]. In the field of printings and visible displays, however, it is a troublesome issue and thus should be avoided. For 3D displays, it occurs due mainly to the interference between grid structures of optical components and pixels [3–6]. Such a moiré effect was shown to be suppressed by placing grids at a certain crossing angle [6]. In the field of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, the moiré phenomenon appears due to the fact that condensed lights from optical films are spatially aliased by the micro grid structures of RGB openings (sub-pixels), which is known as a pixel moiré phenomenon [7]. It can be reduced by optimizing the prism pitch of a brightness enhancement film (BEF) [7]. Lately, as a replacement of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), metals such as chrome (Cr), silver (Ag), or copper (Cu) exhibiting higher electrical conductivity and electromigration resistance have been used in not only rigid but also flexible touch screen panels (TSPs). In addition, a printing technology instead of a standard photolithography process is demanded to reduce the fabrication cost. To ensure the optical transmittance (>85%) of TSPs, those metals must be patterned with the width of less than 5μm. In the case where the metal grid width is large, the moiré effect is inevitably generated owing to the interference between the metal grids of TSPs and the black matrix (BM) in display panels. To eliminate or at least minimize the moiré effect, a design of metal grids is of great importance. When metal lines are drawn on a computer screen with spacing similar to the pixel size in order to design metal grids, an aliasing also arises from the raster lacking the resolution to display the lines individually. As such, an optical design scheme is required to design and optimize metal grids. In fact, moiré interferometry is a well established technique and computer modeling of periodic grid layers is straightforward using Fourier transform [8]. For a system with random metal grids included, however, it is not applicable. In this case, 3D numerical simulations using ray tracing technique [9] are suitable for the systematic analysis of moiré phenomenon. Such a ray tracing technique can generate moiré fringes by tracing the path of light through grids. Although ray tracing entails a lot of computational efforts for the simulation of TSPs with random grids, it is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism.

The main purpose of this work is to provide the simulation scheme and useful guidelines for the design of moiré-less metal grids for TSP applications using a ray tracing tool [9]. The ray tracing simulation provides noise-like ray distribution, making it difficult to measure the period of moiré patterns. To resolve it, we have employed a smoothing technique by adjacent averaging. Due to the different human eye sensitivity, it is difficult to quantify the moiré effect from the image data. By way of simulation, however, it is feasible by calculating the number of rays detected on the receiver. Such information is not readily available in open literature. For a quantitative analysis of the moiré effect, therefore, we have also provided the way of quantifying it using the standard deviation (S/D) and contrast ratio (C/R) computed from the detected ray distribution. The next purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of random metal grids on the moiré phenomenon with the validated numerical simulation process. Furthermore, we have also investigated the dependence of the moiré effect on various design parameters such as the crossing angle between TSPs and display panels, the metal grid structures (spacing and width), and non-uniform metal grids.

@&#METHODS@&#


                        Fig. 1
                         shows the rectangular metal (Ag) grids fabricated for TSP applications on polyethylene teraphthalate (PET) substrates (SKC v5400) using the gravure offset printing process (provided by Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials). As displayed in Fig. 1(c), the width of metal grids is measured to be about 10μm and the spacing of the horizontal and vertical lines is 70μm and 190μm, respectively. In practice, moiré patterns appear due to an interaction between the mesh grid of TSPs and the BM in display panels. As such, the TSP need be overlapped with the BM of display screens to observe moiré fringes experimentally. There are many display products (LCD monitors, smartphones, tablet computers, TVs, etc.) in the market. However, they have different pixel and BM configurations, thereby resulting in different moiré patterns. With attempt to provide trend information of the moiré intensity that changes with various design parameters, we have rather used the PET film with the same Ag metal grid (Fig. 1) instead of selecting a particular BM structure from commercial LCD products. It is reasonable because the structure of Ag metal grid (width=10μm and sensor size=190μm×70μm) is very similar to that of a typical rectangular sub-pixel (spacing≈16μm and size≈180μm×60μm for a LCD monitor). Once they are overlapped, we have rotated the upper PET film to inquire into the moiré effect depending on the crossing angle between the TSP represented by the upper PET film (a single-layered TSP film) and the BM represented by the lower PET film.

To capture the moiré patterns by ray tracing simulations, we have drawn the same mesh grid as in Fig. 1 in the model. Shown in Fig. 2
                         is the schematic layer structure used in the model for simulations. A number of rays are emitted from the light source (surface source) and then detected by the receiver after propagating through the mesh. The computational area is selected to be 3cm×3cm to capture those moiré patterns without heavy computational efforts. For simulations, we used 50 million rays to obtain high-quality moiré patterns and divided the receiver into 600×600 cells (bins). As such, the resolution (cell size) of the receiver is 50μm×50μm and each cell detects less than 139 rays. It displays light and darkness depending on the number of detected rays. Namely, white color is displayed when the number of detected rays is large. Otherwise, blue color is displayed. In Fig. 2, two metal grids (one for BM and the other for TSP) are overlapped. They can be overlapped at a certain crossing angle. It is noteworthy that both source and receiver need be rotated in order to see the moiré effect for different viewing angles. Unless otherwise specified, the viewing angle (θ) is zero.

With the detected rays on each bin or cell in the receiver, we can plot a graph over the computational area. However, noise-like ray distribution is observed, making it difficult to measure the period of moiré patterns from the raw data. To tackle this problem, we first take the average of several (10 lines) adjacent detected rays in the horizontal or vertical direction. Then, we employ a smoothing method (low-pass filtering) by adjacent averaging. This scheme essentially takes the average of a certain number (=2) of data points around each point in raw data and replaces that point with the new average value. Through this process, we can obtain very clear ray distribution and calculate the period of moiré patterns. For a quantitative analysis, we have calculated the S/D and C/R values from the ray distribution. The C/R value can be calculated using

                        The higher value S/D and C/R have, the stronger the moiré effect appears.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Presented in Fig. 3
                         are the moiré patterns (fringes) generated when those two PET films with the same Ag metal grids are superimposed at different crossing angles. Although the moiré patterns are recognizable to the naked eye, yet it is difficult to capture very clear images by a camera. Therefore, much care is taken to capture the moiré patterns using a camera, especially when the metal mesh is rotated. It is observed that as the crossing angle is increased, more moiré patterns with shorter pitch appear (3×7 lines for 1°, 5×13 lines for 2°, and 7×19 lines for 3° appear within the active area of 3cm×3cm). Such moiré patterns can be regarded as line defects in TSPs for displays. As such, a design scheme that can eliminate those defects is highly demanded.

Based on the moiré patterns observed experimentally, we have first validated the ray tracing simulation to find whether or not it can be employed for the design and optimization of metal grids. Such a validation process is required since the ray tracing technique cannot capture the diffraction and interference of light by the BM and metal grids, which may affect the moiré phenomenon. Presented in Fig. 4
                            is the simulation result of moiré patterns for different crossing angles. In analogy to the moiré patterns observed experimentally in Fig. 3, 3 moiré patterns (vertical fringes) with the period of 1.13cm and 7 moiré patterns (horizontal fringes) with the period of 0.47cm appear within the computational area of 3cm×3cm when the crossing angle is 1°. When the crossing angle is 2°, 5 vertical fringes with the period of 0.57cm and 13 horizontal fringes with the period of 0.23cm appear. More moiré patterns (7 vertical fringes and 19 horizontal fringes) appear when the crossing angle is 3°. As such, the pattern pitch becomes shorter as the crossing angle is increased, the phenomenon also observed experimentally in Fig. 3.

To validate our simulation results further, we have calculated the period of moiré patterns analytically for different rotation angles. The period (Pm
                           ) of moiré patterns can be obtained from Eq. (1)

                            is the period of the rotated lower structure, TU
                            the period of the rotated upper structure, αL
                            the rotation angle of the lower structure, and αU
                            the rotation angle of the upper one. We have calculated the period of moiré fringes using Eq. (2) and summarized the results in Table 1
                           . It is apparent from Table 1 that the simulation result is in good agreement with the analytical one.

With the validated simulation scheme, we have first investigated the dependence of the moiré effect on the crossing angle. Shown in Fig. 5
                           (a) is the detected ray distribution extracted along the vertical direction at the center of the receiver. Noise-like ray distribution is observed due to the fact that some receiver cells with higher metal coverage detect a smaller number of rays, whereas those with lower metal coverage detect a larger number of rays (also see Fig. 6
                           ). It is attributed that the receiver cell size (50μm×50μm) is much smaller than the sensor size (190μm×70μm). Such a noise-like ray distribution may correspond to high frequency moiré fringes that are invisible to the naked eye in reality. Moreover, there appear sometimes very sharp periodic peaks (point defects) in the ray distribution, which are also invisible in reality. This may bring in a misleading result. In addition, it is hard to measure the period of moiré patterns from the raw data (i.e., noise-like ray distribution). Through smoothing by adjacent averaging, we can obtain very clear ray distribution (moiré fringes), as in Fig. 5(b) and (c). Those peaks correspond to the moiré patterns and their amplitude is proportional to the strength of the moiré effect. We have found that the horizontal fringes appear more strongly than the vertical ones when the crossing angle is low, the phenomenon also observed experimentally in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 7
                           , however, those moiré patterns weakened substantially when the crossing angle is 45°. It is for this reason that the BM and the metal mesh are less parallel to each other at higher crossing angles (Fig. 6). Even though the same average number (∼96) of detected rays in Figs. 5(b) and 7(c) is observed, stronger moiré effect occurs in Fig. 5(b) when the crossing angle is low.

To observe the angular dependence of the moiré phenomenon, we have computed the C/R and S/D values as a function of the crossing angle. As presented in Fig. 8
                            and Table 2
                           , both (C/R and S/D) show almost the same tendency. It is observed that strong moiré effect occurs at low and high crossing angles. However, both horizontal and vertical fringes are suppressed substantially (i.e., both C/R and S/D reach the flat bottom) when the crossing angle lies within the range between 35° and 55°. From this result, it can be concluded that the moiré phenomenon can be eliminated by simply rotating a TSP at a certain crossing angle. In reality, it can be implemented without difficulty. Namely, the mesh grid configuration with a certain crossing angle at which no moiré phenomenon occurs is first determined within the active area and then the outer fine buslines are readily arranged with the metal grids in the active area. This scheme, however, may bring in an overlap between the pixels and the metal grids, possibly causing a reduction of pixels at some areas. One may expect that if the crossing angle is very small, such a phenomenon would be evitable. To confirm it, we have performed more simulations at very low crossing angles (0.1°, 0.3°, and 0.5°). It is clearly seen from the results in Fig. 9
                            that the moiré patterns still appear strongly even at very low crossing angles. Therefore, rotating the TSP at very low crossing angles is not that effective way to suppress the moiré effect.

In reality, the mesh pitch is determined considering metal coverage (i.e., the optical transmittance and electrical resistance of TSPs), touch performance (i.e., the number of driving and sensing lines), layer structure of electrode (i.e., one or two layer TSP structure), and display panel size. As such, changing the mesh pitch is not readily available. Within the framework of the minimization of the moiré effect, however, the touch sensor size would be one of key design parameters, especially for a full HD display coupled with a TSP. Therefore, an investigation on the effect of the metal grid spacing on the moiré phenomenon deserves to be made. To this end, we have changed the configuration of the upper metal grid (the structure of the lower metal grid is unchanged). We have simulated with two different non-square metal grids. One has the touch sensor size two times larger (380μm×140μm) and the other one has two times smaller (95μm×35μm) than that (190μm×70μm) of the lower metal grid. As evident in Fig. 10
                            and Table 3
                           , when the metal grid spacing of a TSP is larger, the number of moiré fringes is shown to be decreased and their strength is much lowered. With attempt to suppress the moiré effect further, we have simulated with two different square grids (70μm×70μm or 190μm×190μm). As seen in Table 3, the same behavior as observed in Fig. 10 appears. Namely, the number of moiré patterns and their strength are reduced when the touch sensor size is relatively larger.

The metal grid width should be determined considering the electrical resistance, feasibility of patterning, and display panel size. For medium-large sized TSPs, the metal grid width of 10μm would be suitable since the line resistance is a major determinant. Using a roll-to-roll printing process, it is challenging to fabricate the metal grids with the width of less than 5μm. However, it is feasible to make it much less than 5μm by employing a standard photolithography process. Therefore, the width of the metal grids is also one of key design parameters. To investigate the dependence of the moiré phenomenon on the metal grid width, we have reduced the width of the upper metal grid from 10μm to 1μm without changing the metal grid spacing (the width (10μm) of the lower metal grid is unchanged) and performed simulations at the crossing angle of 1°. From the results in Fig. 11
                            and Table 3, we can find that the moiré effect is suppressed to a great extent with the metal grid as narrow as 5μm and eventually disappears by the metal grid as narrow as 1μm. If the metal grid width is larger, broader dark zones are formed in some receivers for low rotation angles, thereby increasing S/D and C/R values. It is therefore concluded that not only to enhance the optical transmittance of TSPs but also to eliminate the moiré effect, the metal grid should be as narrow as possible (preferably about 0.8μm) given that a fine patterning for such a narrow metal grid is feasible.

To find more effective way of reducing the moiré effect, we have simulated non-uniform non-square metal grids. To this end, we have varied the spacing of the upper metal grid in the horizontal direction within the range between 40μm and 100μm (Fig. 12
                           ) in such a way that the average grid spacing is kept unchanged (70μm). As evident in Fig. 13
                            and Table 3, no noticeable reduction in the moiré effect is observed. Rather, more complex moiré patterns appear at low crossing angles, compared with the results in Fig. 4. Namely, another moiré patterns (lines) with relatively low strength appear and they make the pattern complicated.

It is known that the moiré patterns can be eliminated provided that the metal grid involves no repetitive structure. Therefore, a mesh-free random grid is the most ideal structure for TSP applications. To confirm it, we have further performed numerical simulations with the random-structured upper metal grid, as seen in Fig. 14
                           (a). The metal grid structure includes irregular pentagons and hexagons with the width of roughly 10μm. The angle between the sides and their length are randomly varied. Such a random structure requires a lot of computational efforts. To avoid it, we have selected the computational area as small as 8mm×8mm, wherein many moiré patterns are still visible. It is found from the results in Fig. 14(b)–(e) that the moiré effect is suppressed to a great extent by the random metal grids, compared with the uniform non-square metal grids. Therefore, it can be concluded that using a random metal grid for TSPs is also one of the most effective ways to eliminate the moiré effect. However, such random grids may bring in point defects, which appear when the random arrangement of the metal grids enlarges metal coverage and thus reduces the luminance in some cells (pixels). To avoid it, therefore, much care is taken to design the random grid configurations (e.g., the length of sides, the angle between sides, and the number of sides). From Fig. 14(d)–(e), it is likely that the ray distribution obtained with the random metal gird is fluctuated more than that by the rectangular metal grid at the crossing angle of 45° (Fig. 7(c)–(d)), which may result in an increase of the S/D value. To demonstrate it, we have further performed ray tracing simulations and calculated the S/D values as a function of the crossing angle. As presented in Fig. 15
                           , no angular dependence is observed by the random metal grid. However, the random metal grid exhibits even higher S/D value, compared with the rectangular metal grid when the crossing angle lies within the range between 35° and 75°. It is point defects that result in an increase of the SD value, which may also bring in the luminance difference among pixels. In fact, point defect may also appear by non-random metal grids. As evident in Fig. 6(b), some cells with higher metal coverage detect a smaller number of rays, whereas those with lower metal coverage detect a larger number of rays, bringing in point defect. However, it is more noticeable with the random metal grid due to different geometric configuration (random arrangement of metal grids). For this reason, placing non-random (regular) metal meshes at a proper crossing angle would be preferred, not to mention its ease of design and fabrication.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have demonstrated that the ray tracing simulation we performed for the design of metal grids can capture accurately the moiré fringes observed experimentally. With the aid of the contrast ratio and standard deviation calculated from the detected ray distribution, a quantitative analysis of the moiré effect has been made. With the validated simulation scheme, it has been demonstrated that the moiré phenomenon can be suppressed to a great extent by adjusting the crossing angle between a TSP and display screen, reducing the metal grid width down to 1μm, and employing a random metal grid in the shape of irregular hexagon. However, the random metal grid exhibits even higher S/D value due to point defects, compared with the rectangular metal grid when the crossing angle lies within the range between 35° and 75°. Of those design parameters, therefore, placing non-random metal grids at a certain crossing angle is the most critical condition. Though increasing the metal grid spacing brings in a reduction of the number of moiré patterns and their strength, yet it may not be desirable considering the touch performance. It has also been found that employing the non-uniform non-square metal grid results in more complicated moiré patterns, compared with the uniform non-square metal grid.
