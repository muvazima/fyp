                  Selecting the order of autoregressions when the parameters of the model are estimated with least-squares algorithms (LSA) is a well researched topic. This type of approach assumes implicitly that the analyzed time series is stationary, which is rarely true in practical applications. It is known since long time that, in the case of nonstationary signals, is recommended to employ forgetting factor least-squares algorithms (FF-LSA) instead of LSA. This makes necessary to modify the selection criteria originally designed for LSA in order to become compatible with FF-LSA. Sequentially normalized maximum likelihood (SNML), which is one of the newest model selection criteria, has been modified independently by two groups of researchers such that to be used in conjunction with FF-LSA. As the proposals coming from the two groups have not been compared in the previous literature, we conduct in this work a theoretical and empirical study for clarifying the relationship between the existing solutions. As part of our study, we also investigate some possibilities to further modify the criteria. Based on our findings, we provide guidance which can potentially be useful for the practitioners.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The methods used in analysis of time series are traditionally classified into parametric and non-parametric. Parametric analysis assumes that the underlying stochastic process can be described by a model with a small number of parameters. A special class of models is termed autoregressive moving average (ARMA). Their importance stems from the fact that any continuous power spectral density (PSD) can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a model from this class [1,2]. Due to practical considerations, the autoregressive (AR) models are more often used than ARMA. However, before estimating the parameters of the model from the data, one should choose the number of the parameters, which in the AR case is equivalent to selecting the order of the model. The accurate approximation of the PSD can be achieved only if the order of autoregressions is properly selected.

During the last decades, many solutions have been proposed for selecting the order of autoregressions, some of them using the newest advances in maximum likelihood theory, namely the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) [3–5]. As the evaluation of NML is difficult from computational viewpoint, it has been introduced a new variant of it which is called sequentially normalized maximum likelihood (SNML) [6]. In fact, the name used in [6] is sequentially normalized least squares (SNLS) and not SNML, but the reason for which we employ SNML is the following: The authors of [6] firstly published the key ideas of the new method in a conference paper [7], where they used the name SNML and since then almost all researchers employ this name when referring to the method. More importantly, the simulation study from [6], which shows the superiority of SNML in comparison with other methods, is focused on estimating the order of autoregressions. Another interesting aspect is that SNML has been originally regarded as an approximation of NML, but very recent publications revealed interesting properties of SNML, especially its relationship to other statistical methods (see [8] and the references therein).

An autoregressive model with constant parameters is not appropriate for most of the time series which are measured in practical situations, where is preferable either to consider that the parameters of the model are slowly varying in time or to assume that they are piecewise constant 
                     [9, pp. 149–152]. In the latter case, an off-line procedure can be applied for identifying the piecewise AR processes which are called segments. To this end, one should detect the position of abrupt changes and estimate the AR order as well as the AR coefficients for each segment. This is currently done by employing various information theoretic criteria or by using the Bayesian approach (see [9–11] and the references therein). For instance, in [12] the segmentation is performed by introducing a hierarchical Bayesian model for which the posterior distribution is estimated with the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method [13]. The methodology from [12] was further extended in [14] for the joint segmentation of signals measured by different sensors like, for example, the multiple-track audio records. An algorithm based on sequential Monte Carlo was proposed in [15] for tracking the pole parametrization of time-varying autoregressions.

In this work, the segmentation is not the main concern since we adopt an adaptive filtering approach in which the AR coefficients are estimated with forgetting factor least-squares algorithms (FF-LSA) [16]. Based on these estimates, we can analyze how the frequency content of the signal varies over time, but the accuracy of time-frequency analysis depends on the order of the AR model [9, pp. 140–141]. Unfortunately, the SNML cannot be applied straightforwardly for selecting the AR order because it has been devised to work in conjunction with least-squares algorithms (LSA) and not with FF-LSA. The first attempt at altering SNML such that to become compatible with FF-LSA is the one from [17]. The modified SNML is named 
                        
                           
                              SNML
                           
                           
                              λ
                           
                        
                     , and Ref. [17] provides an extensive theoretical and empirical study which shows the relationship between 
                        
                           
                              SNML
                           
                           
                              λ
                           
                        
                      and other model selection criteria.

Another modified SNML criterion was introduced in [18] under the name sequentially discounting normalized maximum likelihood (SDNML), and we prefer to call it 
                        
                           
                              SDNML
                           
                           
                              λ
                           
                           
                              [
                              1
                              ]
                           
                        
                     . The major motivation when proposing this criterion was to address the issue of real-time change point detection in time series. According to [18], a change-point is “the time point at which the statistical nature of time series suddenly changes”, and the detection of the change-point may lead to the “discovery of a novel event”.

                              λ

                              1
                              ]
                           
                        
                      was demonstrated in [18] by using artificial and real-life datasets. In both cases, the AR model was assumed to have constant order. The aim of analyzing the real-life time series was to detect the malicious software based on the computer access logs. The method from [18] has been recently applied in [19] for detecting oscillatory alpha activity in EEG signals.

                     , was proposed in [20,21], where the main interest is to detect the emerging topics from social network streams based on monitoring the mentioning behavior of users. In their paper, a new emerging topic has been defined as “something people feel like discussing, commenting, or forwarding the information to their friends”. Their method has been tested on artificial data sets as well as real-life data obtained from Youtube and Twitter.

For the sake of completeness, we briefly explain how

                      is computed at each time point by applying the formula from [21, Section 3.7]. Note that the same formula is reproduced below in Eq. (7). An intermediate score is obtained at each time point as an average of the most recent κ

                      is evaluated at each time point and then the results are used to compute the final score with the same type of averaging as described above. The final score is converted into binary alarms by thresholding. It is important to mention that the value of the threshold is optimized according to a procedure which was originally introduced in [22] and is also presented in [21, Algorithm 1].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we prove some theoretical results that show the relationship between the three criteria. In order to assess the theoretical results, we conduct several experiments which are described in Section 3. In the same section, we provide an interpretation of the empirical results. Conclusions are outlined in Section 4.

                         are statistically independent and assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and constant (but unknown) variance. The exponential weighting factor λ, which is positive and smaller than one, has the role of “forgetting” the past observations. This feature allows the application of the estimation method to nonstationary time series [23]. Efficient algorithms for the minimization of (2) constitute a well-established chapter in signal processing literature (see, for example, [16]). For the sake of brevity, instead of presenting here all the details, we rather prefer to outline in Table 1
                         the most important quantities which are involved in the implementation of such algorithms. The nomenclature within the first column of the table is taken from [16], while the notation outlined in the second column is the same as in [17]. In the third column, we represent the relationship between the definitions from [18] and those from [17]. In relation with the initialization step, note that all measurements indexed by nonpositive integers (

As already mentioned in the previous section, we focus on investigating the performance of three different criteria employed for selecting the order of an AR model (see (1)) when the coefficients are estimated by FF-LSA. First, we consider the selection rule which was originally derived in [17] by modifying the criterion from [6] such that to become compatible with FF-LSA.

                         can be applied for selecting the order of autoregressions. More precisely, the selected order is the one which minimizes the value of the criterion. All three criteria have been introduced in the previous literature, but the relationship between them was not investigated so far. To fill the gap, we resort next to a theoretical comparative study in which

In order to simplify the calculations, we re-write the formulas of the two criteria in a more convenient form. Since the available measurements are

                           Remark 1
                           The asymptotic approximation in (11) is obtained under the hypothesis that the model in (1) is the correct one and is time-invariant. These assumptions have been already used in the previous literature for analyzing the behavior of adaptive filters (see [17] and the references therein). For instance, in [17, Appendix A] has been demonstrated that λ should be selected such that

                           The result in (11) can be extended without difficulties to the case when k is the order of the fitted AR model and does not necessarily coincide with the order of the “true” AR model. Under this hypothesis, we investigate the role played by each of the terms,

We show that the scale invariance property holds also for the predictive densities criterion (PDC) which was introduced in [17] by adapting a criterion from [30] to the case when the coefficients of the AR model are estimated with FF-LSA:

                         remains unchanged when t increases seems to be in contradiction with our methodology which relies mainly on the idea of “forgetting” the past. Based on this observation, one might consider discarding the terms depending on

The negative implication of this change is that the modified criteria do not have anymore the scale invariance property. This can be seen immediately by noticing that

                         which means the modified criteria will prefer to select lower orders after multiplying all samples with a constant α whose magnitude is larger than one. It can be also shown that the modified criteria will penalize the high order models more severely than the original criteria when the variance of the excitation in (1) is multiplied with a constant larger than one.

In the previous section, we have presented a theoretical analysis of differences between the model selection criteria

The interest in this type of comparison comes especially from the fact that all three criteria have been derived in the previous literature [17,18,20,21] by altering the SNML criterion from [6]. In Section 2.4, we have also mentioned the

For illustrating the effect of λ, we simulate data according to a piecewise AR process which has been previously applied in statistical literature [31] as well as in engineering literature [17]. Each piecewise AR process can be described as a collection of segments, and the segments of the process which is of interest for us are given in Table 3
                        . In Fig. 1
                         we plot the results obtained for two different values of λ:

                         is fairly modest in all segments. It is having a little difficulty to pick the true order not just in segment I, but for the other segments too. In spite of the moderate performance, it is still competent in detecting the increase of the AR order. This can be seen at the start points of the segments II and III.

However, the slight increment of the forgetting factor has two negative effects: In segment IV diminishes the ability of the criterion in detecting the reduction of AR order, and in segment III makes the criterion to have difficulties in selecting correctly the order. Same observation is also true for

Interpretation of empirical results has been limited so far to counting how many times a specific criterion selects the true order, without investigating what is happening when the AR order was selected erroneously. For example, a more in-depth analysis might evaluate the differences between the estimated spectrum and the true spectrum when the selected order does not coincide with the true one. Instead of analyzing the estimated spectra, which is beyond the scope of this work, we prefer to comment on the statistics of the AR orders selected by

It has been already pointed out in Section 3.3 that, in Example 2(a),

                                 λ
                              
                           
                         has serious difficulties in estimating the zero-order models corresponding to segments III and V. According to the statistics collected, in most of the trials when 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         does not select order zero, it chooses order one. There exists also a smaller number of trials when 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         decides that the order is either two or three (instead of zero). In segment IV, we can remark that 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         is able to select the true order (six) in most of simulations, and in the small number of cases when fails, it overestimates the order (says seven instead of six). We can conclude that 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         is good at estimating high orders but performs poorly when the order changes from high to much lower as it tends to overestimate the true order.

The only difference between Example 2(a) and Example 2(b) is the model from which the first m samples are drawn. It is interesting that this change “fixes” the overestimation problem which we have noticed in relation with Example 2(a). More precisely, the ability of

                         to select order zero in segments III and V increased from less than 
                           50
                           %
                         in Example 2(a) to 
                           80
                           %
                         in Example 2(b). Moreover, in Example 2(b), 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         has no difficulties in selecting the true order of six in segment IV.

The influence of the initial observations on performance has been further investigated in Example 3, where our findings are similar to what we have already learned from Example 2(a): In segment I, 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         is capable of selecting the true order (eight) for most of the simulations, but it has only a moderate ability in selecting the order one in segment II (see also Table 2 and Table 5 for a complete description of the AR models used within the two segments). In segment II, when 
                           
                              
                                 SNML
                              
                              
                                 λ
                              
                           
                         overestimates the order, it chooses either order two or order three, and very rarely orders larger than three. Overall, we can say that the performance of 
                           
                              
                                 SNML

                         in Example 3(a) is reasonable.

In Example 3(b), the simulated data are the same as in Example 3(a), but this time we test the criterion

                      depends on the past measurements in a way that might favor the selection of higher orders. In Section 2.4, we have demonstrated that all three criteria are invariant under the scalar change of the observations, and this is mainly due to the presence in their formulas of the term

                     , another criterion introduced in the previous literature, has the scale invariance property.

One of the limitations of the theoretical results is the assumption of stationarity which was used in the proofs. For comparing the performance of the model selection criteria when the time series are not stationary, we have conducted experiments with simulated data. In most of our experiments, the data have been generated as outcomes of piecewise AR processes. One of the methods used in segmentation of such models relies on the hypothesis that the length of each segment is an integer power of two and, based on this assumption, divides the time series into blocks, in a dyadic manner, up to a pre-specified scale [27]. In general, this type of solution is sub-optimal, but it has the advantage of low computational complexity. Even if the estimation methods which we use do not require the time series to have this particular structure, we included in our experiments the piecewise AR process with dyadic structure which has been previously used in [10,17,27]. In this case, we have observed that the performance of

                      is different from the other criteria, but not significantly so. This is the reason for which we did not provide in Section 3 a detailed report containing these results. Based on similar considerations, we did not include the results obtained for the slowly varying AR process from [10,17,27]. In this experiment, all the criteria worked well. It is worth mentioning the performance of

One of the most important problems concerns the selection of the forgetting factor λ. In this work, we have only considered a limited number of experiments to illustrate the impact of λ. However, a depth theoretical analysis of this problem would be certainly of interest for the community of researchers.
