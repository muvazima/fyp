                  Despite the rising prevalence of obesity, little is known about its moderating effects on injury risk factors, such as fatigue, in occupational settings. This study investigated the effect of obesity, prolonged repetitive lifting and their interaction on lifting performance of 14 participants, 7 obese (mean body mass index (BMI): 33.2 kg m−2) and 7 non-obese (mean BMI: 22.2 kg m−2) subjects. To present a physically challenging task, subjects performed repetitive lifting for 1 h at 120% of their maximum acceptable weight of lift. Generalized linear mixed models were fit to posture and acceleration data. The obese group bent to a ∼10° lower peak trunk sagittal flexion angle, had 17% lower root mean square (RMS) jerk and took 0.8 s longer per lift. Over time, the obese group increased their trunk transverse and sagittal posterior accelerations while the non-obese maintained theirs. Although the majority of lifting variables were unaffected by BMI or its interaction with prolonged lifting duration, the observed differences, combined with a greater upper body mass, necessitate a more cautious use of existing psychophysical lifting limits for individuals who are obese, particularly when fatigued.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Manual material handling is identified as a major risk factor for back disorders (Burdorf and Sorock, 1997), with the highest incidence and cost incurred for lower back injuries (Schmier et al., 2006; Woolf and Pfleger, 2003). Lifting, a prevailing form of manual material handling is of particular concern. There is a positive association between lifting and lower back pain and disorder with risk ratio estimates ranging from 1.3 to 4.2 (Kuiper et al., 1999). It has been suggested that trunk kinematics and kinetics during the lifting task play an important role in the development of these disorders (Hoogendoorn et al., 2000; Marras et al., 1993). Since spinal loading is a contributing factor to back disorders (Marras, 2000), further work is needed to understand factors that affect trunk motion and loading during lifting.

One factor that may influence trunk motion, and thus the occurrence of resultant low back disorders, is the increased prevalence of obesity in the U.S. workforce (Caban et al., 2005). Obesity is defined by an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg m−2 and is a modifiable risk factor for many health conditions, such as musculoskeletal disorders involving the back, hip, knee, ankle, and foot (Wearing et al., 2006). Employees who are obese have been found to have higher rates of sick leave or disability use along with increased healthcare costs (Østbye et al., 2007). Studies on lower back pain report contradictory results regarding the association between lower back pain and BMI. Bayramoglu et al (Bayramoglu et al., 2001). found that the prevalence lower back pain was significantly associated with high BMI among females. In contrast, Lee et al (Lee et al., 2005). reported no such relation between obese and lean participants in their large-scale Check Bus Project study of over 10,000 employees of two Swiss companies.

Obesity has been shown to affect an individual's range of motion (ROM), reducing the ROM for shoulder extension and adduction, lumbar spine extension and lateral flexion, and knee flexion (Park et al., 2010). Consequently, individuals who are obese have reported more limitations during work at varying levels of demands, from office work to occupations requiring high physical demand such as laborers (Gates et al., 2008). Although contradictory results are reported regarding the association of obesity and muscle strength, when corrected for fat-free mass and controlled for age and physical activity, handgrip, knee flexion and extension, and trunk extension strengths were reported to be significantly lower among women who are obese. Trunk flexion, however, was ∼8% stronger with obesity (Hulens et al., 2001). With respect to lifting tasks, the excess load of the trunk, due to excess body weight, increases the biomechanical loading at the low back up to 59% (Blanton, 2004). The greater forces from body segment masses, when added to the load weight, can surpass the recommended weight limits and compressive forces, which may lead to pain and discomfort (Wang et al., 1998).

In addition to physical constraints, psychophysical limits play a major role in determining functional capability. Psychophysical lifting tolerance limits are defined as the maximum load weights that workers can handle without perceiving strain, overexertion, discomfort, tiredness, weakness, or breathlessness (referred to as the maximum acceptable weights of lift (MAWL)) (Snook et al., 1970). Although obesity is shown to lower functional capacity in some tasks such as squatting for 10 s, rising from a squat, and kneeling with hands supported on wall bars for 10 s (Evers and Mattsson, 2001), it has been found to not affect MAWLs. When comparing among three obesity levels, Singh, Park, and Levy (Singh et al., 2009) found no significant difference in mean MAWLs. In their study, participants were asked to determine their MAWL values for 18 different task conditions, varying in lifting frequency and lifting height, and were allowed to use self-selected, free-style lifting techniques. After studying the effect of obesity level, gender, lifting frequency, lifting height and their interactions on MAWL, obesity level was not statistically significant and a similar data distribution in terms of quartiles and minimum and maximum MAWL values were observed.

While the finding of equivalent MAWL may lead to the conclusion that the traditional manual materials handling guidelines may be sufficient, it only provides evidence for meeting the psychophysical criterion and further biomechanical and physiological justification is required (Waters et al., 1993), particularly with regard to adopted postures and fatigue development. The reduced knee range of motion (Park et al., 2010) and strength (Duvigneaud et al., 2008) and the elevated low back loads due to excess body weight may lead manual material handlers who are obese to adopt a more biomechanically advantageous lifting strategy. Corbeil et al (Corbeil et al., 2013). observed no significant differences in the trunk and knee postures between obese and lean manual materials handling experts while lifting at their preferred handling technique and pace. Frequent rest periods were provided during the task to minimize fatigue, representing a working environment with minimal physical fatigue. Task duration and the level of fatigue induced by the handling activity were observed to be not significantly different between the groups. However, they reported peak moments of force around the transverse, sagittal and longitudinal axes at L5/S1 to be more than double in both lifting and depositing phases for obese compared to lean handlers. The observed phenomena may not be due to different postural strategies, yet different motion time management. Xu, Mirka, and Hsiang (Xu et al., 2008) also reported a significant effect of BMI on trunk kinematics, with the obese group having higher peak transverse and sagittal plane velocity and acceleration compared to the non-obese group during a series of free dynamic lifting tasks performed at two levels of load and two levels of lift symmetry where participants lifted a box six times over 1 min for each task. However, peak sagittal flexion angle and peak transverse position were not observed to be affected by BMI level.

In most studies focusing on lifting strategy with obesity, participants were free to lift at their preferred pace and were either provided with ample time to avoid fatigue or the tasks were of short duration. Fatigue, as induced by extended task duration, has been shown to alter kinematics, leading to increased joint loading and consequently increased risk of injury (Potvin and O'brien, 1998; Marras et al., 2006). It also plays a role in the progression of pain and feelings of discomfort (Cote and Hoeger Bement, 2010). However, motor coordination may have different traits between obese and lean groups, leading to distinct kinematics during lifting. Controlling the lifting pace and resting time between lifts can give rise to both muscle-level and whole body fatigue and can potentially uncover the underlying differences between obese and lean manual material handlers working long shifts in a fast paced work environment.

Exploring the techniques used by individuals who are obese and are successful at lifting with no greater discomfort than normal weight individuals can support the design of lifting tasks as well as training programs for manual material handlers, not only in production settings, but also in the healthcare industry. Having more obese patients in the healthcare system, who need to be handled by nurses who may be obese is a contributing factor to the prevalence of lower back injury among healthcare staff (Humphreys, 2007). The current study aimed to assess and compare differences in lifting performance of individuals with and without excess body fat, while engaged in prolonged repetitive lifting, similar to an occupational setting. Findings will inform the design of future occupational tasks and training programs.

@&#METHODS@&#

Fourteen participants were recruited into two groups: non-obese (18.5 < BMI < 25 kg m−2) and obese (BMI > 30 kg m−2). All participants were male students recruited from the university population. Exclusion criteria included a history of lower back or knee pain and/or injury that would interfere with their completion of the experiment. Study protocols were approved by the University at Buffalo Institutional Review Board and all subjects completed an informed consent procedure after being informed about the details of the experiment. Anthropometric measurements, including body mass, stature, knuckle height, waist and hip circumferences and body fat percentage were measured at the start of the experiment. Body fat percentage was measured using a bioelectric impedance scale (BC-568 InnerScan Segmental Body Composition Monitor, Tanita Technology, Japan). BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were calculated based on the collected anthropometric measurements (see Table 1
                        ). All of the subjects in the obese group were categorized as Class I obese (30 ≤ BMI <35 kg m−2).

Participants completed two experimental sessions. The first session was used to determine the participants' 8 hr maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWL) according to the psychophysical ‘self-adjustment of load weight’ method used by Snook and Ciriello (Snook and Ciriello, 1991; Snook et al., 1970). Subjects started with very light up to very heavy loads and performed repetitive lifting for 20 min while being able to adjust the load to their preference. The procedure continued until subjects reached a load weight they perceived they could lift safely for an 8 h shift. The procedure was repeated three times and the average of the last two 20 min segments was used as the subject's MAWL. For the second session, the participant's identified MAWL was used to determine the task workload. As the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity during a fatiguing lifting task, only the methods and results from the second session will be reported here.

At the start of the experiment, participants were asked to stretch and warm up by completing a short period of light weight lifting. Following warm up, participants began the lifting task. Initially participants stood in a relaxed position in front of a fixed shelving unit (see Fig. 1
                        a). The shelf was adjusted so that the participant lifted a box (38 cm × 26.5 cm × 24 cm) from the ground to knuckle height and placed it on the shelf (see Fig. 1b). The box was lowered to the ground by a member of the research team. The box was filled with steel shot to a weight 20% above the participant's identified MAWL (obese: 21.2 (5.1) kg, non-obese: 21.2 (3.5) kg, p: 0.997) (Table 2
                        ). This value was selected to induce fatigue over a 1 h lifting period. Since psychophysical lifting limits are suggested to not be used to set lifting standards for frequencies higher than 6 lifts per minute (Karwowski and Yates, 1986) and due to the limitation of the experimental set-up, overloading was the selected method to induce fatigue in the subjects. Participants were instructed to lift with their preferred handling and lifting technique and were provided a short adjustment period to become comfortable with their foot placement and technique. Their foot placement was marked to ensure consistent foot placement throughout the task. Participants lifted the box at a frequency of 4 lifts min−1 guided by a metronome for three 20 min periods. In order to be consistent with the first session of the experiment, each lifting period was separated by 2 min of rest that was initially needed to weight the box. Overall each participant completed 240 lifts over 60 min. Every 5 min during the lifting task, participants were asked to provide a whole body rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using a modified Borg CR-10 score that was displayed in front of the participant (Borg, 1990).

The main measurements included heart rate and lifting kinematics (particularly acceleration and posture). Each measure was recorded continuously throughout the lifting task (see Table 3
                        ). Heart rate and trunk acceleration in all three axes (sagittal, coronal and transverse plane) were measured using a remote physiological monitoring system (BioHarness 3, Zephyr Technology, Annapolis, MD). Total acceleration was calculated as the resultant vector of accelerations in each of the three dimensions. Participants wore a chest strap instrumented with the heart rate monitor and accelerometer located directly beneath the subject's arm pit, or slightly (∼1.25 cm) to the rear. The device's shoulder strap was used to further fix the location of the sensing device during the lifting activity. The straps were visually inspected after fitting. LED indicators on the device confirmed proper operation. Heart rate data was transmitted at 1 Hz and accelerometer data was collected at 100 Hz. The raw acceleration data were smoothed using a fourth-order Butterworth bandpass filter with cut-off frequencies of 0.07 and 10 Hz, which also removed the acceleration due to gravity. Resting heart rate (HR
                        
                           rest
                        ) was estimated based on fitness level and age, using standard charts (Hoffman, 2006). Baseline heart rate was calculated as 1 min average of heart rate prior to lifting initiation. The task physiological intensity was calculated based on maximum heart rate (HR
                        
                           max
                        ) and heart rate reserve (HRR) and the observed changes in average heart rate (HR
                        
                           ave
                        ) following Eq.s (1)–(3). Trunk flexion angle was calculated using Eq.s (4)–(9) to convert triaxial acceleration as inclination angles relative to the gravity vector. In order to do so, the raw acceleration data, obtained from the physiological monitoring system, were low-pass filtered with a 5 Hz finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter, using a Blackman window and a filter kernel size of 255. The data were then converted to tilt along three axes, and the output was expressed as degrees in the range [-90, 90]. Compliment of angle X, the angle between the x-axis and the horizontal plane, represents trunk inclination angle. Total time and the percentage of lifting time spent in neutral posture (trunk flexion < 20°), mild forward flexion (20° <trunk flexion < 45) and severe forward flexion (45° < trunk flexion), were measured based on posture classification used by Punnett et al (Punnett et al., 1991). to provide a more comprehensive profile of lifting movement. Jerk, defined as the rate of change in acceleration, captures the smoothness of the motion, which can allow for differentiation between lifting patterns. Root-mean-squared (RMS) amplitude of jerk, calculated as first derivative of upper back acceleration during the lifting motion was used in the analysis. A lower jerk is indicative of a smoother lifting pattern (Hogan and Flash, 1987).

Wireless accelerometers (Trigno Wireless, Delsys, Boston, MA) were used to record acceleration data (triaxial, ± 6 g, sampling resolution = 0.063 ± 0.005 g/bit, noise level = 0.032 g) from the right erector spinae at L4/L5, and right quadriceps femoris, approximately 4 fingers above the knee. Sensors were placed along the longitudinal midline, according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The right erector spinae sensor was placed at L4/L5 level, with the x-axis aligned with the trunk longitudinal axis. The sensor at the thigh was placed approximately 4 fingers above the knee, such that sensor's x-axis was aligned with the longitudinal axis of right femur. Electrode placement was determined based on palpation and confirmed through corresponding muscle contraction exercises. These two segments were selected in order to represent movement patterns of the upper and lower body. The embedded accelerometer sampled at 148 Hz. In order to get the inclination angle from acceleration data, the raw acceleration data was first low-pass filtered with a 5 Hz finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter, using a Blackman window and a filter kernel size of 255 to remove dynamic impact component of the acceleration. Inclination angles were then calculated with respect to the horizontal plane and the gravity vector.

Coordination between the movements of the right erector spinae and right quadriceps femoris, as representatives of upper and lower body, was captured by the differences in timing of their movement based on the method described by Boston et al (Boston et al., 1993). Considering the up-phase of the lifting movement only, the midpoint was defined as the time at which half of the change in the angle had occurred and risetime as the time required for the angle to increase from 12 to 88% of the total change in angle. These values were obtained separately for right erector spinae and right quadriceps femoris during the first phase of each lift, when reaching for the box, and their absolute differences were used for analysis. Differences between the initial (minimum) and the final angles (maximum) of both muscles were used to compare their range of motion during lifting movement.

Lift duration was defined as the maximum time between the start and end of motion among the upper back, lower back, or thigh, measured from the respective acceleration data. All signal processing was completed using MatLab R2014b.

In order to study the effect of prolonged task duration on each dependent measure, the 10 initial lifts from the beginning of the first 20 min lifting cycle (t
                        1) and the 10 final lifts from the end of the third 20 min cycle (t
                        2) were included in the analysis. For each dependent measure, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model was fit with two fixed effects each at two levels (BMI group: N vs. O, time: t
                        1 vs.t
                        2), a random block effect for subjects (nested in BMI group), and the interaction term (time × BMI group). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the effects of time, BMI level and their interaction on duration and percentage of time in each trunk posture (neutral, mild flexion and severe flexion) within each lift during t
                        1 and t
                        2. Pearson correlations were calculated when possible correlations between variables and covariates were hypothesized to explain observed differences. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS statistics v22 (SPSS Inc, Chicago). Due to the exploratory nature of the analysis, a statistical significance level of 0.1 was used. If the interaction term was found to be significant then post-hoc comparisons were conducted using interaction plots and simple effects tests.

The main effects of time were used to assess the fatigue development for the lifting task. Both groups perceived higher exertion (RPE) levels after 60 min of repetitive lifting (p < 0.001, Table 4
                        ). The percent heart rate change from baseline also increased significantly from t

                        p < 0.001).

Maximum trunk sagittal anterior acceleration, transverse acceleration and subsequently peak total trunk acceleration, increased significantly (p = 0.003, p = 0.06, p = 0.035, respectively) while maximum trunk sagittal posterior acceleration did not show a dramatic change. The lifting task was symmetrical therefore trunk coronal acceleration was small and stable over the course of the experiment. RMS jerk was significantly higher during the final 10 lifts than the first 10 (p = 0.014).

There was a 5° increase in peak trunk sagittal flexion angle (p = 0.075). The percentage of lifting time spent in each of the neutral, mild and severe trunk flexion remained unaffected by time (p = 0.428). Over time, both subject groups lost upper and lower body coordination, such that the absolute difference between lower back and thigh segments’ midpoint and risetime increased by 150% and 119% respectively (p = 0.001, p = 0.004). Subjects were capable of maintaining their pace, both in terms of overall lifting duration and time sharing between postures, with only a minor non-significant decrease in neutral posture time and increase in severe flexion time.

Although the non-obese group started at a higher baseline heart rate (N: 89 (14.1) bpm, O: 79 (8.3) bpm), the percent heart rate change from baseline was unaffected by BMI group (N: 14.09 (15.9) %, O: 13.16 (12.37) %, p = 0.835). Final raw heart rate was also higher for the non-obese group (N: 138.6 (15.5) bpm, O: 134.1 (13.6) bpm, p = 0.031). Task intensity was significantly different between groups (N: 39.50 (13.73) %, O: 29.53 (13.0) %, p = 0.09). The higher intensity of the lifting task for the non-obese group may have been driven by the higher relative load for this group, as opposed to the obese group. Task intensity was strongly correlated with the ratio of external load weight to body weight (r = 0.69, p < 0.001).

On average, individuals in the obese group took 0.8 s longer to perform the lifting tasks (N: 3.18 (0.92) s, O: 3.98 (0.65) s, p = 0.051). The two subject groups exhibited similar peak accelerations in all directions, however the RMS jerk was significantly higher in the non-obese group compared to the obese group (p = 0.072). Participants who were not obese bent to ∼17% (∼10°) higher peak trunk sagittal flexion angle both t

As a confirmation of whether anthropometric limitations influenced trunk flexion, it should be noted that the peak trunk sagittal flexion angle was not strongly correlated with waist circumference (r = −0.4, p = 0.13). The percent of time spent in each posture category was similar, BMI was not a significant factor in the tested MANOVA (p = 0.36).

Neither lower back range of motion (N: 57.0 (15.0)°, O: 63.8 (22.5)°, p = 0.81) nor the thigh range of motion (N: 57.0 (15.0)°, O: 63.8 (22.5)°, p = 0.81) were affected by BMI group. There was large variability between subjects within each group preventing these differences from being significant. There was a mild negative correlation between lower back range of motion and thigh range of motion (r = −0.556, p = 0.039) and it was amplified among subjects who were obese (r = −0.885, p = 0.008). The obese group's absolute difference in upper body and lower body midpoint was twice the difference in non-obese group (N: 0.43 (0.41) s, O: 0.87 (0.50) s, p = 0.044). Although non-obese showed 50% shorter risetime differences, the difference only approached significance (N: 0.15 (0.09) s, O: 0.30 (0.25) s, p = 0.107).

As the task progressed, individuals in the obese group increased their trunk posterior acceleration while those in the non-obese group maintained their acceleration (see Fig. 2
                        ). The same pattern was observed in peak trunk transverse acceleration (see Fig. 3
                        ). Overall, there was a large within subject variability observed in many of the measured kinematic variables and particularly among the obese group. There was also an overall increase in variation by time, which reduced the ability of statistical analysis to capture differences between the two BMI groups.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

To date, no study has investigated the effect of prolonged lifting duration on the lifting kinematics of individuals who are obese. While previous studies have shown the significant effect of obesity on trunk kinematics during short lifting periods (Xu et al., 2008; Corbeil et al., 2013), the development of fatigue has the potential to affect obese and non-obese subjects differently. This study aimed to investigate lifting performance while fatigued by extending the task duration beyond previously tested lifting durations and setting the load weight to 20% above the MAWL. Although we did not measure the force producing capacity of the muscles and therefore we cannot ascertain that subjects were fatigued, 10 out of the 17 measured variables were significantly affected by time. In particular we observed an increase in risetime and midpoint differences of upper and lower body, indicating a loss of coordination and an increase in task intensity, which suggest fatigability of the task.

The individual lift duration remained the same over time. In contrast to previous mentioned studies on obesity-related differences in repetitive lifting kinematics, in which the experiment duration did not exceed 10 min, our subjects had ample time to set their preferred lifting pace and maintain it during the 1 h length of the experiment. However, over time subjects exhibited a less smooth and less coordinated lifting pattern. The 10% increase in RMS jerk over the final lifts is consistent with findings of Slaboda (Slaboda, 2004) in her study of lifting kinematics of low back pain patients and healthy controls, while they performed repetitive lifting for 22 min at 40% of their maximum voluntary static strength. Both subject groups also lost their coordination between the upper body and lower body substantially, as midpoint and risetime differences tripled and doubled respectively. In a study exploring the development of fatigue during repetitive lifting at 25% of maximal lifting capacity at maximal lifting rate to exhaustion (Sparto et al., 1997), a decrease in spine force generating capability as the task progressed was observed. However, a lifting pattern that is less physiologically demanding, such as stooped lift, can potentially compensate for the loss in force generating ability. As such, we observed ∼5° increase in peak trunk sagittal flexion over the course of the task.

Contrary to expectation, task intensity was higher for the individuals who were not obese. This may be due to the higher ratio of external load weight to body weight or to the consistently higher RMS jerk values of the non-obese group. A jerky lift has large changes in acceleration, resulting in large changes in the forces on the body, which subsequently elevates the heart rate. In a study of lifting characteristics of functionally limited elders, Puniello, McGibbon, and Krebs (Puniello et al., 2000) observed a positive correlation between hip strength and jerk. While obesity is not reported to reduce hip strength, lower jerk of obese subjects may reflect their cautiousness in this regard. Patients with low back pain are also found to adopt this prudent lifting strategy as opposed to healthy controls (Slaboda, 2004).

The 10° difference in peak trunk sagittal flexion angle between obese and non-obese subjects is similar to the difference Plamondon et al (Plamondon et al., 2010). found between novice and expert manual material handlers. In their experiment, experts used less back flexion and more knee flexion to get closer to the box. Individuals who are obese may also try to take advantage of this force-efficient strategy while reaching for the box. Subjects in the obese group seemed to rely on the lower body when bending to reach for the box and then on the upper body (trunk) once the box was in hand, while those in the non-obese group coordinated the movement in a way that both the upper and lower body were engaged almost simultaneously. In stooped lifting, less effort is required from the knee extensor muscles. Since knee extensor strength is reported to be significantly lower among non-active obese subjects (Duvigneaud et al., 2008), they may favor this lifting strategy. The greater negative correlation between lower back range of motion and thigh range of motion among the obese group suggests their tendency to benefit from this force-efficient lifting strategy. The additional technique to minimize the dynamic component of the total loading, used by subject with high BMI, was to lift more slowly.

Xu, Mirka, and Hsiang (Xu et al., 2008) observed 51% higher sagittal acceleration among obese subjects. While we did not see such a difference during the first 10 lifts, over time the obese group increased their sagittal posterior acceleration. The non-obese group however, maintained a consistent acceleration. Although at task completion both groups had equivalent acceleration magnitudes, the increase that the obese group experienced suggests a change in their lifting strategy over time. The overall lifting period in their study took no more than 6 min, thus participants could anticipate the imminent termination of the task and could minimize the lifting duration by accelerating. The current study, on the other hand, included 60 min of repetitive lifting and subjects had more time to plan the whole cycle and adopt a lifting strategy that minimizes the overall stress on them. The current finding suggests that under the tested condition, prolonged repetitive lifting may not have substantially different effects on type I obese compared to non-obese. However, the observed increase in trunk posterior acceleration among subjects who were obese over time has implications for job design, particularly those requiring lifting periods longer than 1 min bouts. While in the short term, subjects who are moderately obese seem to be able to plan the movement in order to minimize the overall load, there should be more caution in regard to the incurred changes in lifting strategy over extended durations of repetitive lifting tasks.

There are some limitations to the current study that should be acknowledged. There are some limitations to the current study that should be acknowledged. We aimed to investigate potential distinction in lifting methods of individuals with and without excess body fat, therefore we set the significance threshold at 0.1 for the data analysis to capture any differences that may exist. However, future studies to assess the observed differences in a more rigorous manner are warranted. Although the accelerometers were fixed on the desired positions using adhesive tape at the skin surface and athletic wrap that went around the body segment of interest, skin movement artifact may have increased the error in acceleration data and subsequently the derived inclination data. Also, in order to be consistent with previous studies of repetitive lifting, participants were required to keep their feet in the same spot during the experiment. Some subjects expressed discomfort in the lower extremity due to this, which may have prevented them from lifting as they would otherwise. Moreover, all subjects were students with no previous experience in manual material handling. This can limit the generalizability of the findings beyond novice workers. However, since novice employees have higher rates of work-related back injuries (Bigos et al., 1986), the findings of this study can be applied in order to reduce injury caused by repetitive lifting among novice workers who are obese. We asked subjects to lift a ∼20 kg box every 15 s, from ground level to knuckle height for 1 h with minimal rest in between. While the load and frequency are representative of manual material handlers’ work in occupational settings (Dempsey, 2003) the task duration may not be realistic. The 1 h duration was selected in order to induce fatigue in subjects, while in an occupational setting workers may get fatigued due to other work-related tasks beyond lifting. Finally, all subjects who were obese had a BMI <35 kg m−2, which categorizes them as class I obese; therefore the actual effects of more extreme obesity on lifting kinematics may have not been manifested. However, a majority of the population who are obese have a BMI <35 kg m−2 (Ogden et al., 2014), making the results applicable to a large segment of the population.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

With the growing prevalence of obesity in U.S., understanding its impact on work-related functionality is essential. As a chronic health condition with implications beyond excess body mass, the direct study of obesity, rather than relying on modeling approaches, helps form a solid understanding of the effects on performance of prevalent occupational tasks such as manual material handling. While the findings of equivalent MAWLs suggests the usability of existing psychophysical lifting guidelines for obese workforce, our more comprehensive look at the movement patterns that individuals who are obese adopt in order to maintain their MAWL over time suggests needed scrutiny for prolonged durations of repetitive lifting which may induce fatigue. Although subjects who were obese extended the lifting cycle time and adopted a more stooped lifting strategy, possibly to benefit from a more biomechanically and energetically advantageous lifting pattern, over time they accelerated at a higher rate once the box was in hand while non-obese maintained their acceleration. The increase in acceleration that this group experiences is suggestive of some changes in their lifting strategy over time. This acceleration pattern may have been used to minimize the duration of the lifting phase and consequently the overall load. They also experienced a greater loss of coordination between the upper and lower body. Although for short durations of frequent lifting, individuals who are moderately obese may be able to successfully work at the same psychophysical lifting limits as their normal weight counterparts, the observed changes combined with the greater weight of the upper body and lower knee strength may put them at higher risk of injury while engaged in prolonged periods of lifting or when lifting while fatigued due to other occupational tasks. These conditions are common among many occupations such as in the warehouse and light manufacturing industries as well as healthcare. Future research is needed to further investigate the effects of severe obesity on lifting performance while fatigued.
