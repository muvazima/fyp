                  A reliability system subject to shocks producing damage and failure is considered. The source of shocks producing failures is governed by a Markovian arrival process. All the shocks produce deterioration and some of them failures, which can be repairable or non-repairable. Repair times are governed by a phase-type distribution. The number of deteriorating shocks that the system can stand is fixed. After a fatal failure the system is replaced by another identical one. For this model the availability, the reliability, and the rate of occurrence of the different types of failures are calculated. It is shown that this model extends other previously published in the literature.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Engineering systems sometimes are considered as unit ones when the interest is focused in the behavior of the system as a whole. In many cases the systems operate under environmental conditions producing shocks that cause damage and eventually the failure of them. These conditions can generate different types of shocks (vibrations, heat, strength) that usually cause deterioration to the system. Several probabilistic models can be applied to govern the different systems under shocks, such as the competitive risk model when the different shocks can be considered independent. In general, the independence among the interarrival time of the shocks is usually assumed.

We study a system under different types of shocks causing deterioration and eventually the failure. It will be assumed that all the shocks arise from a source and they can be of different types. The shocks can cause repairable or non-repairable damages, these last are fatal ones. There are shocks causing only a mild deterioration in the system in such a way that it continues operational without repair, but the number of these is limited and after a certain fixed number of them the system is replaced. After a non-repairable failure the system is also replaced. Repair is as good as new. This system is studied following the matrix-analytic methods.

The study of shock and wear models initiated with (Esary, Marshall, & Proschan, 1973), in it the arrival of shocks followed a Poisson process. From then many papers have been written related to shock models (see Finkelstein, 2007, 2008; Tang, 2006, and references in them). The first version of this paper under matrix-analytic methods and incorporating an explicit expression of the reliability function of the system under shocks is due to Neuts and Bhattacharjee (1981). The matrix-analytic methods have proved to be useful in the study of reliability systems incorporating several types of failure and repair with a unified treatment from the methodological point of view. Neuts (1979) introduced the Markovian arrival processes as an arrival model of events to the positive real half line. These have the property of having dependent interarrival times, extend previous models and allow to consider more general models in the study of reliability systems under shocks. Neuts (1981) studied the phase-type distributions, these are being a versatile model for the study of reliability systems under general operational and repair random times since they are dense in the family of the continuous distribution functions defined on the positive half real line. In Asmussen (2000) a survey about phase-type distributions and Markovian arrival processes is performed showing applied aspects of them and indicating how to fit them to datasets. Other papers that have applied phase-type distributions to shocks and wear models are references (Frostig & Kenzin, 2009; Montoro-Cazorla, Pérez-Ocón, & Segovia, 2009). Papers considering phase-type distributions as a model for the occurrence of a wear failure and repair times, and Markovian arrival processes as a model for the arrival of shocks causing failure, each one independent from the other, are references (Montoro-Cazorla & Pérez-Ocón, 2006a, 2006b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Montoro-Cazorla, Pérez-Ocón, & Segovia, 2009; Pérez-Ocón & Segovia, 2009).

In the present paper there are several contributions to the study of reliability systems. (1) A single source for the failures is considered, governed by a Markovian arrival process. This structure allows us to include all the events associated to the different types of shock by introducing six parametric matrices in the Markovian arrival process, each one representing the rate of occurrence of the different types of shock. The behavior of the system is governed by a multidimensional Markov process. (2) Two types of failure are considered. This allows us to model the arrival of shocks to a system composed by two well-differentiated parts, as mechanical and electrical ones. (3) Every type of shock causes different damage in the system: minor, reparable, and fatal damage. (4) Policy K of replacement is included in the maintenance of the system and the performance measures are calculated in terms of K. (5) The performance measures calculated are: the availability, the reliability, and the rates of occurrence of the different shocks in transient and stationary regime. (6) A comparison among these measures for different values of K is performed to determine the system with optimal availability and rate of occurrence of failures. The expressions of these measures are given in algorithmic form to be computationally implemented and so to be applied in practical applications. The versatility of the Markovian arrival process to be a model for a very complex system and its algorithmic advantages are shown throughout the paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the multidimensional Markov model is constructed. In Section 3 the performance measures are calculated in transient regime. In Section 4 the stationary study of the system is performed. In Section 5 several special cases studied in the literature are included as particular and related ones to the present system. In Section 6 a numerical application is performed. Conclusions are included at the end of the paper.

The phase-type distributions, the Markovian arrival process, and the operations of Kronecker play an important role in the present paper. They are the basic elements in the application of the matrix-analytic methods. We define them formally for a better comprehension of the paper.

Let a system be subject to shocks produced by a unique source. Two types of shocks are distinguished. Each one of these produce several types of failures depending on the damage produced in the system. The occurrence of all these types of failures is governed by an MAP that will be defined below. The behavior of the system is governed by the following assumptions.
                        Assumption 1
                        The occurrence of the shocks is governed by an MAP.

Two types of shocks are distinguished, denoted by type I and type II, producing deterioration, failure, and replacement.

Fatal shocks cause non-repairable failures and consequently the replacement of the system.

Repair is as good as new, and the time wasted in it follows a 
                              
                                 PH

                            distribution of order n.

All the shocks produce deterioration and some of them are neither repairable nor fatal, so the system continues working after receiving them. It will be assumed that the system can stand exactly K deteriorating shocks. The system is replaced to the arrival of the 
                              
                                 (

                           .

The replacement times are instantaneous.

So, there are really six types of distinguishable shocks depending on their effect upon the system. These effects are failures that can be repairable, fatal, and causing deterioration, and everyone of these can belong to one of the types I and II. A model grouping all these types is necessarily complex. The matrix-analytic methods allow us to consider a model involving all these types of shocks and including interdependence between their occurrence times.

The MAP governing the arrival of shocks is assumed to have initial vector d and order m. It can be expressed as

                      collects the rates of virtual transitions among the exponential phases when no failure arrives. It governs the MAP between shocks. The rest of matrices are grouped in terms of the type of failure. They are formed by the rates of arrival of the different types of shock that can occur when the MAP occupies any of the virtual exponential phases.

We define the macro-states associated to this matrix structure that will represent the different physical situations that the system can occupy.

Macro-states are formed by vectors whose components are the number of deteriorating shocks undergone by the system, the phases of the MAP, and the phases of the repair. This order will be preserved. We define the macro-states.

If the system is new, it occupies macro-estate

                     . The performance measures we calculate are the availability, the reliability, the rate of occurrences of the different types of shocks and replacements. It will be assumed that initially the system occupies macro-state 0. The MAP initiates according to initial vector d.

Availability at time t is the probability that the system will be operational at time t. The operational macro-states are 
                           
                              0

                        , then the probability that the system will occupy an operational macro-state at time t under the initial conditions is given by

The reliability of the system at time t is the probability of being operational continuously from 
                           
                              t

                              0
                           
                         up to time t. So, during this time the system cannot be repaired. The transition probability functions 
                           
                              P

                         express the transition among macro-states during a time t, with no information about the intermediate macro-states visited during this time. These probabilities do not allow to calculate the reliability. We must calculate the transition probability functions among operational macro-states during a time t for those trajectories of the Markov process

We consider two special cases of the general model. The first one is the initial shock and wear model in Esary et al. (1973) under the matrix-analytic methodology. The second one considers the wear following a phase-type distribution and it has been published in Montoro-Cazorla and Pérez-Ocón (2006a) under some different assumptions. We present them here showing that the MAP allows us to extend previous works incorporating dependence among the interarrival times of the shocks.

Let the system in Section 2 be assuming that there is no repair. This is different to the initial shock and wear model (Esary et al., 1973) in several ways: (1) the Poisson arrival of shocks is replaced by an MAP simpler than the one in (2.1); (2) two types of failure I and II are considered, while in the initial paper only one type was taken into account;and (3) there is a limited number K of deteriorating shocks, while in the initial paper it was not. In both systems there is no repair, there are only deteriorating and fatal shocks, we have

This particular model has been published in Montoro-Cazorla and Pérez-Ocón (2006a). In it, the wear were governed by a phase-type distribution and the arrival of failures (shocks) were governed by an MAP. Their occurrence were independent. Wear failures arrived following a

This previous paper can be interpreted as a special case of the present one introducing an MAP governing all the failures (shocks and wear). In this new model there is dependence among the interarrival times of internal and external failures. We interpret the wear and the external failures (shocks) in the previous paper as type I and type II failures in this new model, respectively. Preserving the notation of the previous paper under the new model, the MAP governing the arrival of shocks has the parameter matrices:

We illustrate the calculations throughout the paper by means of a numerical application in stationary regime. The system we have studied depends on the value K and so all the performance measures. We present a system below and perform a comparison for the different performance measures in terms of the parameter K. Let a system be as the one defined in Section 2 subject to shocks arriving following an MAP whose parameter matrices are the following:

It will be assumed that the number of deteriorating shocks that the system can stand is K.

We calculate numerically the following performance measures for different values of K: availability 
                        
                           A
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                     ; rate of occurrence of deteriorating shocks 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ν
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                     ; rate of occurrence of repairs 
                        
                           
                              
                                 ν
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                     ;rate of occurrence of replacements 
                        
                           r
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                     ; and mean time between consecutive replacements 
                        
                           μ
                           (
                           K
                           )
                        
                     . All these measures are calculated in Table 1
                      for some values of K using computational calculations.

It is observed that from 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                      on all the performance measures reach a limit value and become constant independently of K. In Fig. 1
                      the rate of occurrence of shocks and replacements are represented graphically.

The availability decreases for 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           1
                        
                      to 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                     , and then it becomes constant. This is a consequence that there are more repairs when K increases and the proportion of time that the system is operational decreases. However, this occur only up to value 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                     . From it, the availability is constant.

The rate of occurrence of deteriorating shocks increases with K until 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                      and it is almost constant for greater values of K. The rate of occurrence of failures causing repair increases with K until 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           6
                        
                     , and it is constant from then on. It is observed that the values of the rate of occurrences of these shocks are significantly different, as it is shown in Fig. 1. This means that the source of shocks produces more failures needing repair than deteriorating ones.

The rate of replacement decreases with K up to 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           6
                        
                      and it is constant from then on, with values near to zero (see Fig. 1). For little values of K the system has a greater trend to the replacement than for values of K greater than six. We recall that the replacements are provoked by fatal failures or the accumulation of deteriorating shocks, then it seems that for values 
                        
                           K
                           >
                           6
                        
                      the rate of replacements is not affected, depending mainly on the arrival of non-reparable shocks (see Fig. 2
                     ).

In resume, the performance measures vary for little values of K but all of them are constant from 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                      on. It seems that the system does not change in their benefits when the number of deteriorating shocks is seven or more, as if there were stationary also in the number of deteriorating shocks and that this is reached for 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           7
                        
                     .

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have considered a system under different types of shocks governed by an MAP, a stochastic model whose interarrival times are dependent. Two types of shocks have been studied, and for them three different types of shocks have been included, depending on their effect on the system. This model can be applied straightaway to systems composed by two well-differenced elements, such as devices composed by mechanical and electrical parts. But many other systems composed by more than two parts and subject to more types of shock could be considered under the structure of an MAP in order to show the influence of the environmental conditions on the behavior of the system. The study of these systems would be similar to the present one introducing more parameter matrices representing the rate of occurrence of damages onto the corresponding elements in the MAP, and consequently more complicated calculations. The replacement policy K introduces the effect of certain type of detected shocks whose accumulation produces damage to the system. In the numerical example is presented a study of how the effect of the number of deteriorating shocks K can be used for designing and control of reliability systems by using simulation.
