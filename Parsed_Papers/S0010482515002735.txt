                  Carotid siphon is known as one of the risky sites among the human intracranial arteries, which is prone to formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Indeed, scientists believe that accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) inside the lumen is the major cause of atherosclerosis. To this aim, three types of internal carotid artery (ICA) siphon have been constructed to examine variations of hemodynamic parameters in different regions of the arteries. Providing real physiological conditions, blood considered as non-Newtonian fluid and real velocity and pressure waveforms have been employed as flow boundary conditions. Moreover, to have a better estimation of risky sites, the accumulation of LDL particles has been considered, which has been usually ignored in previous relevant studies. Governing equations have been discretized and solved via open source OpenFOAM software. A new solver has been built to meet essential parameters related to the flow and mass transfer phenomena. In contrast to the common belief regarding negligible effect of blood non-Newtonian behavior inside large arteries, current study suggests that the non-Newtonian blood behavior is notable, especially on the velocity field of the U-type model. In addition, it is concluded that neglecting non-Newtonian effects underestimates the LDL accumulation up to 3% in the U-type model at the inner side of both its bends. However, in the V and C type models, non-Newtonian effects become relatively small. Results also emphasize that the outer part of the second bend at the downstream is also at risk similar to the inner part of the carotid bends. Furthermore, from findings it can be implied that the risky sites strongly depend on the ICA shape since the extension of the risky sites are relatively larger for the V-type model, while the LDL concentrations are higher for the C-type model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well established that the formation and development of arterial stenosis are the result of a complex interplay between systemic factors, changes in the biomechanical properties of vessel walls, and local hemodynamic factors such as negative axial velocity and wall shear stress (WSS) [1]. Atherosclerotic lesions mainly form at specific sites of arteries, where low WSS occurs like bifurcations and curvatures [2]. The initial stage of atherosclerotic plaque formation coincides with the gradual accumulation of LDL particles on luminal surface. Different parameters affect LDL permeability of the endothelium such as pressure, LDL size, concentration, and lesions through the endothelial membrane [3]. Among many curved arteries inside the human body, the internal carotid artery (ICA) is more prone to atherosclerosis [8]. Therefore, understanding blood flow patterns inside ICAs can lead to the identification of patients vulnerable to atherosclerosis.

In primary hemodynamic studies, arteries have been modeled by simple 45 and 90-degree curves [9]. In more developed patient specific models, different shapes have been identified for ICA. Qiao et al. [10] and Oshima et al. [11] computationally examined the hemodynamics related to the couple of these geometries in search for the prone sites for atherosclerosis. Complex flows with helical and twisting patterns inside carotid siphons in vivo have been by employing 4D MRI imaging technology [12,13]. Newtonian blood flow in three types of ICA with sinusoidal boundary conditions was studied to find risky sites [14]. Zhang et al. [15] performed a comprehensive study for classifying the ICA shapes and provided three ideal models based on the average morphological data. In their numerical simulation, WSS distribution for a sinusoidal inlet velocity and zero gradient outlet pressure was investigated, while blood flow was assumed Newtonian.

Better identification of susceptible sites in the ICA requires exploring hemodynamic parameters and LDL mass transfer, concurrently. To this aim, appropriate mass transfer model should be employed for investigating LDL concentration inside the assumed ICA models. Modeling lipoprotein mass transfer in the arteries, three different models have been developed as wall free model [4], fluid-wall single layer model [5] and fluid-wall multilayer model [6]. It has been demonstrated that wall-free model can provide useful information regarding luminal surface LDL concentration, while keeps computational costs low [7,16]. Yet, very limited information is available about the LDL transport inside the ICA siphon. Deng and Wang [17] experimentally investigated the luminal surface concentration of albumin in the carotid artery of a dog. Wall-free model in a simple two-dimensional carotid bifurcation was employed to study WSS effects on the LDL transport [18]. Moreover, Nematollahi et al. [19] explored wall-free mass transfer model inside a carotid artery with and without stenosis assuming steady state flow. However, as mentioned earlier, mass transfer inside the ICA siphon has not received proper attention in literature.

In the present study, flow and LDL transport in three idealized ICA geometries are considered, while real physiological inlet velocity and outlet pressure are adopted. Idealized models are obtained based on each ICA type averaged morphological data, which makes them more suitable for parametric studies as comparing to the patient specific models. Previous studies included some simplifications especially on the blood flow profiles and Newtonian consideration for the blood flow that causes some uncertainties regarding their findings. Besides, mass transport to the ICA siphon and its arterial wall distribution has not been examined previously. Although ICA siphon is considered as a large artery, nonetheless at bifurcation and twisting sites, where local shear rate and WSS drop drastically, non-Newtonian aspects of blood flow become significant [20–22]. Furthermore, experimental investigation by Gijsen et al. [22] in a 90-degree bend (a simple model for carotid artery) showed large discrepancies, especially at the peak systolic phase, between Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood flow behavior. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the blood flow patterns, non-Newtonian blood effects and LDL mass transfer through the lumen and the arterial wall to identify the risky sites prone to atherosclerosis. Flow and mass transfer are simulated by the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM. New solver has been created in OpenFOAM to capture LDL luminal surface concentration. Flow patterns, non-Newtonian effect, wall shear stresses and mass transfer have been examined extensively identifying susceptible sites prone to stenosis along the assumed ICA siphons.

According to the anatomic classifications of the siphon, the ICA shapes can be classified into four categories U-, V-, C- and S-type [23]. However, most of the cases are of U, V and C type that have attracted more attentions. CT angiography technique is used to construct patient specific models of ICA siphon by the authors as well (
                     Fig. 1-I), where twenty patients were investigated and it was observed that U shape model is the more common model among four types of ICA models. However, to perform a more general study, idealized models of ICA are reconstructed following Zhang et al. [15] data as presented in Fig. 1-II.

Employing relatively complicated statistical and mathematical approaches, they reported geometrical specifications of all three models based on the averaged morphological data of 74 subjects, as presented in 
                     Table 1 while corresponding parameters are defined in 
                     Fig. 2-I and II. Fig. 2-I represents the location of characteristic points along the centerline of the siphon, where p1 and p2-located in plane 1- indicate the starting and ending points of the first bend, respectively, while p3 and p4-located in plane 2- show the corresponding points for the second bend. In Fig. 2-II, two views of the siphon are given. Details of the first and second bend planes are represented in Fig. 2-IIa and b, respectively. All necessary information for the construction of each model of Fig. 2-II including the angle between planes, curvature radius of each bend, bend angle and distance between two successive bends are listed in Table 1. The length of the straight sections attached to the inflow of the first bend and outflow of the second bend are 7D and 10D, respectively.

ICA bends are also named according to their geometrical features and locations. B1 is the second bend, which is also called the anterior knee of the siphon and B2 is the first bend located in the posterior knee of the siphon.

The unsteady nature of the flow is applied by the realistic velocity wave form at the inlet and pressure at the outlet, which are taken from Ho et al. [24], as shown in 
                     Fig. 3. The blood is considered incompressible with density of ρ=1056 kg/m3 and the blood vessel walls are assumed rigid with non-slip condition.

Uniform inlet concentration is employed for the mass transport equation, while zero mass flux is applied at the outlet. The continuity of mass flux is applied at the lumen-wall interface as

It is commonly believed that the influence of shear thinning properties of blood are not significant for the flow in large arteries [26,27], however, in arteries with acute curvature such as U type ICAs, the shear thinning effects should be considered as will be discussed later. Experimental results demonstrated that the Carreau–Yasuda model suitably predicts non-Newtonian behavior of blood inside carotid artery [28]; therefore, in the present study, the shear thinning is accounted for by employing the Carreau–Yasuda model [29] as

The governing equations are solved by the open source software OpenFOAM. PimpleFoam transient solver, which works based on PIMPLE (merged SIMPLE-PISO) algorithm is used to simulate Newtonian blood flow, while for non-Newtonian blood behavior, standard solver non-Newtonian ICOFoam is employed. To simulate the LDL mass transfer in ICA, a new solver in OpenFOAM has been developed according to the wall-free model. As in previous ICA siphon studies [14,15], sufficient information for validation purposes have not been provided. Thus, present model has been validated with available experimental data of Van de Vosse et al. [31], through a model of a carotid artery. Blood flow velocity profile in this bend has the same features as in real ICA siphon. As shown in 
                     Fig. 4, the axial velocity profiles at different cross sections are in good agreement with laser Doppler experimental results at Reynolds number of 300.

LDL particles that accumulate on the artery wall creating a very thin concentration layer due to the existence of infiltration flow through the arterial wall. This phenomenon is known as concentration polarization (CP). In recent studies that were focused on lumen surface concentration (LSC) in common carotid arteries [7,19], they validated their results by those obtained by Fatouraee et al. [25] and analytical solutions of Johnson et al. [36]. The same approach has been followed in the present study for a simple CA model at Sc=1.6e5. Lumen surface concentration for the Newtonian fluid is compared with the mentioned analytical [36] and numerical [25] results in 
                     Fig. 5-a. However, concentration variations in the radial direction have been compared with the numerical results of [25] in Fig. 5-b, where reasonable agreements can be observed.

A structured mesh is used for all models, which are relatively finer at the wall adjacent for capturing severe gradients. Extensive computations have been performed to identify the number of grid points that produce reasonably grid-independent results. It was found the minimum grid points of 50, 31, and 155 are required in the azimuthal, radial, and axial directions, respectively. Since denser grid points are required in radial direction to capture the LDL accumulation on the arterial wall, the expansion ratio of 1.1 is set in the radial direction. The time cycle of the assumed pulsatile flow is 1s. Therefore, the time step was set to 1e−4s to obtain relatively time accurate results.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Five cross sections along the ICA siphon are chosen to represent the detailed cross sectional velocity contours and axial velocity profiles. Lines A and B are located in the first and second bend (cross sections 2 and 4 in 
                     Fig. 6), which are commonly called B2 and B1, respectively. Line C is located in the fifth cross section of all models.

To gain a global view of the variations of the non-Newtonian velocity field through the bends, magnified views of three dimensional velocity profiles are presented for a U shape model in 
                        Fig. 7. The chosen cross sections are related to the bends, where velocity profiles undergo considerable changes. Fig. 7 shows that the relatively parabolic velocity profile at the bend inlet transforms to a very complicated profile at the first bend due to the centrifugal forces and the non-planarity of the bend. The point of maximum velocity moves towards the outer bend with a small back flow region located in the inner bend. In cross section 3, this reverse flow region extends and the centrifugal effects are clearer as the location of the maximum cross sectional velocity complies with the first bend. In cross section 4, the velocity profile is still under the effect of the first bend and the maximum velocity is located in the inner bend region. The complex velocity profile after the second bend is affected by the successive bends and the non-planarity of the exit section. For comparison, the corresponding three dimensional velocity profiles for a Newtonian blood behavior are also presented at the specified locations at the bottom of the figure. Despite the general flow features similarities between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian velocity profiles, details of the profiles indicate observable differences, which will be discussed in more details with respect to 
                        Fig. 8. The surface pressure distribution is also included, where the local maximum pressure in outer region of the first bend is responsible for the formation of the crescent velocity profile in this section.

In the first cross section of all models, the axial flow is almost fully developed, while primary effects of the bend create a relatively weak secondary flow from the outer to the inner region. In B2 bend cross section, as visible in Fig. 8-a2, b2, c2, Dean Structures form, which help the formation of the crescent shape in the axial velocity profiles displacing the maximum axial velocity region towards the outer bend. Clearly, the centers of the Dean Vortexes in Fig. 8-a2 corresponds to the two local maximum axial velocity points in Fig. 7. In cross section 3 of all models, Fig. 8-a3, b3, and c3 the strong centrifugal effects of the B2 bend are still present with the axial crescent profile, which is relatively limited to the wall region. However, the slight reverse flow region is apparent for V and C shape models as will be discussed later in more details.

The flow in the second bend of all models is more interesting. Curvature variations upon entering the second bend have distinct effects on the flow, as the peak in the flow profile begins to move toward the lower wall, a4, b4, c4 Fig. 8. Yet, the flow structure in this cross section and in cross section 5 is very complicated due to the successive bends and their non-planarity effects.

In 
                        Fig. 9 the axial velocity profiles in three different models at time 0.2s for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow behavior are plotted. Despite the fact that the non-Newtonian effect is commonly ignored for large arteries such as the present case [14,32,33], the results indicate that this effect can be significant whenever flow through successive bends with sharp angles and non-planarities is considered. Clearly, non-Newtonian effects are considerable in Fig. 9, where the axial velocity profiles are compared for the U shape model in cross sections B and C. However, in V and C type models as shown in Fig. 9-II and III, since bend angles are not as sharp as the U type, non-Newtonian effects are not considerable. Comparison of different shape models indicates that the second bend is more influenced by the non-Newtonian effects.

Since time 0.2s is corresponding to the peak of the inlet velocity waveform, it is interesting to see if non-Newtonian effects are also considerable at other times in the cardiac cycle. Therefore, for the U shape model, the axial velocity profiles are also examined for times 0.4s and 0.6s, which are shown in 
                        Fig. 10. It was found that the flow field in the second bend, again, shows non-Newtonian behavior along the lines B and C, while Newtonian behavior prevails along the line A, in the first bend. Clearly, the axial velocity profiles in V and C models are almost the same for A and B lines due to their geometrical similarities. Velocity profiles along the C line of all models indicate a reverse flow region during the whole time cycle, which is more pronounced in the V shape model. The extent of the reverse flow region throughout the cross section at time 0.2s is clearer in the inner part of the B1 bend in Fig. 9-II. Experiencing negative velocities makes this region to be supposed to stenosis.

In addition to velocity profile, WSS is a good indicator of the sites susceptible to stenosis. Malek et al. [34] showed that regions with WSS lower than 0.4Pa are more prone to stenosis; besides, mass transfer in multi-layer artery [35] indicated that LDL luminal surface concentration sharply increases by decreasing WSS from 1 to 0Pa. In 
                        Fig. 11 the cycle time averaged WSS contours along the ICA siphon in different models are displayed. Based on the abovementioned results, regions of WSS, which are also included the reverse flow regions, are the inner regions of B2 and B1 and the outer region of B1 downstream. These sites are more susceptible to plaque formation; however, the exact locations and their extensions vary between three types of the ICA. The regions indicated by green and red colors have critical amount of WSS, which is lower than 0.4Pa.

Two views of the luminal surface LDL distributions have been shown for each type of the ICA in 
                        Fig. 12 for the given diffusivity of 1e−11m2/s. In the U type model, the local maximum points of luminal surface concentrations are located around the inner part of both bends, which are consistent with the negative axial velocity in these regions (Fig. 9-a). Furthermore, the outer part of B1 bend is also prone to atherosclerosis in all types, as clearly shown in Fig. 12. However, the region of high LDL concentration is fairly extended around the inner part of B2 bend in the V type, while this region is relatively limited for the inner part of B1 bend as shown in Fig. 12-b. Similar to the V type, the inner part of B2 bend indicates an extended region of high LDL concentration, while there is no indication of high LDL concentration in the inner region of the C type. The outer side of B1 bend downstream in the U-type model and its inner side in both V and C type models corresponds to WSS less than 0.4Pa (Fig. 11), which indicates the relation between LDL accumulation and WSS distribution.

For more clarity, a three-dimensional view of cross sectional LDL distributions are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 13 for cross sections 2, 4 and 5, as shown in Fig. 6 of all types. Clearly, the inner side of both bends (cross sections 2 and 4) and the outer side of the second bend (cross section 5) have experienced more LDL concentration in all three models. In search for a relation between helical flow patterns and LDL concentrations, cross sectional flow patterns in Fig. 8 are helpful. It is clear from this figure that helical flow patterns are formed in the center of cross sections except for the cross section 2, where helical patterns are close to the side walls. Relatively lower LDL concentrations in these regions as shown in Fig. 13-a(I–III) can be attributed to the strong cross sectional convective effects of helical flows that reduces the polarization of LDLs in the ICA as also indicated in [37] for the aorta artery. It is also noticeable that the second bend shows a relatively higher and more circumferentially uniform LDL distribution for all models. For the U type model, the inner part of both B1and B2, for the V type model, the inner part of B1 and outer part of B1 downstream are risky sites. For the C type model, the inner side of the first bend and the outer side of the second bend downstream has most concentration (Fig. 13-III) in comparison with two other models, where a large area in the inner side of B2 in the V type model is covered by LDLs. According to the above discussions, C and V type models are more prone to atherosclerosis as compared to the U type, however, the extend of the high LDL concentration regions are larger for the V type model, while the highest local maximum concentrations occur for the C type model.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

It is believed that hemodynamics plays an important role in arterial stenosis [16–19,38]. Zhang et al. [15] performed a comprehensive study to determine the averaged geometrical specifications of different models of ICA siphon and conducted rather a general study on WSS in an ICA, considering Newtonian blood behavior for a sinusoidal velocity inlet condition. They concluded that there is a relation between the ICA types and the risk of stenosis, yet the locations of risky sites were not identified clearly. In an attempt to localize the vulnerable sits to stenosis, Zhang et al. [14] studied the Newtonian flow features in three types of idealized ICA geometry and boundary conditions and identified the first bend of C-shape model and the second bend of V-shape as the most risky sites. They also stated that V-shape model is more prone to stenosis in comparison with two other siphon types. In the present study, realistic boundary conditions and the non-Newtonian blood behavior are applied to idealized siphon geometries based on the averaged morphological data of a relatively large subject society. Furthermore, the LDL mass transfer has also been studied to examine risky sites in a more accurate manner. Based on the LDL distributions, it is observed that the extension of the risky sites is relatively larger for the V type model as also indicated by Zhang et al. [14], while the LDL concentrations are higher for the C type model. Consistent with the findings of [39], we also found that Newtonian blood behavior assumption underestimates the LDL surface concentrations up to 3% as indicated in 
                     Fig. 14, where the differences between the amount of LDL surface concentration for Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood flow behavior have been compared for three siphon types. Figure shows that non-Newtonian effects are more considerable for the U-type model as compared to the other two models. This is consistent with the non-Newtonian effect on the flow patterns discussed with respect to Fig. 9. As mentioned earlier, non-Newtonian effects become critical for large arteries with sharp angle successive bends as commonly assumed otherwise.

Comparison of LDL concentration contours (Fig. 13) with plots of the axial velocity (Fig. 9) indicates that regions with high level of LDL concentrations coincide with those of negative axial velocities. It is also observed that the formation of helical flow patterns close to the artery walls (cross section 2 in all models of Fig. 8) decreases the amount of LDL mass transport in these areas, which is consistent with the results of [37] for the aorta artery. Present findings demonstrate that the LDL concentrations increase considerably (Fig. 12) in sites with WSS lower than 0.4Pa in ICA siphon (Fig. 11), which is in accordance with the theoretical and experimental studies indicating that at low shear rates, the luminal surface concentration of macromolecules such as LDL increases very sharply [17,34,40].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Three different common geometries of the ICA were simulated by open source CFD software OpenFOAM to investigate the blood flow patterns and mass transport in ICA for identifying the risky sites prone to atherosclerosis. Realistic inlet velocity and pressure outlet was applied at the inlet and outlet of the arteries, respectively. Flow patterns, non-Newtonian effects, wall shear stresses and mass transport have been examined for all common types of ICA siphons. Previous studies on this subject predicted risky sites just based on hemodynamic investigation, however, more realistic predictions can be obtained based on the LDL mass transport, which has received much less attention in literature. It is also found that the non-Newtonian effects can be important in relatively large arteries with sharp angle successive bends as commonly neglected in previous studies. It was also shown that neglecting non-Newtonian effects underestimates the LDL accumulation up to 3% in the U-type model in the inner side of both bends. However, in V and C type models, non-Newtonian effects are relatively minor. The preferred sites of stenosis along the carotid siphon of the different geometries of the ICA are generally identified as the inner regions of B2 and B1 bends and the outer region of B1 bend downstream for all three models. However, the extension of the risky sites is relatively larger for the V type model, while the LDL concentration levels are higher for the C type model.
