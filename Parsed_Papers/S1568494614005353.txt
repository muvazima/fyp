               Abstract
               
                  The objective of this study is to develop a genetic programming (GP) based model to predict constant amplitude fatigue crack propagation life of 2024 T3 aluminum alloys under load ratio effect based on experimental data and to compare the results with earlier proposed ANN model. It is proved that genetic programming can effectively interpret fatigue crack growth rate data and can efficiently model fatigue life of the material system under investigation in comparison to ANN model.
