                  Innovation is a key resource for the well-being of national economies and international competitive advantages. First, this study develops a network data envelopment analysis (DEA) production process to evaluate the R&D efficiency and economic efficiency of the national innovation system (NIS) in 30 countries. Our findings show that the R&D efficiencies of the NIS are better than the economic efficiencies. Second, this study examines the effect of intellectual capital (IC) on the NIS performance through truncated regression. Our findings indicate that IC does play an important role in affecting the NIS performance. Finally, this study presents a managerial decision-making matrix and makes suggestions through a performance improvement strategy map to help government and managers improve the NIS performance.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the survey of 2007 global industrial technology innovation policy development, the Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finds that a large majority of OECD countries emphasize technological system and innovation because these two factors affect not only domestic and international competition, but also economic growth [61]. A technological system is the system that affects specific technology or industry. According to Carlsson and Stankiewicz [13], technological system is a dynamic network among economic entities in a specific technological area that aim to create, transmit, and apply technology. In contrast, a national innovation system (NIS) affects the overall development of innovation. That is, a NIS is the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify, and diffuse new technologies [28]. Technological system differs significantly from NIS on the following three perspectives. First, technological system emphasizes creations of new technology, while NIS focuses on the transmission and application of technology. Second, the strength of technological system in each technological area differs significantly within a country. Third, the classification of technological system is based on technology rather than national boundaries.

Since the seminal work of Freeman and Christopher [29], which studies Japanese technological development, NIS research has evolved into an important research agenda. NIS is formed by the interaction among innovation creation, transmission, and application of various institutions. In other words, NIS is an important contributor for economic growth when the interactions among various institutions are well organized. NIS not only offers recommendations on innovation planning and competitiveness enhancement on technological front to policy makers, but also attracts the attention of researchers in the field of economic and innovation. The establishment of NIS thus becomes more important because the interaction among government, research institution, academia, and industry could result in commercialization of technological research outputs, which in turn would increase national competitiveness.

The innovation of a country or an industry does not originate from a single economic entity; rather, it is a combination of a composite and systematic mechanism. According to OECD [60], the development of technology and innovation is the outcome of the interaction among corporations, academia, and government research institution. The knowledge and technology possessed by the personnel and institutions are the key factors in the innovation process. The development of NIS is to improve the network relationship among the system members, which leads to enhancement in the overall national innovative capability [59]. As noted earlier, the NIS performance is the primary determinant of national competitiveness. A holistic assessment that considers overall industrial effects would enable a greater understanding on the impact of NIS on national competitiveness. Besides, this can be guidance for technological policies and research resource allocation in a country.

To determine its own global positioning, a country can obtain the recent NIS performance of other countries from the historical data of NIS development. However, it remains a challenge to evaluate NIS, which is characterized by multiple dimensions, especially in a cross-country setting. To dates, there is no consensus about the NIS measurement. The common problems include the lack of consensus in the measurement model, ambiguous measurement indicators, and the lack of an effective holistic measurement model. These situations suggest that there is a critical need for a more objective and reliable measurement to express the relative efficiency of cross-countries NIS.

To ensure proper decision making, the performance of an institution needs to be measured using multiple indicators [16]. Most studies have recommended the use of multi-factor performance measure model to measure organizational operating performance [2,4,6]. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an approach that simultaneously evaluates multiple inputs and multiple outputs via linear programming technique to determine the production frontier as a basis of efficiency measure [3,33]. Traditional DEA models, however, ignore intermediate measures or interconnecting activities in a production process. Therefore, this study does not apply the traditional DEA that ignores the connectivity of internal economic activities. Set in a slightly different research setting, this study employs a network DEA model that is able to explore the ‘black-box’ process of NIS in estimating the performance of NIS, the R&D and economic efficiencies.

The comprehensiveness of NIS cannot be assessed merely through the performance. Other measurement methods should be employed to provide an overall assessment on NIS. In this globalized knowledge-based economy, knowledge, an important factor of production, has gradually replaced machinery, equipment, capital, raw materials, and labors. The concept of intellectual capital (IC) dates back to the work of Galbraith [31], where IC is interpreted as the difference between market value and book value. Stewart [72] suggests that IC can be deemed as a major source of enhancing or creating competitive advantage for an institution and it is also the most important resource of overall value creation.

Many scholars employ Tobit regression to examine the impact of a variety of external environmental factors on organizational operating efficiency [8,18,64,65,74,78]. Simar and Wilson [71], however, utilize truncated regression with bootstrapping approach and find that truncated regression provides greater validity than Tobit regression. Consistently, this study employs Simar and Wilson [71] truncated regression to investigate the impact of IC on the NIS performance of 30 countries.

The purposes of this study are threefold. First, we develop a network DEA model that comprises R&D efficiency and economic efficiency to measure the NIS performance. Second, we examine the relationship between IC and NIS performance using truncated regression with the aim to provide recommendations for improving NIS performance. Third, we construct a decision-making matrix and a performance improvement strategy map to assist countries to enhance their competitiveness through the integration of the network efficiency and IC dimensions.

The remaining sections of this study are organized as follows. Section 2 provides literature review. Section 3 describes data collection and research methodology. Section 4 presents the findings. Section 5 provides conclusions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The high-tech industry plays a vital role in a country’s global competitiveness. Numerous studies have examined determinants of industrial economy and global competitiveness (for example, [7,27,34,51,63,80]. Although there is no single accepted definition of NIS, the importance of NIS has been emphasized in various research such as business and industry [5,11,15,38,43,79], science [40], and policy-making institutions [1,19,22,42,46,58].

The institutional interactions related to innovation and the underlying production systems are the basic characteristics of NIS. The basic meaning of NIS is the national innovation effort invested by each division, which is transformed into economic development and productivity growth that ultimately gear toward national competitiveness. In summary, the definition of NIS in this study encompasses the developmental concept of industry, government, and academia to investigate the network operating relationship among business, academia, and research systems. From the innovation and knowledge creation perspective, NIS creates technological innovation, stimulates the development of the national economy [26,28,35,44,57], and ultimately the national competitiveness of a country [76].

OECD [60] analyzes the efficiency and interaction of various innovation elements with knowledge creation, proliferation, and application through a series of indicators. McKelvey [53] suggests that the adoption of NIS in new technology is dissimilar. While Freeman [28] emphasizes improvement on social and policy-related issues, Lundvall et al. [49] focuses on the interactive learning between the manufacturer and the customer. Nelson [57] emphasizes the company capacity and the creation of innovative routine. Freeman [28] points out that the interaction and mutual feedback among NIS members including enterprise, academia, and research institutions are critical to NIS performance. Specifically, R&D policy is an important factor that affects national productivity. However, changes in national productivity cannot fully explain differences in R&D policy, which is still likely to distort market forces. Nasierowski and Arcelus [56] are the first scholars to apply non-parametric DEA to unlock the relationship between countries’ commitments and both technological efficiency and productivity, in order to measure the input and output conversion process of NIS. The findings show that the interaction variable affects the overall efficiency.

The term “IC” was first proposed by the economist Galbraith [31]. He states that IC refers to the behavior of using brain instead of just using knowledge and mere intelligence. In order to create valuable IC, an organization should establish valuable organizational network to link the interdepartmental working team, and also to link the external parties like customers and suppliers to accelerate the company’s value creation. Skandia led the way in 1994 by developing and issuing the first IC report in addition to traditional financial report in order to convey supplementary information on its effort in measuring knowledge assets. Based on Skandia work, Edvinsson and Malone [24] categorize IC into human capital and structural capital. The structural capital is further subdivided into customer capital and organizational capital. They also provide market structure and guidelines of IC. However, there is no clear and consistent definition of IC. In summary, IC can be defined as intangible assets, or the value whereby market value exceeds book value, which in turn will enhance organizational value and nurture firms’ competitive advantage [25].

McElroy [52] proposes another theory, which highlights that extant IC measurement neglects social capital. According to the social capital theory, the mutual trust, mutual benefit, common values, networks, and social norms that exist in an organization itself and other organizations can increase the organizational values and inter-organizational values, which can speed up the transfer of information and the development of new knowledge. The theoretical social innovation capital is the firms’ collective capacity of innovation, which can be considered as the most valuable type of IC that forms the basis of organizational learning, innovation and adaptation ability. Thus, he proposes to incorporate social capital into Skandia Market Chart and suggests that IC should comprise human capital, social capital, and structural capital.

This study summarizes the classification of IC done by prior scholars and finds that the definitions of IC differ according to organizational culture and environment. Note that the focus of our study is to assess the NIS efficiency at national level and to conduct cross-countries comparison. Thus, we consider the impact of the characteristics of social culture and innovation. IC is divided into human capital, social capital, and innovation capital [21,52,56,75]. The relevant proxy measures of IC are summarized in Table 1
                        .

There are some other IC-related studies. For example, Lynn [51] investigates the cultural factors of different countries and the critical success factors of IC management using six companies from the United States, Canada, and Sweden as case studies. The researcher adopts Hofstede [36] four cultural dimensions indicators, which comprises power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance, to compare the differential impacts of organizational culture and national culture on IC management. The findings show that culture plays an important role in IC management. Inkeles [39] claims that the indicators in Hofstede [36] fall under social capital.

Dakhli and De Clercq [21] analyze the comprehensive development of a country to test the relationship between human capital and innovation. The researchers employ the conceptual social capital trust, organizational activities, and the citizens’ code of conduct to test the relationship between social capital and innovation indicators. Based on different social dimensions of 59 countries, their empirical results offer a theory-based model in that innovation involves human capital and social capital. The value creation of these two forms of capital provides a global point of view. There is a positive relationship between human capital and innovation, as well as between human capital and the social capital trust, and innovation in organizational activities. Summing up, human capital, innovation capital, and social capital are important intangible assets that drive social network, create economic value, and develop national competitiveness.

Evaluating cross-countries NIS performance is a complex process that needs to take into account multiple indicators. Employing multiple inputs and multiple outputs, this study constructs a network production model [17,41,47,50,68,69,81] that comprises R&D efficiency and economic efficiency to capture the linkages of internal economic activities effectively. Through evaluation of the cross-countries NIS efficiency, we identify countries that are relatively competitive and efficient as benchmarks for other countries. The inputs, outputs, and the network production process model are shown in Fig. 1
                        .


                           Input variables: Labor and capital are inputs that will directly affect the current and future development of NIS. The human components include total R&D personnel nationwide (RDP) and total public expenditures on education (EDU), while the capital components include the import of goods and commercial services (ICGS) and the total expenditures on R&D (EXRD). All of these input factors are deemed important investments in NIS.

Human resources are important assets of a country’s economic and technological development. RDP such as well-trained and skilled engineers, the willingness to work hard and astutely, the professional skill and management style involved, and integrative capabilities to make an energetic and risk-taking entrepreneurial firm are the main indicators to evaluate basic R&D ability [56,62,77]. In terms of enhancement of R&D ability, EDU can train and recruit talents in innovation to improve knowledge innovation and academic excellence. These initiatives can promote knowledge accumulation and create first-class research university to support R&D. In this knowledge-based era, continuous innovation in technological education will not only help industry upgrade and grow in a sustainable way, but also serve as a key factor to enhance national competitiveness [37,56,70].

In developed countries, the service industry evolves and gradually replaces the traditional industries. With values of the innovative service industry increasing rapidly, the developed countries have become prominent players in the NIS global competition through development in knowledge-intensive industries. ICGS is an important factor in fostering a country’s NIS [56,62], while EXRD is a crucial input that can affect patents, intellectual property, and academic research. [37,56,62].


                           Output variables: The output variables of technological research represent the skillfulness of a country in terms of investment in various R&D aspects. There are three types of output that are generally deemed as the final output in the R&D production process. First, published scientific articles (SAP) are concrete outputs of technological and academic research. SAP also serves as theoretical basis for R&D and strengthens a country’s development of technological education. Therefore, this study uses journal articles indexed in Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Engineering Index as the proxy [56,62,77]. Second, when R&D resources are constantly invested in large scale, the number of patents received is the most representative output indicator. For any economic entity in any country, patents not only protect the inventor of intellectual property but also show its unique and exclusive position in the market. Patents contribute significantly to NIS internal network R&D diffusion behavior and the acquisition of economic benefits. Thus, this study employs patents granted to residents (PAGR) as another output proxy in measuring R&D efficiency [37,56,67,77]. Third, patents secured abroad by country residents (PSA) should be utilized as a business tool in the global market to ensure that a leading position can be secured in the intense competitive global business environment. Thus, to enhance the rigorousness of our study, we employ effective PSA as output variable for R&D efficiency [37,56,58,62,77].

In summary, this first stage examines whether the ICGS and EDU improve the knowledge absorption capacity of citizens based on the concept of R&D. Furthermore, through RDPN and EXRD, outputs can be maximized, while input can be minimized for better performance. As a result, we name this stage as R&D efficiency. The input variables include ICGS, EXRD, RDPN, and EDU, whereas the output variables include SAP, PAGR, and PSA.


                           Input variables: SAP, PAGR, and PSA, the output from R&D efficiency stage, are inputs for economic efficiency stage. The rationale is that NIS is formed by the interactions and functions of innovation generation, diffusion, and application of various organizations. When there are proper interactions among these institutions, NIS will function effectively and can become a driving force for economic growth. The idea of the network model is that R&D capability should enhance national economic growth. Therefore, this study treats the outputs of R&D efficiency stage, i.e. SAP, PAGR, and PSA as the connecting factors or intermediate variables for national internal economic activities.


                           Output variables: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a country’s overall territorial economic output. It is the market value of all final goods and services officially made within a country in a year. Gross National Product (GNP), on the other hand, is the market value of all goods and services produced in one year by labor and property supplied by the residents of a country. It reflects the average income of a nation’s citizens. GDP and GNP are different. In its simplest terms, GDP is the value of goods and services made in a country, while GNP is the value of goods and services made by residents. As the world becomes connected, it is common that nations and industries have a multinational human resources allocation. Since we evaluate national decision-making units (DMUs), i.e. the national innovation systems of 30 countries in this study, we use GDP as an output proxy in measuring economic efficiency [55,56].

When comparing GDPs of different countries, the domestic currency has to be converted. There are two types of conversion, the first is using the international exchange rate, and the second is using purchasing power parity (PPP). The PPP is a concept that two countries’ exchange rates of currency equalize the difference in purchasing power between the two currencies. If the countries’ GDP is obtained through the above two methods, the ranking will differ. If we use the international exchange rate, it is unfair to those developing countries as the domestic purchasing power of consumers and producers could be underestimated. Therefore, we employ PPP as another output proxy in measuring economic efficiency [55,56].

Productivity is a measure of output from a production process, per unit of input. The definition of productivity is using resource creatively and effectively, and increasing the values of products and services. Productivity growth depends mainly on a country’s natural resources and accumulation of human capital. It enhances the technical level and improves the institutional environment. As a result, productivity growth determines the expansion of various resources, and affects the economic growth of a country [55,56]. Productivity (PROD), measured as the difference between real output value and real input value, serves as another output variable. Summing up, this second stage investigates the economic outcomes of investment in SAP, PAGR, and PSA. The outputs are GDP, PPP, and PROD.

In this study, all of the inputs and outputs data are extracted from National Science Indicators on Diskette, ISI Co., USA, World Competitive Yearbook (WCY) produced by International Institute of Management Development (IMD), and proxy statements. In conducting the performance measurement in this study, we employ the average values of variables for different countries over the period 2007–2009, which have been adjusted properly by IMD. The requirement to establish an international comparison imposes certain restrictions in obtaining a transnational homogeneous sample of national innovation system in terms of specialization. Another concern is the laggedness of outcomes relative to certain inputs. For example, the effect of SAP on final outputs is not immediate. As noted above, we use average values over the sample period, which solve the problem of laggedness [30]. After data screening, we have 30 countries as sample.

According to Cooper et al. [20], the minimum number of DMU observations should be three times greater than the number of inputs and outputs used when using the DEA model. In this study, the number of DMU is 30, which is at least three times greater than the selected variables in each stage. The two models proposed in this study conform to this requirement. Descriptive statistics of the inputs and outputs are provided in Table 2
                        .

Descriptive statistics show only the distribution of variables, but not the isotonicity relationship between the input and output variables. As a result, we follow Golany and Roll [32] to analyze the correlation between inputs and outputs. The results of correlation coefficients are shown in Tables 3 and 4
                        
                        . All of the coefficients are positive. We hence conclude that the developed network DEA model of the R&D efficiency stage and economic efficiency stage holds high construct validity.

The Tone and Tsutsui [73] network DEA model is employed in this study. The model is based on the weighted slack-based measure (SBM) approach that seeks optimal solution and accounts for the importance of each stage. Solving the black-box issue, we are able to consider the link within an entity. Moreover, we can evaluate each stage of DMUs’ performance [48,54].

The traditional DEA models (such as CCR and BCC models) that utilize the radial measure of efficiency are not appropriate in some cases because some of the inputs or outputs are substitution and do not change proportionally. Tone and Tsutsui [73] propose a network SBM to measure organizational efficiency. The SBM is a non-radial method and is suitable for measuring efficiencies when inputs and outputs may change non-proportionally. The SBM can be divided into three kinds: input-oriented SBM, output-oriented SBM, and non-directional SBM.

Accounting for both input and output slacks, the non-oriented efficiency for the observed DMU (o
                        =1,…,
                        n) can be formulated by the following fractional programming problem:

Prior studies have applied Tobit regression to examine the impacts of exogenous factors on DEA scores since efficiency values obtained range between 0 and 1. [8,18,64,65,74,78]. However, Simar and Wilson [71] verified that truncated regression was more appropriate than Tobit regression. In other words, they illustrated that Tobit regression was inappropriate to analyze the efficiency score under DEA. Their results indicate that truncated regression is superior to the Tobit regression. Therefore, following Simar and Wilson [71], we use truncated regression model to investigate the association between intellectual capital and the performance of NIS. The model is as follows:

                        . Since the distribution of εj

                        Table 5
                         shows the results of the network DEA model. The mean values of R&D efficiency, economic efficiency, and the overall efficiency are 0.918, 0.735, and 0.827. The results show that the R&D performance is better than the economic performance, indicating that most countries have good R&D capabilities, but have failed to create economic value through their R&D capabilities.

In terms of the R&D efficiency stage, 24 countries are deemed efficient, accounting for 80% of the sample. Among the regions, the average R&D performance of countries in Oceania and Asia are the best, reaching the value of 1. Meanwhile, countries in The Americas have the lowest value of R&D efficiency (0.696). With respect to the economic efficiency stage, 17 countries (approximately 57%) are found to be efficient. The regional average performance of the American national innovation system is the best (1.000), followed by Asia (0.940), Oceania (0.735), and Europe (0.659).

To understand whether significant differences on the efficiency performance exist among the different regions, this study uses the Kruskal–Wallis test [10]. At the significance level of 5%, we show that there is no significant difference on the performance of R&D efficiency stage among the regions. However, there is a significant difference on the performance of economic efficiency stage among the regions. Details are shown in Table 6
                        .

IC sources of future benefits that lack physical embodiment can be regarded as a contributor to national economic growth. A country’s NIS aims at increasing the R&D and economic value. Having a well-developed system will be beneficial to all residents; therefore, enhancing national competitiveness so as to grow will be the priority of governments. The best and perhaps only way for countries to perform effectively and efficiently is through a strong combination of IC and the development of NIS. To explore the relationship between intellectual capital and the NIS performance, we use three variables that are related to the dimensions of human capital, innovation capital, and social capital. They are described as follows, respectively. The IC-related data are extracted from the Greet Hofstede Analysis
                           2
                           Greet Hofstede Analysis database are constructed by Geert Hofstede et al. the website: http://www.geert-hofstede.com/hofstede_dimensions.php.
                        
                        
                           2
                         database.

The number of employee is the substantial index of human capital [24,45]. Employees who have R&D talent play a core role in NIS and they contribute to productivity growth and competitiveness by utilizing tangible assets and intangible assets in an organization. From the perspective of NIS, the proportion of R&D talents will affect the innovation activities. Therefore, this study employs the ratio of the number of R&D talents to working population as a proxy of human capital. This variable reflects the distribution of innovative human resources, and reveals the competitiveness and innovativeness of this country.

Van Buren [75] provide a succinct definition of innovation capital in an organization. That is, three core proxies used to measure the performance are the expenditure of R&D, the percentage of innovation in works, and products’ innovativeness. In essence, they are used in the production process of NIS to provide a country with a competitive edge. Furthermore, all of the inputs in R&D expenditure, the number of R&D labors, the cost of training and education, and the import and export business could bring about “patent” as the major output. Accordingly, we employ patent productivity as the proxy of innovation capital. Successful innovation capital is in fact a reflection of the contribution by R&D employees. Moreover, it also reveals whether the difference in the degree of innovation capital will affect the efficiency of the whole system.

According to Inkeles [39], the “uncertainty avoidance” variable that is developed as a proxy to measure cross-cultural differences by Hofstede [36] can be classified as a part of social capital. In addition, Nasierowski and Arcelus [56] also have confirmed that “uncertainty avoidance” variable has played an intermediary role in the NIS performance. Uncertainty avoidance is the level of risk accepted by a culture of a nation, which can be gleaned from the emphasis on rule adherence, ritual behavior, and labor mobility. Culture of a nation with low levels of uncertainty avoidance has greater tolerance for ambiguity and a less need for formal rules. The opposite will hold true for high-uncertainty avoidance cultures. On the other hand, if a nation has a high level of uncertainty avoidance, she will have more rigorous planning in the process of innovation system in order to avoid the occurrence of uncertainties. With rigorous planning, a nation can reduce the cost of non-essential spending on those uncertainties and the economics of the nation will be more stable and ultimately prospers. As a result, “uncertainty avoidance” is utilized as the proxy of social capital.

                            is the DEA score. HCj
                            is the human capital; InCj
                            is the intellectual capital; RCj
                            is the social capital.


                           Table 7
                            presents the descriptive statistics of the IC variables, while the empirical results analysis is shown in Table 8
                           . All of the independent variables are significantly related to the NIS performance.

In summary, in order to enhance the overall performance of national innovation systems, we suggest that governments recruit high-quality R&D team to strengthen global competitiveness. With respect to innovation capital, governments should increase the opportunities of innovation and research exchanges, as well as enhance the quality and quantity of outcome of the patent and other intellectual property to expand its economic benefits. We also suggest that governments could enhance the social capital by actively linking government agencies, business organizations, civil society, and academic research agencies to enhance national synergy effect.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This study further explores the condition of R&D efficiency and economic efficiency in NIS. The correlation between the two stages is significantly positive (coefficient=0.105). We construct a managerial matrix for decision making. In Fig. 2
                           , the horizontal axis represents R&D efficiency and the vertical axis represents economic efficiency. By assigning each DMU to one of the four zones, we can clearly define the benchmark to be emulated by inefficient countries. This provides an insight for governments to develop appropriate strategies for enhancing their overall efficiency. The analysis result as follows.


                           
                              Zone A
                           : The countries in this zone exhibit better R&D efficiency and economic efficiency than those in other zones. There are fifteen countries in this zone: Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Britain, Switzerland, Malaysia, Turkey, China, Spain, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. They can be deemed as a role model for inefficient countries.


                           
                              Zone B
                           : This zone includes two countries, namely Mexico and France, which have lower R&D efficiency but relatively efficient economic performance. We suggest that these two countries should strengthen the foundation of energy and enhance industrial cooperation, and continue to interact with various international institutions in order to reduce a great waste of R&D resources. Remodeling and renewing the process of R&D will increase the benefits to reach the synergy effect. Results from the uncertainty about the outcome of R&D suggest that technology is the priority task that would enable accurate and fast collection of information, and would protect the outcome of R&D patent and the intellectual property rights. In the aspect of human resource, they should hire high-quality technology professionals, and put emphasis on training and education to improve the ability of R&D management.


                           
                              Zone C
                           : This zone contains nine countries, namely Australia, New Zealand, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and Singapore. Their R&D performance is efficient but their economic efficiency is substandard. They should focus on reducing operating costs and making market-demand-oriented managerial strategies decision. They can select the key success factors for the development strategy, and commit to operating diversification in order to increase the value added and to maximize the economic value. In this case, technology that mainly lies in the innovation process are marketing communication and channel expansion, which are meant for profiting from R&D diffusion. As for the human resource, the governments should strengthen corporation among the industries, government, and academic institutions to increase the diffusion of R&D outcome to improve the overall efficiency of the nations.


                           
                              Zone D
                           : The four countries in this zone are Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and Norway. They are inefficient in R&D and economic performances. We suggest that these four countries should fully apply the improvement strategies in other three zones. For example, they should emphasize the strength of the R&D performance; managers should get rid of the concept that R&D creates greater costs and accentuate the concept of unit efficiency. To increase the economic efficiency, they should integrate the enterprise value chain, and participate in industry cooperation and technology transformation to strengthen the competitiveness of their NIS.

As Section 2 points out, IC plays a key role in improving the NIS performance. In this subsection, we discuss a performance improvement strategy map discussed. Continuing from decision-making matrix, we provide suggestions for countries in each quadrant to improve, focus, and strengthen their NIS through IC. Fig. 3
                            shows the map.

The performance improvement strategy for countries in quadrant A: We recommend the countries (i) to continue strengthening international exchanges, cooperation in science and technology policy projects, international intellectual property rights, and economic diffusion capacity (technology-related policy), (ii) to continue focusing on international trade and investment agreements, as well as regional innovation and the effectiveness of the national innovation projects (industry-related policy), (iii) to achieve economic growth and to integrate innovation with environmental issues, in order to adapt to the fast-changing world trends (innovation-related policy).

For example, Japan is far ahead of other countries in innovating new technology because Japan depends not only on the scale of R&D, but also the close linkage with the social and institutional change. The Department of the Government of Japan promotes economic modernization, with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) playing the role of to promote high-tech development, long-term development of the world market for its main functions, and close cooperation between large domestic industry and the Government (human capital strategy). The enterprise-level R&D strategy and technology introduction and the innovative changes viz. “factory is laboratory” bring about changes in innovation (innovation capital strategy). Training and education in science and technology have made the concept of quality and innovation common in Japan, thus resulting in an environment where Japanese pay attention to the uniqueness and innovativeness of goods and services in Japan (social capital strategy), and ultimately the Kingdom of innovation is formed [29]. Taken together, Japan can serve as the benchmark for countries in other quadrants to improve.

The performance improvement strategy for countries in quadrant B: From the intellectual capital viewpoint, we recommend that the countries should train and reward scientific and technological personnel (human capital strategy). Note that countries in this quadrant are inefficient in the R&D efficiency stage. Therefore, the countries should promote industry-university cooperation to enhance research and development. For example, they can improve innovative capital structure by integrating innovation learning into industry clusters (innovation capital strategy). Moreover, through production technology and innovative strategic alliances, innovation infrastructure can be improved and the allocation of resources can be optimized. To enhance learning efficiency, cooperation between university and industry is necessary.

The performance improvement strategy for countries in quadrant C: We recommend that countries in this quadrant to establish a better education and training system. Specifically, they should improve applied science and technology project management and innovative service quality (human capital strategy). The countries should advocate strategic planning on technology commercialization, product commercialization, and technology transfer. They should also encourage entrepreneurial investment (innovation capital strategy). Organizational process re-engineering and re-engineering, innovation-active corporate culture and goodwill, and e-commerce function are all important tactics to shorten lead time (social capital strategy).

The performance improvement strategy for countries in quadrant D: We recommend countries in this quadrant to enhance the research and development capability as well as the education and training system. They should create supply and demand markets. To achieve that, they may have to tighten their defense resources and cooperate with others (human capital strategy). Engaging in strategic alliances, encouraging studies in innovation, integrating technology diffusion among industry clusters are among the potential approaches for the countries to improve their R&D and economic efficiencies (innovation capital strategy). The government should give tax incentives or incentive allowances. Institutional bodies also should support and promote innovation. Financial system support should be built (social capital strategy).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study employs a network DEA model to investigate the efficiency of NIS. From the findings, we offer some managerial implications through a decision-making matrix. Moreover, we determine the impact of intellectual capital on the overall performance using truncated regression. Our research findings may offer some suggestion to improve the NIS performance and resource allocation. The findings are as follows. Generally, NIS is efficient in R&D context but needs improvement in economic efficiency. America NIS is the most efficient one in terms of both R&D efficiency and economic efficiency stages. The countries that are efficient in R&D efficiency stage are not necessary efficient in the economic efficiency stage. The countries that are efficient in both stages include Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Malaysia, Turkey, China, Spain, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. The overall efficiency of R&D inefficient countries can be improved through economic efficiency. For example, Mexico and France are inefficient in R&D efficiency but their overall efficiencies are still satisfactory because of good efficiencies in economic performance. With regards to our regression analysis, IC is significantly related to NIS efficiency. This result shows that the recruit of high quality R&D talent, participation in industry, government, academia, research institutions to increase innovation and research exchange opportunities could improve the quality and quantity of R&D outcomes. Educational training can be held frequently to strengthen organizational competitiveness and foster teamwork to further maximize the organizational economic benefits.
