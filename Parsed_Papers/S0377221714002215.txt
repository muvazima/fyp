                  We investigate a newsvendor-type retailer sourcing problem under demand uncertainty who has the option to source from multiple suppliers. The suppliers’ manufacturing costs are private information. A widely used mechanism to find the least costly supplier under asymmetric information is to use a sealed-bid reverse auction. We compare the combinations of different simple auction formats (first- and second-price) and risk sharing supply contracts (push and pull) under full contract compliance, both for risk-neutral and risk-averse retailer and suppliers. We show the superiority of a first-price push auction for a risk-neutral retailer. However, only the pull contracts lead to supply chain coordination. If the retailer is sufficiently risk-averse, the pull is preferred over the push contract. If suppliers are risk-averse, the first-price push auction remains the choice for the retailer. Numerical examples illustrate the allocation of benefits between the retailer and the (winning) supplier for different number of bidders, demand uncertainty, cost uncertainty, and degree of risk-aversion.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the past decades there has been a trend towards outsourcing the production of goods and services. For example, manufacturers in the automotive industry spent an average of 
                        
                           65
                           %
                        
                      of their costs on goods and services from external suppliers. In order to minimize procurement costs, many companies purchase via reverse auctions and use online bidding systems. The Volkswagen Group, for instance, has a purchase volume of over 
                        
                           75.4
                        
                      billion Euro and has been using electronic reverse auctions as one standard tool in global procurement since 2003 (Sanz, Semmler, & Walther, 2007). Due to the high amount of transaction volumes traded through reverse auctions, their design is critical and poses important challenges. In comparison to traditional purchasing methods, reverse auctions allow for high cost savings when used correctly (Tunca & Wu, 2009).

Current business practice shows that fixed quantity procurement auctions are predominately used, even though they are not always optimal, especially under demand uncertainty. There exist many practical auction examples where demand can be adjusted after the price has been determined (Li & Scheller-Wolf, 2011; McAdams, 2007) and flexible auctions receive increasing attention. For example, taking the newsvendor as the simplest single-product problem under demand uncertainty, the optimal order quantity for a retailer (buyer) depends on the purchasing price and it is not appropriate for treating these procurement problems as simple single-unit auctions. It has already been shown that abandoning fixed quantity auctions and allowing the possibility of adjusting quantities after procurement prices are known results in lower purchasing prices (Hansen, 1988) and enables higher profits for the purchasing company (McAdams, 2007). However, allowing to adjust quantities after observing prices makes the computation of optimal bidding strategies more complex.

Although there are many possibilities for allocating demand risk within a supply chain, the two extremes of push and pull contracts are simple and easy to implement. Because their only parameter is the wholesale price, they find higher acceptance in practice than complex multi-attribute auctions (Elmaghraby, 2007; Li & Scheller-Wolf, 2011). Under a push contract, the retailer has to decide about the purchasing quantity before demand is known and the manufacturer produces the order quantity. The retailer bears all the risk of ordering too many or too few. Under a pull contract, the retailer postpones the order until demand is known. In this case, the supplier bears all the demand risk and must produce or build capacity when demand is still uncertain (e.g. Cachon, 2004). If the retailer or the suppliers are risk-averse, there is an additional benefit from using push or pull contracts as an effective instrument to shift demand risk within the supply chain.

We analyze and compare simple auction and contract formats in a newsvendor sourcing problem under information asymmetry about the suppliers’ manufacturing cost and flexible order quantities. We therefore evaluate the allocation of profits from the retailer’s, the suppliers’, and the entire supply chain’s perspective. The options considered for auction design are the two most prominent first- and second-price auctions. For contract design, we limit the choice to simple pure push and pull contracts. We extend the work of Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) by (1) additionally including first-price auctions, (2) enforcing supply contract compliance by introducing a common outside procurement option, and (3) risk-averse decision makers either on the supply or retail side. We show the dominance of first-price auctions and clear preferences of a push contract under risk-neutrality and full contract compliance. Furthermore, the numerical results show the impact of competition (number of bidders), cost and demand uncertainty, and the degree of risk-aversion on supply chain efficiency and profit allocation in the supply chain through the investigated auction and contract formats. The contribution to the literature is therefore the application of known formats and results from auction theory to the supply contracting problems and enabling the comparison of different format-contract setups under risk-neutral and risk-averse decision making.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We review the relevant literature in Section 2. Section 3 describes and analyzes the model in detail. The influence of risk aversion is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents an example with closed form solutions, followed by numerical studies in Section 6. Section 7 contains concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#


                     Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011) provide a review of the newsvendor problem, including the issue of risk-aversion. Cachon (2003) provides a survey of supply contracts and coordination. Lariviere and Porteus (2001) analyze wholesale price contracts in the context of the newsvendor problem with a manufacturer selling to a retailer that faces uncertain demand. They show how market size and demand variability influence the optimal wholesale price set by the manufacturer. Cachon and Lariviere (2001) address the problem of information asymmetry about demand forecasts and study contracts that allow for sharing demand forecast credibly. Cachon (2004) compares push and pull contracts and proposes an advance-purchase discount where the risk of demand is shared by shifting the excess inventory risk from the supplier to the manufacturer. Contrary to the push and pull contracts, this advance-purchase discount allows to coordinate the supply chain and achieves an efficient production quantity. Comparing push and pull, Cachon shows that the pull contract leads to a higher efficiency than the push contract. Perakis and Roels (2007) compare push and pull contracts and characterize efficiency depending on various supply chain configurations such as different numbers of stages in the supply chain and the number of competing suppliers or competing retailers. They show that under a push contract more competition always leads to higher efficiency. However, in a pull contract more competition can also decrease supply chain efficiency.

While in simple single-unit auctions the format does not matter, a sealed-bid first-price auction leads to different profits in multi-unit auctions in comparison with a second-price auction or an open English auction. The retailer therefore has to choose the auction format wisely. Elmaghraby (2000), Elmaghraby (2007) and Pinker, Seidmann, and Vakrat (2003) provide comprehensive surveys about sourcing, online auctions and internet enabled marketplaces.


                     Dasgupta and Spulber (1990) study different procurement auctions for companies facing downward sloping demand curves. Chen (2007) enhances this model and derives general conditions for a firm’s optimal auction mechanism that selects a supplier and determines the procurement quantity and corresponding payments. He proposes an auction where the retailer determines the optimal quantity-payment schedule. In order to be able to set up this optimal schedule, the retailer needs specific information concerning the cost distribution of the suppliers. As opposed to Chen (2007), we consider price-only auctions where the retailer does not need any specific information about the suppliers’ cost distribution to select the optimal contract. Duenyas, Hu, and Beil (2013) provide an extension of Chen (2007) by studying a more simple auction. They show its optimality for ex-ante asymmetric suppliers and a class of non-linear production costs. Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011) compare different auction designs for a buyer facing uncertain demand using an open descending price-only auction format (English auction). Using an open auction format and letting the supplier determine the service level of supply, they show that intense competition in pull contracts can lead to lower retailer profits. To address this, they propose an enhanced pull contract that enables a certain service level and establish how characteristics of demand and supply influence the retailer’s preferences between a push and an (enhanced) pull mechanism. The authors show that the retailer prefers a push mechanism if supplier competition is high and a pull mechanism if demand uncertainty or the supplier cost level is relatively high. In contrast to Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011), we consider sealed-bid auctions and thus are able to implement a first-price auction that leads to lower purchasing prices in push contracts than in an open auction format. By enforcing contract compliance using an outside option, rather than choosing a service level in pull contracts, we can establish that more competition between suppliers always leads to higher expected retailer profits.


                     Hansen (1988) considers the impact of endogenous quantities in procurement auctions under deterministic, price-sensitive demand. He shows that the auctioneer always prefers a first-price to a second-price auction and that the first-price dominates the second-price auction from the perspective of the total surplus of the considered economy as well. Milgrom (1989) also discusses this model and shows the same results by using the envelope theorem. Spulber (1995) and Lofaro (2002) analyze a similar framework for Bertrand competition where the rivals costs are unknown. Further, Ausubel and Cramton (2002) show how inefficiency occurs under multi-unit forward auctions if large bidders have an influence on the price under a uniform price auction. They show that efficiency and revenue rankings of the uniform-price and pay-as-bid auctions are inherently ambiguous. In some situations, the pay-as-bid auction leads to an efficient outcome while the uniform-price auction does not and vice versa.

For a risk-averse newsvendor, Cachon (2003) provides an overview of the literature. Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) determine comparative-static effects for changes in price and cost parameters. They further study the effect of an increase of the newsvendor’s riskiness or the addition of background risks. Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) study the role of intermediaries offering the possibility of emergency orders and buy-back options in supply chains with risk-averse retailers and Gan, Sethi, and Yan (2004) study the coordination of supply chains with risk-averse agents. Keren and Pliskin (2006) set a benchmark by deriving a closed form solution of the risk-averse newsvendor for a special case of uniform demand. Wang, Webster, and Suresh (2009) provide insights on how selling prices influence the risk-averse newsvendor and thus investigate some limitations of the expected utility theory.

We follow the common modeling philosophy in supply chain management to analyze a stand-alone newsvendor. This restrictive assumption of independence from market considerations is relaxed in Anvari (1987) who uses the capital asset pricing model for studying a newsvendor facing uncertain demand. If the relevant risk of the inventory investment is considered in the market-valuation model, results differ in comparison to the classical expected benefit maximization framework and order quantities are lower. Gaur and Seshadri (2005) study the impact of financial hedging in a newsvendor set-up, where demand is correlated with the price of a financial asset. They show that hedging reduces the variance of profit and increases the expected utility of a risk-averse decision maker. Ding, Dong, and Kouvelis (2007) consider financial hedging against exchange risks and show how financial hedging influences operational strategy and can lead to altering global supply chain choices of a risk-averse firm.

Concerning auctions with risk-averse agents, Maskin and Riley (1984), Matthews (1987) and Waehrer, Harstad, and Rothkopf (1998) provide seminal results for single-unit auctions. Maskin and Riley (1984) show that first-price auctions are optimal for a risk-neutral seller with risk-averse buyers, whereas Matthews (1987) examines the buyer’s point of view. Waehrer et al. (1998) consider risk-averse bid takers and risk-neutral bidders and show that first-price auctions are optimal in this case. Our paper contributes to this field by investigating how effects of risk-averse bidding and risk-averse capacity planning affect each other and influence resulting profits. A combined study allows to investigate how risk-aversion shifts the preferences towards specific auction and contract designs.

Therefore, these products can only be supplied by manufacturers with short reaction times. This high responsiveness leads to the high cost of the outside option (e.g. for investments in responsive capacities, use of faster supply modes, etc.). The manufacturers that participate at the auction considered here cannot supply to this market and take advantage of the high price z, as they have a long reaction time and their production has to start before demand is known. Left-overs cannot be sold to this market either, as they are customized for the particular sourcing company. Instead of an outside option, one might also assume that demand is lost if it cannot be satisfied. If the supplier has to compensate the retailer for lost sales under a pull contract, an obvious compensation would be the retailer’s margin 
                        
                           p
                           -
                           w
                        
                     , where w denotes the wholesale price. This is equal to setting 
                        
                           z
                           =

                     . For a study of pull contracts without second order option and where suppliers do not have to compensate the retailer for lost sales, we refer to Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011).

The retailer chooses the auction format (first-price sealed-bid or second-price sealed-bid to select a supplier and to determine the wholesale price) and the supply contract (push or pull). In the first-price auction, the lowest bid wins and the winner has to supply the product at the bidding price. In the second-price auction, the lowest bid wins but the buyer pays the second lowest bid for the supplied product.

The suppliers compete for the right to supply the retailer through price bidding. The contract is fully awarded to the lowest bidder and the supply quantity

                         is determined directly after the auction and thus after the determination of the wholesale price w through an auction, but before the final demand is realized. The retailer determines the optimal order quantity, which maximizes the expected retailer profit for a given wholesale price w.

On the right-hand side of Eq. (3), the numerator is obviously always positive. The same holds for the denominator. A negative denominator would imply that the bidder could, by decreasing the bid, increase the profit in case of winning and the probability of winning at the same time, which is not an equilibrium. Therefore, the whole term is always positive and bids are increasing in costs since in an equilibrium it has to hold that

                              Under a push contract, the first-price auction leads to lower expected prices than the second-price auction.
                           

In the first-price auction, the bidder has to consider that the quantity sold decreases with the bid. This leads to more aggressive bidding, whereas the bid in the second-price auction does not depend on whether the quantity sold is fixed or variable. The expected profit for the retailer under a first-price push auction is

In a second-price pull auction, all suppliers’ dominant strategy is to bid at expected unit costs. In the push contract, the winning supplier delivers a given quantity, i.e., the total cost is the supplied quantity multiplied by the marginal cost. However, in the pull contract the winning supplier has to build up capacity before knowing how much to deliver and eventually has to buy extra units if demands exceed capacity. Thus, the total cost depends on the realized demand and at the time of bidding, a supplier can only assess expected total cost of the pull contract. Therefore, the ex-ante bid is equal to the expected and not the ex-post cost. Therefore, an equilibrium bid 
                           
                              b
                              (
                              c
                              )
                           
                         satisfies that expected supplier profits in case of supplying the good at a wholesale price 
                           
                              w
                              =
                              b
                              (
                              c
                              )
                           
                         must be zero. Otherwise, a supplier could increase the chance to win the auction by decreasing the bid without changing the outcome as the realized price is determined according to the second-price logic. However, as we consider a pull contract, the bid has to account for the extra cost of taking the entire demand risk. Note that when taking the realized wholesale price into account, the expected supplier profit is positive.

                              Under a pull contract the revenue equivalence theorem holds. The first-price and the second-price auctions lead to the same expected prices and profits for the retailer and every supplier.
                           

Under a push contract, the first-price auction always leads to lower expected prices than the second-price auction because the order quantity is endogenous and decreasing in the wholesale price w. Under both pull contracts, the order quantities are independent of the wholesale price and thus the outcome is independent of the auction format. Since the revenue equivalence theorem holds for the pull contract, an open-bid auction such as an English auction would also lead to the same result as the considered sealed-bid auctions. From the revenue equivalence theorem, the optimal bid of a bidder in the first-price auction must be equal to the expected lowest bid of the remaining bidders in the second-price auction, assuming that this bidder has the lowest costs. Thus,

                        . Therefore, total supply chain profits are higher under a pull contract than under a push contract and a social planner would choose a pull contract. The auction design (first- or second-price auction) is irrelevant. When comparing both push auctions, we find two opposing effects. On the one hand, the profit function of the retailer is convex in the resulting wholesale price (see the appendix for a proof). Since the spread of resulting wholesale prices is now higher under the second-price auction than under the first-price auction, this effect favors the second-price auction. On the other hand, we have shown that the first-price auction leads to lower prices than the second-price auction.
                           Conjecture 1
                           
                              The first-price push contract yields higher expected retailer profits than the second-price push contract.
                           

The conjecture is confirmed by all numerical results and will be proven for special cases (see Section 5).
                           Lemma 2
                           
                              The second-price push contract leads to the same expected retailer profits as a (first- or second-price) pull contract.
                           

The pull contract coordinates the supply chain, but under a wholesale price-only contract, the retailer cannot benefit from the higher overall supply chain profit. If the retailer chooses a pull contract instead of a second-price push contract, the retailer’s profit remains the same while the supplier receives the whole surplus created through the supply chain coordinating pull contract.

This is caused by the fact that under the second-price contract, no matter if push or pull, the suppliers bid at their actual (in case of push) or expected (in case of pull) cost and therefore the retailer’s profit depends on the cost of the supplier with the second lowest cost. For the supply chain profits we can observe a change in the dependency. If a pull contract is chosen, the bidder with the lowest cost determines the total production quantity. Under a push contract, the quantity depends on the cost of the supplier with the second lowest cost. Consequently, as the suppliers profits are equal to the difference of the supply chain profits and the retailer profits, they increase with a switch from the push to the pull contract. Comparing both push contracts, a supplier prefers the first-price contract, as the quantity sold is higher (see Hansen, 1988 & Milgrom, 1989).

As the first-price push contract enables lower expected prices than the second-price push contract and the retailer is indifferent between a second-price push and a pull contract, the retailer would never prefer a pull contract to a push contract. The retailer’s dominant strategy is to not choose the supply chain coordinating contract (see Table 1
                        ).

This result on overall supply chain efficiency and retailer benefit is reinforced by increasing competition between bidders. The retailer and the supply chain always benefit from increasing supply competition and have an incentive to let as many suppliers participate in the auction as possible.
                           Corollary 1
                           
                              For both push and pull contracts expected retailer and supply chain profits increase in the number of bidders.
                           

In the previous section, demand risk allocation was implicitly incorporated through the choice of a push or pull contract. There are additional benefits from shifting the risk in a supply chain if the decision makers are risk-averse, rather than risk-neutral. Next, we analyze how one-sided risk-aversion, both on the retail and supply-side, affects the contract and auction format choice. We define the utility function

                                       A risk-averse retailer sourcing via a pull contract always prefers the first-price auction.
                                    


                                       A retailer with a low risk aversion prefers the push contract to the pull contract, but if the risk aversion is high enough, the retailer prefers the first-price pull contract.
                                    


                                       If the utility function fulfills the property decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA, which includes constant absolute risk aversion (CARA)), the first-price push auction leads to lower expected prices than the second-price push auction.
                                    

Under a pull contract, the supplier takes the whole demand risk. For a retailer with low risk-aversion, the first-price push contract is preferred because of more aggressive bidding under endogenous quantities. However, a retailer with high risk-aversion prefers the pull contract to avoid demand risk. Since the bidding behavior in the second-price push and second-price pull contract does not change, the retailer always prefers the second-price pull contract to the second-price push contract (for a proof see Theorem 2.1 in Agrawal & Seshadri, 2000). This implies that the first-price pull contract dominates the second-price push contract. As the wholesale prices remain the same, a risk-averse retailer prefers the contract where the supplier bears the entire risk.

Assume a risk-neutral retailer and risk-averse suppliers with symmetric utility functions 
                           
                              u
                              (
                              z
                              )
                           
                        .
                           Lemma 3
                           
                              If the suppliers are risk-averse and the retailer sources via a push contract, the prices for the first-price push auction are lower than with risk-neutral bidders.
                           

As the supplier does not take any inventory risk in a push contract, the only risk is not to win the auction. Therefore, lower bids than under risk neutrality are submitted. Under a second-price auction, it is optimal to bid at cost. Thus, the degree of risk-aversion has no influence on the bidding strategy and bids are still higher than under the first-price auction.

Under a pull contract, the winning supplier’s expected utility

                         is analogous to that for the risk-averse retailer. Since z is constant and higher than w, the optimal order quantity is a decreasing function of the wholesale price. For the first-price auction the supplier’s optimal bidding strategy is

                        . The optimal bid for the second-price contract can be derived as the one for the risk-neutral supplier (compare (8)), with the difference that for the risk-averse supplier the expected utility (see (13)) rather than the expected profit must be zero.
                           Theorem 2
                           
                              With risk-averse suppliers, the first-price push contract remains the dominant choice for the retailer. The second-price push contract always dominates the second-price pull contract. The dominances between the second-price push and first-price pull contract are indeterminate. Depending on the demand distribution and the cost structure, the first-price pull contract can either lead to higher or to lower expected retailer profits than the second-price push contract.
                           

Introducing risk-aversion has two effects on the first-price pull auction. Risk-averse suppliers bid more aggressively, but their cost of supplying the good increases because (due to their risk aversion) the production quantities are not efficient anymore. Taking

                         for the pull contract. Therefore, the retailer’s profit can increase and decrease in the suppliers’ risk attitude. In the second-price push auction, the retailer’s profits are independent from the suppliers’ risk-aversion as the suppliers always bid at cost.

The inefficient production of the supplier leads to a lower overall supply chain profit under the pull contract. Therefore, for high risk-aversion, the supply chain profit is maximized under the first-price push contract and not under a pull contract. For low risk-aversion, it depends on the parameters whether the first- or second-price pull contract maximizes the supply chain profit. For instance, it depends on the utility function or the price itself, whether a higher selling price leads to a higher or lower production quantity and thus a higher or lower efficiency (see e.g. Eeckhoudt et al. (1995) or Wang et al. (2009) for the effect of price changes on the order quantities of a risk-averse newsvendor).

A risk-averse supplier prefers the pull contract if risk-aversion is low. If risk-aversion is high, the inefficient production quantity cause preferences to switch to the push contract. Within the contract formats, there is no clear preference for a first- or a second-price auction. While a first-price auction leads to a lower spread of bids (under a push contract) and to a higher quantity sold, it will also lead to lower prices than the second-price contract. For the extreme case without demand uncertainty, pay-offs are a linear function of the wholesale price and according to Matthews (1987), for IARA (increasing absolute risk-aversion) the bidder prefers the first-price, for CARA there is indifference, and for DARA preference for the second-price auction. With demand uncertainty, the pay-offs are no longer a linear function of the resulting wholesale price and it depends on the specific parameters, such as the utility function and demand or cost distributions, as to whether the first- or second-price auction is preferred. The results for the risk-averse retailer and for the risk-averse supplier are summarized in Table 2

An open descending price-only auction (English auction) is proposed in Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011). Under our assumptions, the English auction will lead to the same results as a second-price auction for a pull contract. Therefore, we only analyze the English auction for a push contract. A dominant strategy for a supplier with cost c is to bid starting with the price that maximizes the profit if no other supplier exists, and then descend to the break-even price c. The ideal starting price under the above conditions is

                        . Since for any realization of c, the wholesale price in the second-price push auction is not lower than the wholesale price in the English auction, the expected retailer and supply chain profits in the English auction are higher than in the second-price push auction. The retailer profits are therefore also higher than in the pull contract. Compared to the first-price push auction, the English auction leads to lower profits for the retailer and the supply chain. However, the gaps close with an increasing number of bidders. Since

                         if the product is purchased with a pull auction instead of a first-price push auction, the winning supplier gets exactly one half of the profit increase from the higher total supply chain profit and the other half from the reduced retailer profit.

                         shows that supplier competition is higher under the first-price push contract than under a pull contract and even compensates the additional total supply chain profit under pull contracts from the retailer’s perspective.

Although general results on the ranking of simple auction and contract formats were obtained and the closed-form expressions in the previous section allowed for further insights into the magnitude of certain effects, especially the distributional assumptions were rather restrictive. Therefore, we numerically provide further insights into the dependency of the results on the different parameter values: number of bidders, degree of demand uncertainty, degree of cost uncertainty, and the impact of risk-aversion. The effects are driven by competition, cost and demand uncertainty and result in price and quantity effects of different magnitudes. Similar to Chen (2007) and Li and Scheller-Wolf (2011), we assume that the suppliers’ marginal costs are drawn from a uniform distribution and that demand follows a truncation of the normal distribution with mean

Comparing the results with the optimal benchmark shown in the columns opt (see e.g. Chen (2007)), the optimal contract always leads to higher profits for the retailer, while the supply chain profit and the retailer profit are lower than in the simple auction formats. One reason is that under the optimal mechanism there is no trade if the lowest marginal cost among the suppliers is too high (since the optimal order quantity is given as

The first-price push contract always leads to higher expected retailer profits than the pull contract, which confirms Conjecture 1. The gap

                           , the retailer’s absolute profit decreases with the spread of production cost under the first-price push contract for small demand uncertainty and increases for high demand uncertainty. For 
                              
                                 n

                           , the expected cost of the second-lowest bidder increases in a mean preserving spread of production cost and thus the suppliers bid less aggressively with a higher spread. A second effect is that the suppliers bid more aggressively if the demand uncertainty is higher. The higher the spread of production cost, the more this effect influences the retailer’s profit. Thus, for low demand uncertainty the retailer’s profit decreases, whereas for a high demand uncertainty it increases in production cost uncertainty.

The pull contract maximizes the supply chain profits while the differences 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       Δ
                                    
                                    
                                       SC
                                    
                                 
                              
                            between pull and push become smaller in the number of bidders, but increase in demand uncertainty. The supply chain profits (stronger under push than under pull contracts) increase in the spread of production cost as this decreases the expected cost of the lowest bidder. Although expected supply chain profit and expected retailer profit decrease in demand uncertainty for the pull contract, the supplier’s profit can increase because the cost of offering a pull contract for a given production cost c increases in demand uncertainty, which lowers supply competition. In Table 1, this effect only appears for 
                              
                                 n
                                 =
                                 4
                              
                            when supply competition is relatively high. For a push contract, the cost of supplying the product is equal to unit production cost and there is no such effect. Besides the obviously deteriorating effect of increasing demand uncertainty on absolute retailer and supply chain profits, increasing demand uncertainty decreases the retailer’s share of total supply chain profit for both auction formats, which, however, is less pronounced for the first-price push contract. For the pull contract, lower competition for higher demand uncertainty drives this effect. For the push contract, this effect is caused by higher demand risk purely allocated to the retailer. Only for a high cost uncertainty and a low number of possible suppliers, this share does not decrease under a push contract, because the retailer’s demand is highly sensitive to price changes and competition is relatively low. For an increasing number of bidders and a decreasing cost spread, the retailer’s profit and its relative share of supply chain profits increases for both auction formats. Under the pull contract, the retailer’s expected profit always decreases in the spread of production cost if 
                              
                                 n
                                 =
                                 2
                              
                           , as the suppliers do not bid more aggressively when demand uncertainty is higher. For 
                              
                                 n
                                 =

                           , the retailer’s profit always increases in the spread of production cost, independent of the contract, as with a higher number of bidders the expected cost of the second lowest bidder decreases in the spread.

Define 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            as the share of the products procured from the supplier and 
                              
                                 1

                            as the share of the products procured (by the retailer or, under pull, by the supplier) from the outside option. The study shows that 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            is the highest under the pull contract, while it is the lowest under the optimal push contract (for the case that under the optimal push contract there is no trade between the retailer and the supplier, it is assumed that the retailer satisfies demand from the outside option). Not surprisingly, we can further observe that 
                              
                                 α
                              
                            increases in the number of bidders and decreases in demand uncertainty.

Under risk-aversion, additional effects arise from the possibility of allocating risks through the different auction and contract formats. In addition to the previous assumptions, we specify the utility function to be of the CARA-type,

The results of our numerical study show that the push contract dominates the pull contract for low risk-aversion, but a retailer with high risk-aversion prefers the pull contract (see Fig. 2). For sufficiently large risk-aversion, we face a win–win situation: the retailer and the winning supplier both prefer the first-price pull contract. A lower cost spread further promotes the pull contract because a lower spread lowers the possible informational rent for both strategies and the retailer prefers to shift the demand risk to the supplier.

Under the first-price push contract, the retailer’s share of the supply chain profit increases in risk-aversion while the supply chain efficiency decreases due to the lower order quantity of the retailer (see Fig. 3, where the supply chain profit of a coordinating pull contract under risk neutrality is taken as the benchmark for efficiency). Under the pull auctions, the retailer orders realized demand and the profit and its allocation are not affected by risk-aversion.

In order to show how the choice of the contract format influences the profits and their allocation, we again compare the first-price push and the first-price pull auction. Using the same CARA-utility function for all suppliers with r on

                           ). Since the retailer profit under the second-price push auction does not change with the suppliers’ risk-aversion, this is taken as the reference value. The first-price push contract is the dominant choice for the retailer and the second-price pull is the least preferred contract. The first-price push contract takes maximum advantage of the suppliers’ risk-aversion and the retailer’s expected profit increases with increasing supplier risk-aversion (see Fig. 4a). Furthermore, while under risk neutrality we observe that for a low number of bidders the retailer’s profit decreases in the spread of production cost for low demand uncertainty and increases for high demand uncertainty, this effect disappears if risk aversion increases. Thus, for high risk aversion, the retailer’s profit increases in the spread of production cost even for a lower demand uncertainty. The reason is that risk aversion leads to a more aggressive bidding on the supplier’s side, which has a stronger effect if the spread of production cost is higher.

For the first-price pull contract, we can observe that for low risk-aversion the effect of aggressive bidding dominates the effect of higher cost of supplying the product (see Section 4.2 for further explanation). If the risk-aversion is high, this result changes and the retailer profit decreases in the risk-aversion of the suppliers (see also Fig. 4b). The study further showed that higher demand uncertainty enforces these effects, while a higher number of bidders leads to an earlier decrease of

                           . The reason is that the competition increases in n, which reduces the effect of aggressive bidding under risk aversion and thus the effect of higher cost becomes more dominant.

For the push auction, one can observe that supplier risk-aversion has a coordinating effect and the supply chain profit increases with the suppliers’ risk-aversion because the suppliers bid more aggressively. Suppliers are willing to give up some profit in order to reduce the risk of not winning the auction and consequently not making any profit at all. This effect changes the allocation of profits and the retailer gets a higher share of the total supply chain profit. While supply chain efficiency under the push contract increases in the suppliers’ risk-aversion, it decreases under the pull contract. This is because under the pull contract a risk-neutral supplier maximizes the supply chain profit, whereas risk-aversion leads to an inefficient production quantity.

Consider now the retailer’s share of the total supply chain profit under the pull format. There are several effects that influence the profit allocation. Risk-aversion leads to more aggressive bidding and the supplier further follows a less risky capacity strategy and gives up some expected profit to reduce demand risk. These effects lead to an increase of the retailer’s share. On the other hand, a risk-averse supplier needs a higher compensation to take over the demand risk. Thus, if this effect dominates, the retailer’s share of the supply chain decreases. We can now observe that the retailer’s share first increases, but decreases again if risk-aversion is strong (see also Fig. 5
                           , where the supply chain profit of the pull contract under risk neutrality is again taken as the benchmark).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The analysis provides clear preferences between push and pull contracts and proves that a risk-neutral retailer should source via a push contract in a reverse auction. One benefit of the push contract presented is its simplicity. The retailer does not have to set up a price-quantity scheme (see e.g. Chen (2007) and Duenyas et al. (2013)) and the order quantity follows the well-known newsvendor model. The retailer chooses the first-price sealed-bid auction rather than a second-price sealed-bid auction in order to minimize the procurement price. If we consider a social planner who maximizes the total supply chain profit, the pull contract is preferred as it leads to supply chain efficiency and the auction format does not matter. Therefore, under pull contracts first-price and second-price sealed-bid auctions lead to the same profits as does an open bidding format like the English auction. Sourcing through a push contract and using a first-price sealed-bid auction leads to an aggressive bidding. This is enabled by introducing a flexible auction where the retailer can decide about the order quantity after the wholesale price has been determined.

Compared to other papers that propose pull contracts leading to an inefficient low production volume (see e.g. Li & Scheller-Wolf (2011)), we provide new insights on the efficiency of those contracts. We show that only the supplier can benefit from such an efficient pull contract, whereas the retailer profit is maximized under a push contract. For both push and pull contracts we show that retailer and total supply chain profit increases in the number of suppliers participating at the auction. Consequently, more competition on the supply side increases efficiency and further lowers the difference between auction designs.

For a risk-averse retailer, the push auction is no longer always preferred. A retailer with a high risk-aversion prefers the first-price pull contract avoiding demand risk. With risk-averse suppliers, a risk-neutral retailer prefers first-price to second-price pull contracts, but the preferences towards first-price pull and second-price push are not unique anymore.

One limitation of our analysis is the assumption of symmetric suppliers. Therefore, asymmetries in cost and demand information are an important next step for research. Another challenge is to find mechanisms that are able to allocate more profit to the retailer when choosing a coordinating pull contract.

According to the revenue equivalence theorem (see Myerson, 1981, which we adapted for the reverse auction), every auction where risk-neutral bidders sell a single unit yields the same expected prices and revenues, if (i) the bidders’ costs are independently drawn from a common, strictly-increasing atomless distribution, (ii) the bidder with the lowest signal always wins, and (iii) the bidder with the highest-feasible signal expects zero surplus.

                                    . Thus, the supplier’s profit is linear in the resulting wholesale price and can be analyzed as a single-product auction with risk-neutral preferences.

It is sufficient to show that in both, first- and second-price auction, the bids increase in cost as in both auction formats the lowest bid wins. Since the optimal bid in the second-price auction is to bid the expected average cost per unit,

Consider now the expected retailer profit. Under a pull contract, the quantity sold is equal to the realized demand. Therefore, the retailer’s expected profit is equal the expected demand multiplied by the market price minus wholesale price:

                           . Thus, the expected profit under a pull contract is linear in the wholesale price and is therefore the same for two different auction formats as long as the expected wholesale price is the same. The equivalence of

                            for both pull auctions has been shown above. Therefore, both auctions lead to the same expected profits for the retailer, even though the distributions of the bids in the first- and second-price auction differ. Since production quantities do not depend on the wholesale price either, revenue equivalence also holds for the expected profits of a supplier and for the profits of the whole supply chain.□

                        Proof of Lemma 2
                        The proof follows from a comparison of expected retailer profit under the pull contract (9) with (5). Both expressions are equal because

                           . The revenue equivalence of the first- and second-price pull auction has been shown in Lemma 1, what completes the proof.□

                                    Waehrer et al. (1998) show that in a reverse single-unit auction with a risk-averse buyer the auctioneer prefers the first-price over the second-price auction. Since under the pull contract the order quantities do not depend on the price, this contract is equivalent to a single-unit auction and the retailer prefers the first-price pull to the second-price pull contract.

Since the second-price push contract is not affected by the suppliers’ risk-aversion but risk-aversion in the second-price pull contract results in an inefficient production quantity, the retailer prefers the push contract. As proof of the second part, consider the extreme cases of the first-price auction. Since

                           , the retailer prefers the second-price push contract to the first-price pull contract, provided risk-aversion exceeds a certain threshold level. In the case without demand uncertainty, the push and pull contracts lead to the same results and only in the first-price auction the risk-averse bidder bids more aggressively and the retailer always prefers the first-price auction (see also Lemma 3).□
