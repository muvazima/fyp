                  We consider an order acceptance and scheduling model with machine availability constraints. The manufacturer (machine) is assumed to be available to process orders only within a number of discontinuous time intervals. To capture the real-life behavior of a typical manufacturer who has restrictions of time availability to process orders, our model allows the manufacturer to reject or outsource some of the orders. When an order is rejected or outsourced, an order-dependent cost of penalty will occur. The objective is to minimize the makespan of all accepted orders plus the total penalty of all rejected/outsourced orders. We study the approximability of the model and some of its important special cases.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Order acceptance and scheduling (OAS) has attracted considerable attention from scheduling researchers as well as production managers who practice it in the past a few decades. The key issue in OAS is to balance order acceptance (to increase revenue and guarantee satisfaction to customers) and order rejection (to reduce production load so as to meet production capacity restrictions). In traditional OAS models the manufacturer (machine) is usually assumed to have the capacity of processing orders continuously. But in reality, production could be interrupted due to some potential reasons such as machine breakdown/maintenance, production setup, and worker vacation, which leads to the scenario that there are only a number of discontinuous time intervals available to process the orders in question. When production capacity and machine available time have restrictions, to reduce production load, the manufacturer may have to reject some orders which have long processing times but contribute relatively small profits, or outsource the production of some orders, in which case the profit of those outsourced orders is reduced. In this paper we study a single-machine OAS model with machine availability constraints. In the proposed model, the manufacturer (machine) is available to process orders only within a number of given discontinuous time intervals, and she is allowed to reject some orders. When an order is rejected, an order-dependent penalty will occur. The manufacturer needs to balance the production capacity (the makespan of completing all accepted orders) and the total penalty of all rejected jobs.

OAS has been studied extensively in the production scheduling literature. Guerrero and Kern (1988) provided the rational how to accept and reject orders effectively. Slotnick and Morton (1996) and Ghosh (1997) studied single-machine OAS with the objective of maximizing revenue minus weighted lateness penalties. Slotnick and Morton (2007) extended their previous work (Slotnick & Morton, 1996) by replacing lateness with tardiness in the objective function. Rom and Slotnick (2009) developed a genetic algorithm for the same problem and compared it with the myopic heuristic given in Slotnick and Morton (2007). Talla Nobibon and Leus (2011) studied an OAS model with “firm planned orders as well as potential orders”. Oguz, Salman, and Yalcin (2010) included sequence-dependent setup times and two-level due-dates in an OAS model with weighted tardiness. Cesaret, Oguz, and Salman (2012) developed a tabu algorithm for the same problem and compared it with the two heuristics proposed in Oguz et al. (2010). Yang and Geunes (2007) considered an OAS model with controllable processing times. Chen and Li (2008), Lee and Sung (2008, 2008) and Qi (2008, 2009, 2011) considered OAS models with outsourcing options. An excellent literature survey on the topic of OAS is provided by Slotnick (2011) recently.

OAS is actually equivalent to machine scheduling with rejection (MSR) in mathematics. Bartal, Leonardi, Marchetti-Spaccamela, Sgall, and Stougie (2000) first introduced a multi-processor MSR model to minimize the makespan of all accepted jobs plus the total rejection penalty of all rejected jobs. Seiden (2001) and Hoogeveen, Skutella, and Woeginger (2003) studied the on-line version and the off-line version in Bartal et al. (2000) when job preemption is allowed, respectively. Epstein, Noga, and Woeginger (2002) considered on-line MSR with unit-processing-time jobs and the total completion time of all accepted jobs. Engels et al. (2003) studied single-processor MSR with total weighted completion times of all accepted jobs, and recently, Kellerer and Strusevich (2013) improved the related results. MSR models with industrial applications are studied by Cheng and Sun (2009), Zhang, Lu, and Yuan (2009, 2010), Lu, Zhang, and Yuan (2008), Lu, Cheng, Yuan, and Zhang (2009), among others. A very recent survey on MSR is provided by Shabtay, Gaspar, and Kaspi (2013). All of the OAS and MSR models mentioned above have the potential assumption that machines can process jobs continuously, which differ from our model.

Our model is an extension of machine scheduling with availability constraints (MSAC). MSAC also has been studied extensively. The surveys of MSAC are provided by Schmidt (2000) and Ma, Chu, and Zuo (2010). In this paper we consider a single machine model and the criterion of all accepted jobs is to minimize the makespan. Therefore, in the following we only review the previous work of MSAC with a single machine, and whose objective is limited to minimization of makespan. For convenience, define MSAC-k to be the MSAC problem to minimize makespan with a single machine and k time intervals during which the machine is not allowed to process jobs. Lee (1996) showed that MSAC-1 has been NP-hard, and that MSAC-k is NP-hard in the strong sense if k is arbitrary. He, Ji, and Cheng (2005) proposed a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for MSAC-1. Breit, Schmidt, and Strusevich (2003) showed that no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a fixed performance ratio exists for MSAC-2. When every job also has a delivery time, Yuan, She, and Ou (2008) showed that MSAC-k can be solved by a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm if k is fixed. They also developed a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MSAC-1. Kacem (2009) studied a similar problem to Yuan et al. (2008), and proposed an FPTAS by exploiting the well-known approach of Ibarra and Kim (1975). Wu and Lee (2003), Gawiejnowicz (2007), and Ji, He, and Cheng (2006) studied MSAC with deterioration, where the processing time of a job is a linear function of its starting time. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to examine OAS with machine availability constraints.

We now describe our problem formally as follows. Given a set of n jobs J
                     ={J

                     J

                        j
                     
                     ∈
                     J is associated with a processing time p
                     
                        j
                      and a rejection penalty w
                     
                        j
                     . Job J
                     
                        j
                      is either accepted and then processed on the machine, or it is rejected by the machine and then a rejection penalty w
                     
                        j
                      is paid. Penalty w
                     
                        j
                      is regarded as the cost of losing or outsourcing job J
                     
                        j
                     . Also given 2m
                     +1 integers a
                     0,
                     a

                     2m
                     , we assume that in the planning horizon the machine is available to process jobs within time intervals [a
                     2m
                     , +∞) and [a

                     =1,2,…,
                     m, but it is not allowed to process any job during time interval (a
                     2i−1, a
                     2i

                     =1,2,…,
                     m. In order words, there are m UIs (time intervals during which the machine is not allowed to process jobs) and m
                     +1 AIs (time intervals during which the machine is allowed to process jobs) in the planning horizon. Let A be the set of jobs accepted, and R

Note that if P(U)⩽

                     1, it is easy to obtain an optimal solution where all the jobs in U are accepted and all the jobs in V are rejected. Also note that if there exists some α

                     , then it is easy to show that no job should be processed after a
                     2α−1 in any optimal solution. Thus, we can ignore the UIs after a
                     2α−1 without destroying optimality if such α exists. Without loss of generality, in the remainder of this paper we assume P(U)>

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to solve problem P
                     (m) when m is fixed. In Section 3 we provide non-approximability results to problem P
                     (m) when m
                     >1. In Section 4 we present an FPTAS for the special case P
                     (1). In Section 5 we develop a (2+
                     ∊)-approximation for the special case with

Note that if m is arbitrarily, then it is easy to show that problem P
                     (m) is NP-hard in the strong sense by reducing from 3-PARTITION, and thus an optimal pseudo-polynomial algorithm for P
                     (m) does not exist (Garey & Johnson, 1979). Therefore, in the remainder of this section, we assume that the value of m is fixed. We will present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to solve P
                     (m) when m is fixed.

                     0 to be a dummy job with zero processing time, and fix J
                     0 to be accepted and processed on the machine at time a

                     0 is the first accepted job processed within the last AI). We schedule J
                     0 before the scheduling of any job in our DP. Scheduling J
                     0 has a contribution of a

Consider the complexity of DP
                     1. Note that 
                        
                           
                              
                                 L
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                           <
                           P
                        
                      for i
                     =1,2,…,
                     m (by (1)). The recursive function has at most O(nP
                     
                        m
                     ) states for G
                     
                        j
                     (g
                     1,…,
                     g
                     
                        m
                     ), and each recursion can be calculated in O(m)=
                     O(1) time. Therefore, DP
                     1 has a complexity of O(nP
                     
                        m
                     ).

We now study the situation when μ
                     ⩽
                     m. For this case, we develop another DP to solve the problem. The new DP is similar to DP
                     1, but it needs to keep track of the total processing time of the jobs processed within each of the first μ AIs. It is not difficult to design such a DP with complexity of O(nP
                     
                        μ
                     ). We would like to point out that the new DP is actually applicable to the situation when μ
                     =
                     m
                     +1, but the corresponding time complexity is O(nP
                     
                        m+1). To reduce complexity, we develop DP
                     1 to handle the situation when μ
                     =
                     m
                     +1 additionally, so that the overall time complexity of our algorithm is bounded by O(nP
                     
                        m
                     ). We thus have the following theorem.
                        Theorem 1
                        
                           Problem 
                           P
                           
                              (m)
                            
                           can be solved in O(nP
                           
                              m
                           
                           ) time when m is fixed.
                        

In this section, we study the approximability of problem P
                     (m). We will show that P
                     (m) does not admit a polynomial time approximation algorithm with a constant worst-case bound when m
                     >1, and that a 2-approximation exists for the special case with P(U)⩾
                     a
                     2m
                     . As we will use the well-known NP-hard problem PARTITION (Garey & Johnson, 1979) in our analysis, for convenience, we state PARTITION in advance here: Given a set of t positive integers S

We use the gap reduction from PARTITION. Given an instance I of PARTITION, construct an instance I′ of P
                           (m) as follows. There are n
                           =
                           t jobs, where the processing time and rejection penalty of job J
                           
                              j
                            are (p
                           
                              j
                           , w
                           
                              j
                           )=(e
                           
                              j
                           , 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1)) for j
                           =1,…,
                           t. There are m
                           =2 UIs: (a
                           1, a
                           2)=(B, B
                           +1) and (a
                           3, a
                           4)=(2B
                           +1, 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1)). Such an instance can be constructed in polynomial time. Consider the optimal solution value of instance I′. It is obvious that the optimal solution value of I′ is no less than 2B
                           +1. If we reject one job, the total penalty is no less than 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1). Also, if there exists a job processed after time 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1), the corresponding makespan also will be no less than 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1). Thus, to obtain a solution value of 2B
                           +1 is equivalent to find a subset of jobs with a total processing time of B, so that all of the jobs in the subset are processed on the machine within interval [0, B] without any idle time, while all of the rest of the other jobs are processed on the machine within interval [B
                           +1, 2B
                           +1] also without any idle time. This is equivalent to a solution to PARTITION. If it fails to find out such a subset of jobs, then solution value is at least 2
                              n
                           (2B
                           +1), which is 2
                              n
                            times of 2B
                           +1. This completes the proof. □

Through such the proof above, we can see that if a
                     2m
                     , the ending point of the last UI, is much larger than total processing time P(U), then it is impossible to develop a polynomial approximation algorithm with a constant worst-case bound. However, as we will show it later, if P(U)>
                     a
                     2m
                     , i.e., the total processing time in U is greater than the ending point of the last UI, then a very simple heuristic with a worst-case bound of 2 can be developed. The heuristic is denoted by H
                     1, which is described as follows: Reject all jobs in V, and let all jobs in U be accepted and processed within time interval [a
                     2m
                     , +∞) as early as possible in any job sequence. Let

                           In any case, we have Z′⩾2B
                           +4+2d when instance I has a “NO” answer.

The above analysis indicates that if Z′<2B
                           +4+2d, then instance I has a “YES” answer; Otherwise, I has a “NO” answer. Consequently, we can use approximation algorithm A to solve PARTITION in polynomial time, which is a contradiction unless P=NP.□

In this section we study problem P
                     (1), where there is only one UI in the time horizon. Denote the unique UI by (a, b). Note that P
                     (1) has been shown to be NP-hard when job rejection is not allowed (see Lee, 1996), which indicates that P
                     (1) is NP-hard in general. We will present an FPTAS to P
                     (1). A family of algorithms {A
                     
                        ∊
                     ∣∊
                     >0} is called an FPTAS of a minimization problem if A
                     
                        ∊
                      is a (1+
                     ∊)-approximation running in polynomial time in the input size and

                                 ∊
                              
                           
                        
                      for each given ∊.

We will use the classical 0–1 Min-Knapsack Problem (Min-KP) (Kellerer, Pferschy, & Pisinger, 2004) in our analysis. For convenience, we state Min-KP in advance here: Given a knapsack and a set of items; the size of the knapsack is given; associated with each item is a given size and a given profit. The problem is to select a subset of items into the knapsack so as to minimize the total profit of all unselected items. It is well-known that an FPTAS exists for solving Min-KP (see Kellerer et al., 2004).

We now present an FPTAS to P
                     (1) based on the FPTAS to Min-KP. Our analysis is partitioned into the following two cases: (i)

Summarizing the analysis of Cases (i) and (ii), we have presented an FPTAS to P
                     (1) with the same time complexity as the FPTAS to Min-KP. So far, the best FPTAS to Min-KP is designed by Kellerer and Pferschy (1999, 2004, 2004) with the time complexity of O(n/∊). Therefore, we have the following theorem.
                        Theorem 5
                        
                           There exists an FPTAS to problem 
                           P
                           
                              (1)
                            
                           in O(n/∊) time.
                        

For the variant of P
                           (m) when job preemption is allowed, it is easy to show that such a variant is actually equivalent to problem P
                           (1). Thus, P
                           (m) is still NP-hard even when job preemption is allowed, and an FPTAS exists for such a variant.

In this section we consider the special case of P

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we study an order acceptance and scheduling model with machine availability constraints. The objective is to minimize the makespan of all accepted orders plus the total rejection penalty of all rejected orders. We develop a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the case with a fixed number of UIs (time intervals during which the machine is not allowed to process jobs). We show that no aproximation algorithm with constant worst-case bound exists for the problem in general. We also show that if P(U), the total processing time of all the jobs each of which has a processing time less than its rejection penalty, is greater than the ending point of the last UI, then a simple heuristic with a worst-case bound of 2 can be easy to develop, and such a worst-case bound is shown to be best possible. We further give an FPTAS for the case with a single UI by applying the existing FPTAS for the 0–1 Min-Knapsack Problem. Finally, we present an efficient (2+
                     ∊)-approximation for the special case in which UIs and AIs are identical and periodic, where ∊ can be any small constant.

For future research, it is an interesting research topic of whether the worst-case bound of 2+
                     ∊ for problem

                      could be improved to 2. It is also interesting to develop efficient exact algorithms to solve the proposed problem. The model with other objective functions is also worth considering.
