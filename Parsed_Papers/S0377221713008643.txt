                  In this paper we consider the consistent partition problem in reverse convex and convex mixed-integer programming. In particular we will show that for the considered classes of convex functions, both integer and relaxed systems can be partitioned into two disjoint subsystems, each of which is consistent and defines an unbounded region. The polynomial time algorithm to generate the partition will be proposed and the algorithm for a maximal partition will also be provided.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the fundamental issues in constrained optimization is to determine whether or not the system of inequality constraints defining the feasible region is consistent. The importance and various aspects of infeasibility analysis in linear systems and in some types of nonlinear systems have been discussed by many authors (Amaldi & Kann, 1995; Amaldi & Mattavelli, 2002; Chakravarti, 1994; Chinneck & Dravnieks, 1991; Chinneck, 1995, 2008; Greenberg, 1996; Obuchowska, 1998, 1999, 2010a, 2010b). In both linear and nonlinear case a common approach is to isolate an irreducible infeasible set (Chinneck & Dravnieks, 1991; Chinneck, 1995, 2008; Obuchowska, 1998, 1999, 2010a, 2012), or to find a smallest number of linear constraints to remove, such that the remaining constraints form a feasible set (referred to as MIN ULR (Amaldi & Kann, 1995)). The latter problem is equivalent to finding the maximum cardinality feasible subset in an infeasible set of inequality constraints (MAX FS). It has been shown that these problems (i.e. MIN ULR and MAX FS) are NP-hard even in linear systems (Amaldi & Kann, 1995; Chakravarti, 1994).

A closely related problem to MAX FS problem is to find a partition of the infeasible system into a minimum number of feasible subsystems (Amaldi & Mattavelli, 2002). While the system defining MIN ULR may be in general infeasible, it has been proved by W. Pulleyblank and others and shown by Greenberg (1996) that any inconsistent set of linear (continuous) inequalities can be partitioned into two sets that are both feasible. In this paper inspired by the above result, we consider the problem of the feasible partition in the following more general system of reverse convex constraints defined over the set of integers:

Optimization problems with constraints (1)–(4) formulated above have important applications in operations research, mathematical economics and various engineering problems (Hillestad & Jacobsen, 1980; Horst & Tuy, 1993; Horst & Pardalos, 1995; Jacobsen, 2001; Li & Sun, 2006; Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988; Pardalos & Romeijn, 2002; Pardalos & Rosen, 1986; Schrijver, 1986; Tuy, Thieu, & Thai, 1985; Ueing, 1972). For instance, integer programming problems with a concave objective (cost) function, are often encountered in optimization models involving economies of scale. These problems can be equivalently formulated as problems with linear objective function and an additional reverse convex constraint.

Furthermore, some classes of integer programming problems can be formulated equivalently as concave programming problems or an optimization problem with reverse convex constraints. For instance problems with integer constraints

Several classes of optimization problems involving reverse convex constraints and methods of their solution were studied by many authors, in particular by Ueing (1972), Hillestad and Jacobsen (1980), in Horst and Tuy (1993), in Ben-Saad and Jacobsen (1990), in Jacobsen (2001) and by this author in Caron and Obuchowska, 1992, Obuchowska (2007, 2010b, 2012). These methods, as well as other algorithms for global constrained (continuous or integer) optimization problems are based upon the assumption that the set of optimal solutions is nonempty and compact, although there are many concave optimization problems, which do not satisfy these requirements. The boundedness of reverse convex systems was investigated in Caron and Obuchowska (1992), Obuchowska (2007, 2010b) and feasibility was studied recently in Obuchowska (2012), where the constraint functions included in particular convex multivariate functions. Since similar situation also occurs in convex optimization, the issue of boundedness and feasibility of the feasible region was addressed subsequently for continuous programs in Obuchowska (1998, 1999, 2006, 2007) and for convex integer programs in Obuchowska (2008, 2010a), where the functions defining the inequality constraints were either quasi-convex multivariate polynomials or faithfully convex.

We will begin with recalling that a convex function

Although both classes of functions used in this paper are very important in optimization theory and practice, the most attention has been given to date to convex and quasi-convex multivariate polynomials, which have been studied by many authors, for instance in Bank and Mandel (1988), Belousov and Andronov (1993), Belousov and Klatte (2002), Jeyakumar and Li (2011), Li (2010), Obuchowska (2006, 2008).

In this paper, which is a continuation of our recent study of infeasibility in reverse convex mixed-integer programming in Obuchowska (2012), we show that for the considered classes of convex functions, both integer and relaxed system can be partitioned into two subsystems each of which has a solution and the respective feasible regions are unbounded. The polynomial time algorithm to generate the partition has been proposed and an algorithm for a maximal partition has been also given.

The problem of the consistent partition in reverse convex and convex mixed-integer programming considered in this paper is motivated by its potential applications in infeasibility analysis, and practical importance of MAX FS and MIN ULR problems, to which the partition problem is related.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, which provides mostly auxiliary results used in the remaining part of the paper, we consider the feasible partition problem in linear integer systems, which in particular may include explicit equalities. In Section 3 we extend the results of Section 2 to systems of reverse convex inequality constraints, and in Section 4 we study the problem of feasible partition in systems of convex inequality constraints. We note that while the results developed in Sections 3 and 4 apply to the same two classes of convex functions, namely to faithfully convex functions and functions defined as a composition of convex increasing functions and multivariate polynomials, in Section 4 it was necessary to assume that none of the linear terms of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                           (
                           x
                           )
                        
                      is a linear combination of the rows of the matrices defining all nonlinear terms. The latter assumption was necessary, since otherwise as illustrated in a simple example, it is not possible in general, to partition a convex infeasible system into two feasible subsystems.

We observe that since all results proved in this paper hold for both the integer systems with reverse convex and convex constraints (1) and (3) respectively, as well as for the corresponding relaxed systems (2) and (4), we can conclude that they also apply to the mixed-integer programming problem of the same structure, where only some of the variables are assumed to be integer.

In this section we investigate the problem of the maximal consistent partition, showing that any infeasible linear integer system can be partitioned into two subsystems each of which has an integer solution. Furthermore, we consider a system where both inequalities and explicit equations are included, showing that under certain conditions the system can be partitioned into two feasible subsystems. Suppose that we consider first the following inconsistent linear system defined over the set of integers

A feasible subsystem of the integer system (6) (or of the corresponding relaxed system (7)) is called maximal, if addition of any of the remaining constraints changes its status to infeasible. A feasible subsystem of the system (6) (or respectively (7)) is called the maximum feasible subsystem, if there is no other feasible subsystem of a larger cardinality.

Thus every maximum feasible subsystem is also a maximal subsystem, though some maximal subsystems may have the number of constraints too small to qualify to the former category. While the maximal feasible subsystem in a linear program can be found by solving a finite number of linear programs, the problem of finding the maximal feasible subsystem in the corresponding integer linear system is NP-hard in general. This follows from the fact that in order to find a maximal feasible subsystem in the integer linear program it is necessary to solve integer linear programs which cannot be solved in polynomial time. On the other hand, as shown in Amaldi and Kann (1995), Chakravarti (1994) the problem of finding the maximum feasible subsystem is NP-hard even for linear noninteger systems (7).

It has been shown in Greenberg (1996), that the maximal consistent subsystem of the linear system (7) can be found by partitioning the system into two feasible subsystems.

We note that an interesting approach to generate a direction vector of a line that intersects all hyperplanes has been provided by one of the anonymous referees of this paper. It relies on using the vector

                      for some integer number t. Indeed for a randomly selected integer or rational number t there is no warranty that a vector v will have the required property, which becomes more likely in case of a large number of constraints m and of high dimension n, in addition to the fact that components of the vector v will grow exponentially with n. However it can be shown easily that there exist integer numbers

                     This means that to implement this approach algorithmically, methods for estimating lower and upper bounds for real roots of polynomial equations should be used, for instance applying Cauchy’s bound (Hirst & Macey, 1997).

                     . Such generalization is impossible even in case of continuous (noninteger) linear systems (Chinneck, 2008). We will show however that in case when 
                        
                           Ax

                      has an integer solution, and the homogeneous system 
                        
                           Ax
                           =
                           0
                        
                      has a nonzero solution, and the inequality constraints satisfy some additional assumption, then it is possible to partition the linear system, consisting of both equalities and inequalities, into two feasible subsystems, which have properties analogous to the properties proved in Theorem 2.2 for the systems containing only inequality constraints.

We observe that the feasible partitions in parts (i) of Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 can be obtained in polynomial time, which follows from the fact that linear programming and Gaussian (or Gauss–Jordan) elimination can be performed in polynomial time, as shown by Karmarkar (1984) for linear programming and by Edmonds (1967) for Gaussian elimination.

In this section we will generalize results proved in Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 2.2 for linear systems to systems of reverse convex constraints

                      (or fewer) of m inequality constraints are defined by either faithfully convex functions satisfying condition (5) or by a composition of convex increasing functions and convex multivariate polynomials. We note that by Corollary 2.1 in Obuchowska (2012), the system (19) is always feasible if it contains less than 2 linear inequality constraints.

                            is a maximal consistent subsystem of the system (19).□

We observe that partition described in part (i) of Theorem 3.1 can be computed in a polynomial time, but the maximal consistent partition in part (ii) is NP-hard, since it requires to determine feasibility of the integer program.

The results obtained in Section 3 for reverse convex constraints, are valid for a very broad class of convex functions, which in particular includes convex multivariate polynomials (both in discrete and continuous case) without any additional assumptions. The following simple example shows that it is not possible to extend the result stated in Theorems 2.2 and 3.1 to systems of convex inequality constraints even when functions

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we develop new results concerning (maximal) consistent partition problem, showing in particular how to partition inconsistent system of reverse convex (or linear) inequalities defined over the set of integers, into two feasible subsystems, one of which is maximal. Similar results have been proposed for convex systems, although in this case it was necessary to impose additional assumptions on the convex functions defining the region. The polynomial time algorithm to generate feasible partition has been proposed and the algorithm for a maximal partition has also been provided. We note that Algorithms C1 and C2 and Procedure B1 can be performed in polynomial time.

Concluding, since all results developed in this paper are valid for both the integer systems (1) and (3) as well as for the corresponding relaxed systems (2) and (4), we are able to infer that these results also apply to mixed-integer programming problem of the same structure, where only some of the variables are assumed to be integer.

To the best of our knowledge, the class of functions considered in this paper is the broadest class of convex or concave functions for which the feasible partition of the infeasible system is possible. In order to determine whether the results can be extended to another large and important class of functions, further studies would be needed.
