                  We study a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem with time-dependent deteriorating jobs, i.e. the processing times of jobs are an increasing function of their starting time. The objective is to minimize the total completion time subject to minimum makespan. We propose a mixed integer programming model, and develop two pairwise interchange algorithms and a branch-and-bound procedure to solve the problem while using several dominance conditions to limit the size of the search tree. Several polynomial-time solvable special cases are discussed. Finally, numerical studies are performed to examine the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Machine scheduling problems with time-dependent deteriorating jobs have become an important and interesting topic in recent years. Examples of time-dependent deteriorating jobs often appear in manufacturing settings, such as maintenance jobs, where delay in processing a job often requires extra time to accomplish it. Similarly, when an instrument loses efficiency during work, the job processed later requires more machine time than that of the same job processed earlier. Such phenomenon is called the deteriorating effect. Reviews of scheduling problems with time-dependent deteriorating jobs can be found in Alidaee and Womer (1999), Cheng, Ding, and Lin (2004) and Gawiejnowicz (2008). Specifically, scheduling problem with simple linear deteriorating processing times in a single-machine setting was studied by Mosheiov (1994), who focused on classical performance measures (such as, makespan, and total flow time and sum of weighted completion time) and showed that all these problems are polynomial solvable. Gawiejnowicz, Lee, Lin, and Wu (2011) studied a single-machine scheduling problem with job’s processing time proportionally deteriorating to its starting time. Moreover, the case of multi-machine is examined by Wang, Ng, Cheng, and Liu (2006), Wu and Lee (2006) and Shiau, Lee, Wu, and Chang (2007), who considered simple linear deterioration in a two-machine flow shop to minimize the mean flow time. They used branch-and-bound algorithms with several dominance conditions to search for the optimal solution. Yang and Wang (2011) minimized the total weighted completion time in a two-machine flow shop with simple linear deterioration. Related literature also includes Mosheiov (1998, 2002), Wang and Xia (2006), Cheng, Sun, and He (2007), Dugardin et al. (2010) and Gawiejnowicz and Kononov (2010).

The importance of multi-objective scheduling optimization is widely recognized and its interest is growing since industry needs to cope with multiple performance metrics. There are many multiple criteria scheduling optimization problems. One of the multiple criteria optimization problems is called secondary criterion scheduling problem, which is also known as hierarchical criteria problem. The hierarchical criteria problem starts with solving for the first priority criteria while ignoring the other criteria, then it solves the second priority criterion and ensures the optimal performance of the first criteria remains unchanged. Such problems are known as hierarchical scheduling problems in the literature (Lee & Vairaktarakis, 1993). Hierarchical scheduling problems appear quite naturally in a situation where there are several optimal solutions with respect to a specific objective and the decision maker needs to select from among these solutions the one with the best second objective. Gupta, Ho, and Van der Veen (1999) studied single machine hierarchical scheduling problem with customer orders and multiple job classes. Such a scheduling problem can be denoted as α∣β∣F
                     
                        h
                     (f
                     2∣f
                     1), where f
                     1 and f
                     2 denote the primary criterion and secondary criterion, respectively, and F
                     
                        h
                     (f
                     2∣f
                     1) represents the hierarchical optimization of criterion f
                     2 given that criterion f
                     1 is at its optimal value.


                     Chen and Vempati (1992) and Rajendran (1993) independently proposed a branch-and-bound algorithm to optimally solve the problem

                           ∑
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 j

                                 max
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . Nepalli, Chen, and Gupta (1996) and Gupta et al. (1999) constructed genetic algorithms and local search approach to improve the efficiency of Rajendran’s heuristic. Gupta, Venkata, Neppalli, and Frank Werner (2001) also proposed exact optimization algorithms based on dominance conditions for this problem and developed several polynomial heuristics. Likewise, T’kindt, Gupta, and Billaut (2002, 2003) formulated a mathematical programming model and developed heuristics for the same problem. A comprehensive survey of multiple criteria scheduling problems can be found in Nagar, Haddock, and Heragu (1995) and Hoogeveen (2005), particularly for the two-criterion ones. Lei (2009) also reviewed literature on multi-objective production scheduling problems. Toktas, Azizoglu, and Koksalan (2004) and Eren and Gner (2008) considered a problem of concurrent miinimization of makespan and earliness in a two-machine flow shop environment and developed a branch-and-bound procedure. Chiang, Cheng, and Fu (2011) considered a flow shop scheduling problem with minimum makespan and total flow time, and proposed a memetic algorithm by integrating a general multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.

However, except for Gawiejnowicz, Kurc, and Pankowska (2006), we found no scheduling research involving multiple criteria with time-dependent deteriorating jobs. Gawiejnowicz et al. examined a single-machine bi-criteria scheduling problem to identify the pareto optimality that minimizes the total completion time and the makespan, and the optimality of a convex combination of 
                        
                           ∑
                           
                              
                                 C
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                        
                      and C
                     
                        max
                      criteria. In this paper, we study a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem with time-dependent deteriorating jobs to minimize the total completion time subject to minimum makespan. It is well known that the flow shop scheduling to minimize total completion time is NP-hard even if there are no deteriorating jobs (Garey, Johnson, & Sethi, 1976). Wang et al. (2006) proved that the two-machine flow shop scheduling problem to minimize total completion time with simple linear deterioration is NP-hard. Therefore, the problem we considered is also NP-hard.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formalize the problem. A mixed integer programming model for the problem is developed in Section 3. Section 4 studies the polynomially solvable special cases. Several dominance conditions are discussed in Section 5. In Section 6, we propose a branch-and bound algorithm and describe the upper bound and the lower bound for the studied problem. Numerical studies are conducted in Section 7 to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. Concluding remarks are given in Section 8.

                        Example 1
                        There are five jobs to be processed in two-machine flow shop by M
                           1 and M
                           2 with deteriorating rates: α

                           5
                           =0.2. We find that the minimum makespan is C
                           
                              max
                           
                           =7.338, and if the jobs are processed in non-increasing order of β
                           
                              j
                           , then the total completion time is 
                              
                                 ∑

                           . However, the schedule obtained in non-decreasing order of β
                           
                              j
                            with the makespan C
                           
                              max
                           
                           =9.220 is not an optimal schedule for minimizing makespan, and the total completion time is 
                              
                                 ∑

                                 23.052
                              
                           . It shows that the non-increasing schedule obtains the minimum makespan but does not minimize the total completion time, while the non-decreasing schedule obtains the minimimum total completion time but breaks the premise condition of the minimized makespan.

The proof is similar to that of Property 4, and is omitted here.□

We develop a branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B) to identify the optimal or near-optimal solution. Instead of systematically enumerating all candidate solutions, B&B discards en masse and employs upper and lower bounds and dominance conditions to reduce the search space. We detail the branch-and-bound algorithm next.

Adapted from Mosheiov’s algorithm (2002), we develop a polynomial heuristic to obtain a primal sequence. Subsequently, we perform pairwise interchanges on the primal schedule to improve the performance, until further improvement of the objective function is impracticable. We now present the two-phase algorithm: Phase I is based on Mosheiov’s algorithm, while Phase II further improves the quality of the near-optimal solution by using standard pairwise interchange for each of the two partial schedules. Details are presented next.

It is known that dominance conditions can reduce the number of interchanges and fully pairwise interchange may improve the quality of near-optimal solution. In addition, Property 5 acknowledges that the quality of partial dominant schedule can influence that of the final schedule. We thus propose an alternative heuristic algorithm to obtain a different upper bound. The steps are detailed below.

By combining the solutions of TPA (UB
                        1) and FPIA (UB
                        2), we define the upper bound (UB) of the studied problem as.


                        UB
                        =
                        min{UB

The efficiency of the branch-and-bound algorithm also depends on the quality of the lower bound. Problem

                        2 according to the shortest remaining deterioration rate (SRDR) rule, while the minimum value of Eq. (17) can be obtained by sequencing the unscheduled jobs in nondecreasing order of the deterioration rates. Therefore, we obtain the first lower bound

In Section 3, we formulated a mixed integer programming (MIP) for the problem. In order to obtain a lower bound, we relaxed the zero-one variable δ
                        
                           ij
                         to be a continuous one in [0,1]. Here we assume k jobs in a partial sequence σ

                        =([1],[2],…,[k])) are scheduled. We modify the model in Section 3 to reflect the fact that only n

                        k jobs need to be scheduled. Details follow:

(Move down the tree) Generate the ith node (i

(Update the upper-bound) Apply Properties 2–4 to calculate the upper-bound of the unfathomed partial schedules. If the upper-bound for the unfathomed partial schedule is larger than the initial solution, eliminate the node and all the nodes beyond it in the branch. If the value of the completed schedule is less than the initial solution, and the makespan remains optimal; Use it as the new solution. Otherwise, eliminate it.

(Update the lower-bound) For all jobs in Ω

                                 2 for level j, calculate the lower-bound of the unfathomed partial schedules, respectively. If the lower bound for the unfathomed partial schedule is less than the initial lower-bound, eliminate the node and all the nodes beyond it in the branch. If the value of the completed schedule is larger than the initial lower-bound, and the makespan remains optimal; Use it as the new lower-bound. Otherwise, eliminate it.

(Stopping rule) Continue to explore all the nodes until no more nodes can be explored.

Computational experiments were employed here to evaluate the performance of the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm (B&B). We randomly generated a large number of samples, and compared the proposed lower bound, upper bound and MIP solutions to the optimal solution while maintaining the optimal makespan. All the algorithms were implemented in Matlab. The deteriorating rates of jobs on M
                     1 and M
                     2 of the studied problem were generated from a uniform distribution over (0,1),and the number of jobs (n) in a sample may range from 5 to 50 jobs. For each sample size n, we randomly generated 20 cases and used the same data sets to test each of the proposed algorithms. Note that all results discussed in the following part are subject to the optimal makespan constraint.

In the first part of the experiment, we compare the total completion time obtained by the MIP approach, the brand-and-bound algorithm (B&B), the upper bound algorithm (UB), the lower bound algorithm (LB), and the optimal solution for n
                     =30, in which the optimal solution is derived through exhaustive enumeration. The results are displayed in Table 1
                     , which shows that the solutions obtained by B&B are better than that of the MIP approach. The average upper bound found by TPA and FPIA is better than that of the lower bound (see the last row of Table 1). We found that the total completion time derived from B&B and from UB are comparable and both are very close to the optimal solution. Therefore, the optimal solutions of the studied problem can be approximated by the results obtained by B&BA within a much shorter computation time.

In the second part of the experiment, we compare the results from the proposed algorithms with the optimal solution using the mean absolute percentage error. For each sample, we compute the percentage deviation, defined as

                      are the solutions computed by the MIP approach, the branch-and-bound algorithm, the upper bound algorithm and the lower bound algorithm, respectively. The experiments are run for 12 different job sizes (n
                     =5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 50), and 20 replications are randomly generated for each n. The results are shown in Table 2
                     .

We find that the average differences are no more than 1% for small-sized problem (n
                     ⩽25). However, when problem size is greater than 40, the mean differences are more than 3.4%. We also find that the MIP approach does not guarantee optimal solutions within the specified computation time. Table 2 also shows that the upper bound improves the performance of the branch-and-bound algorithm much more than that of the lower bound for all problem sizes. Since the maximum performance difference between the UB and B&B solution is only 0.14% when n
                     ⩽40. We thus can use the UB heuristics to effectively and efficiently solve this multi-criteria hierarchical flow shop scheduling problem, especially when the problem size is large and the computation of B&B algorithm become unwieldy.

Finally, we compare the solution efficiency in terms CPU time in seconds,. The results are given in Table 3
                     . It shows that the average computation time for the MIP by the Matlab approach increases dramatically when n
                     ⩾35.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

There has been a growing interest in studying the flow-shop scheduling problem with time-dependent deteriorating jobs. However, research is mostly limited to single performance measure. In this research, we address a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem with deteriorating processing time, with the goal of minimizing the total completion time subject to minimum makespan. We propose a mixed integer programming model, and a branch-and-bound algorithm combined with an upper- and a lower-bound for our problem. In order to limit the size of the search tree for the branch-and-bound algorithm, several dominance conditions are developed. We also present several polynomial-time solvable special cases. Numerical studies are performed to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. We find that the proposed B & B and the UB algorithms are more practical to solve the real world problems than the conventional methods used to solve the MIP model. Further research can be extended to study other bi-criteria scheduling problems with time-dependent deteriorating jobs in a single- or multiple-machine situations.
