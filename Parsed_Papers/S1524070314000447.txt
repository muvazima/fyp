                  Minimum enclosing ball algorithms are studied extensively as a tool in approximation and classification of multidimensional data. We present pruning techniques that can accelerate several existing algorithms by continuously removing interior points from the input. By recognizing a key property shared by these algorithms, we derive tighter bounds than have previously been presented, resulting in twice the effect on performance. Furthermore, only minor modifications are required to incorporate the pruning procedure. The presented bounds are independent of the dimension, and empirical evidence shows that the pruning procedure remains effective in dimensions up to at least 200. In some cases, performance improvements of two orders of magnitude are observed for large data sets.

The MEB problem, which is also known as the 1-center problem or the minimax location problem, has been studied for more than a century, and still receives much attention today due to its relevance in important application areas such as rendering, animation, collision detection, robotics, and machine learning.

                      boundary points from P. Thus, the fundamental task of an exact MEB solver is to locate these support points 
                     [15,8,7]. In many types of input, however, a majority of the points are strictly inside

                     . Being able to identify and eliminate, or prune, such points early on during MEB computations is therefore likely to speed up the subsequent processing.

                     [2,10,14,3,16,12]. Eliminating interior points has the potential to accelerate also these algorithms.

Clearly, the support points belong to the convex hull of the input set, and it would be possible to initially eliminate all points not on the hull. However, the time complexity of computing the convex hull would exceed that of most MEB algorithms used in practice. Furthermore, when all input points are on the hull, nothing would be pruned. On the other hand, the algorithm by Megiddo [13] uses a sophisticated prune-and-search method that always manages to reduce the input points by a constant factor in each algorithm pass. Thus, termination is guaranteed in linear time in fixed dimension. A realization of Megiddo’s approach, however, would be intractable due to its exponential dependency on the dimension.

A simpler and more practical pruning approach is described by Ahipaşaoğlu and Yıldırım [1]. By interleaving pruning passes with the main iterations of the two algorithms by Yıldırım [16], they obtain significant performance improvements in dimensions

                     Thus, any point satisfying this condition can safely be removed from the input.

In each pruning pass, Eq. (1) is first applied to the most recent intermediate ball, and then the pruning condition in Eq. (2) is evaluated for each point in P. In order to avoid the overhead of invoking the pruning procedure in situations where little or nothing is pruned, the procedure is skipped every time the right-hand side of Eq. (2) evaluates to a value smaller than or equal to 
                        
                           0.55

                      was determined empirically.

Nielsen and Nock [14] propose a distance-filtering technique to speed up repeated searches for the farthest point. Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, they are able to compute an upper bound on each squared distance

                      cost of computing the exact squared distance can be avoided whenever the upper bound does not exceed the largest squared distance encountered so far. An advantage of this approach is that no additional parameters, such as r and R above, are required, which might make it more generally applicable. A disadvantage, however, is that the effectiveness of this method is sensitive to how the input points are distributed in relation to the origin. Alternative distance filtering strategies that do not suffer from this problem are proposed in a recent publication [9]. A drawback shared by all these filtering approaches, however, is that every input point must be at least touched in every iteration, which is in stark contrast to the pruning procedures discussed herein, which continuously eliminate points entirely from further processing.

In this article, we improve the approach by Ahipaşaoğlu and Yıldırım so that more points are eliminated in each pass. We develop our methods from the concept of viability of the intermediate balls used to derive the pruning bounds. Specifically, our main contributions are (i) the key insight that viability is in fact satisfied in many existing algorithms for the MEB problem, which makes our pruning methods widely applicable, (ii) a tighter bound

                     , which in itself immediately leads to more effective point reductions, (iii) an improved alternative to the pruning condition in Eq. (2) and (iv) a thorough empirical evaluation where the presented techniques are applied to several state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition to enabling improved pruning, we believe that our theoretical results bring additional understanding of the MEB problem and may be useful in a wider perspective.

This section presents the theoretical results of the paper. In the first part, we discuss the general assumptions underlying our approach. Then in the second part, we present bounds that enable improved pruning.

We will require the following property on any approximate solution used to derive our bounds.

                        Theorem 1 immediately implies that viability holds in any algorithm based on the dual formulation. Notable examples are Yıldırım’s two algorithms [16] and the simple algorithm by Bădoiu and Clarkson [2]. In the latter, only a center point is maintained, but a viable ball is obtained by computing a radius using the objective function on the multipliers defining the center point. The above algorithms can be regarded as adaptations of the classical Frank–Wolfe algorithm, which solves the dual problem approximately [5]. In fact, we have recently discovered that the algorithm by Larsson and Källberg [12] also belongs to the same category, which is perhaps surprising since this algorithm was derived using a geometrical approach. See A for a more detailed discussion of this result. In addition, other algorithms have been presented which generate viable balls. An example is the exact solver by Gärtner [8], which uses Welzl’s algorithm [15] as a subroutine to compute the exact MEB of subsets of P. Each such MEB clearly has a corresponding feasible solution to the dual problem and is therefore viable. All these algorithms perform similar repeated farthest-point queries, and may therefore benefit from pruning.

We start by restating a well-known fact that is commonly invoked when reasoning about the MEB problem [1,4,2,3,12].

Note that the pruning condition can be regarded as defining an open ball centered at c whose radius is given by the right-hand side of the condition. The presented bounds ensure that this ball is fully enclosed in the interior of

This section concretizes the theory of the previous section and discusses how it can be applied in practice. The pseudocode in Fig. 3

                     -approximation MEB algorithm called ApxMEB1. The algorithm is described so as to capture the general structure of all the approximation algorithms discussed in Section 2. Also the algorithm by Gärtner follows a very similar structure, except it does not terminate the loop until the exact MEB is obtained. Since these algorithms differ in how they initialize and update the current ball, these steps are represented by abstract subroutines in the code (Lines 1 and 7, respectively). However, these subroutines are assumed to maintain viability of the ball

In the pruning procedure, which is carried out on Lines 4–6, a pruning radius 
                        
                           ρ
                        
                      is first computed using Theorems 2 and 4, and then a pruning pass is invoked to eliminate all points in P that fall inside the pruning ball.

In Fig. 4
                     , an alternative way to apply pruning to the same abstract algorithm is shown. Instead of pruning in a separate pass, this version of the algorithm integrates the pruning procedure with the search for the farthest point by computing a pruning ball that shares its center point with the updated ball.

                      before having updated R, this version of the algorithm uses Theorem 3 instead of Theorem 2 for this step, utilizing the preceding values of c and R (Lines 4, 6, and 7). In the subroutine FarthPtPrune invoked on Line 9, each squared distance

                      to be pruned, the same squared distance is used to determine if

                      is the farthest point so far. The advantage of this approach, and the motivation behind Theorem 3, is reduced overhead: whereas ApxMEB1 processes the remaining points twice in every iteration (Lines 6 and 8), ApxMEB2 needs to process them only once per iteration (Line 9).

Note that while the pseudocode in Fig. 4 assumes that no pruning is possible before the loop, this might indeed be possible if the ball initialization of a particular algorithm provides the parameters necessary to give a pruning radius 
                        
                           ρ
                           >

                     . For example, in all the algorithms considered in Section 4, the ball is initialized as

                      are input points found by two consecutive farthest-point queries. If applying the method in Fig. 4 on these algorithms, pruning can be integrated into the farthest-point search before the loop by using

                     . Consequently, this pruning method gets a head start over the method of Fig. 3.

As an illustrative example, Fig. 5
                      visualizes the pruning procedure at different times during the computation of a

                     -approximate bounding sphere using ApxMEB1, in this case embodied by the second algorithm by Yıldırım [16]. Each image shows the pruning ball and what remains of the input in iteration i (only those triangles with at least one remaining vertex are shown). These images reveal that a large part of the input set is eliminated at an early stage. This is also suggested by Fig. 6
                     , where the values of 
                        
                           r
                           ,

                      during the same computation are plotted. Here 
                        
                           ρ
                        
                      grows beyond

                           %
                        
                      of r early on and then continues to grow throughout the remaining computations, albeit not monotonically. Notice how the slow but steady increase in r makes the dependency of 
                        
                           ρ
                        
                      on R particularly visible in this figure: every change in R is mirrored by a (more pronounced) change in 
                        
                           ρ
                        
                     .

Although the second pruning method above avoids the cost of an additional pruning pass in every iteration, it is possible to reduce the overhead of the first method as well if one is willing to accept an increase in memory consumption. Observe that the point-distance computations in the left-hand side of the pruning condition will always be repetitions of the point-distance computations already performed during the most recent search for the farthest point, because the same center point is used. The search can easily be modified to store each squared distance

This section presents the results from an experimental evaluation of the presented techniques. We implemented both pruning and non-pruning versions of Yıldırım’s two algorithms [16] as well as the algorithm FastApxBall by Larsson and Källberg [12]. A remark concerning our implementations of Yıldırım’s algorithms is that the individual multipliers are not maintained explicitly in the first algorithm (see A for more details), and only the multipliers for core-set points are kept tracked of in the second algorithm to realize the away-steps. Three different pruning methods were implemented: the two methods from Section 3 as well as the original method from [1]. Henceforth, we will refer to these as KL1, KL2, and AY, respectively. Apart from using a different pruning condition, AY was implemented identically to KL1. This means that we chose not to use the heuristic described in [1] which avoids invoking the pruning procedure when little effect can be expected. Note that this introduces no bias towards any of the pruning methods, since the same heuristic is equally applicable to all of them. Furthermore, we are mostly interested in the effects of the improved bounds, and the crudeness of the heuristic risks to make these effects less clear. In the implementations of AY and KL1, the distance caching technique from Section 3.1 was used.

All code was written in C++ and compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 under the default x64 release settings. Only simple data structures were used; for example, the input point sets were represented as 2-dimensional arrays of single-precision floating-point values. In this representation, we let a first-level array contain pointers into a second-level array storing the actual point data. This made it easy to efficiently remove pruned points from the set by shifting elements in the first-level array to the left. We did also try a solution where each pruned point is simply replaced by the point in the last position of the array. However, this decreased overall performance because it led to irregular memory access patterns in the second-level array.

Despite using only single-precision floating-point, we did not observe any robustness issues due to numerical imprecision in our test runs. A possible source of such problems in the pruning procedure itself could be the computation of the pruning radius: if floating-point errors make the radius slightly too large, points that are indeed located on the surface of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 B
                              
                              
                                 ∗
                              
                           
                        
                      can be erroneously eliminated from the input, potentially leading to incorrect output. Conversely, however, too small pruning radii would have only the benign effect of slightly decreasing the number of eliminated points. Furthermore, any robustness problems in the underlying algorithm to which the procedure is applied, e.g., in the corresponding UpdateBall subroutine, could propagate and increase the pruning radius. In all the tested algorithms, however, none of the pruning methods altered the returned ball or the number of passes performed.

The measurements were made under Windows 7 on a laptop PC with an Intel i7-3820QM CPU (2.7GHz) and 16GB of main memory. All runs were performed single-threaded and without vectorization.

The first experiment involved large input sets in 3 to 200 dimensions. The cardinality was kept fixed at

                         provide an implementation- and platform-independent measure of the amount of work saved, by showing the total number of point-distance computations performed during farthest-point queries throughout each algorithm as a percentage of the total number of such computations in the non-pruning version (where it is always nk). Thus, a lower w value means that faster execution can be expected.

A number of trends can be observed in these tables. First of all, KL1 consistently eliminates more point-distance computations than the other two methods. The largest speedups, which quite frequently exceed twice those of AY, are obtained with this method as well. We also see that KL2 for the most part eliminates more computations and gives larger performance improvements than AY.

The effect of all the pruning methods is the largest on the normally distributed data (with the main exception being the case 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              5
                           
                        ). This is natural since a majority of the points in these sets are concentrated near 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                 
                                 
                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                         and are likely to be covered early on by the first few pruning balls. The smallest effect can be observed on the uniform data generated inside a ball. These point sets tend to instead be uniformly distributed in the entire volume of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                                 
                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                        , which reduces the number of points covered by each pruning ball.

It is also evident that in general, the effectiveness of all the pruning approaches diminishes as d increases. This can be attributed to the fact that the volume of a ball with radius r in dimension d is proportional to 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    r
                                 
                                 
                                    d
                                 
                              
                           
                        . Thus, the volume ratio between any pruning ball and 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    B
                                 
                                 
                                    ∗
                                 
                              
                           
                         will approach 0 as d approaches infinity. This effect is particularly visible on the third distribution, on which the w values go up to 
                           
                              100
                              %
                           
                         already for 
                           
                              d
                              =

                        . With these point sets, the pruning effectiveness is roughly proportional to the volume ratio. For example, consider a pruning ball whose radius is as large as, say, 
                           
                              0.95

                        . In dimension 200, the volume ratio then becomes

                        . Needless to say, very limited effect can be expected in this case. Nevertheless, significant acceleration is still visible on the other two distributions at 
                           
                              d
                              =

                        .

Another trend visible is the general differences in speedups between the algorithms. This seems to correlate with their base performance. In most cases, Yıldırım 1 requires many more iterations to finish than the other two algorithms; this gives it longer execution times and more room for improvement. The same holds for Yıldırım 2 when compared to FastApxBall.

Of course, invoking the pruning procedure in each iteration inevitably incurs overhead, and even more overhead is imposed by the reorganization of the input container when points are actually pruned. This can account for the discrepancies between the speedups suggested by the w values in Tables 1–3 and the speedups actually achieved. Moreover, a point set that is only reduced by a small amount in the early pruning passes can give the same w value as a point set that is only reduced by a large amount in the last pruning passes, which hides the fact that the latter case incurs a larger overhead than the former. On the first two distributions, the overhead was far outweighed by the reduction in computations, leading to significant time savings. On the other hand, this was less the case on the third distribution, on which the FastApxBall algorithm even suffered slowdowns.

To observe the performance implications in situations where nothing is pruned, we also generated point sets in which all points coincide with the surface of a ball. Although this could be expected to be a worst-case scenario, the only additional cost in this case is testing the pruning condition in each iteration. The worst speedup factor observed on these inputs were 
                           
                              0.7
                           
                         for AY and KL1. The worst case for KL2 was only 
                           
                              0.9
                           
                        , due to its tighter integration of the pruning procedure.

The second experiment focused on approximate bounding sphere computations for complex three-dimensional polygon meshes. We wanted to evaluate our techniques also on real-world data, and the three-dimensional case is of special interest in many applications. The same algorithms and approximation factor were used as before. The models selected for this experiment include some well-known reference models as well as other interesting test cases. All the used models are rendered in Fig. 7
                        , and the measured data are shown in Table 4
                        .

Unlike the tables in the previous subsection, each row in Table 4 shows data from all three algorithms. The subscripts 
                           
                              Y

                              2
                           
                        , and 
                           
                              F
                           
                         are used here to distinguish between Yıldırım 1, Yıldırım 2, and FastApxBall, respectively. As before, the t values refer to the execution times in seconds of the original versions of the algorithms. Speedup factors are only reported for the KL1 pruning method, which is the method that gave the largest speedups.

These figures seem to confirm that our pruning techniques have the potential of improving performance also on real-world three-dimensional input. As in the first experiment, however, the effect on FastApxBall is less positive than on the other two algorithms. Again, this can be expected from its significantly higher base performance, which reaches up to two orders of magnitude of the performance of the other two. In fact, even with pruning enabled, the other two algorithms fail to reach the same level of performance as the non-pruning version of FastApxBall.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Our experimental results demonstrated the usefulness of the pruning procedure, and our tighter bounds led to significantly improved effects compared to previous bounds [1]. The pruning method most successful in reducing computation times was KL1 when coupled with distance caching.

As shown by the pseudocode in Figs. 3 and 4, the pruning procedure can be incorporated into several recent state-of-the-art algorithms with minimal effort. Furthermore, it is possible to modify several of these algorithms to handle input objects other than points, such as balls and ellipsoids. Given fully functioning such adaptations, all that is required to employ the presented pruning techniques is a fast method to determine when such an input object is fully contained in the pruning ball.

In our experiments, pruning gave performance improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in Yıldırım’s algorithms. In the case of FastApxBall, however, more moderate speedups of around 
                        
                           2
                           ×
                        
                      were obtained, and in some cases, the execution time was even increased by up to 
                        
                           40
                           %
                        
                     . However, this could be considered a mild overhead in relation to the potential performance gains.

                      in all presented tests, which appears to be a common choice [10,16,1]. Note, however, that using values of

                      to compute finer approximations would likely result in even larger speedups, since this would increase the iteration counts of the algorithms. Conversely, values of 
                        
                           ∊
                           >
                           
                              
                                 10
                              
                              
                                 -

                      would of course reduce the number of iterations.

It is clear that the success of the presented pruning techniques is limited by the dimension. For points uniformly distributed in a ball, we hit the wall at 
                        
                           d
                           =
                           200
                        
                     . Moreover, extrapolating the figures from Tables 1–3 supports the conclusion that eventually, the techniques will fall short also on the other point distributions as d increases further.

There are a number of interesting directions for further studies. One such direction would be to consider tailored solutions to tackle the more challenging cases, such as inputs uniformly distributed in a ball. We also believe that similar practical pruning techniques can be developed for computation of other enclosing shapes in high dimensions, such as 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           +
                           ∊
                           )
                        
                     -approximate ellipsoids [11].

Another interesting direction would be to investigate solutions for on-line prediction of pruning effectiveness to avoid wasted pruning efforts. For example, it would be useful if the number of points to be pruned in the next iteration could be predicted with sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, if the number of remaining iterations of the algorithm itself could be estimated, the pruning procedure could be disabled when further point reductions would have limited opportunities to pay off.

Finally, there are opportunities for parallelization of these algorithms. In particular, the search for the farthest point lends itself for both thread-level and data-level parallelization features of modern CPUs [12] and GPUs [9]. The proposed pruning techniques should be fully compatible with such solutions, and it would be interesting to evaluate the combined impact.

We have recently discovered that the simple ball expansion operation described in [12, Eqs. (1) and (2)] is equivalent to what is done in the “plus-iterations” of Yıldırım’s algorithms [16]; that is, updating an intermediate approximation

An interesting implication of this is that the FastApxBall algorithm, similarly to Yıldırım’s algorithms, can be regarded as an adaptation of the Frank–Wolfe algorithm. In this interpretation, the purpose of the inner solver in FastApxBall is to further refine the current feasible solution while remaining in the same face of the unit

                     -simplex [5]. A further implication is that the algorithm SimpleApxBall mentioned in the concluding part of [12] is completely equivalent to Yıldırım’s first algorithm. It follows that the upper bound of
