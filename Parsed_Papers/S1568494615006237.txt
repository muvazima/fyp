                  The fixed charge problem is a special type of nonlinear programming problem which forms the basis of many industry problems wherein a charge is associated with performing an activity. In real world situations, the information provided by the decision maker regarding the coefficients of the objective functions may not be of a precise nature. This paper aims to describe a solution algorithm for solving such a fixed charge problem having multiple fractional objective functions which are all of a fuzzy nature. The enumerative technique developed not only finds the set of efficient solutions but also a corresponding fuzzy solution, enabling the decision maker to operate in the range obtained. A real life numerical example in the context of the ship routing problem is presented to illustrate the proposed method.
