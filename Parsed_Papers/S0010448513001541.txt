                  We introduce and study a new implicit representation of rational Bézier curves and surfaces in the 3-dimensional space. Given such a curve or surface, this representation consists of a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables and whose rank drops exactly on this curve or surface. Our approach can be seen as an extension of the moving lines implicitization method introduced by Sederberg, from non-singular matrices to the more general context of singular matrices. In the first part of this paper, we describe the construction of these new implicit matrix representations and their main geometric properties, in particular their ability to solve efficiently the inversion problem. The second part of this paper aims to show that these implicitization matrices adapt geometric problems, such as intersection problems, to the powerful tools of numerical linear algebra, in particular to one of the most important: the singular value decomposition. So, from the singular values of a given implicit matrix representation, we introduce a real evaluation function. We show that the variation of this function is qualitatively comparable to the Euclidean distance function. As an interesting consequence, we obtain a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational space curve or surface over the field of real numbers. Then, we show that implicit matrix representations can be used with numerical computations, in particular there is no need for symbolic computations to use them. We give some rigorous results explaining the numerical stability that we have observed in our experiments. We end the paper with a short illustration on ray tracing of parameterized surfaces.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In geometric modeling, parameterized algebraic curves and surfaces are used intensively. To manipulate them, it is useful to have an implicit representation, in addition to their given parametric representation. Indeed, a parametric representation is for instance well adapted for visualization purposes whereas an implicit representation allows significant improvements in the computation of intersections. Nevertheless, implicit representations are known to be very hard to compute in general. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by introducing a simple method for computing an implicit representation of a parameterized curve or surface in the form of a matrix. We will call them implicit matrix representations.

Matrix-based implicit representations of plane curves and surfaces have already appeared several times in the literature (see e.g.  [1–4]). However, all these approaches aimed at building a non-singular matrix whose determinant is an implicit polynomial equation. The case of plane curves is well understood: it is always possible to build such a non-singular matrix, in particular by means of the moving lines method introduced by Sederberg  [4]. The case of surfaces is much more involved because of their rich geometry and the occurrence of base points (the points where the parameterization is not well defined). Thus, in order to find a non-singular matrix whose determinant is an implicit polynomial equation, one has to consider some very particular classes of parameterizations (see e.g.  [2,5,6]).

In this paper, we show that matrix-based implicit representations can be built for (almost all) parameterized algebraic curves, including space curves, and surfaces if the requirement of getting a non-singular matrix is deleted. Indeed, the matrices we will introduce are in general singular matrices, but they still represent the curve or surface: the vanishing of a determinant will be replaced by a drop-of-rank property. Our approach is hence to keep these matrices as implicit representations on their own and to develop their study and use. Added and combined to the parametric representations, we believe that these implicit matrix representations can be a powerful tool.

The theoretical foundations of implicit matrix representations have been developed in a couple of papers  [7,8], using tools from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. We will review their main properties in Section  3. The first contribution of this paper is to adapt the construction of these matrices to the context of Bézier patches (usually obtained from the decomposition of a NURBS). This is the content of Section  2. The rest of the paper, and its main contribution, is a study of implicit matrix representations through a famous tool of numerical linear algebra: the singular value decomposition (SVD). It turns out that combined with this SVD, implicit matrix representations have very nice properties and show very good numerical behavior. In Section  4, a real evaluation function is built from an implicit matrix representation and it is shown that this function is comparable to the classical Euclidean distance. As a by-product, a new determinantal formula for implicitizing a rational Bézier curve or surface over the field of real numbers is obtained. Section  5 is devoted to the study of the numerical behavior of implicit matrix representations. In particular, we show that there is no need for symbolic computations to use them and we prove results that give insights for their numerical stability and robustness that we have observed in our experiments. Finally, the paper ends with a short discussion on the application of implicit matrix representations to intersection problems.

                           u
                         and the degree in the variable 
                           v
                        . In the following, all the inequalities between these bi-degrees are understood component-wise.

The family of matrices we have built in the previous section is particularly interesting because these matrices can be seen as implicit representations of a parameterized curve or surface, if the degree 
                        ν
                      is not too small. In this section, we describe their main properties. Notice that most of them have been already proved in a more general setting using techniques from algebraic geometry and commutative algebra (see  [9,7,8,10]).

Hereafter, we take again the notation of Section  2: 
                        ϕ
                      denotes the parameterization (1) of a curve or a surface and

                           ϕ
                           )

By construction, the entries of the matrices

                           R
                           
                              [

The proofs of Facts 1 and 2 can be found in  [9,8,10] for the cases of rational curves (Section  2.1), triangular (Section  2.2) and tensor-product (Section  2.3) rational surfaces respectively. They are independent of any choice of basis (i.e. choices for

If this is not the case, then one has to deal with some extraneous hyperplanes that appear in addition to

                         can be decreased by the smallest degree of a curve in the parameter space going through all the base points, which is at least 1 if there exist base points (see  [8]). However, all these improved values depend on particular geometric features of the parameterization 
                           ϕ
                         and are hence not stable under numerical perturbations. This is why we emphasized the smallest values of the critical degree that only depend on the degree of the

                         (notice that the denominator can never vanish). If 
                           ϕ
                         parameterizes a triangular (Section  2.2) or a tensor-product (Section  2.3) rational Bézier surface, we can proceed similarly and the computation of two ratios yields the two coordinates of the pre-image of 
                           P
                        .

With an M-rep, it is hence possible to handle at the same time a non-singular point 
                           P
                           ∈
                           
                              Im
                           
                           
                              (
                              ϕ
                              )
                           
                         and its pre-image through a simple null space computation. This property can be very useful in many circumstances, such as for instance for splitting a curve at a point in space, or for dealing with trimmed surfaces.

To simplify our notation, in the following we will denote by the 
                           
                              corank

                              corank

The most important property of the SVD for our purposes is that it is a powerful tool for deciding the rank of a matrix. We will come back to this in the next section when dealing with numerical computations. For now, we will only need the following elementary property:

                        Theorem 1 shows that implicit matrix representations allow us to produce square matrices whose determinant is an implicit polynomial equation for a parameterized curve or surface over the real numbers. In general, this equation is not of the lowest possible degree, see e.g.  Example 5. Notice too that Theorem 1 can be extended to the field of complex numbers by taking the Hermitian matrix transpose instead of the simple matrix transpose (the Hermitian transpose of a complex matrix is obtained by taking its transpose and then by taking the complex conjugate of each entry).

In the field of real algebraic geometry, the Łojasiewicz inequality is a classical result that gives information concerning the relative rate of growth of two continuous semi-algebraic functions (see for instance  [15]). In our context, it can be used to compare the growth of the evaluation function given in Definition 2 with the one of the usual Euclidean distance between

Implicit matrix representations are interesting not only for their nice geometric properties, but also because all the experiments we have conducted have shown a particularly good numerical stability. One can expect that this is a consequence of the design of M-reps that makes them very well adapted to the SVD which is one of the basic and most important tool of numerical linear algebra. Indeed, as we will explain in this section, all the properties of M-reps can be exploited using numerical computations by means of the SVD, even their construction. In addition, we provide some rigorous results on the properties of M-reps under numerical computations in order to give more insight on the good numerical behavior of M-reps we have observed in our experiments.

In the presence of roundoff errors and data perturbations, every matrix tends to be a full rank matrix and hence determining its original rank becomes nontrivial. A strict and operational definition of “numerical rank”, which is widely used in the field of numerical linear algebra, takes the following form.

Due to computer arithmetic, the calculated singular values may be different from the exact singular values. However, one can show (see  [14, Section 5.5.8]) that the computed singular values of 
                           A
                         are the exact singular values of a slightly perturbed matrix 
                           A
                           +
                           E

                         is the roundoff unit (see  [14, Section 2.4.2]) and 
                           ρ
                         is a slowly growing function of 
                           m
                         and 
                           r
                        . Therefore, in this context the tolerance 
                           ϵ
                         is usually chosen in this form, so that it makes sense in (18) to use the computed singular values of 
                           A
                         in place of the exact singular values of

                           ϕ
                         is obtained as the null space of the multiplication matrix

                         which is built directly from the control points and weights of 
                           ϕ
                         (see e.g. (8)). We will describe how this computation can be done numerically by means of the SVD.

                         can be read off the SVD of the matrix

The numerical computation of M-reps have some similarities with approximate implicitization  [19,20], as the use of the SVD, but it is different. In particular, with M-reps there is no need to guess or estimate a good degree for the approximate implicit representation, it is provided by the method: this is the integer

                        . Therefore, it seems quite natural to compute the SVD of

                         for deciding if 
                           P
                         belongs to 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Im

                              ϕ
                              )
                           
                        . However, one has to be careful because there is a subtle difficulty. Indeed, the theory of the SVD has been shown to be very powerful when dealing with the whole space of dense matrices. For instance, looking at (17) it is clear that the matrix 
                           B
                         can be any matrix without a particular structure, even if 
                           A
                         has such a particular structure itself. In our setting, we are handling M-reps which are pencils of matrices (see (9)) and hence are very particular. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the detection of a numerical drop of rank at a given point 
                           Q
                         corresponds to the existence of another point 
                           P
                         in its neighborhood such that the exact rank of 
                           
                              
                                 M
                              
                              
                                 ν
                              
                           
                           
                              (
                              P
                              )
                           
                         drops. This is because M-reps have this particular structure of being a pencil of matrices. In general, working with such particular subspaces of matrices may lead to difficulties with the SVD. However, all the experiments we have made with M-reps have always shown a very good numerical behavior. In order to explain and clarify these observations, we prove two results showing that a given point 
                           P
                         is close to

                              )
                           
                         if and only if the numerical rank of

Notice, however, that Proposition 2 is not very helpful in practice because the constants

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 c
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         are difficult to predict (they follow from the Lojasiewicz inequalities). Nevertheless, it reinforces our experimental observations showing the very good numerical behavior of M-reps.

Given a parameterization (1), we have shown in Section  3.3 that the inversion problem can be solved by computing a one-dimensional null space. Exploiting the capability of the SVD for computing numerical null space, as explained in Section  5.2, it becomes possible to treat the inversion problem with numerical computations.

                         be an M-rep of a parameterization 
                           ϕ
                        , as in (1), and consider a given tolerance 
                           ϵ
                        . Let

Our main motivation for introducing M-reps was to tackle intersection problems by generalizing the approach initiated by Canny and Manocha for non-singular matrix representations  [3]. This approach consists in combining matrix-based implicit representations with generalized eigenvalues computations. We have extended it to M-reps recently: see  [21,9] for the curve/surface intersection and  [9] for the curve/curve intersection by means of M-reps. Here, we quickly review how the properties of M-reps allow us to intersect a parameterized curve with another parameterized curve or surface that is represented by an M-rep, i.e. a curve/M-rep intersection problem.

For simplicity and clarity, let us consider the intersection between a ray and a parameterized surface (e.g. a Bezier patch obtained after the decomposition of a NURBS into Bézier patches [22, Chapter 5, Section 5.3]). This intersection problem is intensively used for ray tracing NURBS. A classical approach consists of computing an implicit representation of the ray as the intersection of two planes given by linear equations in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     . Then, substituting the surface parameterization into these two equations yields a polynomial system that can be solved via the Newton method. The intersection points are then obtained in the parameter space of the surface, so one can compute the normal of the surface at these points without difficulty (this is required for light reflection for instance).

Another way to proceed is to compute an implicit equation of the parameterized surface, to substitute the ray parameterization in this equation and solve a univariate polynomial. However, the implicitization step is very hard in general, due to the presence of base points. But M-reps have been designed to overcome this difficulty and are very easy to compute. So, let 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              ν
                           
                        
                      be an M-rep of the surface parameterization. Substituting the ray parameterization into 
                        
                           
                              M
                           
                           
                              ν
                           
                        
                      yields a matrix whose entries are univariate linear polynomials in the parameter of the ray, say 
                        t
                     . Finding the intersection points amounts to finding the values of 
                        t
                      such that this matrix is not full rank. These values are the generalized eigenvalues of this matrix (which is actually a univariate pencil of matrices) and, after a reduction step based on the SVD, they can be found by using algorithms that have been developed by the community of numerical linear algebra (see for instance  [23, Chapter 4]). Using the ray parameterization, we then obtain the intersection points in 
                        
                           
                              R
                           
                           
                              3
                           
                        
                     . Now, thanks to the inversion property of M-reps, one can find the pre-image of these intersection points in the surface parameter space and hence compute the normal to the surface at these points (notice that intersection points that are singular points on the surface do not have a well defined normal vector). We refer the reader to  [21] for the details (see also  [24] for the linearization step in the Bernstein basis instead of in the power basis). Notice too that a study of the numerical accuracy in generalized eigenvalue computations can be found in  [25]. In Fig. 2
                     , a ray tracing of the sphere given in Example 2 is shown. It has been obtained by Valentin Michelet (an engineering student) who developed his own ray tracer from scratch by computing the ray/surface intersection by means of M-reps. Two other illustrations are given in Fig. 3
                     .

It should be clear to the reader that the above method can be applied with any parameterization that admits an M-rep. Therefore, parameterized curve/curve and parameterized curve/surface intersections can be treated exactly in the same way. An implementation of these intersections has been done in the algebraic geometric modeler Axel, in the plugin Shape; it is freely available at the URL: http://axel.inria.fr.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a new implicit representation of a parameterized curve or surface is presented: a matrix whose entries depend on the space variables. It has the property that its rank drops after evaluation at a given point if and only if this point belongs to the curve or surface under consideration. The main properties of such an implicit matrix representation are described and a detailed analysis of its numerical behavior is given. Its use for solving intersection problems is also illustrated and seems to be promising. The surface/surface intersection problem by means of this new representation is still a topic for future research. A preliminary investigation has already started  [26], but more work is necessary to get a numerically stable and robust method, as we provided for the curve/M-rep intersection problem.
