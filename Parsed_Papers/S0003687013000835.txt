                  The main objective of this study is to establish an approach for measuring the dry and evaporative heat dissipation cricket helmets. A range of cricket helmets has been tested using a sweating manikin within a controlled climatic chamber. The thermal manikin experiments were conducted in two stages, namely the (i) dry test and (ii) wet test. The ambient air temperature for the dry tests was controlled to ∼23 °C, and the mean skin temperatures averaged ∼35 °C. The thermal insulation value measured for the manikin with helmet ensemble ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 clo. The results showed that among the five cricket helmets, the Masuri helmet offered slightly more thermal insulation while the Elite helmet offered the least. However, under the dry laboratory conditions and with minimal air movement (air velocity = 0.08 ± 0.01 ms−1), small differences exist between the thermal resistance values for the tested helmets. The wet tests were conducted in an isothermal condition, with an ambient and skin mean temperatures averaged ∼35 °C, the evaporative resistance, R
                     et, varied between 36 and 60 m2 Pa W−1. These large variations in evaporative heat dissipation values are due to the presence of a thick layer of comfort lining in certain helmet designs. This finding suggests that the type and design of padding may influence the rate of evaporative heat dissipation from the head and face; hence the type of material and thickness of the padding is critical for the effectiveness of evaporative heat loss and comfort of the wearer. Issues for further investigations in field trials are discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In Test Cricket, players typically spend considerable amounts of time under conditions of high thermal stress, both externally from environmental factors, and internally from increased heat production by the body, resulting in higher body temperature. To reduce the high temperature, the body perspires or produces sweat. As the perspiration evaporates and is transmitted to atmosphere, the body temperature is reduced and the body feels cooler (Özdil et al., 2007). Research has established that the human head plays an important role in thermoregulation; up to 50% of latent and sensible heat produced by the body is dissipated through the head, as an effect of increased temperatures and sweat production (Rasch et al., 1991; Desruelle and Candas, 2000; Jun et al., 2010).

The primary function of protective helmets is to prevent wearers from impact-related head injuries. The helmet shell, generally constructed with either composite or polymeric materials, and foam padding have been found to impede the transfer of moisture and heat, and hence reduce the head's ability to cool through the evaporation of sweat (Brühwiler, 2003; Mccullough and Kenney, 2003; Song et al., 2011). As a result, helmet usage and design could have a considerable bearing on thermal comfort. Hence, understanding the thermal behaviour of the head is important to form a basis for design and optimization of helmets for thermal comfort and to reduce heat strain to wearers (Bogerd and Brühwiler, 2008; De Bruyne et al., 2010).

Many researchers have developed a number of theories and models to analyse and understand thermal comfort (Lotens and Havenith, 1991; Fan and Chen, 2002; Mccullough and Kenney, 2003; Oğulata, 2007; Qian and Fan, 2009; Wang et al., 2011). In general, research in thermal comfort to date has primarily focused on how humans perceive thermal comfort of different textiles and apparel rather than on objective quantitative measures. For the purpose of this study, proven theories and models that are related to sports apparel comfort will be adopted.

Most of the recreational and international cricket games are played in an environment with little wind effect or low air velocity conditions (McGrath and Finch, 1996; Joshi, 2009), hence, for a player wearing a helmet and standing in such an environment, and when the player's body is in thermal equilibrium with the environment, the heat gain from the body equals heat loss to the immediate surrounding, as follows:

                     where M
                     net is the heat generated by metabolism in the human body (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003;ASHRAE Handbook, 2009). This heat will be transferred from the body to the environment through three basic mechanisms by: (i) conduction; (ii) convection; and (iii) radiation. However, conduction is not relevant in thermal interaction of human body and environment (ASHRAE Handbook, 2009). Hence, the mechanisms of heat transfer from the human body to the environment can be classified as (a) the dry heat transfer (C + R = the sum of the convection C and radiation R heat transfer), which is mainly governed by the mean temperature gradient between the clothed body surface and the environment (see Fig. 1
                     ), and (b) the evaporative heat transfer (H
                     e) governed by the difference between the water vapour pressure at the skin and that of the ambient air and by the degree of skin wetness (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003;Voelker et al., 2009; Cengel and Ghajar, 2011).

The influence of clothing on heat stress depends on the extent to which the clothing affects the heat and moisture transfer between the wearer and the environment. The two main properties of the clothing that affect the thermal balance between the wearer and the environment are the thermal resistance (R
                     ct) and the evaporative resistance (R
                     et) (Song et al., 2011). In helmets the intrinsic thermal resistance (R
                     cf) represents the resistance to heat transfer between the helmet surface and the skin and is a characteristic of the helmet ensemble itself, which is independent of the external environment and the body's condition.

Previous research has concentrated on the evaluation of heat transfer of cricket helmets without taking into consideration the sweating effect (Pang et al., 2013). However, a complete understanding of human heat exchange requires not only the convective, conductive and radiative heat losses to be measured but also this other important mechanism of heat dissipation, namely sweat evaporation (Celcar et al., 2008). In recent years, in order to fully understand the thermal behaviour of clothing systems, thermal manikins with human features (i.e. capable of generating heat and perspiration), have been used successfully in experimental investigations (Chen et al., 2003; Oğulata, 2007; Celcar et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011).

Among several known sweating thermal manikins (Chen et al., 2003; Oğulata, 2007; Celcar et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011), the thermal manikin ‘Newton’ from Measurement Technology Northwest is built in accordance with ASTM and ISO standards and is widely used for garment and environmental heat loss evaluation. The manikin surface is divided into separate sections, each of which has its own sweating, heating and temperature measuring system. Each thermal zone has sweat control through evenly distributed fluid ports on its surface and sweating rate can be controlled by an operator (Wang, 2008; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010) The whole ‘Newton’ manikin system produced reasonable results as compared against human trial studies (Blood and Burke, 2010).

The aim of this experimental study is to establish an approach to determine the thermal and evaporative resistance of a range of cricket helmets using the sweating thermal manikin measurements. These measurements would provide physical values related the heat and moisture transfer properties of helmet ensemble. Such values could contribute to the evaluation of the thermal comfort of helmet assembles, and could be used to improve helmet design by maximizing protection and minimizing thermal insulation and water vapour resistance for summer wear.

Five different models of commercially available cricket helmets were selected and tested in this research (Fig. 2
                        ). These reference helmets were the same as those used in the previous study conducted by the authors (Pang et al., 2013) to quantify the net heat transfer of the headgear under non-sweating conditions.

The sweating manikin called the ‘Newton’, operated by the automatic control software ThermDAC (Measurement Technology Northwest), was used in this research (Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010). The manikin was installed hanging in an upright standing position in the centre of a climatic chamber at the Manikin Laboratory of the School of Fashion and Textile, RMIT University. The manikin was operated statically without any body movement.

The manikin consists of 20 independently controlled thermal zones (see Fig. 3
                        ). All thermal zones are fitted with heaters to simulate metabolic heat output rates and use distributed wire sensors for measuring skin temperatures. The surface temperatures of all zones were set to 35.0 °C. The surface temperature, heat flux and heat loss were measured continuously at 10 s intervals for at least 80 min.

All the tests were conducted in a controlled laboratory within the acceptable ranges as specified in the International standards (ISO, 1995; ASTM F1291, 2010; ASTM F2370, 2010). The air was steady flowing from the chamber roof and was controlled under minimal air velocity at 0.08 ± 0.01 m/s for both dry and wet tests. Since the manikin ‘Newton’ is not design to measure clothing thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance at the same time. Therefore, two separate measurements were required: (1) dry test, and (2) wet test (Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010).

In the dry test condition the manikin was covered with a ‘skin’ suit where sweat is absent (Fig. 4
                           ). The testing environment was set at a Temperature (T) of 23 ± 0.5 °C, and a Relative Humidity (RH) of 50 ± 5% to simulate the dry conditions. The dry heat loss was measured for the ‘naked’ test, where no helmet is presence, and for each helmet respectively. The dry test measurements were then used as a reference for the wet test.

For the purpose of measuring the evaporative resistance of the helmet on the ‘naked’ manikin, wet tests were conducted in an isothermal condition, whereby both ambient temperature of the climate chamber and the mean skin temperature of the manikin were set to T = 35 ± 0.5 °C. The relative humidity was controlled at RH = 40 ± 5%. The isothermal condition was used to ensure that no dry heat loss and no condensation would occur, thus enabling the evaporative heat loss to be measured alone (Havenith et al., 2008; Richards et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011).

The skin suit was pre-wetted by spraying the distilled water from a spray bottle over the skin. In addition to this pre-wetting procedure, the wet-naked test, without helmets, was run for about 1½ hours with a perspiration rate of 700 gm−2 h−1. The wet-naked tests were performed before the wet-test in order to evenly distribute the moisture over the skin to simulate skin saturated with sweat.

During the wet-test, the perspiration rate of the manikin was set to 300 gm−2 h−1 to keep the manikin surface moist. Measurements were taken for 80 min after covering the manikin's head with a cricket helmet. The 80-minute duration was set to allow sufficient time for the helmeted-manikin to reach steady-state condition and at maximum saturation in moisture absorption, if there is any.

The two main helmet properties—i.e. thermal resistance (R
                        ct) and evaporative resistance (R
                        et) (Fig. 1)—which affect the thermal balance between the wearer and the environment, were calculated from experimental measurements. The equations used to calculate the relevant parameters are as follows (ASTM F1291, 2010; ASTM F2370, 2010; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010; Song et al., 2011):

When the manikin is not sweating, the average thermal resistance, which is used to define the insulation between the skin surface and the environment under dry conditions, is calculated for each zone in the following way:

Permeability is the ability of water vapor to move through clothing. It affects the amount of evaporative cooling that can occur, whereby it is calculated as follows:

@&#RESULTS@&#

It can be seen in Fig. 5
                      that during the first 10 min after a helmet was secured on the manikin head, a large variation in surface temperature was recorded. After that, the surface temperature in the head zone reached a steady-state condition; the temperature fluctuated within the range of 35 ± 1 °C and was maintained for the entire duration of the test. The coefficient of variance of the temperature during the steady state condition was maintained within 5%.

In this study, the dry thermal resistance (R
                        ct) and the evaporative resistance (R
                        et) of each helmet were measured. The measurements were obtained in controlled conditions for the manikin head without a helmet, and for the manikin head wearing five different helmets (see Table 1
                        ). All values presented here are steady-state values for the face and head zones.

The ambient air temperature in the climatic chamber was maintained at ∼23 °C and the mean skin temperatures averaged ∼35 °C. In these controlled conditions, the thermal insulation value measured for the manikin with helmet ensemble ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 clo. The clo values of each helmet do not differ significantly under dry testing conditions.

Helmets with similar thermal resistance can demonstrate substantially different evaporative resistance. For example when comparing the NXT, Premiere and Ultimate helmets, although having very similar thermal resistance (0.17 °C m2 W−1), the Premiere and Ultimate helmets have significantly lower evaporative resistance, which are 20% lower than that of the NXT helmet.


                        R
                        ef represents the resistance to moisture transfer between the skin and the helmet outer surface. Table 2
                         shows that R
                        ef increases significantly when a helmet is present.

The permeability index was calculated for each helmet and the overall permeability index, measured at the head and face zones, for all five helmets ranged from 0.22 to 0.26.

Heat dissipation from the manikin surface to the environment consists of two parts: (i) the dry heat loss C + R (convection, conduction and radiation); and (ii) the evaporative heat loss H
                        e. The results for dry heat dissipation from the naked manikin and the manikin wearing different helmet models are shown in Fig. 6
                        .

The dry heat loss calculated from the dry manikin measurements ranged from 4.04 to 4.77 and 4.51 to 5.21 for the face and head zones, respectively. Marginal variations in heat loss among the helmets were observed in both the head and face zones. However, in comparison with the naked manikin, the presence of a helmet has significantly impeded the dry heat loss at the head section, where the dry heat loss was reduced by 50% for most helmets.

The results for evaporative heat loss show much smaller variation in the face zone in comparison with those in the head, where the differences vary from 19% to 55%. Differences were more significant between the NXT and the Elite helmets.

Plots for heat flux versus time for the face and head zones are depicted separately for each helmet in Fig. 7
                        . The heat flux increases rapidly during the first 5 min of the experiment, gradually decreases in the next 5 min and then eventually plateaus to reach the steady-state condition. The average heat flux at the steady-state condition ranged from 83 to 140 Wm−2 and from 46 to 70 Wm−2 for the face and head zones respectively.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This article presents, for the first time, the thermal-manikin-based experimental data on thermal and evaporative resistance of five cricket helmets of different designs. The thermal and evaporative resistance of a specific ensemble can be determined in several ways, with a varying level of accuracy, reproducibility of measurement and cost involved (Lotens and Havenith, 1989; Fan and Chen, 2002; Qian and Fan, 2009). The helmets were tested on an instrumented sweating manikin in a controlled climatic chamber. The manikin measured the helmet thermal and evaporative resistance in a stationary standing position with minimal air movement (typically v = 0.15–0.2 ms−1) and this condition is defined as the standard measurement conditions according to the International standards (ISO, 1995). It was important to perform the ‘Newton’ manikin experiments in standardised conditions in order to understand the basic principles and to establish an approach that can be used later to analyse the measurements taken in dynamic conditions.

The experiments were conducted in two stages, namely dry test and wet test (Wang, 2008; Measurement Technology Northwest, 2010). The dry tests were conducted in non-isothermal conditions and were to measure the dry thermal insulation in the absence of sweat; whereas the wet tests were conducted in isothermal conditions, and together with the data obtained from the previous dry test, data collected were used to calculate the evaporative resistance values for each helmet ensembles. Each experiment lasted for 80 min with water continuously supplied to the manikin to simulate the sweating effect. At the beginning of the test, there were large variations in surface temperatures as the helmets were kept at room temperature. After 10 min, both the face and head surface temperatures attained a steady-state level of 35 °C, which was maintained for the entire duration of the experiment (Fig. 5).

The total thermal resistances R
                        ct and R
                        cf are attributes that account for a decrease in heat flow due to total insulation provided by the helmet components and the air layer between the skin and the helmet. The higher the value of R
                        ct, the lower net heat dissipation due to radiation and convection is achieved. In general, the values of R
                        ct range from 0.1 for the surface of a naked body to 0.2 for the helmets tested (Table 1), which are within the scope of R
                        ct that have been reported elsewhere (Mccullough et al., 1985). The largest values of R
                        ct and R
                        cf were observed for the Masuri helmet, followed by the Premiere and NXT helmets, and the smallest was that for the Elite helmet. Small differences existed between the thermal resistance values for the tested helmets under the dry test condition. One possible explanation is that the tests were conducted under controlled conditions of minimal air movement.

During the wet tests, the sweat rate of the manikin was controlled at the level of 300 gm−2 h−1, in order to simulate an individual sweating as a result from a moderate-to-high workload (Rehrer and Burke, 1996; Gonzalez et al., 2009). The evaporative resistance measures the amount of moisture trapped within the helmet ensemble. In Table 2, values for the evaporative resistance are averaged for each helmet and for the reference naked head. Most helmets transmitted 68–78% of evaporative heat compared with the naked head (assumed 100%). The evaporative resistance, Ret, varied between 36 and 60 m2 Pa W−1 for the helmets, in comparison with 45 m2 Pa W−1 for the naked head. It was reported that Ret should be as low as possible to allow for the clothing layer to transport water vapour (Havelka and Kus, 2011).

The Masuri helmet recorded the highest values of both thermal and evaporative resistance. The higher the value of evaporative resistance (always associated with low evaporative cooling or heat loss as shown in Figs. 6 and 7) the higher the level of heat stress. On the other hand, the Elite helmet showed lower resistance values (R
                        ct and R
                        cf). The main reason for this difference between evaporative resistance values is probably the presence of a thick layer of comfort lining. Elite helmet is the only helmet which possesses a 5 mm-thick lining that covers the entire inner surface of the helmet shell. A considerable amount of moisture was trapped and accumulated in the liner during the experiment. Such moisture reduces both the thermal and evaporative resistance of the helmet ensemble and hence increases the total heat dissipation from the wearer (Lotens et al., 1995; Havenith et al., 2008; Richards et al., 2008). Furthermore, it is reported that absorbed water in the clothing layer increases both heat capacity and thermal conductivity. With an increased water content more heat can be stored, while at the same time the heat conduction to the outer surface increases as well (Voelker et al., 2009).

It is shown in Table 2 that the evaporative resistance of the Elite helmet is slightly lower than that of the reference naked head. A possible explanation is that the water captured within the ‘skin’ suit can either diffuse through the materials (comfort padding, liners and foam) used in the helmet, escape through the helmet via the vent holes as vapour condensation occurs within the helmet materials (Richards et al., 2008). During the experiment, it was noted that the liners and the paddings absorbed the moisture of the ‘skin’ suit. Hence, the humidity at the ‘skin’ suit surface was less than 100%. In order to maintain the moisture of the skin suit at 100%, the manikin control system makes adjustments to the rate by increasing moisture content and thus releasing the heat. Moreover, the condensation would remain within the helmet ensembles. Published research has shown that condensation is responsible for the additional heat loss (Lawson et al., 2004; Richards et al., 2008). This is the speculated reason why evaporative resistance of the helmet ensembles can be lower than that in the naked head test (Chen et al., 2003).

The moisture vapour permeability characteristic of the material used in a cloth ensemble is an important parameter that affects the thermal comfort. It represents moisture permeability of clothing relative to its level of insulation and its ability to transfer perspiration from the body to the environment (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003; Lee and Obendorf, 2007). Low permeability keeps the wearer warm by preventing the escape of body heat and/or water vapour (Mondal and Hu, 2007). The higher the value of i
                        m, the easier it is for the heat to be dissipated through the helmet by means of evaporative cooling. Consequently, high permeability index values are desirable for effective evaporative heat transfer and thermal comfort (Mccullough and Kenney, 2003): the higher the evaporative resistance, the less permeable the clothing is to moisture transfer or vice versa (Table 2). However, when the ambient humidity is high and wind speed is low, evaporative cooling becomes less effective and the dry thermal resistance becomes more important for dissipating heat (Gibson, 1993). In order to optimize the heat exchange properties of a helmet, parameters such as the thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance of materials in addition to design and construction of the helmet should be considered.

It has been reported that, currently, almost all sweating thermal manikins cannot control the wet skin surface temperature because there is no feedback between the wet textile fabric skin and the manikin's controlling system (Wang et al., 2011). Depending on the measurement technique, testing conditions and the sweat gland construction, the reproducibility of the evaporative resistance values obtained from the sweating manikins may vary within a range from 50% to more than 100% (Richard and Mccullough, 2005; Wang et al., 2012). One of the main errors has been reported to come from the calculation of evaporative resistance using the manikin's surface temperature. The thermal manikins tend to predict a slightly warmer skin temperatures that those of volunteers for temperature ranges from 23 to 25 °C (Rugh and Lustbader, 2006; Bogdan and Zwolińska, 2012; Wang et al., 2012). In order to minimise the error on the evaporative resistance values and to avoid the error of overestimating the heat stress level of wearers, Wang et al. (2011) has suggested the experiment should be performed in the isothermal conditions and the mass loss method should be used to calculate the clothing evaporative resistance. Therefore, the wet tests in the present study were conducted in isothermal conditions and the ‘Newton’ thermal manikin uses the mass loss method to calculated the evaporative resistance, hence, the measurements presented in this paper, obtaining from the thermal manikin tests, can interpreted as an indicative results or used for comparative tests of different helmet models (Holmér, 2004).

The total heat losses were calculated using equations (6) and (7). The values were mainly affected by the temperature difference between the skin surface and the environment under natural convection.

By snugly fitting a cricket helmet to the head, it adds a layer of insulation to the head and face surfaces, thus reducing the heat loss from the covered area. The results for dry heat loss showed small differences in H
                        d values between helmets (Fig. 6). Comparing H
                        d with that for a naked head, the total dry heat loss was about 50% lower when wearing a cricket helmet. Similar values of dry heat loss have also been noted in previous research (Pang et al., 2013).

The standard testing methods used to determine the dry thermal resistance values do not measure the effects of air movement in a dynamic environment. During a cricket practice or game, higher levels of air velocity and body motion will increase the convective and evaporative heat loss from the player's body. In fact, several reports show that heat transfer through clothing ensembles is significantly affected by body and air movement (Mccullough and Hong, 1992; McCullough, 1993; Nilsson et al., 1998; Havenith et al., 2002; Qian and Fan, 2006). The static values presented in this paper may imply an overestimation of the actual insulation, whereby the actual heat loss may be greater. Further research is, therefore, needed in order to confirm the small differences in the dry thermal resistance observed in this study.

It is acknowledged that some air is enclosed between the helmet and the head surface. This air acts as an insulator preventing heat transfer by conduction and radiation. Yoo et al. (2000) found that the thickness of the air layer is negatively correlated with the vapour pressure, which affects the wearer's comfort. Likewise, previous research has demonstrated that the R
                        ct and R
                        et measurements improve when the air gap is considered (Gibson, 1993). Therefore, future studies will need to be extended to consider the air gap between the helmet and the head.

Although the measurements obtained from the thermal manikin are highly reproducible, no direct information on subjective human responses such as comfort is available. By using a combination of human and laboratory thermal manikin tests, clothing systems can be studied from both psychological and thermal aspects (Mark and Niklaus, 2001). Future research on thermal comfort feedback—measurement taken in field trails for the same helmets used by cricket players—would add value to the results presented in this paper.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This research investigated the thermal and evaporative resistances of five commercially available cricket helmets using the “Newton’ sweating manikin. All the experimental tests were conducted within an environmental chamber, where the temperature, humidity and wind velocity were controlled within the ranges specified in the relevant standards. The main conclusions stemming from this research are summarized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           Cricket helmets impede the heat exchange between the head surface and the environment. The dry heat dissipation was reduced by upto 50% due to the presence of a helmet in the non-sweating manikin test.

There is no significant difference between the tested helmets in terms of the thermal resistance measured under the dry test condition when the air movement in the climate chamber is small.

Tested helmets transmitted 68–78% of evaporative heat as compared with the naked head.

The type and design of comfort padding may influence evaporative heat dissipation from the wearer's head: the textile material and thickness of the padding are critical factors that determine the effectiveness of evaporative heat dissipation.

The findings reported here have been obtained through laboratory experiments using a sweating manikin, hence, currently it remains unclear if qualitatively similar results can be expected in other conditions, e.g., in the presence of radiant heat with different intensities and angles, and/or with the presence of wind, and how these results relate to comfort perception and possibly heat strain of athletes. Hence, these questions would need to be considered in future research and then through field trials involving cricket players. Such tests should be carried out in a range of realistic conditions to complement these reference studies and hence provide an effective test for thermal and evaporative heat transfer in diverse real world settings.
