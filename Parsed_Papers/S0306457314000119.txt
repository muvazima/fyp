                  Automatic text summarization has been an active field of research for many years. Several approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple position and word-frequency methods, to learning and graph based algorithms. The advent of human-generated knowledge bases like Wikipedia offer a further possibility in text summarization – they can be used to understand the input text in terms of salient concepts from the knowledge base. In this paper, we study a novel approach that leverages Wikipedia in conjunction with graph-based ranking. Our approach is to first construct a bipartite sentence–concept graph, and then rank the input sentences using iterative updates on this graph. We consider several models for the bipartite graph, and derive convergence properties under each model. Then, we take up personalized and query-focused summarization, where the sentence ranks additionally depend on user interests and queries, respectively. Finally, we present a Wikipedia-based multi-document summarization algorithm. An important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they enable real-time incremental summarization – users can first view an initial summary, and then request additional content if interested. We evaluate the performance of our proposed summarizer using the ROUGE metric, and the results show that leveraging Wikipedia can significantly improve summary quality. We also present results from a user study, which suggests that using incremental summarization can help in better understanding news articles.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Text summarization has seen renewed interest recently. The reason for this is twofold: first, summarization can help cope with the information overload, and second, small form-factor devices are becoming increasingly popular. Internet access on the move often happens in an attention-deficit situation where the user is capable of assimilating lesser content. Hence, it becomes important to present only the most relevant information. For example, while reading a news article, the user might first want to look at a short summary (about 50–100 words), and then request the full article if interested.


                     Radev, Hovy, and McKeown (2002) define a document summary as “a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually significantly less than that”. In other words, a good summary: (1) is short and (2) preserves important information. There is a rich history of literature, dating back to the 1950s, that aims to achieve these two objectives. While the earliest efforts were restricted to simple position and word-frequency methods (perhaps due to the limited computation available at the time), more recent work has leveraged learning and graph-based algorithms for generating better summaries. This paper aims to study a further possibility: utilizing a human-generated knowledge base, like Wikipedia, in conjunction with graph-based summarization.

Wikipedia is perhaps the best example of collaborative knowledge creation and sharing, whereby the entire information is readily available to anyone–anywhere–anytime. The fact that it contains topics and entities of interest to humans makes it especially useful for summarization tasks. Moreover, Wikipedia is constantly updated, and provides the topic quality required for generating good summaries. Thus, Wikipdia can serve as the basis for understanding salient concepts from the input text, which can then be used to extract summary sentences.

The main contributions of this work are: (1) We cast the Wikipedia-based summarization problem into a general sentence–concept bipartite framework, and propose an iterative ranking algorithm for selecting summary sentences. (2) We provide precise mathematical definitions and analysis of the iterative ranking algorithm, and derive several convergence results. (3) We study generalizations of the basic bipartite setup, including directed/weighted edges, personalization and query focusing of summaries, and extensions to multi-document summarization. Furthermore, our algorithms provide incremental summarization in real-time, so that users can first view an initial summary, and if interested, can then request additional content. We also provide novel connections of our proposed algorithms with latent topic models and other known optimization problems.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first review related summarization literature in Section 2, and state our research objective in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, we present the Wikipedia-based single document summarizer which is based on a novel iterative sentence–concept ranking. We provide precise mathematical definitions and convergence analysis under different scenarios, starting with undirected binary sentence–concept mappings in Section 4.2, followed by a generalization to weighted and directed mappings in Section 4.4, and then personalized and query-focused summarization in Section 4.5. Next, the Wikipedia-based multi-document summarizer is presented in Section 5. Experiments and performance evaluation are presented in Section 6, and the paper is concluded in Section 7.

@&#RELATED WORK@&#

A few recent efforts have leveraged Wikipedia for summarization tasks.
                        2
                        There is a long history of summarization literature, and the aim of this discussion is not to provide an exhaustive survey. We only seek to highlight the key ideas that help motivate our present work. The interested reader is referred to Das and Martins (2007) and Mani and Maybury (1999) for literature surveys.
                     
                     
                        2
                      This includes our early work Ramanathan, Sankarasubramaniam, Mathur, and Gupta (2009), where summary sentences are selected based on Wikipedia concept frequency thresholds; the work of Ye, Chua, and Lu (2009) on summarizing definitions from Wikipedia pages; Wikipedia-based feature selection approaches (Bawakid & Oussalah, 2010; Gong, Qu, & Tian, 2010); Wikipedia-based sentence similarity approaches Miao and Li (2010); and the recent work of (Pourvali & Abadeh, 2012a, 2012b) which leverage Wikipedia to form multiple independent graphs, and then use graph importance and lexical cohesion features for summarization. However, one shortcoming of the above approaches is that they do not leverage graph-based ranking algorithms, which can capture the inter-sentence dependence and also utilize the entire graph structure for ranking sentences.

On the other hand, there exist several graph-based ranking algorithms that have independently been proposed for summarization tasks. Prominent among these are LexRank proposed by Erkan and Radev (2004), the iSpreadRank of Yeh, Ke, and Yang (2008), and the work of (Mihalcea et al., 2004; Mihalcea & Tarau, 2005). A particularly interesting approach is that of (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2005), who seek to rank sentences using well-known algorithms like HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) or PageRank Brin and Page (1998). Their evaluations show that graph-based methods can outperform baseline summarizers, and are in fact, competitive with the best supervised summarization algorithms. However, the document graph in their case is formed by connecting sentences based on word overlap, and they do not leverage knowledge bases like Wikipedia.

Thus, we see that there are two parallel lines of work: one that leverages Wikipedia, but does not utilize graph-based ranking algorithms; and the other that uses graph-based ranking algorithms, but without leveraging a knowledge base like Wikipedia. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by considering graph-based summarization in conjunction with Wikipedia. Moreover, our proposed ranking algorithms run directly on a bipartite graph, which is a departure from prior work which typically use a document graph. We also present several novel convergence results, and evaluations from experiments and user studies.

Our aim in this work is to consider graph-based summarization in conjunction with Wikipedia. The specific research objectives are fourfold: (1) to present a unified sentence–concept bipartite framework for Wikipedia-based summarization, and propose a novel iterative ranking algorithm for summarization within this framework; (2) to provide mathematical formulation and analysis of the iterative ranking algorithm, and derive convergence properties; (3) to generalize the above framework and analysis to include directed/weighted edges, personalization and query-focusing of summaries, and multi-document summarization; and (4) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, experimentally using the ROUGE metric, and also directly by involving the user.

This paper also introduces the incremental summarization property (see Definitions 1 and 2 in Section 4), which is key to providing additional summary content in real-time. Results from our user study (see Section 6.4) suggest that this feature can help in better understanding news articles more than 
                        
                           70
                           %
                        
                      of the time. We also present experimental evaluations in Section 6, using the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, precision and recall metrics, which show that leveraging Wikipedia can significantly improve summary quality.

Let us now start with Wikipedia-based single document summarization.

The input here is typically a news article, book chapter, report, or any single piece of text, hereafter referred to as the input document D. The upshot of our approach is to first construct a bipartite sentence–concept graph, where the concepts represent Wikipedia article titles that are closest to the input sentences, and then rank the sentences for potential inclusion into a summary. We start by describing how to construct the bipartite sentence–concept graph in Section 4.1. Then, in Section 4.2, we describe the iterative ranking algorithm, and derive several convergence results. Thereafter, in Section 4.3, we discuss how to extract the summary sentences. Finally, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 provide details on the generalizations of the basic bipartite model: how to incorporate directed/weighted edges, and personalization and query-focusing of summaries.

Given an input document D, the sentences are first parsed and mapped to Wikipedia concepts (see for e.g. (Gabrilovich et al., 2006)). For this purpose, the entire Wikipedia corpus is indexed using the Lucene engine.
                           3
                           
                              http://lucene.apache.org.
                        
                        
                           3
                         The sentences (after stop-word removal and stemming) from D are then input as a query, and Wikipedia article titles are extracted from the results to the query (“hits” in Lucene terminology). These hits are precisely what are referred to as Wikipedia concepts.

This process is illustrated in Fig. 1
                         for an example sentence “Sony to slash PlayStation3 price”. The top five Wikipedia concepts returned
                           4
                           In this example, the entire sentence is input as a query to the Wikipedia index. Alternatively, one could query using only the noun phrases or named entities – for e.g. “Sony”, “PlayStation 3”, and “price” in the above example.
                        
                        
                           4
                         are: PlayStation Network, Platform, PlayStation 2, Ducks demo, and PlayStation 3. It is worth noting that the concept Platform is rather generic, even though it has been returned as a top “hit” to the query. In Section 4.2, we will discuss the effect of such generic concepts, which in turn helps motivate our iterative sentence ranking algorithm.

Thus, using the procedure described above, we can obtain a sentence–concept mapping of D, i.e., we can map every sentence in D to their corresponding Wiki concepts. For a typical document (e.g. a news article or book chapter), we would expect to see some overlap of Wiki concepts across sentences, and this is indeed the case. It is thus useful to visualize the sentence–concept mapping as a bipartite graph, with one set of nodes representing the document sentences and the other set of nodes representing the Wiki concepts. An edge between a sentence node and a concept node indicates a mapping between the corresponding document sentence and Wiki concept, while the absence of an edge indicates that there is no mapping. Fig. 2
                         illustrates this for an example document of 3 sentences and 5 concepts. It is worth noting that concepts 2, 3 and 4 in this example map to multiple sentences.

The bipartite graph captures the relationship between sentences through the concept nodes. The question now is how to leverage this relationship in order to identify summary sentences. Before discussing our proposed method, let us first take a look at two natural approaches for this purpose, and see why they are not directly applicable here.

First, let us consider a “coverage” objective as in Filatova et al. (2004) and Takamura et al. (2009), where the aim is to select sentences that best cover a set of conceptual units. The authors of Filatova et al. (2004) provide several definitions of conceptual units in terms of the lexical or syntactic features extracted from the input text. However, the Wikipedia concept space considered in this paper is fundamentally different. It represents the topics and entities drawn from a human-generated knowledge base, and serves as a basis for understanding the input document. Thus, seeking to cover the entire basis may not yield a good summary. For example, we have found that news articles typically map to a large number of low-frequency concepts (concepts with node degrees 1 or 2 in the bipartite graph), and attempting to cover all of them would detract from the main story. Moreover, “coverage” objectives tend to treat high and low frequency concepts equally, which in turn affects the uniqueness of the summary.

Perhaps a more intuitive approach would be to select sentences that map to the most “important” concepts. However, it is not clear what this notion of “importance” means for Wiki concepts. One heuristic is to simply rank the concepts in decreasing order of their node degrees, i.e., their frequency of occurrence. In Fig. 2, for example, this would mean that Wiki concept 2 is ranked highest, followed by concepts 3 and 4. The heuristic then selects sentences mapping to the highest ranked concepts as the summary. We have found that this simple approach gives reasonable summaries (cf. our earlier work Ramanathan et al. (2009)).

However, it also has some serious limitations. Even after ranking the concepts according to their frequencies of occurrence, the problem of distinguishing between summary and non-summary sentences often persists. This is due to the fact that high-frequency concepts, by definition, map to several input sentences. To make this clear, let us go back to the example of Fig. 2, where all the three input sentences map to Wiki concept 2. Thus, we are still unable to select the summary sentences here. In practice, such an impasse occurs frequently with generic concepts like “Science”, “Culture”, and “Platform”. The heuristic used in Ramanathan et al. (2009) to break the ties was to select sentences in their order of appearance, but clearly, this is not a robust solution. For instance, simply permuting the sentence order in the original text (without altering their content) would then drastically alter the summary.

Thus, there is a need to rank the sentences themselves, rather than just rank the Wikipedia concepts. We now describe one such ranking algorithm and study its properties. Specifically, we will see that the proposed ranking allows incremental summary generation.

Before proceeding further, let us introduce some notations and definitions. For ease of understanding, we use the example of Fig. 2 to relate to the notations. It must be remembered, however, that this example has been chosen only for illustration purposes, and is not intended to resemble sentence–concept mappings that are encountered in practice.

In other words, the incremental summarization property requires that longer summaries must be generated in real-time by simply adding sentences to shorter summaries. This requirement is necessary in our applications, where a short summary of a news article is first shown to the user, and after reading this summary, the user then decides whether to ask for additional content or not. In fact, the user can request for larger summaries in increments, all the way up to the entire article. More details on our experimental setup are provided in Section 6.4, along with results from a user study.

To support such repeated increments, it is critical to maintain the continuity of information sent to the user. For example, consider that the user first sees a 5-sentence summary, and then requests it to be increased to 7 sentences. Our solution ensures (by virtue of the incremental summarization property) that the existing 5 summary sentences remain unchanged, and only 2 new sentences are additionally shown. This allows the user to instantly recognize the additional information, thereby enabling successive increments until he/she is satisfied. On the other hand, recomputing a 7-sentence summary (without the incremental summarization property) could disrupt the information flow by presenting an entirely different set of sentences.

The above considerations prompt us to take an approach where sentence ranking is done only once, and summaries of any desired length are then generated using the sentence ranks. In the remainder of this section, we describe one such ranking algorithm

                           We do not endeavor here to study all possible approaches that leverage the sentence–concept mapping and satisfy the incremental summarization property. Such a study needs to be conducted within an axiomatic framework, and is beyond the scope of this paper.

However, there is no apriori notion of “importance” among the Wiki concepts

                         are not necessarily the most important, since they cannot distinguish between summary and non-summary sentences. Moreover, any global notion of importance derived from the Wikipedia graph is also not applicable here, since the summary depends only on the concepts

                         for the given document D. Thus, it appears that the importance of Wiki concepts is tied to the importance of the sentences themselves: one determines the other in a mutually reinforcing manner.

We thus proceed to rank sentences using iterative updates on G. Let us associate a score

                                 We have intentionally used G to denote both the bipartite graph and the biadjacency matrix corresponding to the sentence–concept mapping. These are two different visualizations of the same mapping, and are hence used interchangeably.

                              Theorem 1 implies that the steady-state sentence score vector can be computed using any standard eigenvector algorithm. However, running the score updates for a fixed number (K) of iterations is computationally more efficient. Also, it serves to illustrate the sentence–concept coupling through the mutual reinforcements.

Sentence Ranker 1, in conjunction with the above convergence property, is reminiscent of the HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) algorithm for ranking search results. However, it is worth noting that our setup comes from an undirected bipartite sentence–concept graph, as opposed to the directed link graph used in HITS. Moreover, we neither seek nor find “hubs” and “authorities” as defined in HITS; and we provide several new results and generalizations (including Sections 4.4 and 4.5, Proposition 3 below, and Appendix B) that have significance for Wikipedia-based summarization.

The following result provides an intuitive connection between the iterative sentence–concept updates (4) and a known optimization problem. The proof is again deferred to Appendix A.

                        Proposition 3 can be seen as an interpretation of Sentence Ranker 1. It points out that the sentence scores converge to the solution of an optimization problem. Essentially, the sentence–concept mutual reinforcement (4) finds sentence scores that maximize the square-sum of concept scores.

Finally, we make an interesting connection between Sentence Ranker 1 and a generative latent topic model. We show that under a bag-of-words assumption, the generative weights assigned to concepts follows the same relative ordering as the dominant eigenvector of

                           This can be achieved in practice by running Sentence Ranker 1 offline, once for each input document or news article of interest. It is worth noting that the bipartite sentence–concept model admits a natural parallelization.

Thus, longer summaries can be generated incrementally by simply adding sentences to shorter summaries. However, in some cases, it is desirable to specify the summary-size in words instead of sentences: for example, default summaries are usually set to 50 or 100 words.

                        This is equivalent to the 0–1 Knapsack problem 
                        Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (2009), which can be solved exactly using dynamic programming. However, the resulting solution does not satisfy the word-incremental summarization property. Hence, we take recourse to the following greedy approximation

                           It is well-known that the greedy algorithm proposed here does not provide any performance guarantees for the 0–1 Knapsack problem. However, it works well in practice since the variation in

                        ; and that the incremental indices are computable in real time under the assumption that the per-word rank ordering is precomputed. Thus, word-incremental summaries can now be generated in real time by simply selecting the next few sentences (from the per-word rank ordering) satisfying the length constraint.

Thus far, we have assumed that the sentence–concept mappings are binary, i.e.,

                        . This simple case serves to set up and analyze Sentence Ranker 1, but has some shortcomings. For example, it does not capture the relevance of a Wikipedia concept for a given sentence, and hence cannot distinguish between a generic introductory sentence, and one that provides specific information. For e.g., a sentence that simply mentions the word “planet”, and another sentence that actually talks about news of a planet discovery, are both mapped to the same Wiki concept “planet”. In such cases, it is important to distinguish the strength of Wiki concept mappings using real-valued

The question now is how to derive the mappings 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    z
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              ∣
                              
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        . A popular solution in literature is to use generative models. For instance, El-Arini, Veda, Shahaf, and Guestrin (2009) face a similar problem while assessing feature significance of a blog post, and the authors propose to use an LDA model learned on the noun phrases and named entities extracted from a blog corpus. However, the Wikipedia concept space 
                           
                              Z
                           
                         in our case is actually explicit, and not latent. Thus, we can derive the conditional probabilities using the same method of Section 4.1, by measuring the strength of each “hit”. Here, we assume that the Wikipedia articles are stable, and that their length is representative of an adequate description of the topic. Thus, we do not normalize the hit score by the length of the Wikipedia article. When querying is done using the entire sentence, the returned Lucene weights can directly act as estimates for 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    z
                                 
                                 
                                    j
                                 
                              
                              ∣
                              
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                        . However, if the extracted noun phrases or named entities are used for querying, then the returned Lucene weights must be appropriately combined. Our implementation takes the former approach, but either way, the entries 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    g
                                 
                                 
                                    ij
                                 
                              
                           
                         can now be set to the estimated 
                           
                              P
                              (

                                    j

                                    i

With this approach, the sentence–concept mappings are no longer undirected. The probabilities

                              , respectively. They could instead simply represent non-negative scores for the sentence-to-concept and concept-to-sentence mappings. The only requirement is that 
                                 
                                    A
                                    =

                                          T
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               be symmetric. In particular, it is not required here that

                               be symmetric.

Finally, we consider the case when 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                              )
                           
                         could also be biased. This is relevant in news summarization, for example, where the first few sentences typically lead with the headlines and the main story. In such cases, the 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              
                                 
                                    s

                              )
                           
                         values may be biased according to the position of sentence 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 
                                    i
                                 
                              
                           
                        . The iterative updates evolve as before in (6), but the matrix 
                           
                              A
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    HG
                                 
                                 
                                    T
                                 
                              
                           
                         is no longer symmetric, and Theorem 4 does not hold. However, since A is non-negative, the sentence scores can be shown to still converge under a minor restriction. We require the following definition in order to proceed:

We now state the following results without proof. The proofs rely on Perron–Frobenius Theory, and the interested reader is referred to Seneta (1981) for the details.

The principal eigenvector of a primitive matrix A is referred to as its Perron–Frobenius (PF) eigenvector. The following result provides a connection between the steady-state sentence score vector and the optimal point of a certain max–min optimization, through the PF eigenvector. Essentially, if A is primitive, then sentence scores from (5) converge in the direction maximizing the minimum growth factor over components.

                         is symmetric and positive, further analysis is possible. However, that goes beyond our present scope, and we close by saying that Sentence Ranker 1 yields steady-state sentence scores for practically all sentence–concept mappings.

In our analysis thus far, we assumed that the sole input to the summarizer is a document or text content. However, one might want to provide additional inputs to bias the summary in certain ways: for e.g., to personalize the summary, or to present it in response to queries. In each case, there is an explicit notion of concept importance obtained through the user interests or queries, respectively. This is in contrast with our earlier setup, where concept importance was implicit and tied to the summarization itself.

                        th query. In the rest of this section, we only study the personalization aspect. Query-focused summaries can be derived along similar lines.

To fix ideas, let us consider the simplest case when 
                           
                              Π
                              =
                              Z
                           
                        , i.e., the set of user interests is specified on the Wiki concept space 
                           
                              Z
                           
                        . This is hardly ever the case in practice, but serves to illustrate the approach. As before, we will require the summarizer to satisfy the incremental summarization property (Definition 1 at the sentence-level and Definition 2 at the word-level). We thus seek to rank the sentences once, and then extract summaries of any desired length. The difference in this case, however, is that the concept distribution is already specified through 
                           
                              w
                           
                        . This means that the vector 
                           
                              x
                           
                         of sentence scores is simply the solution to a system of linear equations

                        , and the personalized d-sentence or d-word summary can be formed as described in Section 4.3.

We now turn to multi-document summarization, where the input is typically a cluster of related documents, for e.g. news articles pertaining a single story, or the top hits from a search result. In such cases, the inputs can have similar or even identical sentences, and summarization involves not only ranking sentences but also filtering out redundancy. Clearly, Sentence Ranker 1 cannot be used in its present form, since it would rank similar sentences close to each other. This can be problematic while selecting the summary sentences. For instance, while summarizing news articles pertaining to a single tory, the highest-ranked sentences could come from different news portals, and hence could be very similar, but they would all be selected in any d-sentence summary, 
                        
                           d
                           ⩾
                           3
                        
                     . Thus, we now proceed to formulate the multi-document summarization problem, and propose a revised sentence ranker that addresses this issue.

                                 u

                      must not have significant overlap. Also, the incremental summarization property is required as before (see Definition 1).

Before describing our approach, let us briefly review some of the existing multi-document summarization methods. Perhaps the most natural approach would be to cluster the sentences in 
                        
                           S
                        
                     , and then select one representative sentence from each cluster. This is broadly the method followed in McKeown, Klavans, Hatzivassiloglou, Barzilay, and Eskin (1999) and Radev et al. (2002). Radev, Jing, Stys’, and Tam (2004) Another popular approach is graph-based, where the sentences form the vertices of a graph, and edge weights indicate pairwise sentence similarity. Summary sentences are then selected based on suitable objective functions (Erkan & Radev, 2004; Mihalcea et al., 2004; Lin, Bilmes, & Xie, 2009; Lin et al., 2010). In some cases, the objective functions turn out to be submodular, for e.g. in Lin et al. (2009, 2010), whereupon standard approximations (Khuller, Mossb, & Naor, 1999; Krause et al., 2005) with known guarantees can be applied. In other cases, more complex algorithms have been proposed, for e.g. in McDonald (2007), where summary extraction is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). There are also many other approaches which we are unable to elaborate here, and we refer the interested reader to Das and Martins (2007) for a detailed survey.

While the above methods are effective in their own right, they operate in a setup quite different from ours. None of them incorporate Wikipedia concept mappings as considered in this paper. Moreover, we have imposed the incremental summarization requirement, in light of which we do not formulate summarization as an optimal subset selection problem. Furthermore, for reasons mentioned earlier (see Section 4.2), the notion of sentence importance in our case is coupled to concept importance, thus resulting in a mutual reinforcement quite different from the above-mentioned approaches.

With this in mind, we take the following two-step approach
                        11
                        Our present scope does not permit a full axiomatic study of multi-document summarizers that leverage sentence–concept mappings and satisfy the incremental summarization property. Here, we only propose one algorithm that performs well in practice.
                     
                     
                        11
                      towards multi-document summarization: first, determine the steady-state sentence and concept scores using iterative updates similar to (5); next, derive sentence ranks based on a diversification objective. The latter step leverages the sentence and concept scores computed in the first step.

For the first step, the sentence–concept mapping and forward/backward matrices can be derived as in Section 4, but with the multiset 
                        
                           S

                      denote the steady-state sentence and concept scores, respectively, at the end of iteration K. In the second step, we seek to rank the sentences based on their individual scores

                     , and also their pairwise similarity with other sentences. An analogous problem in literature is that of diversifying search results (see for e.g. (Agrawal, Gollapudi, Halverson, & Ieong, 2009; Clarke et al., 2008; Zhai, Cohen, & Lafferty, 2003; Skoutas, Minack, & Nejdl, 2010)). We follow a similar greedy ranking approach, though our objective function is specific to summarization. We thus have the Sentence Ranker 2 as follows:

                      is any subset of the sentence indices. Thus, the cost associated with a subset of sentences is a (weighted) difference between the total score of sentences in that subset, and their total pairwise redundancy. The negative sign in (11) has the effect of penalizing redundancy, i.e., it favors selection of dissimilar sentences. Taken in conjunction with (10), this means that concept overlaps across sentences are penalized in proportion to their concept scores.

Thus, the sentences in multiset 
                        
                           S
                        
                      can be rank-ordered using Sentence Ranker 2. Any d-sentence summary can then be formed by selecting the d leading sentences. On the other hand, to form a d-word summary, we require the per-word rank ordering. This can be obtained by slightly modifying steps 7 and 9 of Sentence Ranker 2 as follows:

                     with the rest of the steps remaining unchanged. The d-word summary is then formed as described in Section 4.3. It is worth noting here that the incremental summarization property – Definition 1 at the sentence level, and Definition 2 at the word level – is satisfied by the proposed multi-document summarizer.

Summary coherence can be further imposed, if desired, by following time order and text order (sentences from oldest documents appear first) on the selected sentences. One such method is proposed by Barzilay, Elhadad, and McKeown (2001), where a combination of chronological and coherence constraints is used to order sentences.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

In this section, we present experimental results for evaluating the performance of our Wikipedia-based summarizer. We also report the learnings from a user study conducted to assess the impact of incremental summarization. The upshot of our results is that leveraging Wikipedia can significantly improve summary quality. The Wikipedia-based summarizer not only improves upon baseline ROUGE scores, but also comes close to the optimum performance for news articles. Moreover, the use of incremental summarization can help in better understanding news articles.

Let us start with some details on the data set and metrics used in our evaluations.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has organized a yearly series of conferences called the Document Understanding Conference
                           12
                           Replaced by TAC (Text Analysis Conference) from 2008 onwards.
                        
                        
                           12
                         (DUC) since 2001 DUC series. We use the DUC 2002 data, which consists of 567 English news articles DUC (2002). Single-document summarization was the first out of three tasks in DUC 2002, with the aim of automatically generating summaries of length 100 words or less. As a preprocessing step, stop-word removal and stemming was performed on each of the documents in the data set.

Since 2002, the single document summarization task has been dropped by DUC. However, the 2002 data set is available, and has been used frequently for evaluating new summarization algorithms. Another reason for our choice of this data set is that it is focused on news articles, which is our primary use case involving incremental summarization.

We compute recall scores for 100-word summaries using the ROUGE metric Lin et al. (2003), which has been adopted by DUC for automatic summary evaluation. ROUGE relies on counting the number of overlapping word sequences between the candidate and reference summaries, and has been found to agree surprisingly well with human judgment Lin (2004). More precisely, ROUGE-N is an N-gram recall measure computed between a candidate summary and a set of one or more reference summaries as follows:

                        where Countmatch(.) represents the maximum number of N-grams co-occurring in a candidate summary and the set of reference summaries, and Count (.) represents the number of N-grams in the set of reference summaries.

In our experiments, we first used the ROUGE toolkit ROUGE to compute the ROUGE-1 (unigram) and ROUGE-2 (bigram) scores, which have been found to agree most with human evaluation Lin et al. (2003). For this purpose, we first obtained the 100-word summaries of each of the 567 news articles using our Wikipedia-based single document summarizer. For comparison, we then computed the 100-word summaries using the following three techniques:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 Leading sentences: first few sentences are chosen the summary.


                                 Random sentences: summary sentences are chosen uniformly at random.


                                 Best sentences: summary sentences chosen manually to best match the reference summaries.

The first two are intended to serve as baselines, while the third provides a ceiling on the performance of any extractive summarization algorithm.

For computing the ROUGE scores, the reference summaries for each article were directly obtained from the DUC 2002 data set. In order to ensure a fair comparison, we further used the “-l 100” option in ROUGE to truncate longer summaries.

Next, in our second set of experiments, we computed the precision, recall and F-measure for summarizers that showed similar ROUGE-1 performance. These metrics, along with the corresponding ROUGE-2 scores, helped in differentiating the summarizers. We now present the detailed results.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#


                        Table 1
                         shows the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores of our Wikipedia-based single document summarizer along with Leading sentences, Random sentences, Best sentences, and the five top-performing summarizers from DUC 2002 (Wan, Yang, & Xiao, 2006) – these systems are: System 28 (Schlesinger et al., 2002), System 21 (van Halteren, 2002), System 31 (Brunn, Chali, & Dufour, 2002), System 29 (Angheluta, De Busser, & Moens (2002)), and System 27 (Hirao, Sasaki, Isozaki, & Maeda, 2002). For further comparison, we also evaluated the ROUGE scores using the built-in AutoSummarize feature in MS Word.

As expected, we find that Best sentences shows the highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores of 
                           
                              0.51
                           
                         and 
                           
                              0.29
                           
                        , respectively. The summaries here were extracted manually, with the aim of matching the reference summaries as much as possible. Thus, the ROUGE scores of Best sentences serve as an upper bound on the performance of any extractive summarizer for the DUC 2002 data set. It is interesting to note that the top-performing DUC 2002 summarizer comes within 
                           
                              0.03
                           
                         of this upper bound for ROUGE-1. However, the difference in ROUGE-2 scores is greater.

At the other end, Random sentences shows the poorest ROUGE scores of 
                           
                              0.41
                           
                         and 
                           
                              0.15
                           
                        . Leading sentences shows surprisingly high scores at first sight. In fact, the ROUGE-1 score is only 
                           
                              12
                              %
                           
                         short of the Best sentences upper bound, and the ROUGE-2 score is as high as 
                           
                              75
                              %
                           
                         of the upper bound. This suggests that simply selecting the first few sentences is a reasonable summarization strategy for news articles. Indeed, this is not surprising, given that most news articles lead with a gist of the story. Another reason could be that the evaluation is done against human-generated summaries, which naturally favors the leading lines in a news article.

In general, however, Leading sentences is far from optimal. A simple example would be to randomly reorder the sentences in the input document, while leaving their content unchanged. In such a case, Leading sentences would yield very different summaries depending on the reordering, and the ROUGE performance would approach that of Random sentences. A similar drawback affects the Concept-frequency based summarizer proposed in Ramanathan et al. (2009), which also leverages Wikipedia (see Section 4.2 for a quick overview), but relies on sentence ordering while extracting the summary. Despite high ROUGE scores of 
                           
                              0.47
                           
                         and 
                           
                              0.23
                           
                         on the DUC 2002 data set, it is not robust to sentence reordering. This drawback is overcome in the proposed Wikipedia-based summarizer by ranking the sentences and concepts simultaneously, and using the sentence ranks to extract the summary.

Overall, we find that the Wikipedia-based summarizer performs competitively against the top systems from DUC 2002. In particular, it shows the highest ROUGE-2 score, and also significantly improves over the baseline techniques (Random sentences and Leading sentences).

Finally, it is interesting to note that the Wikipedia-based summarizer and the MS Word summarizer both show a ROUGE-1 score of 
                           
                              0.46
                           
                        . This prompted us to conduct a further evaluation using the precision and recall metrics. For this purpose, we use Best sentences as the benchmark, and compute the precision, recall and F-measure of a candidate summary as follows:
                           
                              (14)

The results of our evaluation are shown in Table 2
                         for three candidate summarizers: Leading sentences, Wikipedia-based summarizer, and MS Word summarizer. These three candidates were chosen due to their near identical ROUGE-1 scores of 
                           
                              0.45
                              ,
                              
                              0.46
                           
                         and 
                           
                              0.46
                           
                        , respectively. Although the ROUGE-1 scores are very close, the summarizers can be distinguished based on the precision, recall, and F-measure. It is seen that the Wikipedia-based summarizer has the highest precision, recall and F-measure, while the MS Word summarizer performs the poorest. A similar behavior is seen in the corresponding ROUGE-2 scores.

To further confirm the above findings, we decided to manually assess the summary quality between the Wikipedia-based summarizer and the MS Word summarizer. We found several cases where the summaries were quite different, even though the ROUGE-1 scores are identical. As an example, we give below the summary of a news article on exoplanet discovery New Planet, first using the MS Word summarizer, and then using the Wikipedia-based summarizer. The sentences from the Wikipedia-based summarizer that are not picked up by the MS Word summarizer are shown in bold.

                        Red dwarfs are low-energy, tiny stars that give off dim red light and last longer than stars like our sun. Until a few years ago, astronomers did not consider these stars as possible hosts of planets that might sustain life. The discovery of the new planet, named 581 c, is sure to fuel studies of planets circling similar dim stars. About 80% of the stars near Earth are red dwarfs. The new planet is about five times heavier than Earth. If rocky like Earth, which is what the prevailing theory proposes, it has a diameter about 1 1/2 times bigger than our planet. If it is too thick, the planet’s surface temperature could be too hot. The new planet seems just right. It does not mean there is life, but it means it is an Earth-like planet in terms of potential habitability. The new planet is probably full of liquid water, hypothesizes Stephane Udry, the lead author.
                     


                        Wikipedia-based summarizer:
                     


                        
                           For the first time astronomers have discovered a planet outside our solar system that is potentially habitable, with Earth-like temperatures, a find researchers described Tuesday as a big step in the search for life in the universe. The planet is just the right size, might have water in liquid form, and in galactic terms is relatively nearby at 120
                        
                        
                        
                           trillion miles away. And it is worth noting that scientists’ requirements for habitability count Mars in that category: a size similar to Earth’s with temperatures that would permit liquid water. Until a few years ago, astronomers did not consider these stars as possible hosts of planets that might sustain life. It does not mean there is life, but it means it is an Earth-like planet in terms of potential habitability.Because of its temperature and relative proximity, this planet will most probably be a very important target of the future space missions dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life.
                        
                     

The difference in the above summaries is obvious, though the ROUGE-1 scores are identical, and in fact, only 
                           
                              10

                         below the upper bound of 
                           
                              0.51
                           
                        . This suggests that perhaps the ROUGE-1 score alone is not a sufficient indicator of summarizer performance.
                           13
                           Note that the total range of variation of the average ROUGE-1 scores shown in Table 1 is only 
                                 
                                    0.10
                                 
                              . This is one reason why we have chosen to represent the ROUGE-1 scores only to a two decimal precision.
                        
                        
                           13
                         It is more appropriate to view the ROUGE-1 metric in conjunction with other metrics listed in Table 2 like precision, recall and ROUGE-2.

The incremental summarization property (see Definition 1 in Section 4.2) requires that longer summaries are generated in real-time by adding sentences to shorter summaries. We have built an application for browsing news articles, where the user is first presented with a short summary, after reading which, he/she can then interactively seek the required level of detail. In our implementation, the user is allowed to increment or decrement the summary size using hand gestures, or simply move onto the next article. Thus, the user could go in a single step or multiple steps from the initial summary to the full article. As discussed in Section 4.2, the incremental summarization property helps maintain the continuity of information flow over successive increments/decrements.

With the aim of determining the usefulness of incremental summarization, we conducted a study within a group of 30 users. Our test set consisted of 20 longish news articles, each over 1000 words. For each article, we first presented a 50 word summary, and then handed control to the user. The user was then allowed to iteratively increment or decrement the summary size any number of times, and view the resulting summary. We then asked each user to read the full article, and answer the following four questions:
                           
                              1.
                              Would you rather use incremental summarization or view a single summary? (yes/no)

Was the response to the increment/decrement fast enough? (yes/no)

How many articles (out of 20) are better read with incremental summarization?

Rate the quality of the presented summaries on a scale of 1–10, with 1 being least satisfactory and 10 being most satisfactory.

Almost the entire user group answered questions 1 and 2 in the affirmative. In response to question 3, we found that about 
                           
                              70
                              %
                           
                         of the time, users felt that incremental summarization helped them better understand the news article. The average rating of summary quality was 7 out of 10.

We conclude this section by providing 100-word summaries for two news articles, along with the top concepts returned by our Wikipedia-based summarizer.

                                       In one of the most harrowing spacewalks in decades, an astronaut had to rush back into the International Space Station on Tuesday after a mysterious water leak inside his helmet robbed him of the ability to speak or hear and could have caused him to choke or even drown. His spacewalking partner, American Christopher Cassidy, had to help him inside after NASA quickly aborted the spacewalk. In a late afternoon news conference, NASA acknowledged the perilous situation that Parmitano had found himself in, and space station operations manager Kenneth Todd promised to turn over every rock to make sure it never happens again.

Gates has long been a proponent of using technology to solve the worlds problems, and of solutions like the online education services such as those offered by Salman Khan and the Khan Academy. Gates noted, however, that the problems facing impoverished nations throughout the globe often extend into several different areas; for example, the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa is 82, he said.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The advent of human-generated knowledge bases like Wikipedia can help us understand the salient topics in a given text document. This can, in turn, help us extract summary sentences which convey these salient topics. In this paper, we studied one such approach that leverages Wikipedia in conjunction with graph-based summarization. We first constructed a bipartite sentence–concept graph, and proposed an iterative ranking algorithm for selecting summary sentences. Convergence of the iterative updates was studied under various scenarios: starting with undirected sentence–concept edges, and then allowing weighted and directed edges. Then, we looked at personalization and query-focusing of summaries, where the sentence ranking was dependent on user interests and queries, respectively. Finally, we extended our Wikipedia-based summarization to include multiple correlated text inputs.

A unique feature of our work is the introduction of the incremental summarization property, whereby both our single document and multi-document summarizers can provide additional content in real-time. Thus, users can first view an initial summary, and if interested, can then request additional content. We provided formal definitions of sentence-level and word-level incremental summarization, and used them as guiding factors in the design of our summarization algorithms. Finally, during performance evaluations, we noted how summarizers with identical ROUGE-1 scores could output vastly different summaries, thus motivating the need for further research into automatic evaluation methods. Indeed, a few other metrics (for example, the one based on Jensen–Shannon divergence Lin, Cao, Gao, & Nie (2006)) have been proposed over the years, but they rely on extensive training and the availability of reference summaries. Thus, it is fair to say that automated summary evaluation presents an interesting avenue for further research.

On the theoretical side, it would be interesting to conduct an axiomatic study of summarization algorithms that can leverage the sentence–concept mapping and satisfy the incremental summarization property. This is a topic for future work, both for single and multi-document summarization.

Sentence Ranker 1 is based on mutual reinforcement of sentences and concepts through the iterative updates (4). In Appendix A, the vector of sentence and concept scores were shown to converge to the principal eigenvectors of

In what follows, we take a step towards answering this question, and show that under a bag-of-words model, the generative weights assigned to the concepts is in the same relative order as the dominant eigenvector of

                     While the iterative updates work on sentence–concept reinforcement, one can talk about another summarization approach where to each topic we assign the weights

                      (instead of the weights from the iterative ranking algorithm), and then maximize the cut norm of the resulting bipartite graph. The latter approach is actually similar to the iterative updates, in the sense that if to sentence s we assign weight

                      and pick the highest ranked sentences, we will in turn maximize the cut norm.

In what follows, we show that when we have sufficiently large number of sentences, with a high probability, the observed principal eigenvector of

                     . Thus, it does not matter if we are maximizing the cut norm or using the iterative updates: the summary generated will be the same with a high probability.

                        Remark
                        Suppose we assume the bag-of-words model, and each sentence is made up of b concepts where b is large. In that case, with probability nearing one, each sentence will contain all the concepts, and thus, they will be identical as far as the sentence–concept bipartite graph is concerned. Essentially, the sentences being i.i.d makes it hard to distinguish them. This is one of the weaknesses of the bag-of-words assumption.
