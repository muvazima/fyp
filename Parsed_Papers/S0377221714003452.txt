                  One important problem faced by the liner shipping industry is the fleet deployment problem. In this problem, the number and type of vessels to be assigned to the various shipping routes need to be determined, in such a way that profit is maximized, while at the same time ensuring that (most of the time) sufficient vessel capacity exists to meet shipping demand. Thus far, the standard assumption has been that complete probability distributions can be readily specified to model the uncertainty in shipping demand. In this paper, it is argued that such distributions are hard, if not impossible, to obtain in practice. To relax this oftentimes restrictive assumption, a new distribution-free optimization model is proposed that only requires the specification of the mean, standard deviation and an upper bound on the shipping demand. The proposed model possesses a number of attractive properties: (1) It can be seen as a generalization of an existing variation of the liner fleet deployment model. (2) It remains a mixed integer linear program and (3) The model has a very intuitive interpretation. A numerical case study is provided to illustrate the model.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The massive scale of global freight movement observed today would not have been possible without maritime transportation (Talley, 2009). Indeed, estimates of the tonnage transported in world trade by sea are as high as 90% (Rodrigue, Comtois, & Slack, 2009). One important sector within the shipping industry is liner shipping. A liner shipping company transports cargo, following a published sailing schedule on the routes it serves (Bell, Liu, Rioult, & Angeloudis, 2013; Plum, Pisinger, Salazar-González, & Sigurd, 2014). Competition among ocean carriers is known to be especially fierce in liner shipping (Talley, 2012).

Liner companies face various routing and scheduling problems at the strategic, tactical, and operational planning levels (e.g. see Christiansen, Fagerholt, Nygreen, & Ronen, 2013; Kosmas & Vlachos, 2012; Meng, Wang, Andersson, & Thun, 2014; scheduling in liner shipping: overview, 2014; Mulder & Dekker, 2014; Pantuso, Fagerholt, & Hvattum, 2014; and the references therein). One critical decision at the tactical planning level is the fleet deployment problem in which the number and type of ships to be assigned to the various shipping routes need to be determined in order to maximize their profits, while at the same time ensuring that (most of the time) sufficient vessel capacity exists to meet shipping demand. This fleet deployment problem has been first addressed in the literature by Perakis and Jaramillo (1991) and Jaramillo and Perakis (1991) who formulated (integer) linear programming models to solve this planning problem. In these early and subsequent studies (such as Gelareh & Meng, 2010; Liu, Ye, & Yuan, 2011), shipping demand has been assumed to be known with complete certainty. Only until recently has this assumption been relaxed, and has shipping demand been more realistically modeled as random variables (e.g. see Meng & Wang, 2010; Meng, Wang, & Wang, 2012; Wang, Meng, Wang, & Tan, 2013). It is interesting to note that other researchers, assuming deterministic demand, have embedded the fleet deployment problem within the liner shipping network design problem (e.g. see Brouer, Alvarez, Plum, Pisinger, & Sigurd, 2014 and Plum, Pisinger, & Sigurd, 2013).

In this paper, we further advance the stochastic modeling of the liner ship fleet deployment problem introduced by Meng and co-workers by relaxing the currently standard assumption that probability distributions are readily available to characterize uncertain shipping demand (cf. Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 2002). Indeed, there might be a lack of historical data to estimate these distributions with confidence (especially when there is a new shipping route), or historical data might simply not be representative due to a changing economic outlook. In the proposed modeling approach, instead of having to specify complete probability distributions, a distribution-free approach is adopted in which the modeler only needs to specify the mean, standard deviation and an upper bound on the shipping demand. Clearly, these quantities form a strict subset (i.e. they are easier to specify) of what is needed in order to specify a complete probability distribution (cf. Meng & Wang, 2010; Meng et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). Another attractive feature of our approach is that the computational requirements remain unchanged compared to current state-of-the-art fleet deployment models that account for demand uncertainty through complete probability distributions. More specifically, as in currently available models, the proposed model is of the mixed integer linear programming class. Lastly, the proposed modeling approach has a very intuitive interpretation.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief review of a variation of a currently available stochastic demand fleet deployment model is presented, followed by the proposed distribution-free model. Fundamental properties of the model are analyzed and discussed. Section 3 provides a case study to illustrate the model. Finally, Section 4 summarizes and concludes the paper.

Before we introduce the proposed distribution-free model, let us first briefly review a recent variation of the liner fleet deployment problem that accounts for stochastic shipping demand, e.g. see Meng and Wang (2010) and Wang et al. (2013). To this end, let us first define some notation.

                     The objective function (1) denotes the goal to minimize the total cost (the sum of the operating cost and the cost of chartering ships, minus the revenue obtained by chartering ships out). Constraint (2) ensures that the total number of ships (of type k) deployed does not exceed what is available to the liner company, i.e. the sum of ships (of type k) it owns plus the number of ships (of type k) chartered from other ship owners. In constraint (3), a maximum is imposed on the number of ships that can be chartered from others, whereas constraint (4) is a conservation constraint that ensures that all ships that are not deployed are chartered out to maximize profit (cf. Meng et al., 2012). The maximum number of voyages (on route r) ships of type k can complete within the planning horizon of p days is given by the product of ukr

                     αr
                     , the deployed vessel capacity is sufficient to transport the uncertain shipping demand on all legs of route r. Finally, constraint (8) enforces non-negativity and integrality of the decision variables in the model. In fact, although Model (P1) differs from the two-stage stochastic programming model in Meng et al. (2012), using the same proof as in the aforementioned paper, it is easy to show that the integrality constraints on vk
                      and wk
                      can be relaxed.

                           The integrality constraints on vk and wk in Model (P1) can be relaxed without changing the optimal solution.
                        

As stated, until now, the liner fleet deployment problem has been solved with the assumption that probability distributions characterizing shipping demand are completely known (cf. constraint (7)). More specifically, prior studies typically define distributions for the shipping demand between origin–destination port pairs that, in turn, determine the distributions of

                      and Dr
                     . For example, Meng and Wang (2010) employ the normal distribution, whereas Wang et al. (2013) use the lognormal distribution. To support these assumptions, the authors argue that (log)normal distributions are typically used in inventory management. The key hypothesis in this paper is that in practice it is not always possible, or simply impossible, to specify such distributions with confidence (cf. Wang, Meng, & Bell, 2013). Next, we relax this potentially burdensome assumption and employ an intuitive, distribution-free approach in which one only needs to specify a subset (i.e. the mean, standard deviation and an upper bound on Dr
                     ) of the information currently required in state-of-the-art liner fleet deployment models.

In order to develop our model, let us assume that Dr

                      is a random variable to model deviations from the mean. In addition, it is assumed that there exists some positive real number br
                      such that Zr
                     
                     ⩽
                     br
                      with probability one (hence, Dr

A number of remarks are now in order. First, note that Proposition 1 states that if dr
                     ,
                     br
                      and Var[Zr
                     ] are known (we have used Var[X] to denote the variance of the random variable X), and if μr
                      is chosen according to (10), then one can guarantee a priori, i.e. before the solution of Model (P2), that any feasible solution (particularly, also the optimal solution), will yield a fleet deployment plan that can accommodate the shipping demand with a probability of at least 1−
                     αr
                     , for each route. To solve (10), one can, for example, embed a univariate optimization algorithm within a univariate root finding algorithm. Such algorithms are widely available. (In the case study in this paper, existing algorithms in MATLAB have been used for this purpose.) Second, instead of specifying the variance of the deviation from the mean (i.e. Var[Zr
                     ]), one can also directly specify the variance of the shipping demand Var[Dr
                     ], since 
                        
                           Var

                     . Third, to be mathematically rigorous, one needs to take the infimum rather than the minimum in (10) as λ must be strictly larger than zero. Fourth, it is interesting to note that Model (P2) remains a mixed integer linear program (cf. Model (P1)). In other words, by relaxing modeling assumptions, computational requirements have not been sacrificed.

                           , by the intermediate value theorem and the result in Proposition 2, it follows that f(μr

In this section, the proposed model (P2) is demonstrated using a case study based on the data provided in Meng et al. (2012) for an 8-route example for the OOCL shipping line. For ease of reference for the reader, these data have been repeated in Table 1
                     . Since the demand data were not reported by Meng et al., without loss of generality, the following demand values have been assumed in this case study: d
                     1
                     =130,000, d
                     2
                     =78,000, d
                     3
                     =78,000, d
                     4
                     =130,000, d
                     5
                     =143,000, d
                     6
                     =91,000, d
                     7
                     =156,000, d
                     8
                     =75,400. The planning horizon is 6months, and the service schedule is at least weekly.

To start with, model (P2) is solved with μr
                     
                     =0. The solution to this model can be interpreted as the fleet deployment problem when the liner company plans for the average demand. The optimal solution for this scenario is summarized in Table 2
                      under the column “Mean Demand Model”. For example, it can be seen that in this scenario, one would deploy 1 ship of type 1 on route 2, 3 ships of type 1 on route 3, 2 ships of type 1 on route 7 and 1 ship of type 1 on route 8 (and 0 ships of type 1 on all other routes). The ship of type 1 completes 8 voyages on route 2, and the 3 ships of type 1 deployed on route 3 together complete a total of 25 voyages, and so on. A total of 13 ships are chartered in this scenario: 5 ships of type 1, 5 ships of type 2, and 3 ships of type 3. No ships are chartered out. This solution was obtained using the OSICPLEX solver in GAMS.

In the next scenario, shipping demand uncertainty is introduced (henceforth referred to as the “low uncertainty” scenario). Assuming

                     , Eq. (10) was solved to obtain μr
                      for each route. The optimal solution of the resulting instance is shown in Table 2, under the column “Low Uncertainty Model”. It can be seen that the number of ships deployed has reduced from 40 to 39 when uncertainty is present, which might at first seem counter-intuitive given our interpretation of μr
                      as added demand. However, it is to be emphasized that the decisions that are of greater importance are the number and types of vessels deployed, and the number of voyages they complete. Indeed, the number of voyages has increased from 209 to 210 and, more importantly, these voyages are completed with larger ships. For instance, whereas in the mean value model 66 voyages were completed by ships of type 1 (that have the smallest capacity), only 54 voyages are completed with these smaller ships when uncertainty is present. On the other hand, the largest ships (type 5) are now scheduled to complete a total of 38 voyages, whereas in the mean value model these vessels only complete 34 voyages. As can be expected, the optimal cost has increased (by about $30million compared to that of the mean demand model), to protect against uncertainty.

Finally, the level of uncertainty is further increased (i.e.

                     ), resulting in the “high uncertainty” scenario. As can be seen from Table 2, the optimal cost has further increased, as did the number of voyages completed by the larger ships (types 4 and 5).

One planning problem encountered by the liner industry is the optimal deployment of their vessels, in order to maximize profits while at the same time satisfying customer demand. Whereas the pioneering work on this fleet deployment problem dates back to the early 1990s, only until recently have researchers started accounting for the high level of uncertainty that is prevalent in real-world shipping. Particularly, researchers have assumed that probability distributions can be constructed with confidence to model the uncertainty in shipping demand. In this paper, it has been argued that such distributions are hard, if not impossible, to obtain in practice. To relax this oftentimes restrictive assumption, a new distribution-free model has been proposed that only requires the specification of the mean, standard deviation and an upper bound on the shipping demand. The proposed model can be seen as a generalization of an existing variation of the liner fleet deployment model, remains a mixed integer linear program, and has an intuitive interpretation. Fundamental properties of the model were derived and analyzed.

The main focus in this paper was on advancing the realism of uncertainty modeling in the liner fleet deployment problem by relaxing the assumption of known probability distributions. Opportunities to improve other aspects of the model exist as well. Indeed, as noted by Meng et al. (2014), “…academic models cannot capture all of the operating features of liner shipping.” Particularly, one important future research direction for the liner fleet deployment problem is to account for the practicality that it might not be desirable to assign vessels with very different capacities to the same route, unless shipping demand varies significantly from week to week. Other realities that deserve attention include the possibility of transshipment and uncertain transit times (e.g. see Brouer, Dirksen, Pisinger, Plum, & Vaaben, 2013). Yet another avenue for further research is to further improve on the bound on Pr(Dr

                     ), together with an investigation of the tightness of the bound. Finally, in this paper, an existing commercial solver was employed to solve the resulting optimization model in the case study. In future work, we intend to develop tailored, exact solution algorithms to address large-scale instances of the problem, as well as to explore the use of meta-heuristic approaches (Szeto & Wu, 2011).
