                  We propose a set of atomic modeling operators for simplifying and refining cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions. Such operators either preserve the homology of the cell complex, or they modify it in a controlled way. We show that such operators form a minimally complete basis for updating cell complexes, and we compare them with various operators previously proposed in the literature. Based on the new operators, we define a hierarchical model for cell complexes, that we call a Hierarchical Cell Complex (HCC), and we discuss its properties. An HCC implicitly encodes a virtually continuous set of complexes obtained from the original complex through the application of our operators. Then, we describe the implementation of a version of the HCC based on the subset of the proposed modeling operators which preserve homology. We apply the homology-preserving HCC to enhance the efficiency in extracting homology generators at different resolutions. To this aim, we propose an algorithm which computes homology generators on the coarsest representation of the original complex, and uses the hierarchical model to propagate them to complexes at any intermediate resolution, and we prove its correctness. Finally, we present experimental results showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Cell complexes are used as a discretization and modeling tool in a wide range of application domains, such as solid modeling, computer graphics, computer aided design, finite element analysis, animation, scientific visualization, and geographic data processing. Cell complexes are used to discretize geometric shapes, such as static and dynamic 3D objects, or surfaces and hyper-surfaces describing the behavior of scalar or vector fields. A variety of topological operators have been designed for building and updating data structures representing two and three dimensional cell complexes, such as handle operators [1,2], Euler operators [3–10], or removal/insertion operators in nD [11–13]. Handle operators are based on the handlebody theory [14], stating that any n-manifold can be obtained from an n-ball by attaching handles to it. The main characteristic of Euler operators is that they maintain the Euler–Poincaré formula expressing a topological validity condition for a cell complex.

We describe here a set of modeling operators which form a minimally complete basis for simplifying and refining cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions in a topologically consistent manner. These operators have been originally proposed in [15]. We distinguish between operators that maintain homology of the complex, and operators that modify it in a controlled manner. Homology-preserving operators add (or remove) a pair of cells of consecutive dimension, but they do not change the Betti numbers of the complex. Homology-modifying operators add (or remove) an i-cell, and increase (or decrease) the ith Betti number. We compare our modeling operators with other operators on cell complexes proposed in the literature, and we show how these latter can be expressed in terms of the former.

Based on the proposed operators, we define a hierarchical model that we call a Hierarchical Cell Complex (HCC). An HCC is generated by applying our simplification operators, and it is defined based on their inverse refinement operators and on a dependency relation among these latter that guides the extraction of topologically correct complexes at uniform or variable resolutions. Unlike the pyramidal model defined on quasi-manifolds represented as 2-maps [16] and n-G-maps [17], an HCC can represent arbitrary cell complexes, is based on both homology-preserving and homology-modifying operators, and allows extracting a large number of complexes, also adaptive, according to any user-selected approximation criterion.

In our work, we have also defined and implemented a version of the HCC based only on homology-preserving operators [18]. Here, we investigate the use of this model for homology computation. We show that the HCC based on the homology-preserving operators enables us to obtain the homology (with coefficients in

                     ) of all the complexes encoded in the model by computing the homology of the complex at the coarsest resolution using standard techniques [19]. Moreover, we are able to construct homology generators of a complex at any intermediate resolution by computing generators on the coarsest complex and using the hierarchical model to propagate the computed generators to all the complexes at intermediate resolutions. Unlike approaches based on pyramids on n-maps and n-G-maps [12,20], the implementation of the HCC based on homology-preserving operators can be applied to general complexes, not only to quasi-manifolds and it supports the extraction of homology generators at variable resolutions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some background notions on cell complexes. In Section 3, we describe the new set of topological operators for simplifying and refining cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions. In Section 4, we show how various other update operators on cell complexes proposed in the literature, such as removal/insertion operators, Euler operators and handle operators, can be expressed in terms of our operators. In Section 5, we investigate the properties of an HCC, and we show how to extract from an HCC a large number of complexes at intermediate resolutions. In Section 6, we discuss how we retrieve homology and homology generators of complexes at intermediate resolutions, starting from the homology and the homology generators of the complex at the coarsest resolution. In Section 7, we present some experimental evaluation of the model. In Section 8, we draw some concluding remarks, and discuss possible research directions.

In this section, we present the operators on cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions that we have first introduced in [15]. We show here that these operators form a minimally complete basis for the set of all possible operators that modify cell complexes in a topologically consistent manner.

There have been many proposals in the literature for manipulating two- and three-dimensional cell complexes. We propose here a minimal set of Euler operators on cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions, which subsume, as we will show, all the other Euler operators proposed in the literature. These operators can be classified as:

We have proven, by using discrete Morse theory [22], that the homology-preserving operators do not change the Euler characteristic, or the Betti numbers of the cell complex with respect to any Abelian group. The proof is reported in Appendix A. There are two types of homology-preserving operators, each of which has two distinct instances.

The second instance of the removal operator may, but is not guaranteed to, preserve the topological characteristics of the complex (it may produce cells that are not topological cells, or it may disconnect the complex). Thus, it cannot be classified either as a homology-preserving, or as a homology-modifying operator.

Several homology-modifying operators have been proposed for 2-complexes that define the boundary of a solid in

                        , called boundary models. In these models, there is only one implicitly represented volumetric cell, which is not necessarily homeomorphic to a 3D ball. The glue operator in [3] merges two 2-cells and deletes both of them. It corresponds to the connected sum operator on manifold surfaces. If the two glued 2-cells belong to two different connected components of the complex, one of the components is deleted (and

                         is decreased by a unit). If the two glued faces belong to the same connected components, a handle or through-hole is created (and

                         is increased by two units). In [4–6], the homology-modifying operator is called MRKF (Make Ring, Kill Face). It is similar to the glue operator in [3], but it imposes less restrictive conditions on the 2-cells to be glued, and it deletes only one of the 2-cells. The 2-cells are not supposed to be topological (homeomorphic to a 2D ball).

In [10], the operators defined in [8] have been extended to complexes called stratifications, in which the cells, called strata, are defined by analytic equalities and inequalities. The cells are not necessarily homeomorphic to a ball, and they may have incomplete boundaries. Among the operators on stratifications proposed in [10], operators on topological cells (that are homeomorphic to a ball) with complete boundaries can be classified as homology-preserving (called cell subdividers) and homology-modifying (called global hole shapers). Both types of operators are instances of the operators defined in Section 3.1. A cell subdivider subdivides an i-cell by inserting into it an 
                           
                              (

                         operator. A global hole shaper either attaches or detaches a cell, thus creating a hole. There are two instances of this operator: the attached topological i-cell creates an i-hole or the detached topological i-cell creates an

(Homology-modifying) handle operators on a manifold cell 2-complex X triangulating a surface S have been introduced in [1]. They are based on the handlebody theory for surfaces [14], stating that any surface S can be obtained from a 2-ball by iteratively attaching handles (0-, 1- and 2-handles).

Attachment of a 0-handle creates a new surface with one face, three edges and three vertices. It can be expressed as one

                         operator, which together create a triangle. The operator that corresponds to the attachment of a 1-handle identifies two boundary edges of X (incident in exactly one face) with no vertices in common. The operator that corresponds to the attachment of a 2-handle identifies two boundary edges of X with two vertices in common. They can be expressed through our operators in a similar manner.

Handle operators have been extended to 3D in [2]. The operator that creates a new 3-ball (initialization operator) corresponds to the attachment of a 0-handle. Other operators identify two boundary faces (incident in exactly one 3-cell) of a cell 3-complex X triangulating a solid S. The attachment of a 1-handle (2-handle, or 3-handle) can be applied if the two identified boundary faces have no edges (some edges, or all edges) in common. The handle operators in 3D generalize the glue operator in [3]. They can be expressed in terms of the operators defined in Section 3.1 in a similar manner.

In this section, we introduce a hierarchy of cell complexes, that we call a Hierarchical Cell Complex (HCC), and we discuss its major properties. We define an HCC in terms of the refinement operators introduced in Section 3.

A Hierarchical Cell Complex (HCC) is generated from a d-complex X at full resolution by iteratively applying simplification operators 
                        
                           KiC
                           (
                           i
                           +
                           1
                           )
                           C
                        
                      and KiCiCycle. By applying first the homology-preserving operators, we obtain a complex 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      having the same homology as the original complex X but with fewer cells and such that no homology-preserving operator is feasible on 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     . By applying next the homology-modifying operators to iteratively remove the cells of 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     , the homology is affected at each step and the process is repeated until a complex is obtained that has at least one i-cell, 
                        
                           0
                           ⩽
                           i
                           ⩽
                           d
                        
                     . At each step, when we apply a homology-modifying operator, we remove a top cell from the complex. After each application of a homology-modifying operator, we perform feasible homology-preserving ones.

We call the application of a simplification operator a simplification modification. The complex obtained as the result of the simplification sequence is the coarsest representation of the original cell complex X. We denote such coarsest complex as 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        
                     . It represents the first component of an HCC.

The second component of an HCC is the set 
                        
                           M
                        
                      of the refinement modifications which are inverse with respect to the simplification modifications that have produced 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        
                      from X. Each refinement introduces new cells (two cells if it is homology-preserving, one if it is homology-modifying).

The third component of an HCC is the dependency relation between the modifications in the set 
                        
                           M
                        
                      of all refinement modifications. We consider, for simplicity, the creation of the coarse complex

From an HCC it is thus possible to dynamically extract representations of the original cell complex X at uniform and variable resolutions. The basic query for extracting a single-resolution representation from a multi-resolution model is known as selective refinement. A selective refinement query consists of extracting from an HCC a complex with the minimum number of cells, satisfying some application-dependent criterion. This criterion can be formalized by defining a Boolean function 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      over all nodes of an HCC, such that the value of 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      is true on nodes which satisfy the criterion, and false otherwise. The same value of 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      is associated with the cells created by the modification encoded in the node of the HCC (p and q for homology-preserving modification, p for homology-modifying modification). The selective refinement query consists of extracting from the HCC an intermediate complex of minimum size among the complexes encoded in the HCC that satisfies 
                        
                           τ
                        
                     . Equivalently, it consists of extracting a minimal closed set 
                        
                           U
                        
                      of modifications in 
                        
                           M
                        
                     , such that the corresponding complex satisfies 
                        
                           τ
                        
                     . Such closed set of modifications uniquely determines a front complex, which is obtained from the base complex 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        
                     , by applying to it all modifications from 
                        
                           U
                        
                      in any order that is consistent with the partial order defined by the dependency relation. Criterion 
                        
                           τ
                        
                      can be defined based on various conditions posed on the cells in the extracted complex, like the size of the cell (which may be expressed as the maximum distance between its vertices or the diameter of its bounding box) or the portion of the complex in which full resolution is required (while in the rest of the complex, the resolution may be arbitrarily low).

In Fig. 4
                      we show the HCC built from the sequence of simplifications illustrated in Fig. 1. We can notice that each node, with the exception of the root, represents a refinement dual to a simplification applied in Fig. 1. Each closed subset of refinement modifications produces a different cell complex at intermediate resolution.

In this section, we present an approach for computing homology and homology generators at various resolutions using an HCC built based only on the homology-preserving operators, that we call a homology-preserving HCC.

We are interested in computing the homology groups

We have implemented the homology-preserving HCC by using a DAG for encoding the direct dependency relation and the Incidence Graph (IG) [23] for encoding the base complex 
                        
                           
                              
                                 X
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        
                     . We refer to [18] for details regarding the homology-preserving HCC encoding structure. We have performed experiments on the 2D and 3D complexes described in Table 1
                      by using a desktop computer with a 3.2Ghz processor and 16GB of memory. All complexes are simplicial complexes, that become cell complexes after undergoing some simplification.

The storage cost of the HCC encoding structure is about 25% less than the storage cost of the incidence graph representing the complex at full resolution (the original complex). These latter complexes have between 40K and 3.2M top cells in 2D case, and between 700K and 6M top cells in the 3D case, as shown in Table 1 (column Cells). The storage cost of the original cell complex is between 4.8MB and 398MB for 2D complexes, and between 118MB and 980MB for 3D complexes (column Complex cost). The storage cost of the corresponding HCC is between 3.3MB and 273MB, and between 84MB and 720MB (column HCC cost), respectively.

In the first set of experiments we have evaluated the time required to compute the homology and its generators of the original complex (the one at full resolution) by using the HCC. To this aim, we first compute the homology generators on the base complex, encoded in the root of the HCC. This computation requires between

                      and 8.8s depending on the dataset (column SNF Time in Table 2
                     ). Then, we perform all the refinements in the HCC, by applying when necessary the refinement of the generators as described in Section 6. This produces the representation of the complex at full resolution together with the homology generators. The total cost of this computation is the sum of the time required to compute the homology of the base complex (column SNF Time) and the time needed to fully refine the complex and its generators (column Tot. Ref. Time). This takes from a minimum of 0.15 to a maximum of 83.3s. Applying the same SNF reduction directly on the original complex, requires about 2.6h on a relatively small complex (the dataset Genus3), while it results in very high computation times for the other datasets.

                      generators computed on the 3D Skull dataset.

In the second set of experiments we have focused on extracting different representations of the complex by expanding the computed generators at different resolutions. We have considered first the extraction of representations at uniform resolution: we have extracted representations obtained from the base complex by applying approximatively 20%, 50% and 80% of the total possible refinements (column Uniform Ref. in Table 2). Refinements are forced to be evenly distributed inside the complex in order to obtain a uniformly refined complex. We can notice (see column Uniform Time) that the time required depends on the number of refinements performed and is between 0.03 and 7.5s for extraction at 20% resolution and between 0.12 and 69.3s for extraction at 80% resolution.

Then, we have extracted representations of the complexes varying the resolution inside the domain. The objective has been to obtain a cell complex, and the corresponding homology generators, with a maximum resolution only in a neighborhood of a specific homology class. This corresponds to computing the 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      generators on the base complex and, by traversing the HCC, to performing only those refinements that create an i-cell belonging to some 
                        
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                        
                      generator (and the refinements on which they depend). This kind of selective refinement produces cell complexes with a low number of cells outside the area around the generators and thus leads to a further saving (15–30%) with respect to extracting generators and complexes at maximum resolution. Note that the extraction at variable resolution is a distinctive feature of the HCC which cannot be performed on other hierarchical models. Examples of variable resolution extractions are shown in Fig. 7
                      and in Fig. 8
                     (d).

We have proposed a set of atomic modeling operators for simplifying and refining cell complexes in arbitrary dimensions, which either preserve the homology of a cell complex, or modify it in a controlled way. We have compared these operators with existing ones proposed in the literature. Based on our modeling operators, we have defined a hierarchical model for cell complexes, the Hierarchical Cell Complex (HCC), which implicitly encodes a virtually continuous set of complexes at different resolutions.

We have developed an implementation of the HCC, based on our homology-preserving operators, as the basis for computing the homology and its generators for a cell complex at various resolutions in an efficient and effective way. The advantages of our approach are that a homology-preserving HCC is dimension-independent, can be applied to general cell complexes and enables the extraction of homology generators at variable resolutions.

In our current and future work, we first plan to extend the previous approach to the computation of homology and homology generators with coefficients in 
                        
                           Z
                        
                     . We also plan to adapt the HCC framework to simplicial complexes. We will consider two simplification operators for generating an HCC: simplex collapse 
                     [24], which is an instance of simplification operator
