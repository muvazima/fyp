                  This paper investigates the anchor points in nonconvex Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), called Free Disposal Hull (FDH), technologies. We develop the concept of anchor points under various returns to scale assumptions in FDH models. A necessary and sufficient condition for characterizing the anchor points is provided. Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme units, a definition of extreme units in non-convex technologies as well as a new method for obtaining these units are given. Finally, a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of the anchor points in FDH models is provided. Obtaining both extreme units and anchor points is done via calculating only some ratios, without solving any mathematical programming problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The boundary of the Production Possibility Set (PPS) (production technology) plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and productivity analysis. There are several tools in the literature to estimate the PPS and its boundary. One of the most important and widely-used approaches is Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a non-parametric Linear Programming-based technique. DEA was first introduced by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) and was developed by many scholars; see e.g. Cook and Seiford (2009), Cooper, Seiford, and Tone (2007), Emrouznejad, Parker, and Tavares (2008), and Hatami-Marbini, Emrouznejad, and Tavana (2011) for some reviews.

An important class of DEA technologies is that of FDH models. These models, which have been first presented by Deprins, Simar, and Tulkens (1984), evaluate the Decision Making Units (DMUs) considering the closest inner approximation of the true strongly disposable (but possibly non-convex) technology. FDH models have been studied by many scholars, including Tulkens (1993), Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999), Cherchye, Kuosmanen, and Post (2000), 2001), Podinovski (2004), Leleu (2006), Briec, Kerstens, and Vanden Eeckaut (2004), Briec and Kerstens (2006), Soleimani-damaneh, Jahanshahloo, and Reshadi (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Soleimani-damaneh and Mostafaee (2009). See also, Kerstens and Woestyne (2014) for a recent review of the solution methods in FDH models.

Studying the boundary points of DEA technologies is a very important issue in performance analysis and this leads to theoretical and practical observations which are useful in studying the structure of efficiency and inefficiency. Charnes, Cooper, and Thrall (1991) classified Decision Making Units (DMUs) to six classes based upon their efficiency situation, the dimension of dual solution set, and the positivity of the optimal multipliers. In another work in the economics literature, Färe, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1983) classified the boundary points of production technologies to three classes, isoquant, weak efficient, and efficient. They utilized this classification to address the question, what is technical inefficiency and where does it come from?

An important set of boundary points which are defined according to the positivity of optimal multipliers is that of anchor points.Thanassoulis and Allen (1998) used the concept of these points, at first, for the generation of unobserved DMUs and extending the DEA frontier. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) defined these points formally as production possibilities which give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the boundary of the PPS. Rouse (2004) utilized this notion for identifying prices for health care services. Bougnol and Dulá (2009) used the geometrical properties of the anchor points to design and test an algorithm for their identification. Thanassoulis, Kortelainen, and Allen (2012) provided another method for identifying the anchor points based upon the radial efficiency scores and slack variables at the optimal solution of envelopment models. They have used this concept for improving envelopment under multiple inputs and outputs in a VRS technology. In a recently published paper, Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014) presented an algorithm for identification of the anchor points utilizing sensitivity analysis techniques. See also Bougnol (2001) and Allen and Thanassoulis (2004) for more details about the notion and applications of the anchor points.

All of the above-mentioned works have been done on anchor points under convex technologies. In this paper, we study the anchor points in (nonconvex) FDH models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on anchor points in nonconvex technologies. We define the extreme unit and anchor point notions in nonconvex technologies. Since the first step for obtaining the anchor points is obtaining the extreme units, a ratio-based technique for determining the extreme units in FDH models is presented. Necessary and sufficient conditions for characterizing the anchor points are established, and utilizing them, a ratio-based technique is given for determining the anchor points. Both given ratio-based techniques are polynomial-time and they work without solving any mathematical programming problem.

The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: In Section 2, some preliminaries are provided. Section 3 is devoted to defining and identifying the extreme units in FDH technologies. In Section 4, the anchor point notion in FDH technologies is defined and after presenting a characterization, a polynomial-time algorithm for identification of these points is presented. In addition to the theoretical results, some numerical examples are given. Eventually, Section 5 contains a short conclusion.

The above models and Γ-technologies have been proposed by Kerstens and Vanden Eeckaut (1999). A linear version of these models has been addressed by Podinovski (2004). These models and technologies have been utilized by Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Soleimani-damaneh and Mostafaee (2009) for determining RTS under nonconvex production technologies.

Obtaining FDH efficiency scores using Models (5) and (6) requires solving linear/nonlinear mixed-integer programming problems. The following proposition shows that these models can be solved by calculating only some simple ratios. The proof of this proposition comes from the discussions provided by Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Kerstens and Woestyne (2014), and is hence omitted.

From Proposition 2.1, it can be seen that the FDH efficiency scores can be obtained by calculating only some ratios. Calculating these ratios is polynomial-time computationally; see Theorem 3 in Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007).

Since the set of anchor points is a subset of the set of extreme units, studying (identifying) the extreme units plays a crucial role in finding the anchor points. In fact, the set of extreme units is called the frame of PPS. In this section, a basic definition of extreme units in non-convex technologies is given. Afterward, a method for identification of the extreme units in FDH technologies, under various RTS assumptions, is presented.

In fact, a DMU is an extreme unit if removing it from the set of the observed DMUs does change the PPS. The following example clarifies the above definition.

Hereafter, the set of extreme units in PΓ
                      is denoted by EΓ
                     .

                        Example 3.1
                        Consider five DMUs, A, B, C, D, E which consume a single-input x to produce a single-output y. The data of these DMUs are listed in Table 1
                           .

The frontier of the PPS under different RTS assumptions can be seen in Fig. 1
                           . The frontier in VRS case has been depicted by the dark line segments. The frontier under CRS assumption is the halfline starting from the origin passing from point A. The frontier in NIRS case is the union of the halfline

Model (7) is a 0–1 nonlinear mixed-integer programming problem which belongs to the NP-hard class in general. According to the special structure of this problem, the following theorem provides a practical formula for checking if a DMU
                        o
                      is an extreme unit in PΓ
                      or not. Checking it by this formula is polynomial-time computationally (see Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi, 2007). It is done without solving any mathematical programming problem.

                           . Hence, by the fourth constraint of this problem, we get

                           This implies λjo
                            ≤ λjo
                            for some j ≠ o, which contradicts the assumption and completes the proof of part (ii).□

Now we implement the above theorem on the data of Example 3.1. We do it only for VRS and CRS cases, and for other cases it can be done similarly.

The λjo
                      and λjo
                      values for o, j ∈ {A, B, C, D, E} have been calculated and listed in Tables 2
                      and 3
                     , respectively. In these tables, row is corresponding to “o” and column is corresponding to “j”.

For each o ∈ {A, B, C, D}, we have λjo
                      > 1 or λjo
                      < 1 for each j ≠ o (see the rows corresponding to A, B, C, D in Tables 2 and 3). Hence, four DMUs A, B, C, D are extreme units in P
                     VRS, because of part (i) of Theorem 3.2. DMU
                        E
                      is not extreme in P
                     VRS because

                     .

Now, let 
                        
                           Γ
                           =
                           CRS
                        
                     . For DMU
                        A

                      > λjA
                      for each j ≠ A. Hence, DMU
                        A
                      is an extreme unit in P
                     CRS because of part (ii) of Theorem 3.2. For DMU

                     . Hence, these three DMUs are not extreme units in P
                     CRS.

As can be seen in the DEA literature (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2012), the anchor points play a vital role in DEA theory and application. These points delineate the efficient frontier of the PPS from the free-disposability portion of the boundary (in convex DEA). The anchor points are usually production points with small or big size of input-output factors. These points are far from the central part of the efficiency frontier. As can be seen from Theorem 1 of Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014) and the results given by Bougnol and Dulá (2009), the role of some input–output factors in efficiency situation of these units is not considerable. Anchor points were first used by Thanassoulis and Allen (1998). More developments about the anchor points from both conceptual and applied points of view have been done by Bougnol (2001), Rouse (2004), Bougnol and Dulá (2009), Thanassoulis et al. (2012), and Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014).

Now, we are ready to define the anchor points in nonconvex DEA models which are called FDH models. Let 
                        
                           E
                           Γ

                           P
                           Γ

The following lemma helps us in the sequel. Throughout this work, int(A) stands for the set of interior points of A. Also, e denotes a vector with all components equal to one.

                              It is worth mentioning that the idea of the proof of this theorem is taken from the discussion provided in Soleimani-damaneh et al. (2006), Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), and Kerstens and Woestyne (2014).

The following algorithm, which is obtained from the theoretical results of the paper, provides a ratio-based procedure for checking whether a DMU is anchor point or not. It is done via calculating some simple ratios, and similar to Theorem 3 in Soleimani-damaneh and Reshadi (2007), it can be shown that the provided algorithm is polynomial-time computationally.

We write the algorithm only for VRS case. It can be written for other cases analogously.


                     Algorithm 1
                      is also presented in Flowchart 1
                     . This flowchart is helpful in better understanding the algorithm.

Now, we perform the provided algorithm on an example with real world data.

                        Example 4.1
                        Assume that we have 17 DMUs which consume two inputs x
                           1j
                           , x
                           2j
                            to produce two outputs y
                           1j
                           , y
                           2j
                           . The data of this example, listed in Table 4
                           , have been extracted from a real application reported by Hadi-vencheh, Foroughi, and Soleimani-damaneh (2008). Here, we assume that 
                              
                                 Γ
                                 =
                                 VRS
                              
                           . From the results reported in the sixth and seventh columns of Table 4, it is seen that two DMUs 1 and 2 are anchor points in P
                           VRS and the remaining units are not anchor. The reasons which make DMUs 3–17 non-anchor has been written in the last column of this table. Three DMUs 5, 6 and 16 are non-extreme units in P
                           VRS.

The λ- and μ-values for DMU1 have been reported in Table 5
                           . From Table 5, it is seen that λjo
                            < 1 for each j ≠ 1. Hence, by Theorem 3.2, DMU1 is an extreme unit in P
                           VRS. Furthermore, in Table 5,

                           Thus, DMU1 is an anchor point in P
                           VRS, because of Theorem 4.2. Similarly, it can be shown that DMU2 is an anchor point in P
                           VRS.

There are two equivalent views in defining the anchor points in convex technologies. Based upon the first view, anchor points are extreme points that give the transition from the Pareto-efficient frontier to the weak-efficient portion of the boundary of the PPS. In second view, an extreme point is called anchor if some component of inputs (resp. outputs) can be increased infinitely (resp. decreased until zero) without penetrating the interior of the PPS. Both these standpoints work and these are equivalent under the convexity of PPS, while the former is not valid for FDH technologies; see e.g. DMU
                              C
                            in Fig. 1 (in VRS case). Some approaches given in the literature (Thanassoulis et al., 2012) work based upon the former view and so they do not work for nonconvex case. The equivalence of the above-mentioned definitions in convex technologies accompanying some results from duality in linear programming and convex analysis, lead to an important characterization of anchor points with respect to the supporting hyperplanes (see Result 1 in Bougnol & Dulá, 2009 and its proof) and to some algorithms for convex case (see Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014). This characterization and the related algorithms do not work in nonconvex case due to the lack of duality relations, lack of supporting hyperplanes at some boundary points and inequivalence of two above-mentioned definitions.

In addition to the above comments, the first step in studying anchor points in a technology is defining the extreme points (units). In convex analysis and linear programming, extreme points are defined utilizing convex combination. Such a definition does not work in the presence of nonconvex production technologies, and hence the methods existing in convex DEA literature do not work for nonconvex PPSs. According to this, we have provided a new definition of extreme units (Definition 3.1) which is compatible with nonconvex technologies.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

FDH models are important nonconvex DEA models which rely on the sole assumption that production possibilities satisfy free disposability, and ensure that efficiency evaluations are effected from only actually observed performances; see Deprins et al. (1984), Tulkens (1993), Kerstens and Woestyne (2014), Cherchye et al. (2000), 2001), and Soleimani-damaneh (2013). On the other hand, anchor points, which define the transition from the efficient frontier to the free-disposability portion of the frontier of the convex PPS, build an important class of extreme efficient points in DEA. Although the properties, applications, and identification of these points in convex DEA models have been studied by various authors (see Allen & Thanassoulis, 2004; Bougnol, 2001; Bougnol & Dulá, 2009; Mostafaee & Soleimani-damaneh, 2014; Rouse, 2004; Thanassoulis et al., 2012), there is not any work about these points on nonconvex technologies in the literature. In this paper, we dealt with these points from a different point of view in FDH models, and provided some main theorems for characterization of these points. Utilizing these theoretical results, a polynomial-time procedure has been introduced for identification of the anchor points. The connection between the anchor points and super-efficiency models (see Andersen & Petersen, 1993; Chen, 2005; Tone, 2002) seems as a worthwhile direction for future research. An obvious link can be observed by comparing Definition 3.1 in the present paper and the model given by Andersen and Petersen (1993).
