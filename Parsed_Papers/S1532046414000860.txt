Privacy preserving data publishing

Inference attacks

Privacy versus utility

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  While the study of privacy preserving data publishing has drawn a lot of interest, some recent work has shown that existing mechanisms do not limit all inferences about individuals. This paper is a positive note in response to this finding. We point out that not all inference attacks should be countered, in contrast to all existing works known to us, and based on this we propose a model called SPLU. This model protects sensitive information, by which we refer to answers for aggregate queries with small sums, while queries with large sums are answered with higher accuracy. Using SPLU, we introduce a sanitization algorithm to protect data while maintaining high data utility for queries with large sums. Empirical results show that our method behaves as desired.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In a recent work by Cormode [7], it is shown that despite much progress in two main branches of privacy models for data publishing, namely differential privacy [13], and various syntactic methods such as k-anonymity [26] and 
                        
                           ℓ
                        
                     -diversity [20], inference-based attacks can still be successful. The study is based on the ability of an attacker to construct accurate classifiers on top of releases protected by state-of-the-art privacy preserving data publishing techniques.

The empirical study result above is in fact consistent with the result from [10]. Following the model in [10], given a dataset 
                        
                           d
                           =

                                 d

                           is poly (n)-non-private.
                        

The above findings are based on the assumption that all inference attacks are to be defended, and any relatively accurate information derivable from the published data is considered privacy breaching. This is quite inconsistent with the simultaneous requirement of utility whereby minimum distortion is to be introduced so that the published data are as close to the original data as possible. Here we show that the dilemma can be resolved by a segregation of utility and privacy.

The key point as observed by Cormode is that privacy and utility are closely related. As stated in the conclusion in [7], “release of (anonymized) data may reveal hitherto unknown population parameters which compromise individual privacy. … in some settings, these population statistics may represent exactly the desired utility of the data collection and publication.” This remark highlights the issue to be resolved. The key is how to differentiate between utility and privacy. Once we identify the utility of the data and once users agree that this utility has no conflict with their privacy, the proper solution is not to insist on protection for the information related to the utility. We provide a way to differentiate what concepts may be reasonable to be disclosed for utility. If users indeed have concerns about the disclosure of such concepts there is always the option of not releasing any data. This provides for a better alternative for the status quo of releasing the data knowing that certain inference attacks are possible.

To our knowledge, there is no known model for the separation of concepts that need protection and those that need to be maintained for utility purposes, in privacy preserving data publishing. Some previous works [11,19] study the adjustment of parameters in the anonymization process for the trade-off between privacy and utility. The problem studied in such works is very different and in their model, all concepts are treated equally in terms of utility and privacy. We assume that aggregate queries of large sums should be answered relatively accurately for utility, while those with very small sums should not. Consider an example from [13] where a dataset 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      tells us that almost everyone involved in a dataset is two footed. Knowing with high certainty that an individual is two footed from 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      is not considered a privacy issue since it is true for almost everyone in the dataset.

                        There may be scenarios where our assumption does not hold. That is, even if something is true for most tuples in 
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       D
                                    
                                    
                                       ′
                                    
                                 
                              
                           , the information is still sensitive. An example would be a dataset containing only information about patients with a certain cancer disease. In such a case knowing that a person is in the dataset is already considered sensitive, and all attributes will be sensitive. Hence, our proposed model becomes irrelevant and does not apply.

                      Large sum concepts are statistical and of value for utility. In contrast, small count concepts are non-statistical and the protection of small counts has been well-studied in the topic of security in statistical databases [1].

Our main contributions are summarized as follows.
                        
                           (1)
                           We propose a framework, called SPLU, which allows releasing data for answering large sum queries with high accuracy to provide utility, while offering high inaccuracy for small sum queries in order to ensure privacy. We point out that not all inference attacks should be defended.

To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept of SPLU, we propose a data sanitization mechanism, called SPLU-Gen, for achieving this goal. SPLU-Gen is based on randomized perturbation on the sensitive values.

We introduce a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm which takes into account the global data distribution. This improves on the known reconstruction approach in syntactic methods and leads to higher data utility.

We have conducted experiments on two real datasets to show that SPLU-Gen provides protection for small sums and high utility for large sum queries. We note that existing mechanisms may readily support SPLU, which is an encouraging result.

In Fig. 1
                     , we outline the SPLU-Gen mechanism for data sanitization and the query processing based on the sanitized data. The dataset on the left of the figure is passed as input to SPLU-Gen. The input is processed and as a result, a sanitized dataset is published. Querying is applied on the sanitized data, and the query result is generated by a reconstruction algorithm. The user will receive relatively accurate results for large sum queries and inaccurate results for queries of small sums.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the SPLU model. Section 3 describes the mechanism SPLU-Gen. Section 4 is about count reconstruction and properties of SPLU-Gen. Section 5 considers multiple attribute aggregations. Section 6 is on empirical study, and Section 7 is on related works. Section 8 concludes this work.

We consider the data model in previous works on k-anonymity [26] and 
                        
                           ℓ
                        
                     -diversity [20]. This data model assumes that a set of attributes form a quasi-identifier, the values of which for a target individual can be known to the adversary from other sources, and also one or more sensitive attributes which need to be protected. Hence, there are two kinds of attributes in the dataset, the non-sensitive attributes (NSA) and the sensitive attributes (SA). In Fig. 2
                     (a) we show a given dataset D. In table D, the attribute id is for the tuple id. The attributes Age and Zip-Code are considered non-sensitive attributes and they form a quasi-identifer. The term quasi-identifier indicates that it may be possible to identify an individual based on the respective attribute values. For example, it is possible that Age 90 and Zip-Code [12–17k] uniquely determine an individual, if there is only one resident aged 90 in the area of Zip-Code [12–17k]. Such attributes are considered not sensitive. In table D, Disease is a sensitive attribute.

In this model we do not perturb the non-sensitive values but may alter the sensitive values to ensure privacy. This is a commonly used data model and it corresponds to the initial problem settings with real world applications [25,22].

We are given a dataset (table) D which is a set of N tuples that follow the above data model. A concept c in D is a predicator formed by the conjunction of value assignments to a set of attributes in D. Our problem is how to generate and replace the sensitive values for the tuples in D to be published in the output dataset 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     . 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                      should satisfy both utility for large sum querying and privacy protection for small sum queries.

In Fig. 1(b), we show a possible published dataset 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        
                     , which is a sanitized counterpart of dataset D. We shall discuss in Section 3 about how 
                        
                           
                              
                                 D

                      is generated from D.

We define the requirements of our model in the following.

Our problem is to design a database sanitization mechanism 
                              
                                 A
                              
                            which conforms to SPLU by supporting large sum utility as well as small sum privacy.

The threshold for small sum privacy should be set by the application based on the level of security that is desired. Similarly for the threshold for large sum utility. Note that the two thresholds may be different, so that there can be some frequencies that we guarantee neither privacy nor utility. These thresholds are specifications to be given by the users. Also note that a user needs to first decide if the attributes with large sums are sensitive. As we have discussed in Footnote 1 in Section 1, there are scenarios where they can be sensitive. If large sum data are sensitive, our model will be irrelevant.

We shall also make use of the following definition for privacy guarantee.

The goal of small sum privacy is to ensure that information that applies to a small number of individuals would not be released without introducing a significant amount of error probabilistically. SPLU is defined based on the estimated frequency. It will be up to the anonymization process to ensure that the estimated frequency is not accurate. We shall propose a mechanism SPLU-Gen that has a good guarantee in Section 3.

We do not exclude the possibility that existing methods may also be shown to satisfy SPLU. In our empirical studies we show that Anatomy may achieve high enough relative errors for small sums and good utility for large sums. Also we show that

                     . However, these are empirical results and not theoretical guarantees. There may be future works to show that both techniques conform to SPLU under certain settings.

In this section, we make use of a randomization technique to guarantee a tapering accuracy for the estimated values from large counts to small counts. In [4], a retention replacement perturbation (RRP) scheme for categorical sensitive values is proposed. This scheme keeps the original sensitive value in a tuple with a probability of p and randomly picks any other value to substitute for the true value with a probability of 
                        
                           (
                           1
                           -
                           p
                           )
                        
                     . Not all randomization techniques are equally effective. For example, if we simply generate sensitive values in the published records based on the original distribution of SA (let us refer to this distribution based randomization technique as DBR), the correlation with the NSA values will be lost since the generation of SA value for each tuple is based on the same p.d.f. In what follows, we propose a mechanism, called SPLU-Gen, which introduces uniform probability for replacement over a subset of the domain. We will show that this mechanism is a solution to our problem in Definition 3.

                         given the dataset D. We assume that there is a single sensitive attribute (SA) S in D. Later we shall discuss the more general case of multiple sensitive attributes. We make the same assumption as in previous works [20,30] that the dataset is eligible, so that the highest frequency of any sensitive attribute value does not exceed 
                           
                              N

                        . Furthermore we assume that N is a multiple of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         (it is easy to ensure this by deleting no more than

The first step of SPLU-Gen is an initialization step, whereby the dataset D goes through a projection operation on id and the SA attribute S.

Our method can be seen as a variation of the Retention Replacement Perturbation (RRP) scheme which is known to preserve good utility [4]. In particular the correlation of SA with NSA is maintained by the retention of the SA value for each tuple with probability p.
                           2
                           Since the sensitive value has some stickiness with the original tuple with a probability of p, an adversary with background knowledge that two individuals have the same SA value can launch an attack if both individuals happen to retain the SA value and the value is extremely rare. To handle such attacks we may adopt suppression of rare values. This, however, is beyond the scope of this work.

In comparison with partitioning based methods for 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                        -diversity [20] such as Anatomy [30], there are some major observations. Firstly, Anatomy can be seen as introducing a random permutation in each group, whereas our method draws values in each group with replacement rather than without replacement. Hence, both methods can preserve the distribution of SA well. However, random permutation has a known problem of privacy leak for infrequent values, which need suppression for privacy reason [17]. The honest recording of SA values resulting from the permutations in Anatomy preserves the exact counts of the sensitive values for all frequencies, and there is no protection for the small counts. SPLU-Gen is based on a probabilistic assignment of values to sensitive attributes in the tuples. Due to the randomization, as we shall see in later analysis, the small counts will be protected by large expected error in the results of queries for such counts.

Secondly, the partitioning information is not released by SPLU-Gen, in contrast to Anatomy and related approaches, in which the anonymized groups or buckets are made known in the data publishing. When the partitioning is known, each tuple has a limited set of 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         possible values, hence Anatomy is known to suffer from background knowledge attack where the adversary has 
                           
                              ℓ
                              -
                              1
                           
                         pieces of information for eliminating the possibilities. For SPLU-Gen, by withholding the partitioning information, and with the possibility that a value existing in D may not exist in 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                              
                           
                        , the possible values for the sensitive attribute is the entire domain. Another advantage of not releasing the partitioning information is that it makes the de Finetti attack [18] and the foreground attack in [28] mechanisms inapplicable, since both attacks are based on the knowledge of the partitioned groups. Both attacks are possible for Anatomy.

To answer the question about the utility for large sums, we derive a bound for the relative error. If there are

                         is small, then the bound is large. In other words the utility is not guaranteed, which means better privacy protection.

                         becomes very small when the count is increasing towards 900. Note that it also means that for concepts with large counts, privacy protection is not guaranteed, since the accuracy in the count will be high.

Next, we show how our mechanism can inherently provide protection for small counts. From Inequality (3), small values of

                         will weaken the guarantee of utility. We can in fact give a probability for relative errors based on the following analysis.

We have implemented our mechanism SPLU-Gen and compared it with some existing techniques that are related in some way to our method. The objectives of our empirical study are the following: (1) While we have shown in Section 4 that SPLU-Gen satisfies small sum privacy and large sum utility, we would like to see the actual results in a real dataset. Hence, in our experiments we adopt the measure of relative error to illustrate the privacy and utility levels, where a higher relative error corresponds to more privacy and less utility. (2) Demonstrate the effectiveness of our sophisticated reconstruction mechanism, which makes the querying results more accurate for large sum queries compared to previous approach. We shall compare with Anatomy. (3) Show that 
                        
                           ∊
                        
                     -differential privacy may not preserve small sum privacy with some known parameter settings, and therefore careful parameter setting is needed. (4) Show that the choice of retention based randomization is sound by comparing with a randomization algorithm (DBR) that does not have a retention probability for the original SA value in each tuple. (5) Show that correlation for the case of multiple SA attributes can be preserved. (6) Show that the computations involved are not costly.

All algorithms are implemented in C++ and tested on a machine with Intel (R) Core (TM) i3 3.10GHz CPU and 4.0GB RAM. The program for Anatomy is provided by the first author of [30].

For step 2 of mechanism SPLU-Gen, we need to partition tuples in

                                    s
                                 
                              
                           
                         into sets of size 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         each and each partition contains 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         different sensitive values. We have adopted the group creation step in the algorithm for Anatomy [30]. In this algorithm, all tuples of the given table are hashed into buckets by the sensitive values, so that each bucket contains tuples with the same SA value. The group creation step consists of multiple iterations. In each iteration a partition (group) with 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         tuples is created. Each iteration has two sub-steps: (1) find the set L with the 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         hash buckets that currently have the largest number of tuples. (2) From each bucket in L, randomly select a tuple to be included in the newly formed partition. Note that the random selection in step (2) can be made deterministic by picking the tuple with the smallest tuple id.

We use two real datasets. The first dataset is CENSUS,
                           3
                           Downloadable at http://www.ipums.org.
                        
                        
                           3
                         which contains the information for American adults. The second dataset, CADRMP, is from a publicly available
                           4
                           Downloadable at http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/adafu/medical-data.html, originally from http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/databasdon/structure-eng.php.
                        
                        
                           4
                         real hospital database.

The CENSUS dataset consists of 8 categorical dimensions: Gender (cardinality 2), Education (17), Marital (6), Race (9), Work-class (10), Country (83), Age (78), and Occupation (50). From the CENSUS dataset, we form datasets with increasing cardinalities. First, we randomly sampled 500k tuples from the real dataset, then we further randomly sampled five datasets from the 500k tuples, with cardinalities ranging from 100k to 500k, the 100k dataset is used as the default. Occupation is chosen as the sensitive attribute, while it is combined with Age for experiments with multiple sensitive values.

For the dataset CADRMP, there are 8 tables: Reports, Reactions, Drugs, ReportDrug, Ingredients, Outcome, and Druginvolve. Reports consists of patients’ basic personal information. Reactions has a foreign key PID that references the attribute ID in Reports and an attribute to indicate the patient’s disease. Reports contains records for 42,264 different individuals. A patient may have multiple diseases. We first pre-process the dataset so that we retain only the most frequent disease for each patient. Next we join the tables Reports and Reactions in order to link the patient information with the disease information. There are 42,264 tuples in the joined table with 17 attributes each. The attributes are Report-id (cardinality 42264), Report-no (6998), Gender-English (5), Age (107), Age-unit (1), Weight (316), Height (245), Manufacture-id (3241), Date-of-Last-Follow-up (1200), Serious (3), Feature-of-Report (12), Report-Type (11), Notifier-Type (12), Notifier-Location (13), ADR-id (42264) and Disease (1346). Disease will be used as the sensitive attribute.

In the experiment we consider count queries, which have been used for utility studies for partition-based methods [30] and randomization-based methods [21]. Count queries are generated according to the method described in Appendix 10.9 in [5]. Specifically, we generate random predicates with up to 3 of the non-sensitive attributes, each of which is combined with a randomly selected value in the domain of the sensitive attribute to form a query. We count the tuples satisfying such a query, which is of the form

In most of our analysis, we group queries according to their distinct selectivity ranges. We consider the queries with selectivity no more than 10 as small counts.

                         selectivity in the CADRMP dataset. A pool of 5000 small count queries and a pool of 5000 large count queries are generated for each dataset. When a selectivity s is considered without a range, we report on the average relative error of the estimated count for all queries that pass the selectivity threshold s. For a single query, if the correct answer is a and the returned answer is

Given queries in the pool, we calculate the average relative error between the actual count (from the original dataset) and the estimated count (from the published dataset) as the metric for utility. As discussed earlier, we differentiate between small counts and large counts. Specifically, we vary the selectivity (denoted by s, which is the ratio of the actual count to the cardinality of dataset) for large counts. For small counts, we require the actual count to be no more than 10. We evaluate the influence of various 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         values, and also the cardinalities of dataset on the utility. To assess the efficiency, we record the running time of our data publishing algorithm.

In this subsection we report on the results for the CENSUS dataset. We shall consider the utility for large sums, the privacy for small sums, and the comparison with other algorithms.

We first consider the utility of the anonymized data for queries with sufficient sums. The results are shown in Fig. 9(a). For selectivity (i.e., large counts) between 2% and 5%, the relative error is around 10%. The relative errors are bounded by 20% for other selectivities between 0.5% and 5%. Another observation is that the relative error is the smallest when the selectivity is the greatest at 4–5%. This shows the desired effect that the result is more accurate for large sums. In Fig. 8, we plot the relative errors for increasing selectivity from [0.5%, 1%), [1%, 2%), …, to [4%, 5%), and we notice a drop of the relative error as selectivity reaches 5%, which is the desired behavior.

We have also run some special queries on the dataset by generalizing the domain of attribute age into intervals so that each age interval spans about 8% of the tuples, this allows us to generate queries with selectivities between 5% and 8%. With such queries, and with 
                              
                                 γ
                                 =
                                 5
                              
                           , dataset of size 100K, the average relative error for SPLU-Gen is 0.01, which is very small, and it shows that the utility for larger sums is very high.

We plot the relative errors of queries with small counts in Fig. 7
                           , where the counts are smaller than 10. We see that the error is sufficiently high to ensure privacy, consistent with our requirement that answer for small count should be inaccurate enough to prevent privacy leakage. The relative error also displays a positive linear correlation with 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                           . As 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                            becomes bigger, higher uncertainty is introduced and privacy for small counts is ensured at a higher level. It also indicates that a small value of 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                            such as 5 is sufficient for a big relative error.

We have implemented three existing methods: 
                              
                                 ∊
                              
                           -differential privacy, Anatomy, and the distribution based randomization technique (DBR). DBR is described in Section 3, it generates SA values based on the distributions in the original dataset.

The first other method we have implemented is querying with 
                                 
                                    ∊
                                 
                              -differential privacy. We add independently generated noise with distribution

                                    (
                                    Δ

                               is used for illustration. For this set of experiments, we are not comparing

                               on small sum privacy. We have plotted the result of relative error for small count queries (count between 1 and 10) in Fig. 7 for the cases of

                               and 
                                 
                                    ∊
                                    =

                               and also 
                                 
                                    ∊
                                    =

                              . We can see that the relative error is quite small compared to the other methods, and can lead to privacy concerns. If 
                                 
                                    ∊
                                 
                               is set smaller, the relative error will become bigger. This result shows that differential privacy mechanism may violate the small sum privacy requirement if the parameters are not set properly. Therefore, careful selection of parameters is needed.

To compare with the Anatomy method, we set both 
                                 
                                    γ
                                 
                               and 
                                 
                                    ℓ
                                 
                               in Anatomy to the same value, 
                                 
                                    γ
                                    =
                                    ℓ
                                    =
                                    5
                                 
                              . The answers for Anatomy are estimated using the method in [30]. We then choose different settings of s (selectivity) and N (sizes of dataset) to evaluate their performance. We first examine the relative error for small counts (see Fig. 7). In comparison it is noted that SPLU-Gen achieves a highest error rate for larger values of 
                                 
                                    γ
                                 
                              , which shows that SPLU-Gen is more sensitive to the group sizes. In Fig. 8
                              , we compare the methods in terms of their achieved utility by setting N
                              =300K and varying the selectivity. SPLU-Gen has a decreasing pattern for the relative error with decreasing selectivity, which is consistent with the SPLU model. Anatomy does not exhibit a similar trend. These results can be explained by the use of a randomization and reconstruction technique in SPLU-Gen which directly corresponds to the law of large numbers. For large count queries, the average relative errors for Anatomy and SPLU-Gen are shown in Fig. 9
                              (b) and (a), respectively. The overall error of our method is smaller than that of Anatomy and also there is better correspondence of utility with selectivity. This helps to show the superiority of our reconstruction mechanism.

Next we consider the comparison with the distribution based randomization algorithm DBR. For DBR, the maximum likelihood estimations for sums of SA or predicates involves both NSA and SA are the corresponding counts in the published data. While DBR makes use of the original SA distribution in the randomization, and hence can preserve it well, it does not try to retain the original SA value in a given tuple. Hence, the correlation of the NSA and SA is not preserved. This affects the utility of DBR for predicates involving both NSA and SA. From Fig. 9(c), we see that DBR leads to higher relative errors for large sum queries. In Fig. 8, for DBR, we observe larger errors for smaller selectivities compared to SPLU-Gen, and an increase in error for larger selectivity. There is no obvious trend as the utility fluctuates with the correlations in the original datasets, where higher inaccuracy results if the original dataset exhibits more correlations for the chosen query.

Next we report our results on the medical dataset CADRMP. This dataset is comparatively smaller than CENSUS, with only 42,264 data records. The smaller size makes the results less stable compared to CENSUS. We shall again examine the utility for large sums, the privacy for small sums and the comparison with other methods. Since the relative errors in general for CADRMP are lower for small counts, we have attempted to set the default value of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         to 10 as is set in [30]. However, there exists some sensitive value with a frequency above 10%, hence CADRMP violates the eligibility condition [30,20] and Anatomy becomes infeasible. Hence, we set 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         to the nearest feasible value of 9.

The results for utility are shown in Fig. 11. We plot the relative errors for increasing selectivity from [1%, 2%), [2%, 3%), …, to [8%, 9%). The relative errors range from below 10% to below 30%. The trend is not clear as the greatest errors occur in the middle at selectivity 
                              
                                 [
                                 5
                                 %
                                 ,
                                 6
                                 %
                                 )
                              
                           , and is the lowest at selectivity 
                              
                                 [
                                 6
                                 %
                                 ,
                                 7
                                 %
                                 )
                              
                           . The errors from the three methods, SPLU-Gen, Anatomy, and DBR are quite similar in trend. One explanation to this fluctuation is that the given dataset has a smaller size and the cardinality of the sensitive value is large, which introduces more uncertainty for the errors. The cardinality of Disease in CADRMP is 1346. Compared to the cardinality of 50 for Occupation in CENSUS, Disease is much more diverse. This makes the results more unstable across the different methods. Hence, users may first analyze the diversity of their data attributes and take note of its possible impact on the results. Overall, the relative errors for SPLU-Gen and Anatomy are both small for the large sum queries and both methods provide utility for such queries.

We vary 
                              
                                 γ
                              
                            from 2 to 9 in Fig. 10
                           
                            to measure the relative error for small count queries. The relative errors from SPLU-Gen, Anatomy, DBR and DP are plotted. The resulting trend is similar to the results from CENSUS. SPLU-Gen has a clearly higher relative error rate compared to the other methods at 
                              
                                 γ
                                 =

                            or above, and hence provides better small sum privacy.

                           . We can see that for 
                              
                                 ∊
                                 =
                                 ln
                                 3
                              
                           , the relative error is quite small compared to the other methods, and can lead to privacy concerns. If 
                              
                                 ∊
                              
                            is set smaller the relative error will become bigger. This result is similar to that for CENSUS.

We also consider the utility in scenarios where a query involves more than one sensitive value. To this end, we choose Age and Occupation as the sensitive attributes in CENSUS. The two sensitive attributes are randomized independently and then combined for data publishing To allow queries of large selectivities, we first generalize the domain of Age into ten intervals; without this step, most of the resulting counts are too small and the range of selectivity is limited. The relative error for multiple-dimension aggregates involving two sensitive attributes is shown in Fig. 12
                        , where 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         ranges from 2 to 8. Although the selectivity is very low (0.1–0.7% for this case), the overall accuracy can match that of the single-sensitive-attribute scenario.

The computational overhead mainly comes from the partitioning process. We have adopted the partitioning method of Anatomy. This algorithm can be implemented with a time complexity of 
                           
                              O
                              (
                              N
                              (
                              1
                              +
                              
                                 
                                    V
                                 
                                 
                                    γ
                                 
                              
                              )
                              )
                           
                        , where N is the cardinality of the table, and V is the number of distinct values of the sensitive attribute. We measure the running time for the case of single sensitive attribute on the largest 500K dataset, varying 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         from 2 to 10. For all chosen 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         values, our algorithm can finish within 10 s for a 500K dataset, which is practical to be deployed in real applications.

We also consider the querying efficiency at the user side. To estimate the answer, a user will compute each component of the vector y, and do matrix multiplications to iteratively converge to the answer x. When each component of y changes by no more than 
                           
                              1
                              %
                           
                        , we terminate the iteration and measure the querying time and number of iterations. In our experiments, SQLITE3
                           5
                           See http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html.
                        
                        
                           5
                         serves for querying y, and we consider the case with two sensitive attributes which involves the most number of components in y, implying the largest computational cost. The result shows that the Bayesian iterative process takes negligible time, while the major cost comes from the querying step. In particular, it takes less than 1ms on average, and 10ms in the worst case, for the iterative process to converge. The median and average of the number of iterations is 16 and 325, respectively. In total, the average measured time for a query is 1612ms, which poses little computational burden on users.

As pointed out in Section 2, the thresholds for small sum privacy and large sum utility can be determined by users. The users may decide based on both theoretical analysis and experimental results. With SPLU-Gen, we have the properties as given in Lemmas 1 and 2, and some analytical results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The figures show the utility for large sums of 100 or above for different values of 
                           
                              ∊
                           
                        , and privacy guarantee for small sums of less than 10. Our experimental results in this section support similar findings. The user can decide on the suitable thresholds based on these results. We have set the parameter of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         to values of 5, 9, and 10 with satisfactory outcomes. Hence, we would recommend the use of 
                           
                              γ
                           
                         values between 5 and 10 for SPLU-Gen.

@&#RELATED WORKS@&#

Since the pioneering works on protecting privacy while disclosing information in [25,22] there have been many interesting research works. The models of k-anonymity [26] and 
                        
                           ℓ
                        
                     -diversity [20] are among the first major models on this problem. 
                        
                           ∊
                        
                     -differential privacy has been introduced for query answering and a common technique is based on distortion to the query answer by a random noise that is i.i.d. from a Laplace distribution and calibrated to the sensitivity of the querying [14,12]. Laplace noise has been used in recent works on reducing relative error [29] and the publishing of data cubes in [9].

Some previous works study the trade-off between utility and privacy (risk). They include the work on risk-utility (RU) confidentiality maps by Duncan et al. [11] and the study of utility versus privacy trade-off in k-anonymization by Loukides et al. [19]. These works set up different metrics for privacy and utility, so that adjustments of parameters in the anonyimzation process give rise to different utility and privacy measurements. Typically, higher utility leads to lower privacy, and vice versa. Based on these metrics, Duncan et al. generate RU plots to identify the best solution in terms of both privacy and utility. Such works differ from ours in that they treat all concepts equally in terms of privacy or utility. There is no separation of concepts that need protection versus those that do not. After the parameter setting, these works follow conventional mechanisms and are susceptible to the problem posted by [7].

The problem posted by [7] is that a classifier built on top of data anonymized by conventional mechanisms can be very accurate in the prediction of sensitive values for some individuals. This is true even when the anonymization process is known to have certain privacy protection for the individuals. In their experiment, they showed that with the Adult dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, when the data is sanitized by a differential privacy mechanism, a classifier built on top of the published data can be very accurate for a few hundred individuals when the target attribute is Occupation.

In the literature of statistical databases, the protection of small counts has been well-studied in the topic of security in statistical databases [1]. A concept similar to ours is found in [27] where the aim is to ensure that the error in queries involving a large number of tuples will be significantly less than the perturbation of individual tuples. It has been pointed out in previous works [15,16] that the security of a database is endangered by allowing answers to counting queries that involve small counts. However, these previous works are about the secure disclosure of statistics from a dataset and do not deal with the problem of sanitization of a dataset for publishing.

Some significant impossibility results have been found in previous works. In [10], it is shown that any algorithm which guarantees an absolute query estimation error of 
                        
                           o
                           (
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     , for a dataset size of N, for more than 
                        
                           Ω
                           (
                           N
                           
                              
                                 log
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           N
                           )
                        
                      queries will not guarantee privacy. In [21], it is shown that utility is impossible for privacy preservation if the attacker’s prior knowledge is above a certain threshold, where the prior knowledge is based on the prior probability of a certain tuple in the dataset. Both impossibility results assume uniform utility requirements for all queries and hence they do not contradict our result for non-uniform utilities.

Randomization technique has been used in previous works in privacy preservation, such as [2,4]. The usefulness of such a technique is verified in [3], where the randomized data is shown to have similar utility as the original dataset for classification.

Cormode et al. [8] suggested the notion of empirical privacy. In this work, privacy is defined to be the fraction of tuples for which one can predict the correct SA value from the published data. In the attack model, a classifier is built to determine the empirical privacy. A comparison of syntactic anonymity and differential privacy is given in [6], with the conclusion that both methodologies have their pros and cons, each holding its value. Other studies consider combining the strengths of the two methodologies. It is found that t-closeness can yield 
                        
                           ∊
                        
                     -differential privacy when 
                        
                           t
                           =
                           exp
                           (
                           ∊
                           )
                        
                      in [23], and k-anonymity can improve the utility of anonymized data released by differential privacy techniques [24].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

While the results in [7] raise an alarm on the existing sanitization models, our finding shows the possibility that existing methods may have covered the needed ground of privacy, and the uncovered ground is not meant to be covered but instead is meant for data utility, which is the goal of privacy preserving data publishing. We introduce the model of SPLU which advocates the support of utility for large sum querying and the guarantee of privacy protection by introducing high inaccuracy for small sum querying. We propose a data sanitization mechanism, called SPLU-Gen, based on randomized perturbation on the sensitive values of the given dataset. We show that SPLU-Gen satisfies the requirements of the SPLU model. Our empirical studies on two real datasets show desirable performance of our method. For future work, it will be interesting to examine other existing privacy preserving mechanisms to consider how they can be extended to support the paradigm of SPLU.
