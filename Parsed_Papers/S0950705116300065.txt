                  Trust and reputation systems are vital in large open distributed electronic commerce environments. Although existing various mechanisms have been adopted to guarantee trust between customers and sellers (or platforms), self-interested agents often impose various attacks to trust and reputation systems. As these attacks are usually deceptive, collusive, or strategic, it is difficult to keep trust and reputation systems robust to multifarious attacks. Many defense strategies employ a robust trust network (such as a trustable advisor list) for protecting buyers. However, in the evolution of a trust network, existing strategies consider only historical ratings of given buyers and advisors, while neglecting the timeliness of these ratings. Besides, only a single trust network is utilized to evaluate all sellers, leading to problems such as lack of pertinence and quite large deviation of evaluation. This paper proposes a novel pre-evolutionary advisor generation strategy, which first pre-evolves an optimal advisor list for each candidate seller before each trade and then evaluate each seller according to its corresponding list. After evaluating and selecting the seller, the buyer's own advisor list is evolved based on the pre-evolved optimal advisor list of chosen seller. Two sets of experiments have been designed to verify the general performance of this strategy, including accuracy, robustness, and stability. Results show that our strategy outperforms existing ones, especially when attackers use popular attack strategies such as Sybil, Sybil and Camouflage, and Sybil and Whitewashing. Besides, our strategy is more stable than compared ones, and its robustness will not change with the ratio of dishonest buyers.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Trust has attracted widely attention in the fields such as sociology, psychology, economics, and computer science. Although these disciplines have different definitions and research emphasizes, it is widely agreed that trust means the confidence that one or many entities behave as they expected [1]. According to the source of trust, it can be divided into direct trust and referral trust. The former kind of trust comes from one's own experience, while the latter is calculated according to recommenders’ reviews. If a given pair of trustor and trustee have interacted for many times, the trustor's trust about the trustee may rely much on its direct trust accumulated according to their interaction experience. Otherwise, the trustor may refer to the referral trust recommended by its advisors.

Trust plays a vital role in open, large, distributed, and dynamic multi-agent systems where self-interested agents may be deceptive and strategic. For example, in multi-agent based e-marketplaces, dishonest selling agents often employ “ballot stuffing” reviewers providing unfairly high ratings to promote the seller's reputation [2], which may result in the quality of the delivered products not as good as the buyers’ expectations. In such cases, the buyers will be disappointed or even annoyed, and they will feel risky of subsequent transactions with that seller. Thus, the buyers will distrust these sellers or even distrust the electronic commerce platform after several times of unsatisfactory transactions. Therefore, reputation systems are designed for buyers to model the trustworthiness of sellers based on ratings shared by other buyers (called advisors in this paper) and make decisions on which sellers to transact with.

However, unfair rating attacks (such as the collusive unfair ratings, Sybil, Camouflage, Whitewashing, and discrimination attacks) from dishonest advisors render reputation systems’ vulnerable to mislead buyers to transact with dishonest sellers [3, 4]. Dishonest advisors may also employ sophisticated attack strategies to avoid being detected or defended. For example, Luca and Zervas [5] show that appropriately 16% of Yelp restaurant reviews are fraudulent thought Yelp adopts an authentication algorithm to filter out suspicious reviews. Besides, scalping is prevalent on the Taobao platform, which has even led American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) to submit its worry to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [6].

As further explained in the next section of literature review, existing defending strategies either has limitations in defending some strategic attacks or neglect timeliness of advisor's ratings. To address such problems, we design a new robust algorithm for improving intelligent agents’ capabilities in defending various types of attacks, accurately estimating the trustworthiness of sellers and reducing the risk of purchase. An overview of our approach is highlighted as follows. Before making a decision in selecting which recommended seller as trading partner, the buyer agent should first pre-evolve an optimal advisor list for each recommended seller as well as the trustworthiness of all member of each list (see Algorithm 1). In this process, not only the ratings given by the buyer agent and its advisors are considered, those rated by the recommended seller's recent reviewers are also taken into consideration. Based on the optimal advisor list for each recommended seller, the buyer agent can then evaluate the trustworthiness of the corresponding sellers (see Algorithm 2
                     ). According to the evaluation results, the buyer agent will select one recommended seller as trading partner. Finally, the advisor list of the buyer is evolved based on the pre-evolved optimal advisor list of chosen seller (see Algorithm 3
                     ).

In contrast to existing advisor list generation algorithm, the novel features of this algorithm are as follows. First, the evolution algorithm aims at pre-computing an optimal advisor list for each seller, in which includes the buyers that our buyer agent should consult in evaluating the trustworthiness of the seller. If h sellers are recommended by the search agent, we will get h optimal customized advisor lists. Therefore, the efficiency of this algorithm is O(hG), where h is the number of sellers that are considered in recommendation list, G is the generation that evolution process should be proceeded. This algorithm is inevitably h times that of the strategy of Jiang et al. 
                     [7], as their strategy only include one G-generation of evolution process. Secondly, in the computation of optimal advisor list, the involved advisors come from two sources: (i) the buyer's own witness list; (ii) the seller's recent reviewers. As different sellers have different recent reviewers, the resultant optimal advisor list for the recommended sellers are updated in a timely manner, as improved over the strategy of Jiang et al. 
                     [7]. Thirdly, the computation of optimal advisor list is only a pre-calculation process before selecting trading partner. In that process, the buyer agent's advisor list is not evolved, as opposed to the strategy of Jiang et al. 
                     [7], but is postponed after the seller is chosen, and therefore evolving the buyer's advisor list according to its recent trading experience.

The rest of our paper is developed as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 gives a framework for electronic commerce platform with advisor mechanism. Section 4 illustrates the pre-evolutionary advisor lists generation strategy given in this paper, which is composed of three algorithms, i.e., the optimal advisor lists pre-evolution algorithm, the seller evaluation and chosen algorithm, and the buyer's advisor list evolution algorithm. Section 5 demonstrates the merits of our approach with the experimental settings and results. Section 6 concludes this paper with our future work directions.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Trust problem has attracted wide attention from electronic commerce and social network related academic community and industry field for many years. The aim of this section is to review the modeling of trust, including techniques for detecting and defending against malicious agents. Since our work is based on a buyer's view, not the electronic platform's view, we only review approaches designed from buyers’ viewpoint. In general, the defense models can be generally divided into three categories, i.e., filtering approaches, discounting approaches, and evolutionary approach. Following paragraphs illustrate these models in detail.

As early as 2000, Dellarocas [2] presented a cluster filtering model to reduce the effect of unfairly high ratings and positive discrimination. He first used collaborative filtering techniques to identify the nearest neighbor set N of given buyer B based on their similarity with B on commonly rated sellers. As colluders might have taken collaborative filtering into account and cleverly picked buyers with tastes similar to those of B in everything else except their ratings, hence, the resulting set N will include some fair raters and some unfair raters. To filter the unfair rater cluster N
                           u
                         and the fair rater cluster N
                           l
                         from the buyer's neighbor set N, Dellarocas used the cluster filtering method proposed by Macnaughton-Smith et al. 
                        [8]. Furthermore, to deal with the scenarios that sellers may vary their service quality over time (e.g., improving it, deteriorating it, or even oscillating between phases of improvement and phases of deterioration) and to counter attempts to inflate a seller's reputation using unfair ratings flooding, Dellarocas enhanced the cluster filtering algorithm by considering the values of buyers’ ratings and the frequency of ratings as well. Although these algorithms can filter out the unfairly high ratings very well, they cannot handle unfairly low ratings.

Liu et al. 
                        [9, 10] propose an iClub clustering algorithm, which applies clustering to divide buyers into different `clubs’ according to the similarity between the buyer and the witness (a witness represents the buyer agent who has common trading partners with buyer B, who may be an honest or a dishonest reviewer) of the buyer. If the transaction volume between the buyer and the given seller is smaller than a threshold, the `global’ cluster process will be triggered. Otherwise, only local information is considered in the generation of clusters. In the local-based cluster process, to find the honest reviewer about a given seller, the iClub approach first collects local information about this seller and normalizes the ratings, and then applies a density-based clustering routine DBSCAN [11] to get various clusters. The buyers whose ratings are included in the same cluster with the buyer agent's rating are regarded as honest ones. The global-based cluster process makes use of the buyer's experience with sellers in the reputation system to find a set of advisors who are honest regarding those sellers, and then uses this information to find honest advisors regarding the seller who is currently under evaluation. However, when having little evidence about sellers, a buyer relies on the club with the maximum number of advisors. In this scenario, Sybil attackers forming a club with many members will mislead buyers to follow their opinions. Thus, iClub is also vulnerable to Sybil-based attacks, though it is effective in filtering various types of unfair testimonies.

Different from cluster methods, Whitby et al. 
                        [12] present an iterated filtering algorithm BRS, which is improved from the beta reputation system proposed by Jøsang and Ismail [13]. The iterated filtering approach is realized by testing whether an advisor's testimonies are outside of the q quantile (lower bound) or 1−q quantile (upper bound) of the majority testimonies. If so, the testimonies are considered as unfair and discarded. The iteratively filtering approach is based on the ``majority-rule”; therefore, it is only effective when the significant majority of ratings are fair. However, this rule causes BRS vulnerable to Sybil-based attacks because honest buyers’ (as the minority) ratings will be incorrectly filtered out.

Different from filtering approaches that focus on filtering or classifying reviewers into honest ones and dishonest ones according to cluster method [8, 11] or beta reputation theory [13], the PEALGA algorithm proposed in this paper aims at pre-evolving an trustable advisor list from reviewers of given seller and evaluating this seller's reputation according to advisors’ ratings rather than reviewers’ ratings.

Different from cluster methods and filtering methods which focus on finding out the honest/dishonest buyers, the discounting approaches first evaluate a target seller by the prediction of the reviewers’ trustworthiness and then discount the ratings from these reviewers by the trustworthiness. The only difference among existing discounting approaches [14–17] is that they designed different methods for advisors’ trustworthiness calculation. Following paragraphs illustrates these methods in detail.

Yu and Singh [14, 15] proposed a Referralchains strategy, which involves a novel application of the well-known weighted majority technique to trustworthiness beliefs and their aggregation. For predicting the trustworthiness of an advisor (the reviewer whose ratings are considered and compared by the buyer in its decision of trading partner), they constructed a trust network according to following steps. The buyer agent first judge whether it is acquainted with the target seller. If yes, it will evaluate the seller's trustworthiness based on local belief. Otherwise, it will query its neighbors (the buyers who are trusted by this buyer agent) about whether they are acquainted with the target seller. If yes, the buyer agent will aggregate the neighbors’ local beliefs. If not, the buyer agent will query their neighbors’ neighbors. This kind of query will be continued until the depth of the referral chains reaches a cutoff limit. According to this algorithm, the initial weights (i.e., trustworthiness values) of advisors are set to one. That value propagates through advisors’ trust network by a weighted majority algorithm. If an advisor's ratings deviate from the buyer's direct experience, the trustworthiness of this advisor will be decreased until zero. However, this setting of initial trustworthiness of one provides an opportunity for Whitewashing attackers to abuse their initial trustworthiness values.

Similarly, Teacy et al. 
                        [16] gave a Travos algorithm that integrates trustworthiness and confidence to evaluate an advisor. Based on a Bayesian view, the trustworthiness is calculated using the expected value of the intrinsic probability that the seller will fulfill its obligations during an interaction with the buyer. Confidence is a metric that represents the accuracy of the trustworthiness calculated by an agent given the number of observations (the evidence) it uses in the trustworthiness calculation. Intuitively, more evidence results in a higher confidence. In calculation of a seller's trustworthiness, a buyer agent will first try to calculate the initial trustworthiness and initial confidence of the seller according to its first-hand information (i.e., direct interaction history). If the buyer has an enough large confidence (a threshold) about the trustworthiness, the initial trustworthiness is regarded as the final trustworthiness of the seller. Otherwise, the buyer will request other advisors’ evaluations (named reputation) about this seller. The calculation process of advisors’ reputation includes two steps. First, calculate confidence of the reputation information offered by advisors. Secondly, discount the reputation and integrate it into the initial beta distribution to get the final trustworthiness of the seller. Several times of interactions later, an agent can learn how to identify whether an advisor is dependable. However, in some cases, such trustworthiness weighted method cannot punish dishonest advisors to a large extent when a buyer has insufficient experience with the sellers which the advisors have encountered in the past. In addition, Travos assumes that an advisor's behaviors are consistent, making it vulnerable to Camouflage attacks.

Zhang and Cohen [17] proposed a Personalized strategy, in which, the trustworthiness of advisors as well as the trustworthiness of sellers are calculated based on both private and public trust aspects. This Personalized strategy is divided into three steps: (i) the buyer agent constructs a social network to find the candidate advisor list, (ii) models trustworthiness of advisors by combining advisor's private reputation with advisor's public reputation, and (iii) models trustworthiness of sellers by combining seller's private reputation with seller's public reputation. The calculation principle of private and public reputation of advisors is also based on the Beta reputation system proposed by Jøsang and Ismail [13], which is similar to the ideas of Whitby et al. 
                        [12] and Teacy et al. 
                        [16]. The private trustworthiness and the public trustworthiness of advisors are assigned different weights to gain the trustworthiness of advisors. The weights are determined by the reliability of the estimated private trustworthiness value. If the total number of all rating pairs (i.e., the rating pairs the buyer rate the given seller and the rating pairs that the buyer's advisors rate the given seller) is larger than or equal to a threshold N
                        min, the buyer will be confident about the private trustworthiness value estimated based on its ratings and the advisor's ratings for all commonly rated sellers. Otherwise, there are not enough rating pairs, the buyer is not confident enough about the private trustworthiness value, and it will then also consider public trustworthiness. Different from the calculation method of advisors’ trustworthiness, the private trustworthiness and the public trustworthiness of a given seller can be estimated through the beta family of probability density functions. According to similar integration principle of advisor's trustworthiness, the private and public trustworthiness of a seller is weighted to gain the final reputation of the seller. This approach is comprehensive to defense many attacks. However, the private part is vulnerable to Whitewashing attacks under which a buyer does not have many commonly rated sellers. Neither can the public part work well when the majority advisors are dishonest (Sybil attacks). Thus, this approach is vulnerable to the both Sybil and Whitewashing attacks.

Similar to these discounting approaches, the PEALGA algorithm proposed in this paper focus on constructing a trust network (which is not arranged as network but as optimal advisor list), calculating the trustworthiness of the members in the trust network, and calculating the trustworthiness of sellers based on the trustworthiness discounted advisors’ ratings. Further, the trust network in this paper is pre-evolved based on the buyer's own advisor list and the seller's recent reviewers. Most importantly, different recommended sellers correspond to different trust network. However, in above literatures, only one trust network is generated to evaluate all recommended sellers.

Jiang et al. 
                        [7] proposed an evolutionary algorithm called MET. In fact, this algorithm is also a discounting algorithm. The main difference between MET and above illustrated discounting methods is that this algorithm focuses on how to evolve a trust network after each transaction. Once getting the trust network, the estimation of sellers’ trustworthiness are realized by discounting the ratings of advisors who belong to the trust network by the trustworthiness of them. In the evolution of a trust network, the social network structure which is similar to Yu and Singh [14, 15] is used to evolve the witnesses of the buyer and their trustworthiness. The candidate trust network whose fitness is smaller than the last generation can be survived in the next round of evolution. According to the experimental results of Jiang et al. 
                        [7], this algorithm is effective in defending various attacks, especially Whitewashing, Camouflage, and Sybil and Camouflage. However, this algorithm still has some limitations. First, in the evolution of candidate trust network, the timeliness of these advisors’ ratings is neglected, i.e., the ratings of transactions performed very long ago is not up to date and therefore should have a lower reference value. Secondly, only one trust network is generated, no matter there is how many candidate sellers. However, the only evolved trust network is not necessarily suitable enough for estimating the trustworthiness of all the sellers. That is because the advisors are evolved based on buyer B's experience and its social network. If there are less intersection between a seller's trading partners and B's social network and B (i.e., buyer B and most of B's advisors have limit transaction experience with this seller), the trustworthiness of this seller that is calculated according to this trust network may deviate from its real one greatly.

Jiang et al's. [7] 
                        MET algorithm is the most similar one to the PEALGA algorithm given in this paper. However, there still some important differences. First, MET algorithm aims at learning a trustable advisor list according to a buyer's own experience. Therefore, the advisor list is evolved after each purchase experience. In contrast, the PEALGA algorithm is a pre-calculation process before bargaining, which aims at finding the optimal advisor lists to evaluate given sellers. Secondly, in MET algorithm, only one advisor list is evolved according to a buyer's lifecycle. In contrast, in PEALGA algorithm, an optimal advisor list is just pre-evolved for evaluating a given seller. Therefore, the optimal advisor list varies with sellers. However, the buyer's own advisor list does not change in the pre-evolution process. Thirdly, the selection source of trustable advisors (i.e., members in advisor list) in MET algorithm is buyer B's witness list. However, in PEALGA algorithm, the trustable advisors are randomly selected from buyer B's witness list and recent buyers who rate given seller.

To realize the aim of generating trustable advisors list discussed in the previous section, we propose a framework in this section. In our framework, there are three kinds of agents in the whole market mechanism, i.e., the buyer agents, seller agents, and search agents. Seller agents may collusively employ or generate some buyer agents to improve their reputations or decrease their competitors’ reputations [2]. These generated buyer agents are intelligent and can adopt pure strategies such as alwaysUnfair, Sybil, Camouflage, Whitewashing, or mixed strategies of them to archive the aim of improving its own sellers’ reputations or decrease reputations of competitors. The function of search agents is to help buyers select some sellers who can satisfy their purchase demand, and simultaneously list each seller's reviewers and reviews in reverse chronological order (see the right box of Fig. 1
                     ). Besides, for the interests of all the sellers in the electronic market, search agents should also take some strategies for balancing the recommended ratings of each seller. Therefore, search agents may recommend sellers by comprehensively considering many factors such as price, quality, sales volume, coverage, diversity, popularity, and so on. Even though trustworthiness can be evaluated by search agents, however, the recommendation results may not be directly suitable for special individuals. Therefore, to evaluate sellers by its own viewpoint, the buyer should maintain a memory (see the left dotted box of Fig. 1), which include a list of historical counterparties (i.e., sellers who trade with the buyer, denoted as 
                        
                           S
                           B
                           H
                        
                     ), a list of advisors (denoted as 
                        
                           T
                           B
                           0
                        
                     ), and its satisfaction about the advisors list (denoted as 
                        
                           f
                           B
                           0
                        
                     ). The advisor list, buyer's satisfaction about advisor list, and corresponding initializing algorithm, updating algorithm, and application method compose an advisor mechanism. The framework of electronic commerce platform with advisor mechanism is shown in Fig. 1. The meanings of concepts such as advisors, advisors list, witness, and symbols used in this framework are summarized in Table 1.
                     
                  

In the electronic commerce platform with advisor mechanism, the reputation defense strategies should be designed under following assumptions to overcome the problems discussed in the previous section.

                        
                           
                              
                                 Assumption 1
                              . Buyer agents pay more attention to the ratings that are given by the advisors who have similar opinions to their own. Some inexperience buyer agents often need to consider other buyer agents’ advices. Similar to the experience of humans, buyer agents are more incline to refer to the advisors who have similar opinions and believe that agents who often give positive/negative ratings belong to similar category.


                              
                                 Assumption 2
                              . Buyer agents’ acceptance toward other reviewers’ ratings decrease over time. The more recent the rating time, the more accurate the rating can reflect current trustworthiness of the seller and the more significance it is to the seller's reputation calculation.


                              
                                 Assumption 3
                              . Buyer agents have different approval degree toward their direct transaction experience and the advisors’ ratings. Since different buyers have different experiences, in the process of selecting sellers, buyers may have different weight to their own experience and other reviewers’ opinions. For example, for new buyers or inexperienced buyers, they may pay more attention to other reviewers’ opinions because they do not have enough own experience for evaluation. However, for experienced buyers, their selection of sellers may rely more on their own experience as they have already transacted with the sellers many times.


                              
                                 Assumption 4
                              . In this paper we assume the buyer agents are not competitive in general and are willing to share their advisor list with others. This is quite common in major e-marketplaces and travel agent portals.


                              
                                 Assumption 5.
                               In experiments, the simulated electronic commerce platform with advisor list mechanism is treated as in a B2B mode, in which transactions between a pair of seller and buyer is expected to repeat for many times because they often have long term cooperation relations. All the strategies listed in this paper are designed and compared under B2B electronic commerce mode.


                              
                                 Assumption 6.
                               We rule out the influence of various prices in the selection of trading seller in this study as we concentrate on the effect of trustworthiness computation.

Under above framework and assumptions, any buyer agent who adopts a defense strategy should complete following common steps before purchase.

                        
                           (1)
                           Evaluate the trustworthiness of the reviewers who rated the recommended sellers according to the buyer's own ratings or experiences, and generate a most trustworthy list of reviewers as advisors for the buyer agent.

Evaluate each seller's trustworthiness according to buyer's own experience and advisors’ ratings.
                           

Select a suitable seller as trading counterpart based on their trustworthiness.

Different defense strategies have different methods in realizing above steps. Section 4 illustrates the strategy given in this paper for complete these steps.

As there are many sellers who satisfy the buyer agents’ requirement, only one fixed advisor list may not be suitable for evaluating all of the recommended sellers’ trustworthiness. Therefore, to find a more suitable advisor list for the buyer agent, we apply the evolution method to search for an optimal advisor list for evaluating every recommended seller. Based on the optimal advisor lists, we can evaluate and select a seller as counterpart and evolve the buyer's own advisor list. Therefore, every time when recommended sellers are shortlisted, the buyer agents who adopt the pre-evolutionary advisor lists generation strategy will implement following steps. The following sub-sections illustrate the core implementation steps in detail.

Evaluates each seller's trustworthiness according to its own experience and advisors’ ratings, and then select a suitable seller as trading counterpart based on their trustworthiness.

Evolve the buyer agent's advisor list according to the optimal advisor list of chosen seller.

Based on the witnesses list constructed according to Yu and Singh [14], we can evolve an optimal advisor lists for the buyer to evaluate each recommended sellers. The main idea of the evolution algorithm (see Algorithm 1) is as follows: (1) initialize each optimal advisor list with buyer B's own advisor list, and then initialize the corresponding witnesses with the buyer's own witnesses (see step (3) in Algorithm 1); (2) evolve the trustworthiness of witnesses using the differential evolution method based on B's current advisor list

If so, update the old optimal advisor list Tbi

As reputation, i.e., combining different views of trustworthiness [18], is the most important factor considered in this paper, the seller who has the highest reputation are selected. The steps of this algorithm are given in Algorithm 2 (also called SRCA). The main idea of this algorithm is as follows: (1) Buyer B first calculates each seller's private trustworthiness according to B's trading experience between this seller (see step (2)-(4) in Algorithm 2). (2) Buyer B calculates each seller's public reputation according to the optimal advisor lists obtained from Algorithm 1 (see step (5) in Algorithm 2). (3) Combined the private trustworthiness and the public reputation to get the perceived reputation of each seller (see step (6) in Algorithm 2).

To facilitate the analysis of various defense strategies, Jiang et al. 
                        [7] simulate a market with many ordinary sellers and two duopoly sellers in the experiment. One of them is an honest seller, while the other is a dishonest one. The setting of duopoly sellers is to evaluate the difference of honest and dishonest seller's performance. The setting of ordinary sellers is to simulate the effect of randomly selected noisy sellers on the duopoly honest and dishonest sellers. For further comparing with the strategy given by Jiang et al. 
                        [7], we choose a similar market setting and trading seller selection method. The main idea of trading seller selection is as follows. First, set a ratio (denoted as Ratio) for selecting between the duopoly sellers. Secondly, if the two duopoly sellers’ trustworthiness equal to each other, randomly select one of them as a counterpart. Otherwise, choose the one with higher trustworthiness. Thirdly, randomly select an ordinary seller as counterpart based on the ratio: 1- Ratio.

As the evolution of optimal advisor list for each seller is only to generate the most trustworthy advisors that the buyer can refer to in the evaluation of the corresponding seller, the buyer's own advisor list is not evolved in this process. To improve the instructiveness of advisors’ ratings and satisfaction of advisor list, the buyer's advisor list should be evolved according to its purchase experience. Algorithm 3 presents an evolution process, which includes two key steps. First, rank 
                           
                              W
                              B
                              0
                           
                         in descending order according to their trustworthiness (step (1)). Secondly, select the top m number of witnesses, take these witnesses as trustworthy advisors of buyer B, and store in 
                           
                              T
                              B
                              0
                           
                        (step (2)). In this algorithm, the optimal advisor list of the chosen seller is used to evolve buyer B's advisor list because the chosen seller is the partner of buyer B's recent trading experience and advisors in the optimal advisor list are the most trustable ones due to recency. The advantage of this evolution method is that it considers the timeliness of experience (or ratings) as well as the fact that the optimal advisor list is pre-evolved based on buyer B's advisor list. The computation time of Algorithm 3 mainly depends on the ranking process. Traditional quicksort algorithm is used in this paper, therefore the time complexity of Algorithm 3 is O(

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

To verify the performance of the advisor list generation algorithm given in this paper, we design two set of experiments. In the first set of experiments, six kinds of attacks such as AlwaysUnfair, Camouflage, Sybil, Whitewashing, Sybil-Camouflage, and Sybil-Whitewashing are selected to attack the reputation mechanism. AlwaysUnfair attacker always calls white black, i.e., it always give high reputation to dishonest seller while rate low to the honest seller. Camouflage attackers intermittently tell the truth or call white black. In experiments of this paper, each Camouflage attacker will rate honestly in the first 20 days, while giving unfair ratings to both the duopoly dishonest and honest seller in following days. Similar to AlwaysUnfair attacker, buyers who adopt Sybil attack always calls white black. Different from AlwaysUnfair attack, the number of dishonest buyers in Sybil is greatly larger than the one in AlwaysUnfair attack. The buyers who use the Whitewashing attack strategy always whiten their low reputation by recreating a new account. In experiments, the Whitewashing attackers provide an unfair rating each day and then recreate a new account in later day to whitewash their sham action.

Three defending strategies such as naive strategy, the random strategy, and the oracle strategy are designed as baselines. Naive strategy means that the buyers who adopt this strategy believe all raters are good and their ratings are true. Random strategy specifies that each buyer who adopts this strategy randomly believe each rating rated by other raters is true or false. Oracle strategy assumes that the buyers are omniscient, therefore, they always know each seller's real reputation. Moreover, four typical strategies presented by Zhang et al. (2011) (abbr. Personalized), Jiang et al. 
                     [7] (abbr. MET), Liu et al. 
                     [9, 10] (abbr. iClub) and Teacy et al. 
                     [16] (abbr. Travos) are selected as benchmarks. To identify these strategies easily we identify these comparing strategies using their abbreviated names. The strategies proposed by Zhang et al. (2011) and Jiang et al. 
                     [7] are selected because they are closely related to the algorithm given in this paper. The strategies of Liu et al. 
                     [9, 10] and Teacy et al. 
                     [16] are selected because they are recent filtering approach and discounting approach about defensing various attacks. Moreover, those authors have demonstrated that their algorithms can outperform the defending algorithms which are proposed before them. In the first set of experiments, the ratio of dishonest buyers is 30%. To further verify the stability of each defending strategies, we design the second set of experiments, in which, the ratio of dishonest buyers is extended to 12.5%, 22.2%, 30%, 41.7%, 50% respectively. A defending strategy is stable when its anti-attack ability does not change with the ratio of dishonest buyer.

To compare the experimental results, we choose similar criteria given in Jiang et al. 
                        [7] to evaluate the performance of each strategy. One criterion is robustness, which is used to evaluate the feasibility (i.e., anti-attack ability) of each defense strategy from macroscopic scale. Formula (15) defines the function of robustness. According to this formula, the value of robustness range from –1 to 1. The larger the value of robustness is, the better the anti-attack ability.

The other evaluative criterion is MAE (mean absolute error), which is used to evaluate the reputation estimation accuracy of each defense strategy from a microscopic scale. Formula (16) defines the calculation function of MAE. The smaller the MAE, the accuracy the defense strategy's prediction is, and therefore the better the defense strategy is.

To facilitate the analysis of various defense strategies, Jiang et al. 
                        [7] simulated a market with 99 dishonest common sellers, 99 honest ordinary sellers, and two duopoly sellers. For further comparing with the strategy given by Jiang et al. 
                        [7], in the first set of experiments, we choose a similar market setting and re-list the setting of their experiment parameters in Table 2
                        . According to this table, in the absence of Sybil attack, there are 12 dishonest buyers and 28 honest buyers in the market. Under Sybil attack, the dishonest buyers and honest buyers are 28 and 12 respectively. In the second set of experiments, we change the number of dishonest buyers to 4, 8, 12, 20, and 28 in the absence of Sybil attack (see Table 3
                        ). Similar to the first set of experiments, under Sybil attack, the number of dishonest buyer and honest buyer should also be exchanged.

All the honest buyers, no matter what defense strategy is adopted, select sellers according the seller selection algorithm described in Section 4.2. Besides, totally 100 days of transactions are simulated. In each day, every buyer has a transaction with a counterpart. Their ratings to sellers are distributed between 0 and 1. It also should be noted that, as recommendation algorithm design is not topic of this paper, the recommendation seller list recommended by search agent is randomly generated in experiments. Once a recommendation advisor list is generated, all the strategies can use it. Besides, the settings of parameters in the compared strategies are listed in Table 4.

In the first set of experiments, the experimental results about the robustness of compared strategies are listed in Table 5
                           . The number before ``±” represents the mean value of robustness. The number after ``±” is the mean square deviation. According to each column of this table, we can see that our PEALGA strategy achieves the best result or nearly the best result upon all different pure or combined attack scenarios, while other strategies score poorly upon one or more scenarios. That is because PEALGA can almost always reach the highest transactions difference between duopoly honest seller and duopoly dishonest seller (i.e.,

                           , which varies in the calculation of robustness) no matter what attacks are (see Fig. 2
                           ). Especially, PEALGA has the best performance at defensing Sybil and Sybil & whitewashing attacks. Although it cannot reach the highest transactions difference under Sybil & Camouflage attack, the difference in PEALGA’s performance with other strategies such as iClub, Personalized, and MET (see Fig. 2 (e)) are insignificant. The high performances in transaction difference are further leaded by the fact that PEALGA can accurately predict duopoly sellers’ reputations and accurately choose the honest duopoly seller as transaction partner. In the following paragraphs, we explain the results in Table 5 and analyze the reasons in detail. From the second row of Table 5, we can see that naïve strategy act well in defensing alwaysUnfair, Camouflage, and Whitewashing attack, while bad in defensing the ones contain Sybil attack. From the third row of Table 5, we can see that the robustness of random strategy always lies around zero. That is because its specification about random belief of other raters’ rating is true or false directly resulting in reputations of duopoly honest and dishonest seller distribute around 0.5 (see Figs. 3–8
                           
                           
                           
                           
                           
                           ) and further leading to nearly equal probability of choosing duopoly honest and dishonest seller. Therefore, the transaction difference

                            is around zero under all cases of attack (see Fig. 2). Besides, as oracle defenders know the real reputation of each seller, they can always choose a common honest seller or a duopoly honest seller as trading partner. Therefore, the robustness of oracle strategy is always round 1 no matter under which attack, which can be seen from the fourth row of Table 5. It should be noted that mean square deviations of oracle strategy are larger than zero is led by the setting of ordinary sellers, which formed noisy in selection of duopoly sellers. From above analysis, we can take the results of these three strategies as baselines in following analysis of other benchmark strategies.


                           Fig. 2 explains why strategies such as PEALGA, MET, Personalized, iClub, Travos are more robust than naïve. We can see that transaction difference between duopoly honest and dishonest seller of random strategy distribute around zero. The curve of the naive strategy deviates from other strategies such as PEALGA, MET, Personalized, iClub, Travos, and oracle. Oracle can always reach the highest transaction difference. Therefore, oracle can be regarded as an upper limit curve, while naïve and random curves the lower limit ones. The nearer a curve to oracle, the more robust the corresponding strategy is. For example, from the second column of Table 5, we can see that all the strategies expect for random strategy are good at defending alwaysUnfair attack. Though naïve strategy achieves the lowest one, the value is still as high as 0.89±0.03. Expect for Travos, all other benchmark strategies can 99% defending the alwaysUnfair attack, which is almost equal to the oracle strategy. These results can be explained according to Fig. 2(a).

The results of Fig. 2 can be further explained by the reputation estimation accuracy of each defense strategy we gained from the first set of experiments. Figs. 3–8 illustrate the estimation accuracy of these strategies under various attacks. In these figures, the horizontal axis represents the 100 days of trading, while the vertical axis is the averaged estimated reputation of duopoly sellers when the honest buyer agents adopt various defending strategies. From these figures, we can see that random strategy's estimated reputations of dishonest and honest duopoly seller always distribute around 0.5. Therefore, these two curves of random strategy can be regarded as baselines respectively. If a strategy's prediction curve of dishonest/honest seller is above/below the corresponding random curve, we can say that this strategy's prediction is inaccurate. Besides, as oracle can always accurately estimate any seller's reputation, the closer a curve of given strategy to the oracle curve, the more accurate this strategy's estimation. As naïve strategy assumes the defender trust all others’ ratings, it can be regarded as the worst baseline.

                                 Accuracy analysis under pure strategy attacks.


                           Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show that under alwaysUnfair attack, Travos cannot accurately estimate the reputation of dishonest duopoly seller (see Fig. 3 (a), in which the real reputation of dishonest seller is 0, while the estimated one is about 0.9) and that of the honest duopoly seller (see Fig. 3 (b), in which the real reputation of honest seller is 1, while estimated value ranges from 0.65 to 0.95) at the same time. Personalized is not good at estimating the reputation of dishonest seller (about 0.43) while it performs well in estimating the honest seller's reputation. In estimating honest seller's reputation, iClub is worse than Personalized because it is above naïve curve (see Fig. 3 (a)). Further, we can see that iClub’s estimation (about 0.9) of the reputation of dishonest duopoly seller deviates from the real value (i.e., 0) greatly after 17 days (see Fig. 3 (a)). However, it can estimate the reputation of the honest duopoly seller very well (see Fig. 3 (b)). In contrast, MET and PEALGA can accurately estimate the trustworthiness of the honest and dishonest sellers simultaneously under alwaysUnfair attack. PEALGA curves are almost the nearest one to the baseline strategy oracle both when estimating dishonest or honest seller's reputation. Besides, it evolves to their real reputation quicker than MET. Therefore, we can conclude PEALGA outperform other strategies in estimating seller's reputation.

From the third column of Table 5, we can also see that Travos cannot deal with Camouflage attack very well (i.e., 0.83), while other strategies such as naïve, iClub, MET, Personalized, and PEALGA are equally at defending Camouflage attack (i.e., 0.98 or 0.99). Fig. 2 (b) explains the reason according to transaction difference, in which Travos achieves lowest transaction difference. Fig. 4 further illustrates the reason according to estimated reputation of duopoly sellers. According to the curves in Fig. 4 (a), there are waves round the 20–23th day. That is due to the Camouflage attack simulation principle. In the first 20 days of Camouflage attack simulation, dishonest buyers choose ordinary sellers as trading partner and give fair ratings to them. After 20 days of pretending to be an honest rater, the dishonest buyer will randomly select trading partner from all the sellers, ordinary ones, duopoly dishonest one, or duopoly honest one. Moreover, they will give fair ratings to ordinary sellers, while giving unfair high rating to both the duopoly dishonest and honest seller. iClub, Personalized, and Travos strategies are not good at dealing with this kind of behavior change of buyers, and therefore their estimation of the dishonest seller's reputation will rise to a high value and cannot decrease afterwards (see Fig. 4 (a)). Especially, all these four strategies are worse than random strategy because all of them are above the random curve. Besides, the rise of iClub is even higher than naïve, which illustrate that iClub is weaker than naïve in defending Camouflage attack. In contrast, MET and PEALGA can quickly adjust to reflect the real reputation. The wave of PEALGA is much smaller than MET. According to Fig. 4 (b), all the other benchmark strategies excepting for Travos (which is even worse than naive) are good at predicting honest sellers’ reputation. In the curves of MET and PEALGA, there are abruptly low values near the 20–28th days. That is caused by the change of buyers’ behavior from fair rating to Camouflage. However, several days of evolution later, MET and PEALGA recovers their estimated reputations back towards the real one soon. On the other hand, the Personalized strategy cannot recover well after the behavior change.

According to the fourth column of Table 5, iClub is the worst in defending the Whitewashing attack (0.77). Besides, the mean square deviation is very large (0.15). Travos can reach a better result than iClub. However, it is still inferior to MET, Personalized, and PEALGA strategies. Fig. 2 (c) explains the reason according to transaction difference. Similar to the results attained when buyers adopt alwaysUnfair and Camouflage attacks, iClub, Travos, and Personalized strategies’ estimation of dishonest buyers deviates from their real values significantly (see Fig. 5 (a)). Personalized and iClub are even worse than naïve. All of these four strategies are less inaccurate than random in predicting dishonest seller's reputation. In contrast, PEALGA and MET can closely approach the oracle curve (which illustrate the real reputation of dishonest seller). To evolve to the real reputation, 15 days is needed for MET, while only seven days is needed for PEALGA. Similar phenomenon about MET and PEALGA can be observed in Fig. 5(b). Larger deviation is observed when iClub, Personalized, and Travos strategies are used in estimating honest seller's reputations (Fig. 5(b)). Although the robustness of Personalized is as high as 0.98±0.03, its prediction accuracy is low. Therefore, Fig. 5 supplements Table 5. Moreover, the estimated reputations of iClub, naïve, and Travos deviate from the real values much smaller than that under the alwaysUnfair attack and the Camouflage attack (see Figs 3(a), 4(a), and 5(a)). However, Personalized achieve larger deviation in Whitewashing attack (see Figs. 3(a), 4(a), and 5(a)). That means, upon Whitewashing attacks, the estimation of these strategies on dishonest seller is more accurate than those of former two attacks, while the estimation of honest seller is less accurate. Similar phenomenon can be observed in Figs. 3(b), 4(b), and 5(b). According to these figures, we can see that Whitewashing attack is more difficult to defend than alwaysUnfair and Camouflage.

From the fifth column of Table 5, we can see that, excepting for oracle strategy and our PEALGA strategy, all others are not very good at defending Sybil attack. Naïve is the worst one both in Fig. 6 (a) and (b). That means naïve agent makes absolutely inverse judgement under Sybil attack, which leads to the transaction difference between honest sellers and dishonest sellers being negative (See Fig. 2(d)). Except for naïve and random, Travos is the worst one (0.14±0.09). Although MET can reach an acceptable performance out of these four others, the robustness of MET can only reach 0.79 under Sybil attack. In contrast, PEALGA can reach 0.98, which significantly higher than MET and extremely loser to oracle curve. Those results are reached because PEALGA can accurately estimate the reputation of dishonest sellers and honest sellers simultaneously (see Fig. 6 (a) and (b)). The estimation accuracy of MET is low in the beginning 60 days of trading. With the accumulation of trading experience, the buyers adopting MET can estimate quite accurately. Out of expectation, iClub is good at judging the dishonesty of sellers under Sybil attack. However, iClub is still not good at predicting honest duopoly seller's reputation under Sybil attack.

                                 Accuracy analysis under combined strategy attacks.

From the sixth column of Table 4, we can see that PEALGA can outperform other strategies in defensing Sybil&Camouflage attack. MET has similar performance with Personalized and iClub. Further, the transaction difference of Personalized and iClub approach the curve of oracle very well in the beginning 80 days. As time goes by, these two strategies’ deviation become bigger and bigger, which almost overlap with the transaction difference curve of MET. In contrast, PEALGA almost overlap with oracle all these days (see Fig. 2(e)). From Fig. 2(e), it can also be seen that the curve of Travos and naïve are in decreasing trend, which means that they are completely vulnerable to the combination attacks of Sybil and Camouflage. Moreover, the decline rate of Travos is larger than that of naïve, which means that Travos is inferior to naïve (see Fig. 2(e) and Table 5). These characteristics can be further explained by Fig. 7. Similar to the situation in Fig. 4, there are abrupt increase and decrease in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). That is caused by the simulation of Camouflage. After buyers have changed from honest to dishonest, Personalized’s estimation of dishonest seller deviates from its real reputation (i.e., 0) greatly (see Fig. 7 (a)). Plus, this kind of deviation cannot be reduced with the experience of trading. The curve of travos is similar to personalized one. iClub also present similar characteristic in the first 55 days, however, in following days, its curve quickly decrease. Both travos, personalized, and iClub are worse than naïve. Although MET and PEALGA also abruptly change the reputation estimation upon buyers’ behavior change, they can approach the real reputation after several days of trading. Moreover, PEALGA can approximate the real value more quickly (see Fig. 7 (a)). Similar results are also observed when Personalized, MET, and PEALGA are used to estimate the honest duopoly seller's reputation (see Fig. 7(b)). It should be noted that, between the days of 20–40 and 20–54, respectively, deviations of MET and PEALGA are greater than that of Personalized. Such inaccuracy may lead to the lower transaction difference of MET and PEALGA (see Fig. 2(e)) and quite high robustness of personalized (see Table 5).

According to the last column of Table 5, in dealing with Sybil&Whitewashing attacks, PEALGA (0.97) is much better than other strategies. MET is significantly lower than PEALGA. Personalized and Travos are absolutely vulnerable upon the combination attacks of Sybil and whitewashing. From Fig. 2 (f), we can see that the curves of oracle and PEALGA are almost overlapping. The curve of MET is below them, which lead to the inferior of MET. It can also be seen that the curves of naïve, Travos, and Personalized are in decreasing trend, which means that they are completely vulnerable to the combination attacks of Sybil and Whitewashing. Plus, all of them are greatly inferior to random (see 
                           Fig. 2 (f)). The characteristics of Travos and Personalized can also be seen from Fig. 8. From Fig. 8(b), we can see that Personalized, naïve, and travos always falsely classify honest sellers as dishonest ones. Travos can slightly outperform Personalized in estimating honest duopoly seller's reputation, while inferior to Personalized in approximating dishonest duopoly seller's reputation. In contrast, PEALGA can outperform the other four benchmark strategies in identifying honest sellers (see Fig. 8 (b)) and can outperform other benchmark strategies in identifying dishonest sellers except iClub (see Fig. 8 (a)). iClub is expert at identifying dishonest seller, which even outperform the PEALGA strategy presented in this paper (see Fig. 8 (a)), but it is not good at identifying the honest sellers (see Fig. 8 (b)).

The above analyzed reputation estimation accuracy is numerically summarized according to the mean absolute error (MAE) and the variance between real reputation and predicted reputation in Table 6
                            (a) and (b), respectively. As oracle strategy assumes that agent knows each seller's real reputation, agents who are oracle can always gain no difference between real reputation and predicted reputation (i.e., MAE equals to zero). Therefore, oracle can be taken as the lowest (best) baseline. The closer a strategy's MAE to oracle, the more accurate it is. In contrast, as naïve strategy assumes that agents trust all the buyers’ ratings are true, therefore, difference between real reputation and predicted reputation gained by naïve strategy is high (i.e., MAE is very large). Especially, in predicting the reputation of dishonest seller, the MAE is as large as 0.76 in some cases. Therefore, naïve can be taken as the highest (worst) baseline. The closer a strategy's MAE to naive, the more inaccurate it is. Moreover, since random agents randomly believe or disbelieve a buyer's rating, the MAEs that are gained by them are 0.5 both in predicting dishonest sellers and honest sellers (see Table 6). Therefore, random may be regarded as an alternative baseline.

Comparing corresponding columns and rows of Table 6 (a) and (b), we can see that PEALGA can always simultaneously get good results in estimating the reputations of honest sellers and dishonest sellers because the MAE gained by it is very close to the corresponding oracle ones. However, other strategies can only estimating one kind of sellers’ reputation well or can only defense some attacks well. The following paragraphs discuss Table 6 (a) and (b) in detail.

Under alwaysUnfair attack, MET and PEALGA can gain very small value of MAE, which means that they are good at estimating the reputations of honest and dishonest sellers simultaneously. However, under alwaysUnfair attack, Personalized and iClub can only accurately estimate honest seller's reputation (MAE scores 0.02±0.00 and 0.01±0.00, respectively), while inaccurate in estimating dishonest seller's reputation (MAE scores 0.45±0.06 and 0.85±0.20, respectively). In estimating dishonest seller's reputation, iClub is the worst one, which is even worse than naïve. Travos is the worst as a whole because its MAE on estimating dishonest and honest duopoly seller's reputation is quite large simultaneously (0.41±0.03 and 0.17±0.02). Similar results are obtained when these compared strategies are defensing Camouflage attack and Whitewashing attack.

Under the Sybil attack, only PEALGA proposed in this paper can effectively predict dishonest seller's and honest seller's reputation simultaneously (MAE score 0.02±0.01 and 0.02±0.00, respectively). The MAE of MET strategy proposed by Jiang et al. 
                           [7] score 0.10±0.06 and 0.13±0.13, respectively, which is significantly higher than that of PEALGA. Personalized and Travos is much worse than MET. It should be noted that, under Sybil attack, iClub scores very low MAE when estimating dishonest duopoly seller's reputation, though it's MAE in estimating honest duopoly seller's reputation is 0.35±0.16.

Under the combination attacks of Sybil and Camouflage, PEALGA can also score very good MAE, i.e., 0.04±0.01 and 0.04±0.01 in estimating dishonest and honest seller's reputation, respectively. MET’s performance is significantly inferior to PEALGA. Travos is the worst one because it scores very large MAEs in estimating dishonest as well as honest sellers’ reputations, which are even larger than the ones gained by random and naive. On the other hand, Personalized and iClub can do well in estimating honest sellers’ reputations, while get very bad results (i.e., MAE is 0.59±0.08 and 0.70±0.11) in estimating dishonest sellers’ reputations.

Similar to the above attacks, under combination of Sybil and Whitewashing, PEALGA can also simultaneously achieve good results. Except PEALGA, only iClub can accurately estimate dishonest seller's reputation under combined Sybil and Whitewashing attack. Regretfully, iClub’s MAE in estimating honest seller's reputation is as high as 0.34±0.15. All the other three strategies (i.e., MET, Personalized, and Travos) deviate largely from the corresponding MAE of oracle in estimating dishonest and honest sellers.

In the second set of experiments, we verify the stability of each strategy by adjusting the ratio of dishonest buyers in the simulated market. The robustness of the baseline strategies and the defending strategies are presented in Tables 7
                            and 8
                           , respectively. These results are achieved by 50 times repetition of 100 days of trading for ruling out the influence of random.

From Table 7, we can see that the robustness of oracle is stably kept at 1 in all cases. Moreover, the robustness of random stably distributed around 0 in all cases of ratio. However, naïve are affected by ratio of dishonest buyer. Under alwaysUnfair, Camouflage, and Whitewashing attacks, naïve’s robustness decrease with the increase of ratio of dishonest buyer. However, under attacks including Sybil, the robustness of naïve increases with the ratio of dishonest buyers. That is leading by the setting characteristics of the attack strategies. Although in a rising trend, the robustness of naïve under Sybil and Sybil&Whitewashing attacks is still smaller than zero, which means that naïve is absolutely vulnerable to these two kinds of attacks.

The characteristics of naïve also exist in strategies such as travos, personalized, and MET (see Table 8). It should be noted, the robustness of personalized under Sybil&Camouflage attack is quite acceptable even in its lowest value 0.67±0.18 when ratio of dishonest buyer is 12.5%. Similarly, iClub is also good at defending Sybil&Camouflage. Besides, iClub defends all the attacks well when the ratio of dishonest buyer is 12.5%. However, the robustness decrease or increase with the variation of dishonest buyer ratio. Differently, PEALGA is a stable strategy as its robustness range from 0.97 to 1 under all attacks and all listed ratios of dishonest buyer with only one exception (i.e., 0.52±0.28 under Sybil&Camouflage attack when ratio of dishonest buyer is 12.5%). However, the robustness of this exception is still larger than the corresponding values of travos and MET. According to above results, we can conclude that PEALGA outperforms all other benchmark strategies, naïve and oracle strategy in robustness, accuracy, and stability.

In this paper, we develop a new advisor list generation strategy, which is composed of several algorithms including pre-evolution of optimal advisor list for evaluating each seller, evaluation and selection of recommended sellers, and evolution of buyer's own advisor list. In contrast to existing advisor list generation strategy, our strategy has following novel characteristics.

In contrast, the evolution algorithm in this paper (i.e., Algorithm 1) is a pre-calculation process before bargaining, which aims at finding the optimal advisor lists

Therefore, the optimal advisor list varies with sellers and purchase requirements. It should be noted that, in this paper, the advisor list

                               does not change in the differential evolution process of calculating the optimal advisor lists. It is evolved based on the optimal advisor lists after the trading partner is selected, which make

                               always timely evolve according to recent trading experience and recent trading partner's optimal advisor list.

(2)	In pre-evolution process, the advisors are selected according to the buyer's own experience and the ratings of seller's recent reviewers. The selection source of trustable advisors (i.e., members in advisor list) in personalized strategy proposed by Zhang et al. 
                              [17] is all the reviewers in the market. The three advisors A

Two sets of experiments have been carried out to compare the performance of our strategy, existing ones and baseline ones. Experimental results show that the advisor list generation algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms existing related algorithms in defensing various attacks such as AlwaysUnfair, Camouflage, Sybil, Whitewashing, Sybil-Camouflage, and Sybil-Whitewashing, under robustness, MAE, and stability criteria. Especially, when defensing attacks that are widely recognized challenging such as Sybil, and Sybil&Whitewashing, the robustness of our PEALGA strategy is significantly higher than MET in all ratios of dishonest buyers. Moreover, PEALGA is the most stable one in comparing with 5 other strategies because its robustness almost keeps the same under all listed pure or combined attacks.

The strategies compared in this paper are suitable for B2B electronic market, where user requirements are not changed frequently. In our future work, whether this strategy proposed in this paper is suitable for the C2C market in which the purchase requirement often change is a problem that needs to be explored. Besides, we are planning to apply our study into different real-life applications of tourism [19] and workforce management [20].
