                  In traditional analytic hierarch process (AHP), decision makers (DMs) are required to provide crisp judgments over paired comparisons of objectives to construct comparison matrices. To enhance the modeling ability of traditional AHP, we propose hesitant AHP (H-AHP) that can consider the hesitancy experienced by the DMs in decision. H-AHP is characterized by hesitant judgments, where each hesitant judgment can be represented by several possible values. Different probability distributions can be used to further describe hesitant judgments according to the DMs’ preferences. Based on a hesitant comparison matrix (HCM) that consists of hesitant judgments, we define two indices to measure the consistency degree and the consensus degree of the HCM respectively. From a stochastic point of view, a new prioritization method is developed to derive priorities from HCMs, where the results are with probability interpretations. We provide a step by step procedure for H-AHP, and demonstrate this new method with a real-life decision making problem.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Analytic hierarch process (AHP) can be used for structuring, measurement, and synthesis. It has wide applications, such as the decisions of choice, prioritization/evaluation, resource allocation, benchmarking, quality management, public policy, and forecasting etc. (Saaty, 1989, 1994, 1977, 1980, 2008; Saaty & Vargas, 1987). In a multi-criteria environment, AHP is built on a decision maker (DM)’s intrinsic ability to structure his/her perceptions or his/her ideas hierarchically. With the produced dimensionless ratio-scale priorities, AHP assists the DMs to make reliable decisions.

To resolve the AHP problems, four main steps should be followed. (1) Modeling: determining a top-to-bottom form as a hierarch with different levels of criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives. (2) Evaluation: constructing comparison matrices based on a 1–9 scale. (3) Prioritization: using prioritization methods to derive local priorities of objectives in each level of the hierarchy. (4) Synthesis: utilizing aggregation procedures to synthesize the local priorities into global priorities of alternatives.

In AHP, the DMs usually provide crisp values for judgments over paired comparisons of objectives with respect to a criterion. So we call the judgments represented by crisp values as crisp judgments. If the DMs are uncertain about the judgments, this uncertainty can be measured by intervals which can be called interval judgments (Saaty & Vargas, 1987). Both crisp judgments and interval judgments are based on the 1–9 scale. If it is difficult to determine crisp or interval values, the judgments can also be represented by fuzzy values (Ishizaka & Labib, 2011; Ishizaka & Nguyen, 2013; Saaty, 1980; Van Laarhoven & Pedrycz, 1983; Zadeh, 1965).

However, the existing representations of judgments still have limitations in practice. More possible representations should be developed to represent uncertainty experienced by the DMs due to the increasing complexity of modern society. Motivated by a real-life AHP problem, that is to assess the strategic positions of islands and reefs of China, we need to deal with a hesitant case, where the military experts prefer to retain several possible values to represent some judgments rather than crisp or interval values. For example, to make the judgment over a paired comparison of objectives, a military expert is hesitant about the values 4 or 5 based on the 1–9 scale. So we have two possible values in this case, not a single value represented by a crisp judgment, or a margin of error represented by an interval judgment. From a probability point of view, 4 and 5 should be with the same probability 0.5. Similar idea of this kind of uncertainty can also be found in the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets proposed by Torra (2010).

In the process of human reasoning and concept formation, hesitancy is a common phenomenon, especially in decision making. We use several possible values to indicate a judgment in AHP to describe the hesitancy experienced by the DMs in decision. As distinct from crisp judgments and interval judgments, we call the judgment represented by several possible values a hesitant judgment. Based on hesitant judgments and under the framework of AHP, we propose a hesitant AHP (H-AHP) in this paper with a series of new concepts and methods.
                  

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives necessary descriptions of AHP. Section 3 develops the concept of hesitant comparison matrices (HCMs), then focuses on consistency and consensus of HCMs respectively. In Section 4, we develop hesitant preference analysis as a new prioritization method for HCMs. Section 5 gives related discussions. Based on the developed concepts and methods above, Section 6 concludes a step by step procedure for H-AHP. A real-life example is introduced to illustrate our results in Section 7. Section 8 closes this paper with some conclusions.

In recent decades, AHP and related research topics have widely attracted much attention of researchers (Ivlev, Vacek, & Kneppo, 2015; Kułakowski, 2015; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2015; Zhu, Xu, Zhang, & Hong, 2015). In this section, we discuss four main steps of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in detail, which are modeling, evaluation, prioritization and synthesis to provide a fundamental for our new method.

Modeling is the first step of AHP, that is to hierarchically structure a problem. With respect to a decision goal or control criterion, the hierarchy consists of several levels with criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives from top to bottom. As usual, we begin with the alternatives, then go up with the simplest sub-criteria until determining all objectives in each level.

In the evaluation step of AHP, the decision makers (DMs) provide judgments over paired comparisons of objectives with respect to a criterion in an upper level. Saaty (1990) gave the 1–9 scale shown in Table 1, which is a scale of absolute numbers used to assign numerical values to judgments made by comparing two objectives.

The judgments over paired comparisons of objectives are collected by comparison matrices. Let

In the evaluation step of hesitant AHP (H-AHP), the DMs are allowed to provide hesitant judgments to construct hesitant comparison matrices (HCMs), which are discussed in Section 3 in detail.

Consistency is a basic requirement for comparison matrices to guarantee meaningful results, and consistency check and consistency improving are two main research topics.

Checking consistency of comparison matrices is a crucial step to avoid misleading solutions. Saaty (1977) developed an eigenvector method (EVM) to derive priorities from comparison matrices, and then defined a consistency index to measure their consistency degrees.

If CR < 0.1, it means that the error in measurement is considered to be acceptable, then A is said to be with the acceptable consistency; otherwise, A is called unacceptable.

                           , then A is with the acceptable consistency, which means that the RGMM captures the essential idea of transitivity, and the priorities obtained by the RGMM are meaningful. From the computational point of view, GCI can be easily obtained due to its linear complexity. In the rest of the paper, we will use it as a basis to develop new indices for HCMs.

For the comparison matrices with the unacceptable consistency, many methods have been developed to improve consistency. For example, Xu and Wei (1999) proposed an iterative method; Ishizaka and Lusti (2004) developed an expert module to construct consistent comparison matrices; Li and Ma (2007) proposed an iterative method to detect and improve inconsistent judgments; Cao, Leung, and Law (2008) developed a heuristic approach; Ergu, Kou, Peng, and Shi (2011) proposed a method to identify and improve inconsistent judgments based on the theorem of matrix multiplication and vectors dot product.

In the rest of the paper, we use the iterative method given by Xu and Wei (1999) as a basis to develop consistency improving and consensus improving methods of HCMs due to its relationship with the traditional EVM and advantages in computation.

In a context with a group of DMs, AHP requires that individual judgments should be aggregated, where aggregating individual judgments (AIJ) and aggregating individual priorities (AIP) are two basic approaches. However, Hauser and Tadikamalla (1996) argued that many circumstances make the aggregation difficult, and the confidences of the DMs to the results may be reduced if they lack faith in some aggregated judgments. Altuzarra, Moreno-Jiménez, and Salvador (2010) claimed that this kind of aggregation is usually accepted only if judgments among the DMs are not strongly divergent. Therefore, consensus reaching, which is defined as the full and unanimous agreement among the DMs regarding all judgments, is a guarantee for the DMs to adequately represent their preferences.

Consensus reaching is relevant to the revisions of judgments and the establishment of consensus paths. For example, Bryson (1996) used consensus relevant information to assess the levels of consensus, and then developed some strategies to increase the consensus levels. MarÍa, JimÉnez, Joven, Pirla, and Lanuza (2005) developed a spreadsheet module to search for consensus. Yeh, Kreng, and Lin (2001) developed a computer-aided approach to achieve consensus. Altuzarra et al. (2010) developed a semiautomatic Bayesian approach to build consensus. Under a row geometric mean prioritization method, Dong, Zhang, Hong, and Xu (2010) proposed some models to achieve consensus.

Generally, the existing methods for consensus building can be roughly divided into automatic methods which are time saving, effective and practical without the interactions of the DMs, and feedback methods which generate suggestions for the DMs to revise their judgments. The automatic methods pay attention to the efficiency, while the feedback methods stress on the DMs’ interventions. In this paper, we shall develop an automatic consensus improving method for HCMs considering of efficiency.

In the prioritization step of AHP, many prioritization methods have been developed to derive priorities of objectives in each level of the hierarchy, such as the EVM, the RGMM, the logarithmic least squares method (Crawford & Williams, 1985), the logarithmic goal programming method (Bryson, 1995) and the fuzzy programming method (Mikhailov, 2000). Among these methods, only the EVM and the RGMM require to measure consistency of comparison matrices. Without consistency check, the prioritization methods may give different ranks, and lead to wrong solutions (Saaty, 2003; Saaty & Hu, 1998; Saaty & Vargas, 1984, 1987). With respect to HCMs, we develop hesitant preference analysis as a new prioritization method, where the RGMM is used to guarantee reliable results.

The local priorities, obtained by the prioritization methods in each level of the hierarchy, are aggregated into global priorities in the synthesis step. The weighted arithmetic average and the geometric means are the two most used aggregation procedures to obtain the global priorities of alternatives.

In this section, we define the concepts of hesitant judgments and HCMs, then propose an expected geometric consistency index to measure consistency degrees of individual HCMs, and then give an expected geometric consensus index to measure the consensus degrees of multiple HCMs. Based on the two indices, two Algorithms are proposed to improve consistency and consensus, respectively.

Based on the 1–9 scale, the hesitant judgment is characterized by several possible values. The definition is as follows.


                        
                           Definition 1
                           For a paired comparison of the objectives i and j, if a judgment following the 1–9 scale consists of several possible values to represent the dominance of i over j, then it is called a hesitant judgment.

For convenience, we use y to indicate a hesitant judgment, and collect all the possible values of y represented as 
                           
                              y

                        , where |y| is the number of possible values in y. So the hesitancy experienced by the DMs in making judgments can be described by these possible values. Generally, all the possible values for a hesitant judgment have the same probability, and the sum of the probabilities is 1. However, the DMs can also specify probability distributions according to their preferences.

                        , it means that there is no hesitancy experienced by the DMs, then the HCM reduces to the comparison matrix.

It should be noted that the similar idea of representing the judgments with probability interpretations in AHP has also been considered by other researchers. For example, Rosenbloom (1997) recommended treating the judgments as stochastic variables, and then used a three point discrete approximation to describe the distribution of the stochastic variables. Stam and Silva (1997) argued that the stochastic nature of the judgments can reflect either subjective probabilities that a particular alternative better achieves a given goal, or objective probabilities that reflect uncertain consequences of selecting a particular alternative. Moskowitz, Tang, and Lam (2000) claimed that attempting to make precise judgments can be time consuming and cognitively demanding. They also recommend using stochastic variables to account for inconsistency and imprecision. Hahn (2003) considered that the judgments may be subject to error, and it is nature to use stochastic variables.

Although the hesitant judgments can be considered as a special case of the stochastic methods that represent the judgments, we propose this new representation due to its simplicity that captures hesitancy and close relationship with crisp judgments. Moreover, in our practical example, the invited military experts considered that the hesitant judgment is a simple and natural approach to present their uncertainty.

We now develop a consistency index for HCMs. The consistency thresholds are established to define the acceptable consistency of HCMs. Then we develop a consistency improving method to improve inconsistent HCMs until they are acceptable.

                                 , and since Algorithm 1 which improves consistency of Y
                                 (l) is convergent according to Xu and Wei (1999), then Y
                                 (l) is convergent everywhere, and the limit matrix of Y
                                 (l) is also a stochastic comparison matrix. Therefore, Algorithm 3 is convergent, which completes the proof.□

                                 1 is not consistent, then we improve its consistency according to Algorithm 3. The results are as follows:

The consensus reaching process is important to get reliable results with a certain level of agreement among the DMs. As usual, the aggregated judgments that are aggregated by individual judgments are set as the judgments of the group. Then the consensus index can be defined by measuring the distance or the error between individual judgments and the aggregated judgments (Ben-Arieh & Easton, 2007; Ben-Arieh, Easton, & Evans, 2009; Dong et al., 2010). Motivated by this idea, we define a collected HCM to collect all original hesitant judgments provided by the DMs. Then an aggregated comparison matrix is further defined by aggregating all the possible values. Based on the aggregated comparison matrix, a consensus index is defined for HCMs, and a consensus improving method is then proposed.

                                 Algorithm 6 is convergent.


                           
                              Proof
                              Since the main loops that Algorithms 3 and 5 in Algorithm 6 are convergent, its convergence can be proven immediately.□

Due to the hesitant judgments provided by the DMs are characterized by probability distributions, the derived priorities from HCMs should be with probability interpretations. Therefore, we now develop a new prioritization method for HCMs that can not only produce priorities from HCMs with probability interpretations, but also reflect the original hesitancy experienced by the DMs, which is called hesitant preference analysis.

Hesitant preference analysis is a stochastic method to deal with hesitant judgments. This idea is motivated by stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis-2 (Lahdelma & Salminen, 2001), which is a multi-criteria decision support method. With respect to the HCM which consists of hesitant judgments, we let it be a hesitant-judgment space, and then analyze this space to obtain the priorities of objectives.

On the basis of the acceptable indices, the acceptable probabilities of the objectives for each rank can be clearly identified. Furthermore, the acceptable probabilities for all ranks of each objective can be aggregated as a holistic evaluation of priorities that are with probability interpretations. Some techniques can be utilized for the aggregation, such as the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator (Yager, 1988) which provides a parameterized class of mean operators and has wide applications in practice (Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Verdegay, 1996; Rinner & Malczewski, 2002; Yager, 2007; Yager & Kacprzyk, 1997).

                        which can be called a holistic priority of xi
                        .

Since the higher the ranks, the more important the acceptable probabilities, then the basic requirements for the weights that aggregate the acceptable probabilities should be nonnegative, normalized, and non-increasing when the rank decreases.

Based on the attitudinal character, many models have been developed to determine the weights (Fullér & Majlender, 2001, 2003; Liu, 2006; Liu & Chen, 2004; Liu & Yu, 2012; Majlender, 2005; O'Hagan, 1988). Particularly, Liu (2008) proposed a general model to obtain the weights which can be controlled by the attitudinal character and an objective function. Motivated by the model of Liu (2008), we develop the following model:

                        where F is a strictly convex function on [0, 1], and at least second-order differentiable.

With different values of the attitudinal character AC(w) and different representations of the objective function F(x), we can obtain the desirable weights that emphasize different ranks of objectives. The settings of AC(w) and F(x) will be discussed in detail in Section 5.

Based on the discussions above, we give the following procedure of hesitant preference analysis to get the holistic priorities.

In this section, we discuss the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulation that are used in Algorithms 2, 4 and 7, design an experiment to study the relationship between the expected geometric consistency index and the sizes of HCMs, and then focus on the attitudinal character and the objective function in Eq. (23) to provide some suggestions for their settings.

The computation of the expected geometric consistency index E(GCI)

                         in Algorithm 2, the expected geometric consensus index

                                    (
                                    G
                                    C
                                    E
                                    I
                                    )
                                 
                                 
                                    Y

                         in Algorithm 4, and the rank acceptability index

                         in Algorithm 7 are carried out by Monte Carlo simulation programmed in the Matlab environment. As Milton and Arnold (1995) discussed, the results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation are normally distributed according to the central limit theorem if the numbers of iterations are large enough (>25). If we aim to achieve the accuracy d with 95% confidence level for each index, the required number of iterations is

If we set

                         which is also the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulation in this paper.

In Section 3.2, we calculate the expected geometric consistency index E(GCI)
                           Y
                         to measure the consistency degree of the HCM Y. Actually, the consistency degree of Y has close relationship with its size. We now design an experiment to focus on this issue.

The experiment is conducted on the sizes 
                           
                              3
                              ×
                              3
                              ,
                              4
                              ×
                              4
                              ,
                              …
                              ,
                              10
                              ×
                              10
                           
                         of HCMs. Using “RANDPERM” function in Matlab, we generate 1000 HCMs for each size, where the hesitant judgments in each HCM consist of limited random numbers of possible values. Then we ran 10,000 iterations to obtain E(GCI)
                           Y
                         for each HCM by Algorithm 2. The average values of E(GCI)
                           Y
                         for each size are described in Fig. 2.
                        
                     

It is clear that as the matrix size increases, the average value of E(GCI)
                           Y
                         decreases. Since 
                           
                              G
                              C
                              
                                 
                                    I
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 
                                    (
                                    n
                                    )
                                 
                              
                              =
                              0.370
                           
                         with n > 4, and based on the results in Fig. 2, we know that the HCMs are with the acceptable consistency if the sizes are larger than four. So we usually do not need consistency improving for HCMs in such cases.

To determine the weights that aggregate the acceptable probabilities discussed in Section 4.1, the DMs need to determine the values of the attitudinal character AC(w) and the representations of the objective function F(x). Since F(x) is a strictly convex function on [0, 1], and at least second-order differentiable, we can set

From Fig. 3, we can find that the bigger the value p, the more the emphasis of the mediocre ranks. With respect to AC(w), if 0 ≤ AC(w) < 0.5, we get non-decreasing weights which are contradict with the basic requirements of the weights; if

                                 x

                        , we can describe the obtained weights with different values of AC(w) shown in Fig. 4.
                        
                     

Clearly, the bigger the value AC(w), the more emphasis of the good ranks. So we recommend setting 0.6 ≤ AC(w) < 1 in practice.

With all the discussions that are associated with each aspect of H-AHP, we now decompose H-AHP into the following steps.

                        
                           
                              Step 1:
                           Regarding to a control criterion, configure a top-to-bottom hierarchical structure with a control level, a criterion level and an alternative level. Each level may also include sublevel(s).

With respect to each objective in an upper level, compare the objectives in a lower lever to construct HCMs associated with all the DMs.

Check and improve the consistency degrees of individual HCMs.

Check and improve the consensus degrees of the HCMs in each level among the DMs.

Derive the holistic priorities of objectives in each level of the hierarchy.

From the bottom of the hierarchy, aggregate all the holistic priorities of the alternatives with respect to objectives in an upper level, and continue this process until the holistic priorities of the alternatives with respect to the control criterion are obtained.

Islands and reefs are important components for a maritime nation. Their strategic positions mean a lot to national security, military deployments, resource and economy etc. Assume that five military experts are invited to participate in a project to assess the strategic positions of islands and reefs. Following H-AHP, we give the following steps.


                     Step 1. The hierarchical structure of this problem is described as follows. The strategic assessment of islands and reefs is set as the control criterion in the control level. Sensitivity and vulnerability are the two main criteria in the criterion level. Vulnerability also includes two sub-criteria, which are exposure and defense. The alternative level has four alternatives

                      to compare. This structure is shown in Fig. 5.
                     
                  

The basic objectives of the criteria, sensitivity, exposure and defense, are listed as follows:

                        
                           (1)
                           Sensitivity (S): History conflict (S
                              1), diplomatic relations (S
                              2), race and ethnic relations (S
                              3), strategic value (S
                              4).

Exposure (E): Population (E
                              1), facilities (E
                              2), resource (E
                              3), location (E
                              4).

Defense (D): Weaponry (D
                              1), military bases and garrisons (D
                              2), reconnaissance capabilities (D
                              3), military support capabilities (D
                              4).


                     Step 2. Based on the 1–9 scale, we require the invited five DMs

                              1
                              ,
                              2
                              ,

                      to provide their judgments over paired comparisons of the four alternatives with respect to sensitivity, exposure and defense respectively, where hesitant judgments are allowed to represent their hesitancy. Then we can construct fifteen HCMs, denoted by 
                        
                           
                              Y

                     . For brief, we only give one constructed HCM for illustration shown in Table 5.
                     
                  

Moreover, with respect to the control criterion, we assume that the DMs achieve a consensus to weight sensitivity and vulnerability; with respect to vulnerability, the DMs also achieve a consensus to weight exposure and defense. Let wS, wV, wE
                      and wD
                      be the weights (holistic priorities) of sensitivity, vulnerability, exposure and defense respectively, then

Therefore, the alternative A
                     4 is the island (reef) that has the most important strategic position.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, we have developed a hesitant analytic hierarch process (H-AHP) method as an extension of traditional AHP. H-AHP is characterized by hesitant judgments that use several possible values to represent the judgments over paired comparisons of objectives. Different probability distributions can be used to describe hesitant judgments according to the preferences of decision makers. On the basis of hesitant judgments, we have defined a hesitant comparison matrix (HCM) as a basic tool to collect hesitant judgments in H-AHP. To check the consistency degrees of individual HCMs and the consensus degrees of multiple HCMs, we have developed an expected geometric consistency index and an expected geometric consensus index, respectively. The consistency improving and the consensus improving methods of HCMs have also been developed to produce the consistent HCMs. By analyzing hesitant-judgment spaces of HCMs, a new prioritization method, hesitant preference analysis, has been developed to derive holistic priorities of objectives, where the obtained holistic priorities are with probability interpretations. A step by step procedure of H-AHP has been concluded. Following this procedure, we have given a real-life example to illustrate our results. However, more researches related to each aspect of H-AHP can be further explored in the future work.
