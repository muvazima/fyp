                  We present a new piecewise linear approximation of non-linear optimization problems. It can be seen as a variant of classical triangulations that leaves more degrees of freedom to define any point as a convex combination of the samples. For example, in the traditional Union Jack approach a (two-dimensional) variable domain is split by a rectangular grid, and one has to select the diagonals that induce the triangles used for the approximation. For a hyper-rectangular domain

In the proposed approach the choice of the simplexes is optimistically guided by one between two approximating objective functions (one convex, one concave), and the number of additional binary variables needed by a straightforward implementation drops to only

When addressing polytopes that are regularly spaced hyper-rectangles, the methods allows modeling of the domain partition with a logarithmic number of constraints and binary variables. The simultaneous use of both convex and concave piecewise linear approximations reminds of global optimization techniques, which are, on the one side, stronger because they lead to convex relaxations and not only approximations of the problem at hand, but, on the other hand, significantly more arduous from a computational standpoint. We show theoretical properties of the approximating functions, and provide computational evidence of the impact of their use within MILP models approximating non-linear problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The linearization of non-linear functions plays an important role in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approaches to the solution of non-linear optimization problems, especially in the real-world context (see, e.g., (Borghetti, D’Ambrosio, Lodi, & Martello, 2008; Irion, Lu, Al-Khayyal, & Tsao, 2012; Silva & Camponogara, 2014) just to mention a few recent ones). Classical approaches are based on piecewise linear approximation.

                      of two variables, various methods provide piecewise linear approximations. The most common approaches are based on triangulations, pictorially illustrated in Fig. 2
                     . The variable domain is split by a grid, and each cell of the grid is subdivided into two triangles: the convex combinations of the function values sampled at the vertices of a triangle uniquely provide the linear approximation. Fig. 2 reports the domain partition and the sampling points both for the original function (Fig. 2(a)) and for the corresponding piecewise-linear approximation (Fig. 2(b)). Various approaches are discussed, e.g., in Todd (1977), Babayev (1997), D’Ambrosio, Lodi, and Martello (2010).

                      independent vertices (i.e., an L-dimensional simplex) so that the convex combination is unique as well as the resulting piecewise linear approximation of f. This is the most classical approximation method (see, Todd (1977) and Lee and Wilson (2001)).

                           =
                           2
                        
                     , this would mean to use all four vertices of the rectangle in Fig. 3(a) to define the convex combination. As it will be shown in the next sections, such a degree of freedom can be exploited to discriminate combinations among each other, for example in the case where special properties of f are known.

Beyond samples on the vertices of each region, we may want to consider samples inside the regions. Hence, for each

                     (2)) is implied by the minimization (resp. maximization) requested by the problem.

Hence, the solver of the resulting piecewise linear problem implicitly uses an approximation that yields, for each feasible point and among all the possible linear interpolations of the samples that are available due to non-simplex regions and oversampling, the one that agrees most with the sense of the optimization problem: the largest when seeking a maximum or the smallest when seeking a minimum.

Actually, this is the optimistic attitude that gives the name to the proposed approximation scheme when embedded in an optimization problem.

Note that the use of a piecewise linear approximation that may be locally convex or concave may remind of global optimization techniques (see, e.g., Belotti et al. (2013)). Actually, in that context, a convex piecewise linear under-estimation and a concave piecewise linear over-estimation of a generic non-convex function are used to create a convex polyhedral relaxation, and those under- and over-estimations are iteratively improved by branching. This leads to compute a global optimal solution for the problem at hand, with the significant difficulty that finding appropriate under- and over-estimations might be hard, especially for 
                        
                           L
                           >

                     , and refining them is computationally arduous (see again Belotti et al. (2013) and Tawarmalani, Richard and Xiong (2013)). Yet, in our approach, convex and concave approximations are not simultaneously employed but implicitly chosen by the solver and not refined over time.

The result is that the computed solution is approximated, i.e., it might not even be feasible when the function f appears in a constraint of the original MINLP problem, with the relevant advantage that the out-of-the-shelf solution of a single MILP suffices.

Computational results using the proposed approximations are reported in Section 4, where we evaluate its performance in the MILP context. Some conclusions are finally drawn in Section 5.

The following result ensures that the approximations introduced in the previous section can be profitably used to reduce the complexity of piecewise-linear models of non-linear optimization problems without impairing approximation quality.

Though some of the points in Theorem 1 can be inferred from ongoing studies on the properties of convex and concave envelopes of non-linear functions (see, e.g., Theorem 2.4 in Tawarmalani, Richard, & Xiong (2013)), we chose to present them in a self-contained form to integrate other issues that are equally important for our purposes like continuity of the approximation, asymptotic error bounds, optimality of approximation for convex and concave non-linear functions.

                      are simplexes and no oversampling, which, for any given x, implies that the convex combination is unique. Model (15)–(24) is however valid for any choice of the regions and any oversampling provided Conditions C1-C3 of Section 1 are satisfied. In particular, if there are regions with more than L linearly independent vertices (see Condition C3) or additional samples are considered, then for some x values the convex combination is not unique, hence the resulting solution minimizes the objective function. We refer to such kind of situations as optimistic modeling.

This model adopts a standard formulation. Effective, more complex methods, requiring a smaller number of variables and constraints, were recently proposed by Vielma and Nemhauser (2011) and are discussed and extended to oversampled cases in the second part of Section 4.

From a practical viewpoint, it turns out that the smaller the number of regions in 
                           
                              R
                           
                         the lighter the resulting formulation. On the other hand, the approximation error is bounded by the diameter

                        . In this section we evaluate the trade-off between approximation quality and tractability of the MILP problem. Although a specific tuning can only be done when the shape of domain 
                           
                              U
                           
                         and the position of the sampling points are known, the potential of optimistic modeling may be appreciated with few considerations.

Consider a normalized setting in which domain 
                           
                              U
                           
                         has an overall unit volume, and establish the approximation quality by prefixing the value of 
                           
                              δ
                           
                        . Within this bound, and depending on their shape, the regions in 
                           
                              R

                         (diamonds). It is clear that standard simplex triangulation is not the best tessellation strategy, and that triangulations in general yield a number of regions whose trend is unfavorable with respect to the one of simple rectangular tessellations. More complex tessellations are difficult to characterize for

                         because they strongly depend on the dimensionality of the domain.

The most common variable domains 
                           
                              U
                           
                         are hyper-rectangles defined by bounds on the variable values. Hence, although any collection of regions satisfying Conditions C1-C3 of Section 1 can be adopted to approximate a given function, it is natural to partition the domain into hyper-rectangular regions, also because this yields the simplest structure of all. For this reason, this section is devoted to the specialization of the MILP model of Section 3 to the case in which

                         is a hyper-rectangle, and samples of the objective and constraint functions are defined on a regular grid.

We assume that

                              L

                         equivalent simplexes that share a single edge, which is also one of the possible diagonals of the containing hyper-rectangle. Common diagonals change from one sub-domain to an adjacent one, following a regular pattern that avoids the possibility of identifying a preferred direction. Due to the well-recognizable pattern of its two-dimensional realization, such a globally isotropic triangulation is often referred to as Union Jack (Todd, 1977).

Simplexes are all equivalent to the standard one and their arrangement allows the implementation of extremely effective high-dimensional interpolators when the time needed to compute the value of the approximation in a given point is the key factor (Kuhn, 1960; Rovatti, Borgatti, & Guerrieri, 1998).

When straightforwardly embedded in an MILP model, this approach requires a binary variable per region (Lee & Wilson, 2001), hence a total of

                         binary variables. We next show that in the approach we propose the number of binary variables is drastically reduced by defining the regions as hyper-rectangles, hence avoiding the partition through simplexes.

                         (see (25)). It follows that (33) automatically sets to zero all

                         coefficients corresponding to additional sampling points outside that region.

Since this is separately imposed for each of the L dimensions, the model requires in total only

Recently, Vielma and Nemhauser (2011) proposed new, more complex methods for modeling triangulations, based on properly encoded binary decision trees, which require a number of binary variables and constraints that is logarithmic in the number of regions.

When applied to non-oversampled models (i.e., to models with

From (33) and (37) we get that, both in the standard and logarithmic implementations, once the model is laid down encoding the samples on the grid, further samples can be injected in it by adding a single column per additional sample.

Moreover, for hyper-rectangular domains sampled on regular grids, the B binary variables and

                         constraints (36) (and thus the corresponding constraint (37)) can be partitioned in two disjoint sets, one dedicated to model the selection of a single hyper-rectangular region and the other in charge of selecting a single simplex within that hyper-rectangle. Hence, the optimistic model can be implemented exploiting the results in Vielma and Nemhauser (2011), generalized as in (37), by simply discarding the second set of binary variables and constraints (i.e., rows). In Section 4 we provide a computational comparison of the different implementations of both methods.

In this section we perform a detailed computational evaluation of the proposed approximation within MILP models. Specifically, in the next subsections we consider three simple Non-Linear Programming (NLP) problems in two, three, and four variables, respectively, to be piecewise linear approximated by our optimistic modeling. Although such problems are easy and small, they allow an evaluation of the impact of the optimistic modeling within an MILP approach. The resulting MILP models were solved by CPLEX version 12.4 on a PC equipped with an hyperthread-enabled Intel Core-i7 and 16gigabyte of RAM.

In Section 4.4 we consider a real-world Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem arising in an industrial context.

                         into triangles following the Union Jack pattern are indicated as “UJ”. The fact that an optimistic approximation is used that implicitly considers a piecewise-linear concave interpolation of the objective function in any region is indicated with an Op superscript.

The standard implementation ((15)–(24) for full UJ models and (26)–(35) for HR models) is indicated with “-std”, while the logarithmic implementation (Vielma & Nemhauser, 2011) is indicated with “-log”. When oversampling is considered, a further “-ovr” is added to indicate that 10 points, randomly drawn with a uniform probability in the rectangle containing the true optimum solution, have been added as non-structured samples.

As an example, HROp-log-ovr indicates a model with hyper-rectangular regions, with a logarithmic implementation and oversampling that implicitly uses optimistic approximation of the original problem.

The results are reported in Table 1
                        . As far as the sizes of the four models are concerned, we report, for each value of m, the number of constraints (constr.), the overall number of variables (var.), the number of non-zero entries (non-zero), and the number of binary variables (0–1 var.).

The performance is reported as the time needed by CPLEX to complete optimization expressed in CPLEX ticks (i.e., roughly, an estimation of the computing time that is based on the deterministic number of operations performed by the MILP solver, and that is therefore independent of the current overhead due to the machine load), the percent gain in solution time due to the adoption of an HR model instead of an UJ model, the adjustment in the constraint radius (

                                          10
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                         in the non-approximated problem) that is needed to make the CPLEX solution feasible (the constraint is non-linear and thus approximated), the value of f computed at the CPLEX solution and the corresponding percent loss with respect to the true maximum (possibly after the relaxation needed to make the CPLEX solution feasible).

As a preliminary remark, note that the approximation of the constraint is very good for 
                           
                              m
                              >
                              3
                           
                         and improves consistently as m increases.

Results in Table 1 are very satisfactory. The percentage speed-up obtained by the optimistic models is consistent and often very impressive. This is true both for the standard and the logarithmic implementations. It is remarkable that the reduction in the MILP model size obtained by applying the optimistic approach corresponds to a significant advantage for the MILP solver even when applied on top of the already very compact logarithmic formulation. This shows that the optimistic models are also somehow easier to “assimilate” by the solver.

The quality of the solutions if no oversampling is applied is exactly the same between “UJ” and “HR”. However, if oversampling is used, a sometimes impressive improvement of both “UJ” and “HR” with respect to their standard versions can be observed, with the only exception of

                        . Although it only happens in two cases and with a quite small difference (namely, 
                           
                              m

                        ), the version of “HR” with oversampling seems to obtain slightly better solutions (in terms of quality) than the corresponding version of “UJ”. Computing times of the versions with and without oversampling are very comparable. Just to give a rough information of CPU times in seconds, the highest values, corresponding to the case

As m increases, standard non-logarithmic implementations become unmanageable. Hence, for both HR and UJ models, only the logarithmic implementation (Vielma & Nemhauser, 2011) is considered in which oversampling is possibly introduced by considering 10 points, randomly drawn with a uniform probability on the cube containing the true optimum solution.

The results are reported in Table 2
                         using the same notation as in Table 1.

The analysis of the results in Table 2 is quite similar to that of Table 1. The speed-up is consistent and significant, and we are considering here only the logarithmic approach. There are more differences here in the solution quality of the “UJ” models with respect to the “HR” ones, even without oversampling. Overall, as far as the objective function value is concerned, the best model is HROp-log-ovr the only exception being

                        . Finally, though the improved performance of oversampled models comes at some computational price, differences remain reasonable.

In this case too, as m increases, standard implementations become unmanageable. Hence, the tested models are the same as in the 3-variable case.

The results, reported in Table 3
                        , are consistent with those in Tables 1 and 2, with the only exception of small values of m (3 and 5) for which the approximated solutions are very far away from the optimal one. This is due to the high dimensionality of the problem whose geometry is badly captured by too coarse partitions. For higher values of m, the speed-up is significant, the quality improves by doing oversampling, and oversampling is not in general slower.

The final step of this experimental evaluation deals with a real-world MINLP. We consider the problem of finding the optimal scheduling of a multi-unit hydro power station, known as Short-Term Hydro Scheduling problem. In a short-term time horizon it is required to maximize the power selling revenue by assuming that (a) the generation company acts as a price-taker, and (b) the electricity prices and the inflows are forecast. We consider the MINLP model presented in Borghetti et al. (2008) in which all constraints are linear, while the objective function has a non-linear term, as the power production is a non-convex, non-concave function

                         has been proposed. The method, called Improved Rectangle (IR) modeling, was later analyzed in detail in D’Ambrosio et al. (2010) and consists of a “basic approximation” and of its quality improvement. The basic approximation is obtained by sampling one of the two variables, say

                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                        , for a fixed number of values, say 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                        , and using a piecewise linear approximation to linearize the 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         resulting univariate functions. The approximation quality improvement is obtained by adding a “correction factor” that takes into account the difference between the real value of variable 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    x
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           
                         and the two closest among the 
                           
                              ℓ
                           
                         sampling points. Although the IRmodeling is not as general as the UJ and HR ones (for example, it does not – directly – extend to functions of more than two variables and does not admit a logarithmic implementation), we include comparison with its performance mainly because it has been developed and tailored for the problem at hand.

The other approximations we consider are those proposed in this paper with no oversampling.

In fact, though we performed some experiments with oversampling and obtained non-negligible improvements in the quality of some of the recomputed solutions, the results are not conclusive and we decided to not report them in full detail. The reason for that is twofold. On the one side, the objective function to be approximated, involved in a maximization problem, is non-concave and we have no indication of where the true optimal solution is. Thus, the only way of performing the experiments is to oversample in each region and this leads to huge MILPs even with only one extra sample point per region. Runs exceeding memory or time limits are thus too frequent to allow a significant comparison.

On the other hand, and more structurally, the non-concavity of the function sometimes causes the extra information associated with oversampling to be neglected because of the optimistic attitude of the approximation. Indeed, an extra point in the interior of a region that tightly approximates the value of the function could be ignored in the convex combination if the function is not locally coherent with the objective function of the MILP.

Both these observations suggest that oversampling could be better exploited in a dynamic algorithmic approach that refines the region of interest based on intermediate MILP problems (possibly approximatively solved with light heuristic techniques). Such an approach is compatible with triangulation as well, although increasing triangulation resolution entails a complete reformulation of the model where adding oversampling in an optimistic model can be done by simple insertion of new variables in existing equations. A compromise would be to use triangulation first and then hyper-rectangular oversampling, so as to locate regions in which the objective function is locally concave or convex thus allowing a better approximation by means of cheap optimistic oversampling. Developing such an approach is beyond the scope of the current paper and could be the topic of future research.

For the computational evaluation we consider a specific Short-Term Hydro Scheduling instance with 168 time periods introduced in D’Ambrosio et al. (2010).

                         reports, for each value of the sampling parameter

                        , the size of the three MILP models (HR, UJ and IR) with the same notation as in the previous tables. The table refers to the non-logarithmic implementation (which is the only one possible for the IR model).


                        Table 4 shows, for the HROp-std model, a huge reduction in all indicators with respect to the UJ-std one: both the number of constraints and the number of binary variables are one order of magnitude smaller, while the number of variables and non-zero entries is halved. With respect to the IR model, there is the same drop in terms of number of constraints, the number of binaries and non-zero is equivalent, while the overall number of variables is one order of magnitude bigger.

The results of the CPLEX computation are presented in Table 5
                        , where we report, for each value of m and for different time limits (5, 10, 60 CPU minutes on an Intel Core2 CPU 6600, 2.40gigahertz, 1.94gigabyte of RAM running under Linux) (i) the solution value obtained at the time limit (or earlier, if CPLEX could prove optimality), recomputed using the original non-linear function; (ii) the initial and final percentage gaps; (iii) the CPU time in seconds (or “T.L.” when time limit occurred); and (iv) the number of branch-and-bound nodes. Note that, differently from the previous tables, we consider, in Table 5 and in the following ones, CPU times in seconds instead of CPLEX ticks. The reason is that ticks are especially interesting when the computing times are small so as to be able to appreciate the “granular” differences, while computing times in Table 5 are never negligible (often coinciding with the time limit), thus providing a very neat measure of the performance of the different models. The results show that size matters. Indeed the MILP resulting from the UJ model cannot be solved to optimality but for the case 
                           
                              m
                              =
                              10
                           
                         with a time limit of 600 CPU seconds, while all other runs reach the time limit without having proven optimality, and, in most cases, without having found any feasible solution at all. Both the HROp-std and the IR models behave quite well, the former being always faster (sometimes much faster) than the latter. This is shown not only by the shorter computing times but also from the number of time limits (1 vs. 6 out of 11 runs). In addition, when both executions hit the time limit (
                           
                              m
                              =
                              30
                           
                         with 300 CPU seconds), the number of enumerated branch-and-bound nodes for the HROp-std model is roughly four times bigger than that for the IR model. The initial percentage gap for the HROp-std model is slightly better than that for the UJ-std model and much smaller than that for the IR one. All these indicators clearly show that, as expected, the MILPs associated with the HROp-std modeling are by far the most competitive ones.

Coming to the quality of the approximation, in the unique case in which all MILPs are solved to optimality (
                           
                              m
                              =
                              10
                           
                         with 600 CPU seconds), the (recomputed) solution value is identical. In general, the (recomputed) solution value for the HROp-std model is better than that for the IR model (when both MILPs are optimally solved). Note that in this case it is not trivial to trace the improvement of the approximation quality when m grows, as we do not know the true optimal value.

Concerning the logarithmic implementation, Table 6
                         reports, with the usual format, the size of the HROp-log and UJ-log models. As expected, the difference in size between the two models collapses: the number of variables (both binary and continuous) is similar (but smaller for the HROp-log modeling), the HROp-log model uses few less constraints, while the number of non-zero entries, although comparable, shows a clear advantage for the HROp-log model. This results in a very similar performance of the CPLEX solver on the two versions of the MILP as shown by Table 7
                        .

Finally, in Tables 8 and 9
                        
                        , we compare the MILPs obtained with the HROp-std modeling with those obtained with the UJ-log (Vielma & Nemhauser, 2011). Table 8 shows that the size of the MILPs resulting from the former modeling are of course bigger than those resulting from the latter, but not much bigger. In fact, the number of constraints and binary variables is considerably larger, but, on the other hand, the number of non-zero entries is much smaller. The results in Table 9 show an acceptable difference also in terms of solution quality and CPU time for the solver. The entries in the “% err” column give the error of the solution value with respect to the value of the original non-linear function at the solution point. The solution values for HROp-std are slightly better or identical, while the solution times are larger but comparable. This is a significant advantage for the HR modeling because going logarithmic is definitely not for free in terms of complexity of the implementation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have discussed a novel piecewise linear approximation of non-linear optimization problems that, with respect to classical triangulations, guides the choice of the simplexes through one of two approximating objective functions. We have investigated theoretical properties of such functions and established upper bounds on the error they can produce. Moreover, we have shown that the number of artificial binary variables required within an MILP model is dramatically reduced with respect to the UJ triangulations. The proposed approach allows the use of recent methods for representing such variables logarithmically. Computational experiments highlighted the impact of the method when embedded in MILP models.
