                  The main challenge in image denoising is, how to preserve the information such as edges and textures to get satisfactory visual quality when improving the signal to noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a hybrid filter bank for denoising based on wavelet filter bank and quincunx diamond filter bank. The noisy image is decomposed into different subbands of frequency and orientation using DMeyer wavelet. The quincunx diamond filter bank is designed from finite impulse response (FIR) filters using Kaiser window, which is applied on the detail subband of wavelet filter bank. The directional subband coefficients are modeled with Gaussian scale mixture model (GSM). The Bayes least squares estimator is used to obtain the denoised detail coefficients from the noisy image decomposition. Experimental results show that the new method performs spatial averaging without smoothing edges, and thereby enhances the visual quality and peak signal-to-noise-ratio.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Edge-preserving image denoising has become a very intensive research topic. In the past three decades, a variety of denoising methods has been developed in the image processing and computer vision communities. Although seemingly very different, they all share the same property of keeping meaningful edges. The main goal of the image denoising algorithm is to preserve global contrast, edges and texture details of the image without blurring while smoothing the image.

The transform domain denoising methods have shown remarkable success over the last decade. Image denoising using wavelet techniques [1–5] is very effective because of its ability to capture the energy of the signal with few transform coefficients. But it suffers from several fundamental shortcomings including lack of shift, orientation invariance and poor directional selectivity. Although wavelet transform is optimal for a large class of one-dimensional signals, it represents only point-singularities. It is less efficient for line and curve-singularities (edges), which represent the directional information in two-dimensional domain. So, ordinary wavelet transform is not optimal for denoising two-dimensional signals such as natural images.

To overcome this weakness of wavelets in high dimensions, researchers have recently considered multiscale and directional representations to capture the intrinsic geometrical structures such as smooth contours in natural images, and they have proposed a series of effective image denoising algorithms. Steerable wavelet [6], complex wavelet [7,8], curvelet [9,10] and ridgelet [11] are developed to represent functions sparsely that contain singular curves and surfaces in multi-dimensional space. However the high redundancy limits the application of these transforms in denoising applications.

The directional filter bank (DFB) [12] proposed by Bamberger and Smith, preserves sharp edges and geometrical structures with nonredundant representation which is suitable for denoising application. However DC energy leakage into the subbands affects the directional information. Do and Vetterli developed the contourlet transform (CT) [13,14], which is constructed by combining the Laplacian pyramid (LP) to remove the low frequency component and the directional filter bank (DFB). The contourlet transform is widely used in image denoising due to its properties like multiresolution, localization, directionality and anisotropy. However, contourlet transform lacks the shift invariance and produces false Gibbs distortion due to the sampling process. The nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) [15,16] is proposed by switching off the upsamplers and downsamplers in contourlet domain, which is fully shift-invariant, multiscale and multidirection expansion. The denoising performance of NSCT is poor due to the overcomplete representation of images. Several multiscale and multidirectional transforms proposed in [17–24] are fully shift invariant and introduce many artifacts in the denoising results. Its computation cost is much higher than that of the separable wavelet transform due to the necessity of many 2D filter bank for good orientation selectivity.

To alleviate these problems, we propose a hybrid wavelet quincunx diamond filter bank (HWQDFB), which is built upon wavelet filter bank (WFB) and quincunx diamond filter bank (QDFB). HWQDFB is a translation invariant, directional and multiresolution expansion that has similar frequency partition as other transforms. Initially the noisy image is decomposed into different subbands of frequency and orientation using HWQDFB. This transform can capture the edges and contours more effectively compared to wavelet transform. Gaussian scale mixture model is utilized to model the directional coefficients of the transform, to recover the noise-free image using Baye’s least squares estimator from the observation. The sharp frequency selectivity and high stopband attenuation with linear phase characteristics of Kaiser window eliminates the filter design problems in QDFB. The proposed hybrid structure reduces the computational complexity and provides an efficient directional representation based on the geometric structure of an image. This proposed method with various thresholding strategies are compared with other techniques.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the overview of proposed filter bank. Section 3 describes the design of two channel quincunx diamond filter bank. Section 4 covers the Gaussian scale mixture model of HWQDFB coefficients. Several experimental results are presented and discussed in Section 5. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.

The overview of the proposed hybrid filter bank is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The structure consists of two parts, a wavelet filter bank with DMeyer wavelet that ensures the multiscale property and a quincunx diamond filter bank (QDFB) for directionality. QDFB is designed with Kaiser Window having high stop-band attenuation and sharp cutoff frequency. Its basis functions have elongated supports rather than square supports as with 2D wavelets, which make it more efficient in describing curvature details along smooth contours. The structure increases the directionality with better edge preservation.

The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [25–27] is implemented with the separable 1D filtering along rows and columns followed by downsampling. Such separable systems are much easier to implement and reduces the computational complexity. The wavelet transform maps the function onto a scale-space plane. The analyzing function of the wavelet transform is chosen to produce large number of wavelet coefficients close to zero. The total number of non-negligible wavelet coefficients depends on the regularity of the image, the number of vanishing moment of ψ and the size of its support [25]. A wavelet function ψ has p vanishing moment if

                        j
                     . Therefore, the selection of wavelet filter depends on the tradeoff between the number of vanishing moment and the support size.

Wavelet filter bank (WFB) decomposes the image into low-low (LL), low-high (LH), high-low (HL) and high-high (HH) subbands. Since most of the energy is in the top left (LL) subband, the approximation coefficients obtained in the first level can be utilized for the next level of decomposition.

The Quincunx lowpass filter conserves horizontal and vertical frequencies, but it cuts off the diagonals to half of their original range. The diamond filter is a 2D half-band filter with symmetric frequency response about the point

HWQDFB is localized not only in position and scale but also in orientation. This localization provides surprising properties to this transform and makes it useful for image denoising application.

Our goal is to design the Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) imposing the Bezout identity (i.e., perfect reconstruction) and with other properties such as sharp frequency response, easy implementation and linear-phase. In this paper, we focus on the finite impulse response (FIR) case due to easy implementation and perfect reconstruction. The filters satisfy the Bezout identity as follows:

The linear phase filters preserve the shape of the signal within the passband and minimizes the effect of aliasing in each subband. The 1D linear phase half-band FIR filter is designed using Kaiser window [28–30] due to its high stopband attenuation, absence of ripples in the passband and narrow controllable transition width. FIR filter implementation reduces the computation cost because the 50% of the filter coefficients are zero. An effective and simple way to design 2D filters from 1D FIR filter is the mapping approach [31–34] equivalent to the generalized McClellan transformation [32]. The 1D FIR filter is designed with Kaiser Window based on prolate spheroidal functions. The window function ωk

The polyphase implementation reduces the computational complexity of the filter. The characteristics of 1D filter such as high stopband attenuation, good passband and low transition width are transferred to 2D Diamond filters.

Modeling the statistics of natural images is a challenging task, because of high dimensionality of the signal and the complexity of statistical structure. Statistical image models have been developed by transforming the image from the pixel domain to transform domain. The GSM model [4,5,35] represents the local variance fluctuations in neighborhoods of coefficients at different spatial locations, scales and orientations. This spatial inhomogeneity of the local variance represents the sparseness of the responses and amplitude coupling among neighbors.

Consider an image decomposed into oriented subbands at multiple scales by HWQDFB. The subband coefficients are statistically modeled as GSM model in which the parameters are governed by a hidden random field. GSM is the product of a Gaussian random vector and an independent hidden random scalar multiplier. Based on this assumption, a Bayes least squares estimate of the coefficients is derived. Let a random vector x be expressed as the product of zero mean Gaussian vector u and an independent positive scalar hidden random variable

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

To evaluate the performance of image denoising, two main aspects are considered: the amount of noise reduction and the preservation of image features. We use peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) as an “objective” measure of performance and visual quality as subjective measure to identify artifacts. We have tested the various denoising methods for a set of 8-bit grayscale images such as Lena, boat, circuit (256×256), peppers (512×512), corrupted by simulated additive Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation equal to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25. The HWQDFB decomposes the noisy images into approximation and detail Subbands using DMeyer wavelet and directional subbands using Kaiser Window based 2D diamond filters.

The performance of different denoising techniques can be quantitatively described by the PSNR (in dB) [8], and is defined as

The PSNR values on Lena, Boat, circuit and pepper image denoising with five different noise levels using Haar, db4, sym3 and DMeyer in conjunction with QDFB are given in Table 1
                        . For this comparison, global threshold is set three times the standard deviation of the noisy image. The table indicates that the result of our algorithm with DMeyer wavelet is better than the others due to its good time-frequency localization. Moreover DMeyer wavelet is symmetric, orthogonal and is infinitely differentiable due to FIR approximation. It is observed that for Lena image with noise density σ
                        =20, the PSNR obtained with our method is 0.9445dB greater than Haar wavelet. Haar wavelet is simple, discontinuous and has the shortest support among all orthogonal wavelets. It is not well adapted to approximate smoothing function since it has only one vanishing moment. Compared with symlet3 and Daubechies, PSNR obtained with the new method is still enhanced by 0.1484dB and 0.04dB respectively, Daubechies (db) wavelet has minimum size support for a finite number of vanishing moment but are asymmetric. Daubechies wavelets select the minimum phase square root such that the energy concentrates near the starting point of their support. The asymmetric nature of Daubechies wavelets can cause artifacts at borders of the wavelet subbands. Symlet wavelets are also orthogonal and compactly supported wavelets with a finite number of vanishing moment and near symmetric and are not energy preserving. With the increase of noise variance, PSNRs obtained with all these methods have a decrease trend, but PSNR obtained with the new method is still more than other methods and our method has the best performance for all noise levels.

The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in denoising applications using different diamond filters. Fig. 3

                        =20, the PSNR value of the proposed method with Kaiser window is about 0.2420dB greater than pkva filter. 0.2443dB greater than pkva6 filter, 0.2216dB greater than 9/7 filter, 0.4065 greater than 5/3 filter and 0.1841dB greater than maxflat filter. Thus, the proposed method has better denoising result compared with other filters at low noise densities and somewhat better performance than other filters at high noise densities due to the use of sharp frequency selectivity diamond filter.

The proposed denoising method has superior performance over other state-of-the-art denoising techniques; especially it can remove noise but preserve edge sharpness significantly. The proposed image denoising does not contain disturbing artifacts along edges. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method in terms of visual quality, it is compared with various diamond filters such as pkva, pkva6, 9/7, 5/3, maxflat filters and various wavelet filters like Haar, db4, sym3 and DMeyer. The comparison results for Lena image at noise density σ
                        =20 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5
                        
                        . Compared with DMeyer wavelet, other wavelet filters such as haar, db4 and sym3 will produce pseudo Gibbs artifacts in the denoised image thereby affecting visual quality of the image. The diamond lowpass filter such as 5/3, 9/7 and pkva filters have stopband edge greater than π/2, that contain aliasing artifacts in the passband region after downsampling. This results in scratch phenomena in the reconstructed image thereby affecting the visual quality of the image. The Kaiser window used in the proposed method has sharp frequency selectivity with normalized cut off frequency of 0.43 and

                         which enhance the visual quality of the image with better edge preservation.

We extend our comparison on other transform domain denoising algorithms. Orthogonal DWT, contourlet transform and nonsubsampled contourlet transform are the most competitive denoising methods in transform domain to the best of our knowledge. Similarly, in the below comparisons, we have also chosen the best denoising methods such as global thresholding, normal shrink and Bayes least squares Gaussian scale mixture model (BLS–GSM). The comparison results are shown in Table 2
                        . The PSNR value of the proposed method is greater than that of the DWT, contourlet and nonsubsampled contourlet transform for all test images. The directional highpass subbands of the proposed method have better correlation with image features than DWT, CT and NSCT in terms of PSNR.

Similarly the visual quality of the proposed method using BLS–GSM is better than that of the other thresholding methods such as global thresholding, normal shrink in wavelet domain and the results are shown in Fig. 6
                        .

The time complexity of the proposed method depends on the input size and computational complexity of the structure. Table 3
                         summarizes the CPU times of each of the four methods for the four test images. The computational complexity of the proposed method is less compared with other methods due to its simple structure (single level of DWT along with QDFB). The polyphase implementation of half-band symmetric FIR filter reduces the computational cost because 50% of the filter coefficients are zero. It can be observed that the details are preserved in our algorithm by removing unrelated pixels from the weighted average, which also reduces the computational complexity. Since the wavelet method needs more than two levels of decomposition to achieve good denoising performance, the computational complexity of DWT is high. The computational complexity of contourlet transform is the sum of the computational complexity of lapalacian pyramid and Directional filter bank. Similar to DWT, more than two level of decomposition is necessary. Computational complexity of CT is less than NSCT and DWT but greater than that of the proposed method. The execution of our denoising method takes about 4.25s for 512×512 gray scale images and about 10.4s for 1024×1024 gray scale images on a computer with Pentium (R) Dual-Core CPU speed of 2.50GHz and 2GB of memory, whereas NSCT takes 32.5s and 131.5s respectively on the same working conditions.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Better visual quality is always the aim of all kinds of image processing tasks. Most of the subsampled filter banks lack the feature of edge preservation. In this paper, we propose an edge preserving image denoising technique and present a filter bank framework HWQDFB, which integrates wavelet filter bank and diamond quincunx filter bank. The structure decomposes the image into a coarse image and detail subbands. This simple, multidirectional decomposition reduces the computational complexity. The proposed denoising method is based on Gaussian scale mixture model in hybrid wavelet quincunx diamond filter bank (HWQDFB) domain. The HWQDFB coefficients are statistically modeled with GSM. The denoised detail coefficients are obtained from noisy HWQDFB coefficients by using Bayes least square estimator.

The proposed framework is tested using images with diversified characteristics. Eventhough the number of directional subband is minimum, due to the selection of filter with high stopband attenuation and good passband characteristics, it decorrelates prominent features in images more efficiently and provides better denoising results in terms of PSNR and visual quality, also avoids the “ringing” effect due to transform domain shrinkage. The comparison of the denoising results of our method with the best state of-the-art denoising techniques, demonstrates the efficiency of our approach which gave the best output PSNRs for most of the images. Sharp frequency selectivity and high stopband attenuation of the proposed structure reduces the computational complexity and redundancy with better edge preservation. The symmetric property of the filters (DMeyer wavelet filter and Kaiser window based quincunx diamond filter) used in the proposed structure also reduces the computational complexity. At high noise densities, the visual quality of our denoised images is moreover characterized by fewer artifacts than the other methods. In future, by devising a suitable thresholding method, good denoising results can be obtained at high noise densities.
