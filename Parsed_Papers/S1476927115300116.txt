                     Yersinia organisms cause many infectious diseases by invading human cells and delivering their virulence factors via the type three secretion system (T3SS). One alternative strategy in the fight against these pathogenic organisms is to interfere with their T3SS. Previous studies demonstrated that thiol peroxidase, Tpx is functional in the assembly of T3SS and its inhibition by salicylidene acylhydrazides prevents the secretion of pathogenic effectors. In this study, the aim was to identify potential inhibitors of Tpx using an integrated approach starting with high throughput virtual screening and ending with molecular dynamics simulations of selected ligands. Virtual screening of ZINC database of 500,000 compounds via ligand-based and structure-based pharmacophore models retrieved 10,000 hits. The structure-based pharmacophore model was validated using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). After multistep docking (SP and XP), common scaffolds were used to find common substructures and the ligand binding poses were optimized using induced fit docking. The stability of the protein–ligand complex was examined with molecular dynamics simulations and the binding free energy of the complex was calculated. As a final outcome eight compounds with different chemotypes were proposed as potential inhibitors for Tpx. The eight ligands identified by a detailed virtual screening protocol can serve as leads in future drug design efforts against the destructive actions of pathogenic bacteria.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


                     Yersinia species, known to be facultative parasites, cause infectious diseases such as Yersiniosis (Smego et al., 1999) and plague, and autoimmune diseases like reactive arthritis and Crohn’s disease (Malekzadeh et al., 2009; Nikkari et al., 1992). These pathogenic organisms utilize the type III secretion system (T3SS) to transmit their powerful effectors into the host cytoplasm. These effectors inhibit the cellular signaling mechanism and prevent the defensive response in the host cell (Edgren et al., 2012). Therefore, disruption of the secretion effectors is an attractive alternative to the currently used antimicrobials and discovery of T3SS inhibitors is an area of increasing research interest (Nordfelth et al., 2005). After the discovery of salicylidene acylhydrazides as T3SS inhibitors (Nordfelth et al., 2005), the potential targets of this group of compounds were identified to be Tpx WrbA and FolX (Wang et al., 2011). The binding of one member to thiol peroxidase, Tpx in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was then demonstrated by NMR (Gabrielsen et al., 2012) suggesting that the mechanism of action for acylhydrazides may be via inhibition of Tpx. Tpx which belongs to the Thioredoxin superfamily, Peroxiredoxin family and Atypical 2-cysteine subfamily, regulates expression of T3SS and it enhances the bacterial defense system against reactive oxygen species by utilizing reducing forms of thioredoxin (Trx1) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) to reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. It also plays a key role in activation of transcription factors and signaling (Flohe et al., 2011). Two cysteine residues, C61 (resolving) and C95 (peroxidatic), form the redox active disulphide bond in Tpx. Tpx is a dimer in solution as shown by sedimentation equilibrium (SE) data (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). The active site residues that contribute to ligand binding have been determined by NMR (Gabrielsen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). The crystal structure of Tpx (Fig. 1
                     ) suggests that the binding pocket is mostly hydrophobic (Gabrielsen et al., 2012).

The aim of this study was to design novel and potent Tpx inhibitors via structure-based and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling followed by molecular docking approach. The selected hypothesis in the structure-based pharmacophore modeling was verified with high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS). The pharmacophore hypothesis was used to screen 500,000 compounds from the ZINC database. The selected molecules were docked by SP followed by XP mode by taking ligand flexibility into account. The compounds with high docking scores, low strain energy and favorable ADME properties were used in induced fit docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. The interactions of the compounds with the protein were analyzed in detail. As a final outcome, eight compounds from different chemotypes including n-benzylformamide, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene and phenoxyethanol were proposed as potential Tpx inhibitors.

All virtual screening applications for the discovery of potential Tpx inhibitors were carried out using Maestro interface of Schrodinger’s Small Drug Discovery Suite 2013 (Schrödinger, 2013) and the workflow of the proposed study is displayed in Fig. 2
                     .

In computer-aided drug design, combination of the results of multiple virtual screening protocols gives rise to high-quality lead compounds against a target protein (Tanrikulu et al., 2013; Wilson and Lill, 2011; Zander et al., 2010). In the current study, two different pharmacophore models were applied to obtain different chemotypes of inhibitors for Tpx.

Structure-based pharmacophore modeling involves an analysis of the chemical features of the active site and their relationships and a subsequent pharmacophore model assembly with selected features. In our study, a crystal structure (PDB code: 3ZRD) of oxidized Tpx receptor was used to generate a structure-based pharmacophore model, using the E-pharmacophores script. Protein structure was prepared via Protein Preparation Wizard (PPW) module. Missing hydrogens were added to heavy atoms and missing loops and side chains were filled (chain A residues: 4, 17, 141, 167, chain B residues: 17, 24, 26, 33, 67, 124, 167). No water molecules were included because there was no mention of important water mediated contacts in the literature. Hydrogen-bonding network was optimized by reorienting hydroxyl and thiol groups, amide groups of asparagines and glutamines, and imidazole ring of histidines. The energy was minimized by setting the maximum heavy atom RMSD to 0.30Å using the OPLS_2005 (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations) force field. Grid box was generated using Glide (Halgren et al., 2004) such that the center of the grid box was at the center of the Tpx active binding site including Leu 35 and Phe 89 residues of chain A and Phe 7, Phe 53, Pro 54, Thr 58, Cys 61, Val 65, Phe 94, Leu 127, Arg 133, Ile 153 and Thr 154 residues of chain B (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). A positional constraint with Isoleucine 153 residue which plays a significant role in the active binding site (Gabrielsen et al., 2012) was also added to the specified grid. After completing protein preparation and grid generation, a fragment library (Halgren et al., 2004), which includes 667 conformers of 441 unique fragments, was docked to Tpx using extra precision (XP) mode of Glide. Common features of the docked fragments were obtained by Phase and the E-pharmacophore script. Seven possible pharmacophore sites were ranked based on their energies as H1489, R2265, H1450, R1807, H1401, A577 and R2170 (hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrophobic (H), aromatic ring (R)). H1489, R2265 and H1401 sites were selected as HRH pharmacophore hypothesis by taking into account the distance between pharmacophore sites (Fig. 2 and Table S1).

HTVS of 500,000 molecules from the ZINC database was carried out to validate the selected hypothesis in structure-based pharmacophore modeling. Using positional constraint with Ile 153 residue, common features of the compounds were created. Seven pharmacophore sites were ranked as R1013, H597, R998, R1017, H637, P777 and H600 (positively charged group (P)). After evaluation of the distances between pharmacophore sites (Table S2), HRH hypothesis was selected using H597, R1013 and H600 sites.

27 active salicylidene acylhydrazide derivatives (9 compounds from (Nordfelth et al., 2005) and 18 molecules from (Dahlgren et al., 2010) which were previously shown to inhibit Tpx and display at least 40% inhibition at 50μ M ligand concentration were utilized for hypothesis generation via Phase (Dixon et al., 2006). LigPrep (Chen and Foloppe, 2010) was used to generate low-energy 3D structures of these ligands. All possible ionization states of ligands were generated at neutral pH and maximum 32 stereoisomers were generated for each ligand. The energy of the structures was minimized with ConfGen (Watts et al., 2010) and maximum 100 conformers per ligand were selected. Pharmacophore sites were generated by Phase. In this study, maximum five points were used to generate a ligand-based hypothesis because use of more points decreased the likelihood of finding common pharmacophores. Overall quality of each hypothesis was measured from its survival score which is a combination of alignment (site) score, vector score and volume score. Alignment (site) score is the root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) in the site-point positions. Vector score is the average cosine of the angles formed by corresponding pairs of vector features as acceptors, donors and aromatic rings in the structure. Volume score is the overlap of van der Waals spheres of the non-hydrogen atoms in each pair. Based on these evaluations, the hypothesis AADDR was chosen for virtual screening operations.

In our study, the pharmacophore hypotheses based on the Tpx structure or the 27 experimentally identified ligands (Nordfelth et al., 2005; Dahlgren et al., 2010) were utilized to screen 500,000 drug-like compounds, selected by Lipinski’s rule of five, from the ZINC database (Irwin et al., 2012). The compounds were sorted based on their fitness to selected hypothesis. Finally, 10,000 compounds with minimum fitness of 1.90 to HRH model and 10,000 compounds with minimum fitness of 1.25 to AADDR model were chosen for docking.

The 10,000 filtered molecules of each hypothesis were docked onto the Tpx structure using standard precision (SP) and extra precision (XP) of Glide 6.0 consecutively. Tpx dimer structure (PDB code: 3ZRD) was prepared and the grid was generated such that the active site residues mentioned in Section 2.1.1 were included. Maximum ten poses per compound were generated in both docking modes. Ligand poses were ranked based on GlideGscore, which is based on ChemScore (Friesner et al., 2004) and only best scoring hit was kept in final list. Top 10% of the docked ligands according to SP Gscore were docked using XP mode (1000 compounds). The threshold GlideGscore value for the ligands, which were then used in post-docking, was selected based on the distribution of the GlideGscores.

After docking, the high-ranking poses were analyzed based on efficiency indices, ligand strain, ADME properties and protein-ligand interactions. Ligands with high strain values due to rigid receptor docking were identified via ligand strain calculations of Strain-Rescore script. The ligands that had higher than 4kcal/mol energy difference between bound and free conformations received penalties and quarter of this energy difference was added to the GScore, resulting in corrected Gscore values. The ligands were further evaluated by calculations of the ligand efficiency index (LEI), which is the gibbs free energy per the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the compound, surface efficiency index (SEI), which monitors the potency gains as related to the increase in polar surface area (PSA) normalized by 100Å2 and binding efficiency index (BEI), which relates potency values to molecular weight on a per kilodalton scale, and by comparison with the reference values of BEI and SEI in literature (Metz and Abad-Zapatero, 2005; Abad-Zapatero, 2007; Perisic et al., 2010; Hopkins et al., 2014). The pharmacokinetic properties for absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism (ADME) (Milic et al., 2014) were evaluated using QikProp module (Ioakimidis et al., 2008). The residues that interact with the ligands were identified.

To identify a diverse set of chemical scaffolds as potential inhibitors, the similarity between compounds with docking scores higher than −7kcal/mol, while the GlideGscores of 1000 compounds were between −9.7kcal/mol and −1.2kcal/mol, was determined using hierarchical clustering and scaffold decomposition in the Canvas module (Duan et al., 2010; Sastry et al., 2010). The common scaffolds of the ligands with favorable BEI values were picked out and the ZINC database was screened with that scaffold again in order to obtain additional high scoring ligands which were missed in the pharmacophore filtering stage (Xu et al., 2012).

After identification of a set of compounds, their binding mode was further examined by IFD. Initially, Glide XP docking of chosen hits to the rigid receptor was performed. Prime was used to generate maximum 20 poses for each ligand and the residues within 5Å of 20 poses. Receptor side chain flexibility was introduced while the coordinates of other residues and the backbone remained fixed. Finally, the ligands were rigorously redocked in Glide XP mode into the lowest energy induced fit receptor structure with no scaling (vdW scaling of 1) and their final scores were obtained.

Relative binding affinities of ligands to the Tpx were computed based on the interaction and desolvation of components using Prime MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics—Generalized Born Solvent Accessible Surface Area) panel (Hayes et al., 2011). Binding free energy in the MM-GBSA formulation is calculated by subtracting the free energy of the Tpx-ligand complex from the sum of the free energy values for Tpx and the ligand. The free energy of each molecular system includes total molecular mechanics energy in the gas phase, solvation free energy and entropy terms. Total molecular mechanics energy is the sum of the internal (bonded), and electrostatic and van der Waals energies (non-bonded). The solvation free energy contains polar and non-polar contributions. The polar interactions are derived from Poisson–Boltzmann model and the non-polar interactions are related to the solvent-accessible surface area.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the protein-ligand complex using Desmond module and the OPLS 2005 force field. The simulation system included the protein, ligand, explicit solvent and counter ions. The ligand was immersed in an orthorhombic box (417715Å3) of TIP3P water model (solvent) including 11234 water molecules. Nine Na+ ions were added to neutralize the overall charge of the simulated system. Sodium chloride was also added at a concentration of 0.15M. At the beginning of the simulation process, the system energy was minimized. Then, at 10K, two consecutive relaxation processes, one with the NVT ensemble and the other with the NPT ensemble at 1atm, were performed followed by equilibration using NPT ensemble at 300K and 1atm for a 48ps run. A cutoff radius of 9Å and an integration time step of 2fs were applied for the long-range electrostatic interactions and the bonds including hydrogen atoms, respectively. After the relaxation protocol, simulation of the protein-ligand complex was carried out in a 50ns run.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Potential Tpx inhibitors were identified via pharmacophore modeling, docking and substructure search. The pharmacophore models, which were generated either based on the binding site structure or based on a set of previously identified Tpx inhibitors, were used to filter the ZINC database based on the 3D similarity to the selected pharmacophore hypothesis. Molecular docking by Glide was applied to predict the binding modes of the compounds in the filtered database. Strain energy, ADME and druglikeness properties, similarity and efficiency indices were calculated to filter the compounds obtained from docking operations. Common scaffolds in the top scoring hits were identified via Canvas, and substructure search with the selected scaffold was carried out to filter the database and obtain other compounds. The surviving hits were analyzed via induced fit docking and molecular dynamics simulation and were proposed as potential inhibitors of Tpx.

Potential Tpx inhibitors were primarily obtained using structure-based routes comprising pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking. The ZINC database was screened with the selected hypothesis and then, the filtered compounds were docked to Tpx structure.

Structure-based pharmacophore sites were created by unconstrained docking of small fragments to the binding site of Tpx receptor. Via the information from binding modes and energetic terms of 441 unique fragments (667 conformers), seven pharmacophore sites were determined by E-Pharmacophores script of Phase. The coordinates, ranks, scores and types of seven sites are given in Table S1. The pharmacophore sites included three hydrophobic groups consistent with the information that the binding pocket is mostly hydrophobic (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). Since the pharmacophore model becomes more restrictive as the number of sites increases, hypothesis with three sites was selected in order to eliminate as few compounds as possible from the database. Consequently, the hypothesis based on the rank and inner-site distances was created using H1489, R2265 and H1401 (HRH hypothesis). HRH hypothesis in the binding site of Tpx structure and the distances between the hypothesis sites are shown in Fig. 3
                           . High throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of 500,000 compounds from the ZINC database was performed to generate a structure based pharmacophore hypothesis and the HRH hypothesis was still found to be the optimum hypothesis. The similarity of the hypotheses generated by E-pharm and HTVS can be seen in Fig. S1 in which the two hypotheses are superimposed.

After verification of the hypothesis by the two structure based methods, ZINC database was filtered with HRH hypothesis and 10,000 ligands with minimum fitness of 1.90 were passed to docking step.

10 000 compounds obtained from the virtual screening step were docked to the Tpx active site in SP mode using Ile 153 interaction as a positional constraint. 995 molecules with SP score between −8.5 and −2.1kcal/mol were then used in XP docking. The GlideGscore values of the 995 compounds (Fig. S2) were between −9.1 and −2.4kcal/mol and the distribution showed a relatively sharp decrease to −7.0kcal/mol followed by a significantly smaller decrease. Therefore, GlideGscore of −7kcal/mol was selected as the cutoff value and 55 compounds survived.

The binding efficiency index (BEI) and surface efficiency index (SEI) values of the 55 compounds were calculated based on the descriptive equations (Metz and Abad-Zapatero, 2005; Abad-Zapatero, 2007; Perisic et al., 2010; Hopkins et al., 2014) (Fig. S3). The compounds were placed above the diagonal line in the BEI versus SEI plot suggesting that the inhibitors were mostly polar despite the filtering by the HRH pharmacophore model, which is hydrophobic.

The ligands with more than 4kcal/mol energy difference between bound and free conformations received ligand strain penalty. As a result, 20 compounds were eliminated. The remaining 35 compounds were further analyzed for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties. ADME properties of three hits were outside the acceptable range of FISA and WPSA, the hydrophilic and weakly polar components of solvent accessible surface area (SASA), respectively. 32 compounds remained after this step (Table S3).

The protein–ligand interactions were obtained by the Structure Interaction Fingerprint Tool (SIFT) (Deng et al., 2004) of Schrodinger. All ligands made side chain hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu 156. Furthermore, twelve ligands made hydrogen bonds with the Ser 55 backbone and nine ligands made hydrogen bonds with Ile 153 backbone. Also, seven ligands made π–π stacking interactions with Phe 89.

These 32 compounds were examined by pairwise similarity based on the Tanimoto Coefficient (TC) (Ajay et al., 1998). Compounds with higher than 0.4 pairwise similarity values were divided into three clusters (Cluster 1: ZINC40984430, ZINC40984473 and ZINC08456196, Cluster 2: ZINC40959674 and ZINC40959641, Cluster 3: ZINC12371164, ZINC12371364 and ZINC19169013) with single-linkage hierarchical clustering via Canvas module. BEI and SEI values of the compounds in the clusters were displayed in Fig. S4. The compounds of cluster 3 had high BEI values implying more drug-likeness (Hopkins et al., 2014; Ripphausen et al., 2012). In addition, BEI and SEI values of the compounds in cluster 1 were close to each other and higher than the values of the compounds in cluster 2. Fig. 4
                            displays the binding site of Tpx and the compatibility of HRH hypothesis with representative ligands of clusters 1 and 3. The common scaffold of each cluster (1 and 3) and seven compounds with high BEI values were used as query in substructure search of the ZINC database (Table S4). Substructure search with the high ranking compounds did not yield any new compounds but using the chemical scaffolds of cluster 1 and cluster 3 yielded a novel set of compounds that were initially missed due to low fitness to the HRH pharmacophore model.

The substructure search with the scaffold of cluster 1 (Table S4), which includes n-benzylformamide, generated 1350 hits. Docking of these molecules resulted in GlideGscores between −9.5 and −2.4kcal/mol. 1222 of these ligands were not obtained in the first hit set found from the molecular docking followed by filtering with HRH hypothesis. Since the three ligands in cluster 1 had GlideGscores between −8.3 and −7.1kcal/mol and the average GlideGscore value of the 32 hits retrieved from HRH hypothesis was −7.6kcal/mol, the cutoff value in substructure search was set to −8.0kcal/mol and 17 hits were retrieved. 15 of these hits were not obtained in the hit set retrieved from the docking of HRH hypothesis since their fitness scores were lower than the minimum fitness score of 10,000 filtered compounds. Strain-energy values of these 17 hits were calculated and 14 ligands were eliminated. The remaining three novel ligands were further analyzed for druglikeness and ADME properties. No violations to these properties existed. These three ligands made side chain hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu 156. Two out of three ligands also made backbone hydrogen bonding interactions with Ile 153 and Asp 57.

When the common scaffold of cluster 3 (Table S4), 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, which is used as a sedative, was used in substructure search of ZINC database, 3024 hits were found and GlideGscores between −9.7 and −2.0kcal/mol were obtained after docking. 82 of these ligands had Gscores higher than −8kcal/mol. After eliminating 57 ligands due to high strain, the remaining 25 compounds were further analyzed for ADME properties. These 25 molecules, which were not obtained in the first round of docking, had no violations to ADME properties. The surviving 25 ligands interacted mostly with Ile 153, Glu 156, Ser 55 and Ala 62 residues of Tpx. 24 out of 25 ligands made side chain hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu 156. 8 hits made backbone hydrogen bonding interactions with Ser 55 and Ile 153. Six ligands made backbone hydrogen bonding interactions with Ala 62.

The properties of the final hits obtained by substructure searches of clusters 1 and 3 with strain-corrected docking scores and their locations on Tpx binding site with the representative ligands of cluster 1 (ZINC40984430) and cluster 3 (ZINC12371164) of HRH hypothesis are given in Table S5, Table S6 and Fig. 5
                           .

At the end of structure-based methods, 60 compounds; comprising 32 molecules retrieved in the first round and 28 compounds retrieved in the second round were identified.

Potential Tpx inhibitors were also obtained using ligand-based pharmacophore modeling followed by molecular docking. Docking of 10,000 filtered compounds with selected hypothesis resulted in the second set of potential hits.

Salicylidene acylhydrazide group of compounds were previously shown by NMR to bind to Tpx (Gabrielsen et al., 2012). In order to test whether similar compounds would also bind to Tpx and potentially inhibit it, the salicylidene acylhydrazide type inhibitors of T3SS were used to build ligand-based pharmacophore models. 2D structures of 27 experimentally identified inhibitors in previous studies (Nordfelth et al., 2005; Dahlgren et al., 2010) were converted into 3D via LigPrep with different tautomerization and ionization states at neutral pH. For twenty-seven inhibitors, 570 energetically minimized conformers were generated by ConfGen and were docked to Tpx using Glide XP without any constraints. For each inhibitor, the conformer with the highest GlideGscore value was retained for protein–ligand interaction analysis. For the 27 inhibitors, GlideGscores of their highest ranked conformer and the key interactions that they make with Tpx are listed in Table S7. Average GlideGscore of the 27 inhibitors was −6.11kcal/mol and the key interactions were observed between Glu 156, Ile 153, Ser 55 and Phe 53 residues of the Tpx receptor and the ligands. The location of high ranking ligands in the Tpx dimer interface is shown in Figure S5. Five-point hypothesis AADDR with two hydrogen acceptors (A), two hydrogen donors (D) and one ring group (R) gave the best three-dimensional alignment to the compounds in terms of site, volume, vector and total survival scores. AADDR site points matched with compound 17 (Dahlgren et al., 2010) as 3.00 fitness value (Fig. 6
                           ). The pharmacophore model was used to search the ZINC database and to reduce the database to 10,000 hits with fitness values between 2.90 and 1.25.

10,000 ligands that matched the AADDR hypothesis were docked to Tpx in SP and XP modes with a positional constraint on Isoleucine 153 and 1000 compounds with GlideGscore values between −9.7 and −1.2kcal/mol (Figure S6) were obtained. As the docking scores showed a relatively sharp decrease to −7.0kcal/mol, the GlideGscore cutoff value of −7.0kcal/mol (consistent with structure-based docking) was used for the hits of AADDR hypothesis resulting in 123 ligands.

46 of the 123 hits were eliminated due to high ligand strain and six others were discarded due to ADME violations. 71 hits with high GlideGscores and good ADME properties were obtained. Finally 71 hits with high GlideGscores and good ADME properties remained. Evaluation of the BEI and SEI values showed that the inhibitors were polar. The properties and docking scores of the final 71 ligands are given in Table S8.

The surviving 71 ligands interacted mostly with Ile 153, Glu 156, Ser 55, Phe 89 and Asp 57 of Tpx. 53 ligands out of 71 ligands made side chain hydrogen bonds with Glu 156. 35 hits made backbone hydrogen bonds with Ser 55. Furthermore, 21 ligands made π–π stacking interaction with Phe 89.

The 71 compounds were clustered based on Tanimoto Coefficient (TC) and eight clusters comprising compounds with more than 0.4 similarity were identified using single-linkage hierarchical clustering via Canvas module (Table S9). BEI and SEI values of the compounds in all clusters are shown in Fig. S7. BEI and SEI values of the compounds in clusters 2, 3, 6 and 7 were similar and higher than the values of the compounds in other clusters. Thus, clusters 2, 3, 6 and 7 were selected for substructure search. The consistency of representative ligands of each cluster with the AADDR hypothesis is displayed in Fig. S8.

Finally, the common scaffold of each cluster (2, 3, 6 and 7) and four compounds with high BEI values were used as query in substructure search of the ZINC database (Table S10). The compounds identified by substructure search with the scaffolds of cluster 3, 6 and 7 had high strain energy violations and poor docking scores (lower than −8.0kcal/mol). The substructure search based on the high BEI compounds yielded no new compounds due to their large size. Only using the chemical scaffold of cluster 2 yielded a novel set of compounds that were missed in the previous step due to low fitness to AADDR hypothesis.

After ZINC database was screened with the scaffold of cluster 2 (Table S10), which includes phenoxyethanol that is used in cosmetics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals as a preservative, 110 hits were found with GlideGscores between −8.7 and −3.1kcal/mol and an average fitness value of 1.16. Out of 110 hits, 96 were different from the 1000 hits retrieved by molecular docking of ligands based on AADDR hypothesis. Five ligands had GlideGscores better than −8.0kcal/mol and three of these five hits were not obtained in the hit set retrieved from the docking followed by filtering with AADDR hypothesis. Two of these ligands were eliminated due to high strain energy. The three ligands showed good ADME properties. The properties of the final three hits, which were different from the 1000 hits based on AADDR hypothesis, are given in Table S11. The consistency of binding conformations of final hits with the representative ligand of cluster 2 is displayed in Fig. S9. These three ligands made backbone hydrogen bonds with Ile 153 and side chain hydrogen bonds with Glu 156.

60 hits with average molecular weight (MW) of 372Da and standard deviation of 18.43Da were obtained via the structure-based pharmacophore modeling route while 74 hits with average MW of 366Da and standard deviation of 14.76Da were obtained via the ligand-based pharmacophore modeling path. 60 hits had an average FOSA (hydrophobic component of SASA) of 359.22 with standard deviation of 8.92 and octanol-water partition coefficient (QPlogPo/w) of 3.23 with standard deviation of 1.02 whereas 74 hits had an average FOSA of 216.48 with standard deviation of 13.71 and QPlogPo/w of 2.34 with standard deviation of 1.57. Despite having similar average sizes, the molecules from the structure-based route are more hydrophobic as indicated by their average FOSA and octanol-water partition coefficient values. This is an expected result because the structure-based pharmacophore model includes two hydrophobic sites and one ring whereas the ligand-based pharmacophore model includes two acceptors, two donors and one ring.

The pool of ligands retrieved from ligand-based (74 hits) and structure-based (60 hits) pharmacophore models were further analyzed to find most drug-like compounds based on docking scores, fitness values to the hypothesis, molecular weight, percentage of human oral absorption (HOA) and BEI values. The selection of final hits was optimized using the following simple scoring scheme based on the contribution of each factor equally:
                           
                              Final selection score=0.25 Glide Gscore+0.25 Fitness+0.25 HOA+0.25 BEI
                           
                        
                     

Via these optimization criteria, 14 hits from structure-based and 17 hits from ligand-based pharmacophore models were selected (Table 1
                        ) The summary of the interactions of these final 31 hits is displayed in Table S12.

Eventually, eight ligands with high docking scores, good fitness to hypotheses and high BEI values, 1, 4, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 26 were selected. These proposed compounds were analyzed for their interactions with the Tpx binding site residues. Binding modes of the proposed ligands and the binding site residues that interact with the ligand are shown in Fig. 7
                        .

The agreement between these ligands and the hypothesis sites is given in Table S13. Comparison of these eight ligands, four of which were obtained based on structure and four of which were obtained starting with salicylidene acylhydrazide group of compounds, shows that the hydrophobic dimer interface formed by residues Phe 89 and Leu 35 from one chain and Ser 55, Phe 7 and Leu 127 from the other is occupied by a ring and the Glu 156 side chain is in interaction with a cationic nitrogen in all of them. These eight ligands were further examined by induced fit docking, binding free energy calculations, MD simulations and selectivity analysis.

The binding conformations of the proposed eight ligands were assessed by allowing side chain flexibility in addition to the ligand flexibility during docking. The highest IFD scored poses for each ligand as well as rigid docking scores and their interactions with Tpx are displayed in Table 2
                        . For the compounds 4, 12 and 26, IFD score was high despite having relatively low rigid docking scores. Thus, the selection of proposed compounds based on not only good docking and fitness scores but also low molecular weight, high BEI and% HOA values allowed the inclusion of additional potent compounds.

For example, the binding score for ligand 26 increased considerably from −7.40kcal/mol to −10.56kcal/mol upon IFD. Its binding modes in the presence and absence of protein flexibility and its interaction maps with the binding site residues are displayed in Fig. 8
                        . Superimposition results of the conformations of rigid docked form and highest docking scored IFD poses for each ligand are displayed in Fig. S10.

Furthermore, for each ligand, the top 10 poses with the best IFD scores were compared with each other to obtain information on the variance amongst the conformations. The averaged values of RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) between top pose and the other poses for each ligand were lower than 1Å and the variance amongst the poses increased as the IFD scores of the eight ligands reduced (Table S14, Fig. S11). These results suggest that the proposed eight ligands can bind to Tpx in a stable interaction mode.

The proposed compounds made interactions mostly with Ile 153, Ser 55, Glu 156 and Phe 89 residues similar to the 27 experimentally identified ligands. Furthermore, the docking scores were higher than those of the experimental ligands, possibly suggesting the proposed ligands may bind to Tpx favorably.

The Prime MM-GBSA panel was used to estimate the relative binding affinity of the final eight ligands. The binding free energies of ligands (MMGBSA dG Bind) were positively correlated with IFD GlideGscores except for ligand 1 (Fig. 9
                        , Table S15).

Ligand 26 makes important interactions both after rigid docking and after IFD, and it is surrounded by residues at the dimer interface. To check the stability of the complex with this compound, 50ns MD simulation was performed using Desmond module at 300K and 1atm. Total and potential energy of the system in the simulation are also shown in Figure S12. In the initial structure (IFD pose), the ligand is surrounded mostly by chain B residues, with the hydrazine group making hydrogen bond interactions with Ile 153 and Glu 156, the benzylamino group has a pi stacking interaction with Phe53 and the phenylamino group is surrounded by a hydrophobic group of residues including Phe 7, Pro 54, Leu 127 and Leu 130 and makes π–π stacking interaction with Phe 7. The phenylamino group maintains this position between the hydrophobic residues of chain B throughout the simulation. After 45ns of simulation, the hydrazine group switches from interacting with Arg 133 and Glu 156 of chain B, to pointing toward the Arg 93 (chain A)—Asp 57 (chain B) bridge and it moves to the dimer interface (Fig. S13).

In summary, IFD, binding free energy and MD simulation results indicate that ligand 26 makes strong and favorable interactions with Tpx at the dimer interface.

The off-target activity of ligands was analyzed to determine selectivity of the selected ligands for Tpx. hERG potassium channel protein (PDB code: 1BYW), which is responsible for repolarization in cardiac cells and substrates block it, cardiac arrhythmias can occur (Vaz, 2008) and human cytochrome P450 receptor (PDB code: 1W0E), which is primarily responsible for the metabolism (degradation and elimination) of drugs (Lynch and Price, 2007), were utilized in selectivity analysis.

To verify that the proposed ligands are selective for Tpx the eight ligands were docked to these proteins in XP mode without any constraint. The grid was generated using binding site residues of each protein (Morais Cabral et al., 1998; Williams et al., 2004). Docking results and interactions of eight compounds with each protein are displayed in Table S16 and Table S17. Average docking scores of ligands were −2.53kcal/mol for hERG receptor and −4.14kcal/mol for human cytochrome P450 protein. Furthermore, the proposed ligands did not make interactions with the active site residues. The low GlideGscore and poor interaction results indicate that the proposed ligands are selective for Tpx.

The binding potential of the eight ligands for WrbA (PDB code: 2R96) and FolX (PDB code: 4AEY), which can be potentially targeted in T3SS inhibition (Wang et al., 2011), was also analyzed. The proposed ligands were docked to these proteins in XP mode without any constraint by using the active site residues of WrbA (Tyr 11, Arg 78, Phe 79, Gly 94, Thr 115, Tyr 142, Asp 168 and Gly 169) (Wolfova et al., 2009) and of FolX (Arg 12, Arg 17, Leu 36, Thr 40, Glu 100, Pro 105 and Val 115) (Beckham et al., 2012). The low GlideGscores (−3.77kcal/mol for WrbA and −3.43kcal/mol for FolX in average) and poor interaction of eight ligands with the proteins suggest that these eight ligands are selective for Tpx (Table S18, Table S19).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

An integrated workflow starting with pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking followed by substructure search of ZINC database with the common scaffolds obtained after docking was applied to identify potential Tpx inhibitors. Two kinds of pharmacophore models, structure-based, HRH which is validated by HTVS, based on the information of the active binding site, and ligand-based, AADDR, based on the previously identified Tpx inhibitors, were built to screen novel Tpx inhibitors. After molecular docking, 103 compounds in total were identified as putative inhibitors. In addition, substructure search of common scaffolds of clusters including n-benzylformamide (Itou et al., 2003), 1,2-dimethoxybenzene (a sedative and commonly known as veratrol (Mori et al., 2006)) and phenoxyethanol (a preservative in cosmetics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals (Spaulding et al., 2013)) was used to retrieve additional novel ligands, ZINC55099370 (Table S5), and ZINC12298678 (Table S6), which had 1.35 and 1.30 fitness to HRH hypothesis and ZINC13810798 (Table S11), which had 1.23 fitness to AADDR hypothesis. Thus, the substructure search based on the scaffolds identified after docking revealed new compounds which did not fall into the first sets of 10 000 compounds retrieved from database searches. As a final outcome, a total of 31 compounds based on high docking score, favorable fitness value to pharmacophore model, low molecular weight, high BEI and% HOA values were obtained. Out of 31 molecules, eight ligands from different chemotypes which had high docking score, fitness and BEI value were proposed as potential inhibitors for Tpx. Induced fit docking was performed to find favorable binding conformations for selected eight ligands. The most significant movements were observed for Ile 153, Glu 156 and Phe 53 residues. Throughout the MD simulation, the ligand binds to Tpx in the region close to the dimer interface. The similarity between proposed ligands and 27 previously identified inhibitors were lower than 0.3 suggesting that a new class of chemotypes for Tpx inhibition have been obtained. Out of these eight ligands, 4 is an trypanothione (parasite analog of glutathione) reductase inhibitor (Horvath, 1997). Our results provide a new set of compounds for in vitro and in vivo experiments. If the efficacy of these compounds can be experimentally verified, these lead compounds will guide drug design efforts in fighting with pathogenic bacteria.
