                  The linear source-filter model of speech production assumes that the source of the speech sounds is independent of the filter. However, acoustic simulations based on the physical speech production models show that when the fundamental frequency of the source harmonics approaches the first formant of the vocal tract filter, the filter has significant effects on the source due to the nonlinear coupling between them. In this study, two interactive system models are proposed under the quasi steady Bernoulli flow and linear vocal tract assumptions. An algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters. Glottal flow and the linear vocal tract parameters are found by conventional methods. Rosenberg model is used to synthesize the glottal waveform. A recursive optimization method is proposed to find the parameters of the interactive model. Finally, glottal flow produced by the nonlinear interactive system is computed. The experimental results show that the interactive system model produces fine details of glottal flow source accurately.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The human speech production system involves lungs, trachea, vocal cords, pharynx, oral tract, nasal tract, tongue and lips. The brain controls the production process, while other organs form the time-varying aerodynamic and acoustic subsystems. Based on the physics of speech production, the aerodynamic and acoustic subsystems are the basis of current articulatory speech synthesizers which mimic the human vocal system.

The aerodynamic part of the speech production system involves the interaction of airflow and tissue structure of vocal folds. To investigate the interaction effects on the vibration of vocal folds, the Navier–Stokes nonlinear differential equations need to be solved on the complex soft tissue structure of the vocal folds with a set of appropriate boundary conditions (Alipour et al., 2000; Jungsoo and Frankel, 2007, 2008; Zheng et al., 2009). Due to the high complexity of vocal fold tissue dynamics and high time consumption of finite element based methods, instead of using numerical simulation, excised canine vocal folds or kinematic solid physical models of vocal folds have been used to investigate the aerodynamic system (Alipour and Scherer, 1995, 2006; Khosia et al., 2007, 2008). For articulatory speech synthesis, the aerodynamic system is generally modeled by the combination of a bio-mechanical structure that models tissue elasticity and an airflow model. These models work based on the myoelastic aerodynamic theory of phonation (Van den Berg, 1958; Titze, 2006a). They can be classified as low dimensional, such as one mass, two mass, sixteen mass etc, and high dimensional models like point mass models. Their inputs are lung pressure, elasticity, mass and friction of vocal folds, and the output is the glottal area. In addition to these input variables, acoustic loading of vocal tract or supraglottal input pressure can also be used as an input to the aerodynamic system so that the acoustic–aerodynamic interaction can also be taken into account (Zanartu et al., 2007).

The acoustical part of the speech production system represents the transmission and radiation of sound generated by the vocal folds or by a turbulence at a constriction in the vocal tract. It is usually assumed that the sound propagation is one dimensional and linear except at the glottis and constrictions where nonlinear effects cannot be neglected (Sondhi and Schroeter, 1999). In the articulatory synthesizers, the vocal tract and trachea are considered as a concatenation of uniform tubes with either equal or different lengths depending on the acoustic simulation type. Since, in linear acoustics, sound propagation in a tube depends on the cross-sectional area and the length, in order to simulate the acoustics in the vocal tract, these parameters are calculated from 3D MRI images of the vocal tract. Therefore, the inputs of acoustic subsystem are pressure or flow sources, cross-sectional areas and tube lengths and its output is acoustic pressure distribution in the vocal tract and radiated speech pressure wave.

Most of the current articulatory speech synthesis methods rely on two assumptions, quasi-steady flow at the glottis and linear vocal tract. Simulations based on these assumptions show that glottal flow is affected by the vocal tract acoustic loading if the vocal tract impedance is comparable to the acoustic glottis impedance; in other words, supraglottal pressure is comparable to subglottal pressure (Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982; Titze, 2006a). Studies (Ishizaka and Flanagan, 1972; Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982; Titze, 1984, 2008) showed two major effects of this interaction; superimposed ripple on the glottal flow and skewness of the glottal flow with respect to glottal area. These are called as level-I effects by Titze (2008).

Despite the fact that the research on the physics of speech production has been continuing for a considerable amount of time, the acquired knowledge has not been utilized extensively in the development of speech signal models. The linear source-filter model has been used dominantly for about half a century. It is applied in many speech related applications ranging from speech synthesis to speaker recognition. On the other hand, it is a quite simplified approximation of the speech production system. It assumes that glottal flow is independent from vocal tract acoustics. However, this assumption is good only for low pitch male speech (Titze, 2008). The simulations of physical speech production models show that glottal flow waveform is significantly affected by the vocal tract acoustics when the fundamental frequency (F0) of the glottal flow approaches the first formant (F1) of vocal tract. (It is illustrated in Section 2.) For example, these effects might be important especially in emotional speech synthesis due to the fact that depending on the emotional state of the speaker, the fundamental frequency (F0) of voice source can increase (or decrease) while F1 is fixed or even decreases. The physical simulation results suggest that if the fundamental frequency of a speech signal is to be altered, the changes in the glottal flow waveform due to the interaction between the source and the filter should be considered. This knowledge obtained from the physical simulations is not used in fundamental frequency modification methods. It might be one of the reasons why the perceived quality of modified speech decreases when using TD-PSOLA (Bulut and Narayanan, 2008). An interactive source-filter model can make it possible to use this information in speech processing applications.

The aim of this study is, based on the existing knowledge of the physics of speech production, to develop an interactive source-filter model that takes the level-I effects of nonlinear interaction of the source and the filter into account. In particular, a way of combining the glottal nonlinearity to the linear model of vocal tract, to produce the glottal flow, is introduced. The proposed nonlinear interactive source-filter model is based on the quasi-steady glottal flow and linear vocal tract assumptions. It is an extension of the linear source-filter model with a capability of producing level-I interaction effects. We show that the proposed nonlinear model can be used in either interactive or non-interactive mode by using a control parameter.

The parameters of the interactive system can be estimated by solving a combination of nonlinear blind estimation and parameter optimization problems. We propose a parameter estimation algorithm that yields a stable nonlinear interactive system model, which always performs better than the classical linear model.

The literature on source-filter interaction is dominated by the simulation of the speech production system by using the directly measured physical quantities like vocal tract areas and mechanical parameters of vocal folds. The glottal flow waveforms produced by the proposed models are investigated. In this work, a nonlinear discrete-time system model is developed to solve the inverse problem, i.e., estimation of glottal flow from speech. The estimate is evaluated by comparing the estimated glottal flow to that obtained by linear inverse filtering.

The rest of this article begins by a review of the source-filter interaction in voiced speech in Section 2. The dependence of the glottal flow on the vocal tract shape and vocal fold vibration frequency (F0) is demonstrated by using simple vocal fold and vocal tract models. Section 3 describes the assumptions on the source-filter model. Section 4 introduces the proposed interactive source-filter model (ISFM). An extended interactive model that takes subglottal loading into consideration is described in Section 4. In Section 5, a parameter estimation algorithm for the interactive model is proposed and, in Section 6, it is applied on a short speech segment. In Section 6, proposed interactive and classic noninteractive source-filter models are compared on a large speech database using Rosenberg+ source model. The Rosenberg+ glottal flow model is extended to an interactive source model that has the capability of producing fine details of glottal flow waveform. The interactive Rosenberg+ model is compared to the non-interactive Rosenberg+ model on the glottal flow estimates obtained from closed phase analysis of a large speech database. Finally, Section 7 provides a conclusion for the study.

Nonlinear source-filter interaction has been studied by simulation, using acoustic and/or biomechanical models of vocal system. Due to the nonlinearity of the glottal impedance it can be simulated in time domain (Story, 1995). The one mass and the two mass models of Ishizaka and Flanagan (1972) are among the first models that take into account the source-filter interaction. They solved the transmission line circuit analog (Fant, 1960; Flanagan, 1965; Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982; Birkholz et al., 2007) of vocal system by the finite difference method. Their results demonstrate the acoustic interaction effects, skewness of glottal flow and superimposed ripple on it.


                     Rothenberg (1981) studied the acoustic interaction between the glottal source and vocal tract with a simple impedance based model of vocal tract linearly coupled to the time-varying glottal impedance. The results show that the interaction effects are noticeable when the glottal impedance is comparable to the vocal tract input impedance. In particular, the vocal tract inertia is responsible for skewness of glottal flow with respect to the glottal area while the vocal tract resistance changes the amplitude of the glottal flow waveform.


                     Ananthapadmanabha and Fant (1982) used lumped approximation of vocal tract, trachea and glottis in order to investigate the effects of nonlinear interaction on the glottal flow for different vowels. They use various configurations for the coupling of the vocal tract and trachea and solve the nonlinear system of equations by an iterative algorithm. It is concluded that the waveform of the interactive glottal flow is different for different vowels and depends more on the vocal tract resonances than subglottal resonances. They also proposed a model that approximates the nonlinear source filter coupling by varying vocal tract formants and their bandwidths in accordance with the variation of glottal area in time.

In the hybrid time-frequency articulatory speech synthesis method, Sondhi and Schroeter (1987) used a different approach. The impulse response at the input of the vocal tract is found from the frequency response obtained from vocal tract areas (subglottal part is neglected) and then it is combined with the vocal fold acoustics. However, they report that the impulse response of vocal tract is very long and it is not always possible to calculate the interactive glottal flow. Hence, they follow another approach using the input reflectance of the vocal tract (frequency domain representation of reflection coefficients) similar to that in the wave-reflection method.


                     Liljencrants (1985), Titze (1984, 2002, 2004, 2006b, 2008), Titze and Story (1997), Story (1995) and Zanartu et al. (2007) used the wave-reflection method which works based on particle flow and pressure variations along the subglottal, supraglottal tract and glottis. For the coupling at the glottis, Titze proposed a mathematical model based on the quasi steady Bernoulli flow assumption. It is essentially the glottal flow equation used in other approaches (Titze, 1984; Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982), however it represents the glottal flow in terms of particle velocity (instead of volume velocity).

The simulation of the interactive system model via wave-reflection method is a time-domain approach. The calculation of the parameter values is easy, and, in particular, the frequency dependent losses of the vocal tract are calculated recursively. It is considered to be a more convenient approach compared to other methods (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962; Liljencrants, 1985; Story, 1995; Mathur et al., 2006; Zanartu et al., 2007).

Titze and Story investigated not only the acoustic interaction but also the aerodynamic interaction of the coupling on more complicated models (Titze, 1984, 2002, 2004; Story and Titze, 1995; Titze and Story, 1997). They show that vocal tract affects the vibration pattern of vocal folds. Zanartu investigates the acoustic loading effect of both vocal tract and trachea on a single mass model of the vocal folds under a quasi Bernoulli flow assumption at the glottis (Zanartu et al., 2007). It is shown that the acoustic loading of vocal tract is dominant against that of trachea in maintaining self-sustained oscillations of vocal folds. Titze has recently introduced a theory of nonlinear source filter coupling (Titze, 2008). It is based on the assumptions of linear vocal tract and a quasi-steady Bernoulli glottal flow. Two levels of interaction effects are demonstrated. The level-I interaction seen in normal speaking consists of the skewness and the ripple on the glottal flow for F0<
                     F1 and the level-II interaction involves instabilities in the vibration pattern of vocal folds when F0 crosses over the formant frequencies. Titze et al. (2008) demonstrate the level-II effects in human voice by varying F0.


                     Howe and McGowan (2012) present a theory of source filter coupling based on aeroacoustic theory. Their model also demonstrates the effects of level-I interaction.

In this work, we focus on the level-I interaction observed in normal speaking conditions.

In this section, the dependence of glottal flow waveform on vocal tract in two different formant vowel cases, high F1 vowel /a/ and low F1 vowel /i/, for a wide F0 frequency range is demonstrated by using a parametric glottal area model. The vocal system is simulated by the wave reflection method described in Story (1995) and Zanartu et al. (2007) using the areas extracted from 3D MR images provided by Story (1995) and parametric glottal area model proposed by Ananthapadmanabha and Fant (1982) given by

                         are the peak value of the glottal area, the open phase duration and the closing phase duration, respectively. Particularly, we used the same glottal flow expression obtained by Titze (1984, 2008) based on the quasi-steady Bernoulli flow assumption. It is also equivalent to the interactive glottal flow equation of a single mass system in terms of volume velocity that was used by Fant for the calculation of true glottal flow (Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982).

The source-filter interaction depends on the vocal tract input impedance (Rothenberg, 1981; Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982; Titze, 2008). Considering the speech production system, there are mainly two different acoustic cavities, the vocal tract, above the glottis, and trachea, below the glottis. Since the vocal tract has much smaller crossectional area with respect to subglottal tract, its reactance is much larger than the subglottal reactance. Hence, the reactance of the overall system is slightly different than the vocal tract reactance. The impedance relating the glottal flow to the transglottal pressure across the glottis is the sum of the subglottal and supraglottal impedances (Titze, 2008).

The vocal tract impedance of vowel /a/ calculated by the impulse response technique using the wave reflection method is plotted in Fig. 1
                        . The magnitude and resistance curves have peaks at resonance frequencies at which the reactance curve has its zeros. It is seen in the figure that the vocal tract input impedance is inertive for frequencies below F1, approximately 0.8kHz, and between 1.1 and 1.2kHz while compliant in the frequency intervals 0.8–1.1kHz and 1.2–1.7kHz.

The vocal system is simulated by using constant lung pressure, P
                        
                           L
                        
                        =0.8kPa and the maximum glottal area A
                        =0.15cm2. Since subglottal tract is not used in the simulation, the subglottal pressure, p
                        
                           sub
                        , is set to the lung pressure, P
                        
                           L
                        . The glottal area and glottal flow waveforms normalized in time and amplitude obtained for F0 frequencies equally spaced by 40Hz between 80 and 240Hz are plotted in Fig. 2
                        . It is seen from the figure that the glottal flow is skewed to the right with respect to glottal area. This is the first effect of level-I interaction. This behaviour is due to the inertive vocal tract reactance. It increases the spectral slope of the source harmonic peaks. The second effect of level-I interaction is the ripple on the glottal flow waveforms. The interaction ripples can be easily seen in the glottal flow waveforms in Fig. 2(c)–(e). The intensity of the ripples increases as F0 is increased. On the other hand, the frequencies of the ripples are not the same in each case. They result from the variations in the magnitudes of the glottal flow harmonics. The magnitude of each harmonic in the source spectrum is mainly determined by the vocal tract input impedance. The discussion on the cause and effect of the interaction ripple requires both spectral and time domain investigation of the simulated glottal waveforms and output speech signal.

The vocal tract impedance of vowel /i/ calculated by the wave-reflection method is shown in Fig. 3
                        . In this case, the first formant, (F1), calculated approximately as 200Hz, is smaller and closer to F0 frequencies used in the simulation. For fundamental frequencies between 80 and 240Hz, the simulations are conducted for /i/ and the resulting glottal flow waveforms are plotted in Fig. 4
                        . As expected, the skewness and ripple effects are observed in each case. However, an important difference between the flow waveforms of F0<
                        F1 (Fig. 4(a)–(c)) and F0>
                        F1 (Fig. 4(e)) is that the former waveforms are skewed to the right while the latter is skewed to the left. This is due to the first source harmonic, when F0=240Hz is inside the negative reactance region (compliant reactance) of vocal tract input impedance of /i/. Furthermore, the size of the interaction ripple is much larger than the ripple seen in the case of /a/. The reason for the large ripple is that the vocal tract impedance has a much stronger effect on the individual harmonic magnitudes compared to that in the case of vowel /a/.

The glottal source waveform strongly depends on the vocal tract shape. It is due to the loading effect of the vocal tract on the glottis (Titze, 2008). The following statements summarize the salient aspects of the source-filter interaction;
                           
                              1.
                              There are two major effects of the source-filter interaction on the source, skewness of glottal flow and ripple on the glottal flow (level-I interaction).

Glottal flow is affected by the vocal tract input reactance. Positive reactance increases the skewing of glottal flow to the right and increase the energy level of corresponding harmonics (Rothenberg, 1981; Titze, 2008).

The vocal tract input reactance is always positive for frequencies below F1. During speech activity, most of the time, the frequencies of source harmonics having the largest energy values are in inertive reactance interval. As a result, the glottal flow is skewed to the right (Titze, 2008). The reactance usually increases up to the first vocal tract formant, F1, except some small variations around the subglottal formants. It may be concluded that for frequencies below F1, increasing F0 increases vocal tract input reactance so that skewness is increased.

The resistive part of vocal tract input impedance affects the peak value of the flow. Increasing resistance decreases the amplitude of the glottal flow (Rothenberg, 1981; Titze, 2008). The resistance increases up to F1, then decreases. This implies that the amplitude of the glottal flow decreases as F0 increases up to F1.

The interaction ripple is caused by the variations in the magnitudes of the glottal flow harmonics strongly effected by the vocal tract input impedance. The size of the interaction ripple depends on the magnitudes of the corresponding source harmonics. By increasing F0, the dominant harmonics get closer to the zero reactance frequency and the ripple gets larger.

For different vowels, the frequency of ripple, the maximum amplitude and the skewness of the glottal flow are different due to the difference of the input impedance.

The most widely used assumptions in modeling the glottal aerodynamics are that the glottal flow is incompressible (flow density is constant) and steady during the opening of vocal folds and unsteady during their closing. It is called as quasi-steady Bernoulli flow assumption. Then, the pressure-flow relation can be written by the well known Bernoulli equation (Titze, 2006a):

                        . Eq. (4) is valid if the glottal flow is downstream. The results of our physical system simulations verified its validity. The experimental results obtained by the simulation of mechanical model of vocal folds show that the quasi-steady Bernoulli flow assumption is valid during almost 70% of a glottal cycle. It has been found that, it is a good approximation of actual glottal flow during the open phase (Jong and Mongeau, 2007).

The linear source-filter theory (Fant, 1960) assumes that the glottal flow does not depend on the vocal tract acoustics. Considering Eq. (4), this assumption holds if

                        , in Eq. (4). It is a linear function of glottal area.

Based on the quasi-steady Bernoulli flow assumption, the glottal flow is related to the vocal tract input pressure as given by Eq. (4). As we aim to develop a coupled speech production model, it is needed to have another expression, representing vocal fold dynamics, in terms of the vocal tract input pressure, p

                        , is calculated from vocal tract input impedance obtained by the chain matrix method (Sondhi and Schroeter, 1987). The impulse response of the vocal tract is calculated by inverse Fourier transform, and it is convolved with the glottal flow (Sondhi and Schroeter, 1987, 1999) to obtain the output speech. However, it is reported that one drawback of this approach is that when the duration of the impulse response is very long, calculation of convolution gets hard. Hence, instead of using convolution directly, input reflectance of the vocal tract is used. Recently, Howe and McGowan (2012) use three poles and zeros for modeling both subglottal and supraglottal impedance. In this work, in order to accomplish the coupling, the input pressure, p

There are three types of acoustic models for vocal tract; transmission line circuit analog, wave-reflection method and chain matrix method. The first two methods work in time-domain while the last one works in frequency domain. Since it can model the frequency dependent losses due to viscosity and wall vibration, the chain matrix method estimates the vocal tract formants more accurately. The chain matrix for vocal tract is first given in Sondhi and Schroeter (1987, 1999). It depends on the solution of equation of continuity and equation of motion.

In addition, source-filter interaction is neglected, assuming that they are independent. In general, the lip radiation is approximated by a first order high-pass filter (Quatieri, 2001) and applied on the lip velocity to obtain speech, s[n].

In order to properly couple the source and the filter, according to quasi-steady Bernoulli equation in Eq. (4), the vocal tract input pressure, p

                        . It is known that the impedance relating the glottal flow to the transglottal pressure across the glottis is the sum of the subglottal and supraglottal impedances (Titze, 2008). In other words, if we consider both subglottal and supraglottal impedance, the transglottal pressure can be written as

                         represent the pressure drop due to not only the supraglottal impedance but also subglottal impedance. Therefore, if the subglottal impedance is taken into account, overall impedance is the sum of the subglottal and supraglottal impedances. It is shown in the previous section that, by using the chain matrix model, the subglottal and supraglottal impedances can be expressed by rational transfer functions. As a result, the overall system transfer function is the sum of the two rational functions, which is a rational function. Let q

                        [n] is calculated, we propose two interactive models. The first model using Eq. (19) together with Eq. (28) is called as interactive source-filter model I (ISFM1) and the second model using Eq. (31) for p
                        
                           IN
                        [n] in Eq. (28) is named as interactive source-filter model II (ISFM2). The proposed interactive models, ISFM1 and ISFM2, are shown in Fig. 5
                        (a) and (b), respectively.

The first point in the analysis of the interactive models is the stability. The interactive systems produce bounded output if the vocal tract filter, H(z), is stable and the interactive glottal flow, u
                        
                           g
                        [n], is bounded. Since the ISFMs are nonlinear, the stability of the system depends on the amplitude of the input, particularly the maximum amplitude of glottal area, A
                        max, and the other model parameters, P

                         is the asymptotical condition that the interactive system is in non-interactive mode and equivalent to linear source-filter model. In this mode, glottal flow is a linear function of the glottal area and vocal tract has no influence on it.

                           Closed – Phase analysis

Estimation of glottal flow waveform by removing the vocal tract and radiation filters from speech signal using constrained closed phase analysis (Alku et al., 2009). In this step, both glottal flow waveform, u
                              
                                 g
                              [n], and vocal tract filter coefficients, a

                              's, are estimated from speech.

Glottal parameterization

For pitch synchronous analysis, the glottal closure and the glottal opening instants and, the location and the amplitude of glottal flow maxima are obtained from glottal flow estimate.

Glottal area model initialization

Using the glottal parameters, the time sequence denoting the samples of glottal area model, a
                              
                                 g
                              [n], is generated. There are parametric glottal area models used for articulatory synthesis and acoustic analysis in the literature (Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982). It is also possible to use parametric glottal flow models instead of glottal area model, such as Rosenberg, LF etc. (Veldhuisa, 1998; Fu and Murphy, 2006)

Multi-parameter optimization

                         gives us a flexibility to choose the operating point for ISFMs. We can operate the system either in interactive or non-interactive mode. This property allows the performance of ISFM be equal or better than the linear source-filter model. At its worst, ISFM would be performing like LSFM.

                        's estimated by closed-phase analysis are the coefficients of the vocal tract filter and its poles define the vocal tract formants. It can be inferred from the spectrum of the vocal tract impedance (see Titze and Story, 1997) that a zero is located between any two consecutive formants. Hence, a suitable initial value for b

In this section, we present two sets of experiments conducted on a short speech segment and a large speech database recorded in anechoic recording room at our laboratory. At the beginning, the model and parameter estimation procedure is tested on a short speech segment in order to investigate how the nonlinear model produce fine details of glottal flow obtained by inverse filtering. Later, the linear non-interactive and nonlinear interactive models are compared by using Rosenberg+ model (Veldhuisa, 1998). The results of the interactive and noninteractive Rosenberg+ model are presented and discussed at the end of the section.

A voiced speech segment shown in Fig. 7
                         is used for the first experiment. The first step of parameter estimation is to estimate the glottal flow waveform from speech signal using closed-phase analysis. The spectrum of speech signal and estimated vocal tract filter are plotted in Fig. 7(b). Glottal flow and glottal flow derivative waveforms obtained by using the vocal tract filter are plotted in Fig. 7(c) and (d), respectively. The glottal flow estimate is similar to the simulated glottal flows obtained by physical models in Section 2. There is a ripple on the glottal flow and derivative estimate due to the interaction between glottal flow and vocal tract.

The next step is the glottal parameterization in which time instants and amplitude values of the glottal flow and glottal flow derivative are found for the glottal area model. A set of results are shown in Fig. 8
                        .

As the glottal area input, we use Eq. (1) (Ananthapadmanabha and Fant, 1982). The parameters of the model are estimated from glottal flow estimate assuming that the coarse shapes of the glottal area and glottal flow are close to each other. The glottal area waveform, a
                        
                           g
                        [n], obtained according to Eq. (1), and the estimated parameters are shown in Fig. 9
                        .

After generating the glottal area waveform, the parameter A
                        max is found to be 0.13 as described in Section 6 by setting P

                         is equal to a
                        
                           k
                        , hence the gain is

                                          (
                                          H

                                       ∞
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        , thus it is expected that the model is in non-interactive mode. Before optimizing the parameter, b
                        
                           k
                        , the resulting interactive glottal flow and its derivative are plotted in Fig. 10
                        . It is seen that there is no ripple on the interactive glottal flow that is almost the same as the glottal area waveform in Fig. 9. Interactive glottal flow is seem to be an amplitude scaled version of the glottal area, meaning that glottal flow is a linear function of the glottal area.

By optimizing the parameters b
                        
                           k

                           k
                         as described in the optimization algorithm, all the parameters of the interactive models are obtained. In this case, for ISFM2,

                         and interaction ripple is expected on the resulting interactive glottal flow. The interactive glottal flow produced by ISFM2 is shown in Fig. 11
                        .

It is seen from the figure that ISFM2 produces the ripple on the target glottal flow from the given glottal area. However, there is a large mismatch between the closing phases of the target glottal flow and the estimated glottal flow. The mismatch is also clearly observed in Figs. 9 and 10. The glottal area model is not successful in modeling the closing-phase and it yields a large modeling error. Since the optimization algorithm attempts to reduce this error, despite its ability to produce the interaction ripple, estimated interactive glottal flow is severely affected by this modeling error. Its performance can be increased by avoiding closing phase or return phase errors in the glottal area model.

To reduce the effect of closing phase mismatch, instead of Fant area model, Rosenberg+ model can be used. Rosenberg+ has an exponentially decaying return phase (Veldhuisa, 1998). It is an extension of Rosenberg model, whose return phase is zero, given as

Estimation of AV is a convex optimization problem, while that of OQ is non-convex (Fu and Murphy, 2006). The general procedure is to first obtain AV by solving a linear LS problem, then to perform a grid search, over 0<

First, Rosenberg model is estimated using open-phase of glottal flow waveform according to Eq. (45) and then Rosenberg+ model is obtained by fitting an exponential model to the return phase. It is used in interactive systems as a glottal area waveform, a
                        
                           g
                        [n]. In this way, Rosenberg+ model is extended to an interactive glottal flow model.

The Rosenberg+ model obtained from glottal flow estimate is shown in Fig. 12
                        . The return phase of Rosenberg+ fits the return phase of glottal flow estimate and reduces the modeling error. The interactive glottal flow and its derivative obtained by optimal

                         are plotted in Fig. 13
                        . It is seen from the figure that the interactive glottal flow approximates the coarse shape of the target flow successfully, however there are considerable errors due to the interaction ripple in each glottal cycle's open-phase. ISFM1 model can produce the fine-ripples on the glottal flow waveform. It is estimated by optimizing b

                         parameter.

The interactive glottal flow produced by ISFM1 is shown in Fig. 14
                        . It is seen that ISFM1 produces not only the coarse shape but also the fine ripple of the target glottal flow. It is more clearly observable on the glottal flow derivative waveform shown in the lower part of the figure. In this configuration,

                         is calculated as 99, smaller than the upper bound, 165.

Finally, using ISFM1 as an initial model, ISFM2 is estimated. The interactive glottal flow generated by ISFM2 is plotted in Fig. 15
                        . ISFM2 refines the glottal flow produced by ISFM1 and decreases the error further. Now

                                       )

                         is calculated as 89. The results show that both ISFMs can produce the ripple with fine granularity by working in the interactive mode. Fig. 16
                         shows one cycle of glottal flow and its derivative for Rosenberg+ model, ISFM1, ISFM2 and the target glottal flow waveform obtained by inverse filtering. The outputs of ISFM1 and ISFM2 are quite similar, they both exhibit interaction ripple in the open-phase of the target glottal flow waveform, but the non-interactive flow shown in black dotted line does not have such a fine detail. Therefore, the MSEs of the interactive flows are much smaller than the MSE of the non-interactive flow.

To compare the interactive and non-interactive models, an experiment is conducted on a large speech database. A speech database containing eight sustained Turkish vowels is prepared by recording from 12 male and 8 female speakers together with the electroglottograph (EGG) signals. The utterances were recorded in a soundproof recording 224 cabin, using an Edirol UA-1000 audio capture device. The audio files are recorded at 16 kHz with 16-bit resolution. The glottal closure instants (GCI) are marked by thresholding the EGG signal (Henrich et al., 2004) and then by manual correction. Then, the glottal flow is estimated by covariance analysis over closed phase (CPC) of the speech signal (Wong et al., 1979; Veeneman and BeMent, 1985; Krishnamurthy and Childers, 1986; Childers and Wong, 1994; Alku et al., 2009). One of the problems in estimating the glottal flow waveform using the CPC is that when the F0 is high, accurate vocal tract filter may not be obtained due to the limited data in the closed phase. Arroabarren and Carlosena (2006) demonstrates this type of erroneous glottal flow estimates obtained from high pitch voicing. This problem makes it difficult to use female speech in the experiments. Therefore, we only use the male speech database. Rosenberg+ glottal flow model is used for the comparison of interactive and noninteractive systems. The Rosenberg+ model parameters are estimated according to Eq. (45) and used in interactive systems as a glottal area waveform, a

                        [n].

The performance of the systems are compared based on the mean square error (MSE) between the reconstructed glottal flow and the reference glottal flow estimated from CPC analysis over each glottal cycle:

The numbers of analyzed glottal cycles are shown in Table 2
                        . There are a total of 2768 glottal cycles included in the experiments.

The averages of MSE and error variances calculated for each glottal cycle in the database are shown in Tables 3 and 4
                        
                        , respectively. The PISMF1 and PISMF2 in table II represent the percentage error reduction ratios of ISFM1 and ISFM2, respectively, over the Rosenberg+ model. When the Rosenberg+ model is applied to ISFM1, the reconstruction error decreases at most by 44.44% for /ɯ/ and at least by 19% for /u/. Similarly, ISFM2 decreases the error of Rosenberg+ model between 35% and 58%. Among the interactive models, ISFM2 performs slightly better than ISFM1. The results show that the performances of ISFM1 and ISFM2 are much better than the performance of the Rosenberg+ model. Incorporating nonlinear interaction into Rosenberg+ model improves the performance.

The cummulative error distributions of the Rosenberg+ and proposed models are plotted in Fig. 17
                        . The vertical axis is the percentage of the number of the glottal cycles that yield a smaller MSE than that indicated by the horizontal axis. The dash-dot, dashed and solid curves represent the MSE distributions of the Rosenberg+, ISFM1 and ISFM2, respectively. About 20% of the glottal cycles by the Rosenberg+ model produce an MSE of greater than 0.5 while the glottal cycles with an MSE in the same range is about 7% for ISFM2. MSE distributions show that ISFM1 and ISFM2 are far better than the non-interactive Rosenberg+ model.


                        Fig. 18
                         shows the scatter plot of the MSEs of all vowels based on the ratio of first formant (F1) and fundamental frequency (F0), F1/F0. It is seen from the scatter plot that the MSE levels can vary. This level change may occur due to the aspiration noise and small ripples in the closed phase resulting from erroneous inverse filtering for some cases in the study. The closed phase ripples are usually reported as a bad inverse filter configuration flag in inverse filtering literature and they cannot be eliminated easily (Wong et al., 1979; Alku et al., 2009). Since we do not use an aspiration model for closed phase, high noise in this time interval can significantly affect the total MSE calculated over a glottal cycle. Figs. 19 and 20
                        
                         show the interactive and non-interactive glottal flow waveforms for two values of F1/F0, about 5 and 2, respectively. Note that there is a quite small ripple in the closed phase in the glottal flow waveform shown in Fig. 19, it is considerably larger in the case of low F1/F0 case (/i/). In addition, in the case of /i/ sound, Rosenberg+ model has larger errors in the open phase with respect to the modeling error in the case of /a/. Hence, MSE of the Rosenberg+ model increases as F1/F0 decreases. On the other hand, ISFM2 model not only reduces modeling error of Rosenberg+ model but also produces the ripple in the open-phase of target glottal flow waveform shown by blue line. As a result, it yields much less MSE than the Rosenberg+ model. It is observed that all of the vowels in the experiments are enhanced by incorporating the coupling into the non-interactive Rosenberg+ model. In the introduction section, based on the acoustical simulation, it is stated that increasing the F0 towards to F1 increases the nonlinear coupling effects on the glottal flow. Hence, when F1/F0 is large, the glottal flow can be represented by a coarse shape model more successfully. However, when it is small, the performance of a coarse shape glottal flow model decreases. These relationships can be observed on the MSE scatter plot in Fig. 18. The figure shows that when F1/F0 is large, MSE values are very close for ISFMs and Rosenberg+ models. However, when F1/F0 decreases, ISFMs reduce the MSE of Rosenberg+ model and provides significant improvement.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work, we present a framework for modeling nonlinear source filter coupling in voiced speech sounds. Based on this framework, two nonlinear interactive source filter models, ISFM1 and ISFM2, are developed and their relation to the linear source filter model, LSFM, and each other are exposed. It is shown that LSFM is an approximation of the ISFMs under certain conditions. The major difference between the ISFMs and LSFM is that, in the LSFM the source and the filter are assumed to be independent and do not affect each other however in the ISFMs they nonlinearly interact according to Bernoulli equation.

A parameter estimation algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of ISFMs and tested on speech signals. Experimental results show that proposed nonlinear interactive models exhibit the source-filter interaction effects seen in speech production. Since ISFMs are based on physical modeling, they have the capability of producing the fine ripples on the glottal flow waveform observed in the simulation of speech production. They accurately generate fine ripples on the glottal flow obtained by inverse filtering by the help of the nonlinear interaction between the glottal flow and vocal tract filter. This feature is incorporated into the Rosenberg+ model and used to synthesize glottal flow waveforms obtained from a large speech database. The results indicate that the interactive Rosenberg model is always better than its non-interactive counterpart.

Proposed interactive model takes the glottal area waveform as its input. A model based glottal area waveform is synthesized using the glottal flow waveform obtained by inverse filtering assuming that the glottal flow and the glottal area waveforms achieve their peaks synchronously. In this context, the optimization of the skewing quotient of the glottal area can be studied further. In generating the glottal area waveform, Rosenberg+ model has been used mainly due to its suitability in the optimization of its parameters. The generation of the glottal area waveform for natural sounding speech can be a part of future studies. Alternatively, the use of a dynamic system model to generate the glottal flow waveform can be considered. Another way to obtain the glottal area waveform could be the use of High-Speed Endoscopic Video (HSV) of vocal folds. An aim of such a study would be to investigate whether the interactive system enhances the source harmonics and generates non-existing harmonics in the glottal area observed in Titze (2008).

Proposed framework can be used in an articulatory speech synthesizer to couple the glottal flow, and sub- and supra-glottal tracts. The transfer function of the combined sub- and supra-glottal tracts has to be calculated from the time-varying areas. They can be parameterized by estimating the p
                     
                        IN
                      filter. Hence, instead of areas, the filter coefficients, b
                     
                        k
                      and q
                     
                        k
                     , can be stored in a codebook to represent the transfer function of the system.

ISFMs can be used in speaker identification (SID). For instance, Plumpe and Quatieri use glottal flow waveform in SID (Plumpe et al., 1999). They model both the coarse shape and fine details of glottal flow in a different manner. The coarse shape is modeled by LF model and the fine details are modeled in frequency domain by fitting a second order polynomial to the variation of the frequency of the first formant (F1) in a glottal cycle. Their combination with cepstrum coefficients increases SID accuracy by 3% with respect to using only cepstrum coefficients as a feature. ISFMs may increase SID accuracy more. The LF model can be used as a glottal area to produce interactive glottal flows. Then, its parameters can be combined with both the vocal tract input transfer function parameters and MFCC coefficients as a feature vector for SID. Another branch of future studies can be to investigate better glottal features for applications such as voice quality assessment or emotion recognition. For instance, Fu and Murphy propose a method to extract the LF model parameters for voice quality assessment (Fu and Murphy, 2006). Their method can be a pre-processing method for ISFMS, e.g., the estimated source model can be used as a glottal area for ISFMs. Time, frequency and amplitude based attributes of the coarse and the fine details of glottal flow can be extracted from interactive glottal flow waveform. Their combination as a feature may increase the accuracy of the application.

Nowadays people want to combine physically informed models into their existing speech applications. For example, recently, the branch of statistical speech synthesis seeks a solution to the integration of physical speech production models into the statistical parametric speech synthesizers (Tao et al., 2014). The ISFMs are inspired from the physical model of speech production. They can be used in HMM-based speech synthesis by replacing the linear source-filter model in the sound synthesis block (Raitio et al., 2011). The proposed models may be used in the next generation speech processing applications to increase the quality of speech or the accuracy of recognition systems.

Depending on the size of S, there are two approaches for the calculation of Eq. (A.11), small residue and large residue algorithms. If S is large with respect to J
                     
                        T
                     
                     J, it has to be calculated either analyticaly or by using finite difference approximation. This type of approaches is called large residue algorithms. However, if the error, e[n], is small enough to neglect the term S, the Hessian can be calculated by using only the first derivative of the cost function. Algorithms that use this approximation are called small residue algorithms. The Gauss–Newton and Levenberg–Marquardt are the two algorithms that are based on the small error assumption. In the Gauss–Newton method, the Hessian is approximated by
