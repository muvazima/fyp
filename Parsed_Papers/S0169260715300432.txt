                  Interventional cardiologists have a deep interest in risk stratification prior to stenting and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is most commonly adapted for screening, but current tools lack the ability for risk stratification based on grayscale plaque morphology. Our hypothesis is based on the genetic makeup of the atherosclerosis disease, that there is evidence of a link between coronary atherosclerosis disease and carotid plaque built up. This novel idea is explored in this study for coronary risk assessment and its classification of patients between high risk and low risk.
                  This paper presents a strategy for coronary risk assessment by combining the IVUS grayscale plaque morphology and carotid B-mode ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) – a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Support vector machine (SVM) learning paradigm is adapted for risk stratification, where both the learning and testing phases use tissue characteristics derived from six feature combinational spaces, which are then used by the SVM classifier with five different kernels sets. These six feature combinational spaces are designed using 56 novel feature sets. K-fold cross validation protocol with 10 trials per fold is used for optimization of best SVM-kernel and best feature combination set.
                  IRB approved coronary IVUS and carotid B-mode ultrasound were jointly collected on 15 patients (2 days apart) via: (a) 40MHz catheter utilizing iMap (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) with 2865 frames per patient (42,975 frames) and (b) linear probe B-mode carotid ultrasound (Toshiba scanner, Japan). Using the above protocol, the system shows the classification accuracy of 94.95% and AUC of 0.95 using optimized feature combination. This is the first system of its kind for risk stratification as a screening tool to prevent excessive cost burden and better patients’ cardiovascular disease management, while validating our two hypotheses.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for 31% of the death toll among all the diseases. This amounts to 17.5 million deaths, coronary disease accounts for 7.4 million deaths while cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) or stroke accounts for 6.7 million lives [1]. South-East Asia region is having a speedy occurrence of CVDs in the young and middle-aged groups of the population. It is estimated that between 2000 and 2030, about 35% of all CVD deaths in India will occur among those aged 35 years to 64 years, compared with only 12% in United States and 2% in China [2].

Coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease are the two kinds of CVDs fundamentally caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a progressive process which silently and slowly narrows the arteries, putting the blood flow at risk. It damages the endothelium, primarily due to deposition of plaque in the arteries. In the most severe cases of stable plaque, it also causes considerable blockage as shown in Fig. 1
                     (left) that suddenly ruptures and allows blood to clot in the artery. This can further cause myocardial infarction or heart attack and stroke.

Different imaging modalities have been adapted for screening coronary artery such as: computer tomography (CT) [3,4], OCT [5,6], IVUS [7–11], and elastography [12,13]. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Even though, CT is popularly known to quantify the coronary calcium, it possesses a threat due to CT radiation risk. Among the PCI procedures, angiography is normally used. This provides instantaneously an image of stenosis. This helps the cardiologist to proceed and take interventional procedures according to the severity of the patient. However it does not give the sufficient pathological and geometrical information on plaque burden and its composition or ability to characterize the plaque risk. On the other hand IVUS has advantages: It provide real-time grayscale images of coronary vessel wall region along with plaque morphology and its structures. Due to better signal penetration it provides accurate tomography of coronary plaque burden. This helps the cardiologist in: (1) exactly where the stent should be placed in coronary artery; (2) the assessment of condition of patients after an angioplasty or stenting procedure. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for PCI state that: the limitation of angiography is overcome by IVUS. Further, with regards to the vulnerability of plaque, IVUS has a greater predicting ability toward vulnerable plaques. It measures all the morphological features (thin-cap fibro atheroma (TCFA), lipid core size and calcification patterns) at once, unlike the other imaging modalities such as OCT [14–16].

Prior to planning stenting and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures, interventional cardiologists using IVUS are very interested in knowing which kind of patients are at high risk and vulnerable to coronary plaque rupture [17,18]. Thus coronary plaque morphology has been the key driver for risk stratification. This morphology has been explored to understand different components of plaque such as fibrous, fibrolipidic, calcified and calcified-necrotic. Even though the diagnostic and screening tools are useful, but, they do not predict the severity of the disease nor they offer information about the plaque progression. In our current study, we hypothesize that the above multiple plaque components in the coronary wall constitute a risk factor. Our approach in this study is to stratify this risk via grayscale tissue characterization of IVUS coronary vessel wall when taken along the coronary artery.

The genetic makeup of the plaque buildup between coronary artery and carotid artery has shown lots of interest recently (see Fig. 1(left and right)). cIMT has been the biomarker and gold standard for measuring the cardiovascular events (CVE) [19–22]. Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between cIMT and coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction and most of the authors showed the threshold on cIMT leading to CVE [23] (cIMT>1.15mm), [24] (cIMT>1.26mm), [25] (cIMT>0.8mm) and [26]. Recently, in [27], the authors showed that cIMT>0.9mm had significantly higher SYNTAX score, an angiographic grading tool used to determine the complexity of coronary artery disease. Recently, Suri's team developed the relationships between cIMT and coronary calcium volume [28,29] and further showed correlation (CC) between automated cIMT that includes carotid bulb plaque and coronary SYNTAX score of 0.467 (P
                     <0.0001) [30]. Thus there exists a clear relationship between the cIMT and coronary artery disease severity and its risk. We thus hypothesize that cIMT biomarker has ability to characterize the cardiovascular disease and bears a link between carotid plaque burden and coronary plaque components due to the atherosclerosis disease. Even though, there have been recent studies [31,32] that shows that IMT is not related to MI/stroke risk, but these studies use IMT measurement manually and take into consideration only few sample points proximal to the bulb (see the detailed reviews by Suri's team regarding the engineering perspective on automated IMT estimation techniques [33–37]). As a result, this cIMT marker can be adapted as a possible gold standard for identification of the coronary risk of the patient.

Having discussed the two hypotheses on coronary plaque component risk and carotid risk biomarker, we can leverage to model the risk assessment system via machine learning paradigm. This machine learning based risk stratification system uses tissue characterization of the coronary vessel wall, where the tissue characteristics can be computed in real time to predict the coronary risk such as MI or determine the high risk coronary patients. Previously Nicolaides and his team attempted to characterize the carotid plaques for the assessment of stroke [38–40]. Recently, Suri's team developed a morphological-based tissue characterization for stroke risk assessment on grayscale carotid plaques and can be seen in the current literature [41–48]. Keeping this spirits, this study is the first prototype of its kind for modeling the coronary risk assessment via a machine learning paradigm that utilizes grayscale tissue characteristics of IVUS-based coronary artery wall plaque and carotid cIMT as a ground truth. This is the first cross-link between coronary artery and carotid artery. This cross-link combination is implemented by an offline-based machine learning system where 56 novel features were extracted using IVUS coronary vessel wall images and then combined with the carotid plaque risk biomarker (cIMT) binary label for training the machine learning system. This cIMT risk biomarker can be either retrospectively measured (say by the neuroradiologist or the sonographer) or automatically measured. This cIMT biomarker provides the coronary risk label of 1/0, depending upon the carotid plaque burden measured via cIMT values. The offline training coefficients were then transformed by the online test IVUS coronary vessel wall grayscale features leading to prediction of the coronary artery risk label. For accuracy of risk classification, K-fold cross-validation paradigm is adapted, ensuring a fixed number of trials per fold. The performance is evaluated and ROC and AUC are determined based on SMV-kernel adapted.

The layout of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the demographics and data acquisition. Section 3 describes the novel machine learning approach for risk assessment. Classification and risk stratification is presented in Section 3. Three sets of experimental protocols are presented in Section 4. We have shown all the results in Section 5 followed by performance evaluation in Section 6. A discussion on the results of proposed system and its interpretation is presented in Section 7, and finally we conclude the paper in Section 8.

Fifteen patients were taken from a single-center study [49] between July 2009 and December 2010, with stable angina pectoris who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions using iMap (Boston Scientific®, Marlborough, MA) IVUS examination. All the fifteen patients are male between the ages of 36 and 81. The data sets were approved by Institution Review Board and Ethics Committee and consent from patients were also taken before the study. A combination dose of clopidogrel (75mg/d) and aspirin (100mg/d) were given to the patients, prior to performing coronary intervention procedure. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was also given to these patients prior to the procedure. This would obtain a partial thromboplast in time of less than 250s.

Scanner equipped with a 7.5MHz linear array transducer (Aplio XV, Aplio XG, Xario, Toshiba, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was used for Carotid ultrasonography examinations. All the scans are performed by expert sonographer with 15 year of experience. Patients were examined by taking the transverse scans to locate the carotid arteries, and then, a longitudinal image of the anterior and posterior walls was acquired by rotating the probe by 90°. cIMT was recorded from the high resolution image, approved by the American Society of Echocardiography Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Task Force. The mean pixel resolution of the database was 0.05±0.01mm/pixel.

A 40-MHz IVUS catheter (Atlantis SR Pro; Boston Scientific) was used for coronary artery data acquisition. Cross section view of coronary artery was performed by automatic pullback of the catheter, at the speed of 0.5mm per second. Catheter obtains the images of vessel area of coronary artery on every heartbeat. Since we receive QuickTime IVUS videos, the IVUS frame quality was degraded compared to the original DICOM images [50].

The machine learning system designed in this study is based on the data size derived from 15 subjects. Complete coronary artery images from coronary video of each patient were taken for analysis. Each subject consisted of an average of 2100 coronary artery frames. In each subject, we have removed the starting and end frames because they may did not contain any information about plaque morphology of the vessel wall region. Therefore on an average, we had 1900 frames per subject. Further each subject had some redundancy in frames i.e., there was no significant change in plaque morphology between every 10th frame. Due to this, we further optimized the data size by taking every tenth frame in about 1900 frames per subject. This resulted on an average of 190 frames per subject, totaling to 2865 frames corresponding to 15 subjects. On the basis of the second hypothesis, stoke-risk biomarker, (cIMT>0.9mm), 9 patients out of 15 were determined as high coronary risk patients while 6 were considered as low coronary risk patients. Thus, a total of 1508 frames were high risk coronary artery patient images and 1357 frames were considered as low risk coronary artery patient images out of a total of 2865 frames. Thus, our data size constituted a set of 2865 frames and not the number of subjects, i.e., 15. Note carefully, from here on, the data size referred in this study means a collection of 2865 frames and not the source of frames i.e., 15 subjects. Representative images of coronary high risk and low risk patients are shown in Figs. 2 and 3
                        
                        , respectively. Region of interest was determined using Img-Tracer™, user friendly software (courtesy AtheroPoint™, Roseville, CA, USA) discussed in Section 3.1.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The two hypotheses behind our study are: (a) there exists multiple components of plaque in the grayscale coronary vessel wall and (b) stroke risk biomarker cIMT has an ability to characterize the cardiovascular disease. The first hypothesis leads us to the concept of tissue characterization based on machine learning paradigm. The second hypothesis leads us to create a high risk vs. low risk label for patients who are likely to have high risk or low risk coronary artery disease. Thus, cIMT can be adapted to generate a ground truth label of 1/0, depending upon the cIMT values. Our model is based on a genetic relationship of plaque buildup between coronary artery disease leading to myocardial infarction (MI) and carotid artery disease leading to cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

For an accomplished, focused and efficient infrastructure we introduced a two stage paradigm which consisted of a global processing system (GPS) and local processing system (LPS). GPS is a feedback system where an expert cardiologist is able to extract multiple focal plaque regions along the vessel wall of coronary artery from the IVUS frame. The output of the GPS consists of the region of interest (ROI) in entire coronary artery and is then ready for tissue characterization. The second stage consisted of LPS which consisted of the machine learning system. The heart of the LPS consisted of extraction of 56 novel IVUS gray scale features for both training and testing phase. The K-fold cross validation was utilized for estimating the accuracy of the LPS. In this, the data set are randomly sampled into K equal sized partitions, where, K
                     −1 partitions were used for training and single partition is used for testing. This process repeats K number of times, with each partition being retained once for testing as the validation data [51] without being included in the training pool. Note that the risk assessment system is performed by characterizing the grayscale vessel wall region based on the risk biomarker (cIMT) of the carotid scans. This study did not take grayscale plaque of the carotid scan into consideration.

Some artifacts such as catheter glow and acoustic shadow may present in the coronary ultrasound image during the data acquisition. Sometime these artifacts result in very bright adventitia region which lead to a false estimation of calcified plaque region. Therefore, pre-processing was performed to remove these artifacts. ImgTracer™ software (courtesy of AtheroPoint™, Roseville, CA, USA) has been used for pre-processing to extract the vessel wall region. The output traced images are vessel wall region containing two borders: lumen-intima (LI) border or Inner Elastic Lamina (IEL) and media-adventitia (MA) border or External Elastic Lamina (EEL). The tracing of 2865 frames of coronary IVUS corresponding to 15 patients was performed by two experts i.e., region of interest (ROI) computed for all the 2865 frames. The region between these two borders (LI and MA) has region of interest (ROI) as shown in Fig. 4
                        . In Fig. 4a, the inner yellow curve shows the LI interface (or IEL) and outer yellow curve shows the MA interface (or EEL), while Fig. 4b shows the region of interest (ROI). Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                         show the coronary artery ring images of high risk and low risk patients based on the retrospectively assigned ground truth carotid plaque burden risk labels, respectively.

In the proposed paradigm, we have an offline and an online component corresponding to training and testing, respectively shown in Fig. 7
                        . The system uses SVM-based classifier for tissue classification. Nonlinear kernel functions were used in SVM-based classifier, because the extracted features were not linearly separable. Cross validation with 10 trials was used to reduce variability. In both online and offline components, feature extraction was performed, which consisted of extraction of seven sets of grayscale texture features namely: (i) gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), (ii) gray level run length matrix (GLRLM), (iii) intensity histogram, (iv) gray level difference statistics (GLDS), (v) neighborhood gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM), (vi) invariant moment, and (vii) statistical feature matrix (SFM), totaling to 56 features. Using the second hypothesis, cIMT was adapted to generate the high risk/low risk (0/1) labels as part of the ground truth. Extracted grayscale coronary features and the class labels derived from ground truth carotid cIMT is fed to the offline local processing system. This produces the system parameter model as an output. Further, in an online phase, features of the online data and parameter model from training section have been fed to the online classifier to predict the risk of coronary artery disease patients. Using this setup, we ran three experimental protocols: First experimental protocol is to find the best kernel function on the basis of high accuracy for a given fold value (K), Second experimental protocol is to find the best feature combination on the basis of classification accuracy derived in fixed data size (N) framework. In experiment three, the system generalization is verified by observing the behavior of classification accuracy with increasing data size.

Feature extraction is done to extract the grayscale plaque features from the vessel wall region of the coronary IVUS ring images. These plaque features are derived from the plaque components such as fibrous, fibrolipidic, calcified and calcified-necrotic, fatty plaque, lipid-rich, dense calcium, necrotic core and fibro-fat. Overall, we have extracted 56 grayscale features using seven grayscale feature combination set.

GLCM is a statistical tool for extracting texture information present in an image by considering the neighbored relationship of pixels [52]. Let I be a given grayscale 2D image, containing pixels with gray levels (0, 1, …, L
                           
                              g
                           
                           −1). The GLCM is a matrix M
                           
                              x
                            of order L, where the P
                           
                              d
                            (i, j)th entry of M
                           
                              x
                            represents probability of the number of occasions a pixel with intensity i is adjacent to a pixel with intensity j. The normalized co-occurrence matrix is obtained by dividing each element of M
                           
                              x
                            by the total number of co-occurrence pairs in M
                           
                              x
                           . The adjacency can be specified in any direction such as horizontal, vertical, right, left and diagonal. The texture features were calculated by taking the average of specified direction of co-occurrence matrix. We have extracted 18 features shown in Table A1 of Appendix A.

GLRLM measures the gray intensity pixel in a particular direction from the reference pixel. Run length is defined as a set of collinear pixels having the same gray level in a particular direction [52]. GLRLM is a 2-D matrix in which element p(x, y) gives the total number of consecutive runs of length y at gray level x. We have extracted 13 features using GLRLM as shown in Table A2 of Appendix A. Here, m represents the number of gray levels and L represents the maximum run length.

Brightness and contrast are the signification characteristic of the histogram [52]. Following features are calculated under intensity histogram such as: mean, energy, variance, entropy, skewness and kurtosis. Mean calculate the brightness of an image and individual calcifications. Variance calculates the contrast of an image. High variance shows the good contrast of an image. Skew shows how the gray level distributed in an image. Skew is directly proportional to energy. Entropy is the inverse of skew and energy. Grayscale features were extracted as shown in Table A3 of Appendix A.

The GLDS algorithm is based on absolute differences between pairs of gray levels [53]. For any given displacement d
                           =(X

                              gl
                            number of gray levels, then it forms N
                           
                              gl

                              c
                           (i, j), will have value k. We have extracted four texture features using GLDS as shown in Table A4 of Appendix A.

NGTDM defines the texture features [53]. It is basically a column matrix m(i) where each absolute value is the difference of pixel under observation and the mean of pixels in its neighborhood. From the NGTDM, five texture features i.e., coarseness, contrast, busyness, complexity and texture length are derived. Coarseness is the measure of deviation of pixel from its neighborhood. Its large values indicate coarse (small) gray level differences in the area i.e. coarse texture. On the contrary the contrast is the measure of higher gray level differences in area to have clear visibility between them. Busyness presents the rapid change in the gray levels from one pixel to its neighborhood. Its small values indicate a high level of uniformity in intensity in the area. Next the complexity refers to the visual information of the texture. The texture is complex when the information content is very high. Texture strength is difficult to define but briefly it is said as higher strength when basic elements that comprise it are distinguishable. We have extracted above texture features as shown in Table A5 of Appendix A.

Invariant moment features were proposed by Hu [52] and it describes the image as being invariant under translation, change in scale, rotation and localization and makes the system reliable. The seven features extracted using raw moments r

                           . We have extracted four texture features shown in Table A7 of Appendix A.

In our proposed model, support vector machine (SVM) is used for binary classification. An SVM classifies the data by finding the best hyper-plane that separates all data points of one class from those of the other class. The best hyper-plane for an SVM has the largest margin between the two classes. Margin defines the maximal width of the two slabs parallel to the hyper-plane that has no interior data points. Other than conventional linear classification, for non-linear separable features, kernel functions are used [54,55]. The detailed description of SVM is provided in Appendix B.

We have followed three experimental protocols presented in this section. In the first experiment, all five kernel functions were compared against different K fold values for fixed data size (N), out of which the best kernel was selected on the basis of classification accuracy. In the second experimental protocol, we have compared the feature combinations for three fold values (K
                     =5, 10 and N) on fixed data size (N). The best feature combination was selected on the basis of classification accuracy. The third experimental protocol analyzes the behavior of classifier on changing data size (N) to evaluate the generalized nature of the proposed system.

The experiment presented in this section is about evaluation of classification accuracy and selection of best SVM kernel function. In this experiment, we have kept the data size fixed i.e., N
                        =2865, in which 1508 were high risk IVUS patient images, and 1357 were low risk IVUS patient images. These images were fed into the automated system to extract the texture features which were then used as input to the classifier. Using the cross-validation approach, best SVM-kernel was chosen based on the classification accuracy.

In this experimental protocol, we have derived six feature combinations given below in Table 1
                        . Next, we evaluated the classification accuracy using each feature combination, and the best feature combination was chosen based on the highest classification accuracy. This feature combination set was then used for all the further experiments with best SVM-kernel type.

In this experimental protocol, we have analyzed the performance of the proposed automated system at variable data size ranging from N
                        =150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900, 1050, 1200, 1350 to N
                        =1500. This has been done to observe the stability of the system with respect to data size which eventually helps to achieve generalization unlike memorization.

This section provides the results of the above three experimental protocols. In the first experiment, best kernel function is selected for the SVM classifier using optimization procedure. In the second experiment protocol, the best feature combination is chosen on the basis of optimized classification accuracy. Lastly, in third experiment protocol, we analyze the accuracy against change in dimension of dataset.

In the first experiment protocol, classification accuracy was calculated for five different SVM kernel functions and for 13 K-fold values as shown in Table 2
                        . It is observed from Table 2 that the polynomial kernel function of order 2 gives better classification accuracy for all 13 K-fold values. Accuracy as a function of fold values is depicted in Fig. 8
                        , which clearly shows that the performance of polynomial kernel function of polynomial order 2 is higher as compared to other kernel functions.

In the second experiment, we have a dataset which contains 2865 images, out of which 1508 were high risk patient images and 1357 were low risk patient images. Different feature combinations were prepared and classification accuracy was computed for each feature combination and for three different K fold values (Table 3
                        ). The feature combination FC6 gives better classification accuracy as compared to other feature combinations for all fold value K
                        =5, 10 and N. For fold value K
                        =5, FC6 has produced an accuracy 94.84%. Similarly for K
                        =10 and K
                        =
                        N, the accuracy of 94.95% and 95.30%, respectively has been obtained using FC6. The accuracy as a function of feature combination is depicted in Fig. 9
                         for all three K fold values.

In third experiment, we have analyzed the effect of changing data size on the classification accuracy of the machine learning system for different data size ranging from N
                        =150 to 1500. The accuracy of the system was between 92% and 97.89%. The accuracy of the classifier is monotonically increasing as shown in Table 4
                         and Fig. 10
                        .

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

Five performance measures i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve i.e., AUC were computed for all five kernels and for selected feature combination FC6 as shown in Table 5
                      and Fig. 11
                     . It can be clearly seen that the polynomial kernel function of order 2 produce better performance parameter as compared to other kernels with AUC 0.95.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

In this study, we have developed a machine learning based CADx system for coronary artery disease risk stratification. The two hypothesis behind our study were: (a) there exists multiple components of plaque in the coronary vessel wall which accounts to risk and needed to be characterized, and (b) cIMT biomarker has ability to characterize the cardiovascular disease and thus could be used as a label indicator for high and low risk coronary artery disease. The first hypothesis leads us to the concept of tissue characterization based on machine learning paradigm. The second hypothesis leads us to create a high risk vs. low risk label for patients which lead us to the detection of high/low risk CAD patients. The above model offers the advantage of low cost and less laborious paradigm compared to histology-based label generation.

The above derived parameter models were provided to the online testing system to predict the risk of the coronary artery disease patients. To check performance of the system, we have followed three experimental protocols. In the first experimental protocol discussed in the section titled experimental protocol, polynomial kernel of order 2 was estimated to be the best SVM-kernel by optimizing the cross-validation procedure. It is further observed that after K
                        =10, there is monotonic change in accuracy for all the kernel functions with increase in K fold values, as depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 8. This has helped in restricting our fold values to K
                        =5, 10, … N (jack knife). In second experimental protocol, various combinations of features i.e., invariant moment, intensity histogram, GLCM, GLRLM, GLDS, SFM, and NGTDM were utilized. These feature spaces can be seen in [56,57] for skin disease classification but have never been used before in ultrasound for coronary risk assessment combined with carotid plaque burden. The extracted features were not linearly separable; therefore we used the nonlinear kernel functions [54] in SVM classification. K-fold cross validation has been used along with 10 trials (T) to reduce variability [51]. This has achieved the classification accuracy of 94.95% shown in Table 5 and Fig. 11. In third experimental protocol, increasing the data size (N) has shown slight change in accuracy after N
                        =300 for all fold values (K
                        =5, 10, … N) as presented in Table 4 and Fig. 10. This shows at least 300 samples are required for stable and reliable performance of the machine learning system.


                        Table 1 showed the six feature combination in the increasing order of feature selection. This means, the number of feature in FC6 has seven feature spaces namely: IH, GLCM, GLDS, IM, NGTDM, SFM, and GLRLM. This accounts to set of 56 novel features for coronary plaque vessel wall region. Our observation shows that for all three fold values (K
                        =5, K
                        =10, K
                        =
                        N (Jackknife)), the accuracy is higher using the feature FC6 combination. We also see the behavior of monotonic increase in accuracy from 85% to 95%, which is about 10% increase with the increase in feature combination set. Furthermore with increase of every feature combination space there is improvement in accuracy by 2%. This implies that the most fundamental feature GLCM is alone able to characterize the vessel wall region up to 82% with the addition of 13 features. GLRLM space improved the accuracy by 2% which account for gray level runs for long and short runs. IH features again boosted the accuracy by 2% which accounted for mean, variance, and standard deviation. The next 2% increase in accuracy by GLDS which accounted for features – contrast, angular moment, entropy and its mean. Similarly both NGTDM and IM improved the accuracy by 2%. Thus, we found that with an increase in the feature combination, we are able to capture these high and low risk plaque components such as fibrotic, narcotic, calcified. Further FC6 showed that all seven feature space combination easily captured these plaque components which were taken by us as part of the first hypothesis. Furthermore this also authenticates our second hypothesis that is cIMT is good biomarker for CAD risk prediction using our machine learning paradigm.

A typical machine learning system is intended to achieve a generalization unlike memorization during its training and testing phases. The relationship between generalization and accuracy of classification is very closely knitted. This relationship is further tied to the data size of the machine learning system. The behavior of classification accuracy typically increases with the increase in data size leading to stabilization. The tendency of the machine learning process should show an increase in classification accuracy with an increase in the data size and such behaviors validates the hypothesis; the machine learning model is based on. Our study encountered a similar set of results where the classification accuracy tended to increase with data size leading to the point of diminishing return. Fig. 10 demonstrated as the data size increased, the accuracy increased leading to flattering of accuracy curve like plateau. Note carefully the data size modeled here is the number of frames acquired from the population pool of 15 subjects. Thus data size is not the 15 subjects, rather 2865 frames (see Section 2.4 on data size and preparation) which is collected using global processing (stage 1) of the machine learning. Since tissue characterization uses the vessel wall region from 2865 frames to build the cross validation of the machine learning system, thus it does not matter as to how many source were adopted to derive this data.

To the best of our knowledge, there has been no machine learning based CADx system design which has estimated the risk stratification based on tissue characteristics of coronary artery disease linking carotid artery disease. We have presented here the brief literature of similar carotid image classification. Table 6
                         shows the comparative summary of proposed method and other classification methods. Modern neural network approach for carotid plaque classification has been proposed in [38]. It has used ten different texture feature sets extracted from manually segmented plaque images. The author used 61 texture features and achieved a classification accuracy of 73.10%. In another similar attempt [39], neural network approach for carotid plaque classification was presented. They have reported classification accuracy of 71.2% with only 10 texture and morphological features. In [40], the author analyzed B-mode ultrasound image of carotid artery and showed the usage of hybrid neural network approach for carotid plaque classification. They extracted 21 features estimated from Law's texture energy and obtained an accuracy of 99.10%. A SVM-based approach for carotid plaque classification was proposed by [41]. This was to investigate the usefulness of multilevel binary and gray scale morphological analysis in the assessment of atherosclerotic carotid plaques. Ultrasound images were recorded from 137 asymptomatic and 137 symptomatic plaques extracted using 10 texture features and reported an accuracy of 73.70%. An enhanced activity index approach has been presented for carotid plaque classification in [48]. A set of echo-morphology and texture features was fused with clinical information for classification. The classification performance assessed by means of the Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO) cross validation technique applied to a population of 146 total plaques and yielded an overall accuracy of 77%.

A series of papers were written by Suri's team for tissue characterization on carotid plaque: In [42], the authors describe a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system that analyzed the ultrasound images and classified them into symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques. In this, authors extracted texture features and achieved an accuracy of 82.40% for SVM-based classification compared to 81.7% using AdaBoost. Same group presented another study [43], with increased number of features and reported an accuracy of 83% using SVM classifier. In one more study [47] of the same group, texture features on data size of 492 gave an accuracy of 85.3% using SVM-based classifier.

In our proposed model, SVM is used for classification of IVUS-based coronary artery diseased images into high risk or low risk image frames. We have extracted 56 texture features on data size of 2865 coronary ultrasound image frames. We have considered the complete coronary artery ultrasound video in our study.

There has been an attempt to characterize the coronary tissue wall region into different plaque components by few authors. In [9], the authors compared the lipid-rich and soft plaque components against collagen-rich and hard plaques suggesting that lipid-rich and soft plaque are unstable and are prone to rupture. The authors in [10] presented an online integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound (IB-IVUS) system for tissue characterization. IB values were classified into lipid-rich, fibro-calcific and fibrous plaque components. In [11], the authors showed tissue characterization approach for classification of plaque into four components such as: fibrotic tissue, dense calcium, necrotic core and fibro-fat. The authors adapted geometric features from virtual histology IVUS images. In [12], the study showed the role of intravascular elastography for different tissue characterization, where the authors showed three different plaque coronary components such as: fibrous, fatty plaque and fibro-fatty components.

Notice carefully that all the above modalities and approaches use tissue characterization into component classification, rather than the risk stratification or risk assessment. The scope of our study is to characterize the coronary plaque wall region based on tissue characterization using linear and non-linear models, and adapt the two key hypotheses for establishing the machine learning approach for coronary risk assessment and use carotid artery disease to link with coronary artery disease. Our hypothesis assumes that vessel wall region has these risk associated plaque components and the goal is to model these regions to stratify the severity of the risk using machine learning approach.

Carotid disease is significantly correlated with coronary artery disease severity as shown in [58]. The authors showed that in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic performance (initially screened for chest pain), the presence of carotid disease reflected the presence of CAD severity, while in patients with normal ejection fraction, the absence of carotid disease reflected the absence of CAD severity. In [59], the authors concluded that patients with mean cIMT value greater than 1.15mm had a 94% chance of CAD.

In [60,61], the author leveraged the genetic link between the cIMT (from carotid disease) and cardiovascular (CV) risk. The author concluded that carotid plaque was more powerful predictor of CV risk compared to cIMT alone, i.e., if we take both cIMT and carotid plaque as biomarkers, this can improve the CV risk prediction. The cIMT used by the medical community is limited by the fact that the measurements are semi-automated and these measurements are only taken at fixed locations unlike the methods presented by Suri's team, which takes the entire CCA (analogous to total plaque area) into account and sampling over 100–400 points along the CCA [33,34,62–64]. In [19], the authors showed that carotid IMT is a good surrogate marker of coronary atherosclerosis. They showed that carotid atherosclerosis correlated better with coronary atherosclerosis when both circulations were investigated by the same technique (ultrasound) using the same parameter (cIMT). In [20], the author showed the relationship between cIMT and coronary atherosclerosis. This reflected the unpredictability in the development of atherosclerosis between the vascular beds. In [24], the author showed that cIMT predicted the cardiovascular risk of older women unlike the older man as compared to traditional risk factors. In [27], 496 patients underwent carotid ultrasound and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) analysis along with coronary angiography. The study was divided into groups based on cIMT and ABI index and found that 75% had coronary artery disease among groups of patients having mean cIMT≥0.9mm and ABI<0.9. The correlation between the carotid and coronary atherosclerosis SYNTAX score was further improved by the same group [30] using automated ultrasound carotid bulb plaque IMT measurement. They reported correlation between automated cIMT and SYNTAX score that was found to be 0.467 (P
                        <0.0001) in comparison to 0.391 (P
                        <0.0001) for the correlation between the sonographer's IMT reading and SYNTAX score. Moreover, the precision of automated cIMT against the manual radiologist reading was reported 98.86%. In another study [28,29] correlation between coronary calcium lesion volume and left cIMT has been reported based on shape. Based on aforementioned articles, we took cIMT value of 0.9mm as a benchmark in our proposed model for coronary artery disease risk assessment.

Even though, cIMT has shown to be a strong predictor of CVE and CVD, there can be an extension from cIMT to grayscale plaque area (also called as total plaque area (TPA) [65–68]) as possible ground truth for our training and testing phases during the risk prediction. The scope of the current study adapted cIMT biomarker as the ground truth for risk stratification. We demonstrated our machine learning approach for coronary tissue characterization for risk stratification utilizing SVM for learning and testing phases. Our approach fully complies with the two hypotheses, where cIMT was used for characterizing the CV risk which is along the lines of previously published literature.

Today cardiologists need a CADx system that has to be not only accurate and reliable, but also helpful to them in quick decision making during PCI procedures. In this paper, we have developed a machine learning image-based CADx system on a retrospective study and not a longitudinal or prospective study. Thus, cerebrovascular events or myocardial infarction information was not available during this study. This technique uses a comprehensive feature space extraction using 56 features which uses the atherosclerotic genetic link between cerebrovascular and coronary artery to build the CADx machine learning system for clinical risk stratification.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) severity depends on many parameters. In current scenario where our cohort consisted of diabetic patients, such population has chances of cardiac arrest compared to non-diabetic patients. If a patient is diabetic, having a carotid plaque (cIMT>0.9 or 1.0mm) and further, if the nature of coronary plaque in coronary artery is asymptomatic, our CADx system can help in giving a second opinion on the severity of coronary artery disease. Hence, the proposed system is very valuable to a cardiologist during intervention procedure. The encouraging results using our proposed system for coronary artery disease risk assessment can help cardiologists with quick decision making and can improve their work-flow.

We proposed a method on a solid foundation of two hypotheses which are derived from a pool of leading strategist in the field: (a) the plaque components have several tissue components and have a risk associated with it. These risks are derived using the tissue characteristics of coronary artery vessel region; (b) the carotid risk cIMT biomarker has a clear relationship to cardiovascular events. The system takes into consideration all the IVUS frames of the coronary artery and corresponding cIMT values. Lastly the system is fully automated and can handle full volumes during training and testing phases.

Though the above system clearly has merits, but we must highlight few challenges we encountered: (a) inter-observer variability could have been tried on the IVUS volumetric frames during the feedback system design of the ring image generations using ImgTracer™. (b) Since the features space was large, in future, there could be a more efficient system design incorporating PCA or Fisher Discriminate Analysis. (c) This prototype did utilized two manual readers for coronary vessel wall region extraction, however more work needs to be perform to understand the effect of plaque intra-variability and motion [29].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A CADx system for automatic classification of high risk and low risk patient's coronary artery images with user guided wall region of interest has been presented in this paper. The fundamental model was based on two key hypotheses: (i) coronary vessel wall have multiple plaque components and associated risk; (ii) carotid intima-media thickness has direct relationship to cardiovascular events. Support vector machine (SVM) learning paradigm was adapted for risk stratification, where both, learning and cross-validation phases used grayscale tissue characteristics derived from 56 features in the K-fold cross validation protocol with 10 trials per fold. The system achieved a classification accuracy of 94.95% and AUC of 0.95. The CADx system showed encouraging results and such a model can be helpful in risk characterization of coronary artery disease.
