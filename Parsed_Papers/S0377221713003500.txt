                  Managing knowledge based resource capabilities has become very important in recent years and during a finite horizon it seems to be reasonable to develop the capabilities intensively at the beginning as one can utilize those over a longer period of time. With the help of multi-period models we check the validity of this idea and characterize the dynamics of development activities. The paper identifies the factors that shape these dynamics and from the behavior of these factors we conclude when the dynamics can be increasing or decreasing. We point out that in stable environment there is tendency for decreasing dynamics but future expectations can significantly modify this outcome. Relationships between the successful or less successful implementation of a business strategy and the dynamics of improvement activities are highlighted as well. For specific model structures explicit solutions are derived.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The implementation of continuous process improvement seems to be a crucial point in modern business life. Not long ago, when Mr. Watanabe, the chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, was asked about the essence of Toyota Way, he mentioned continuous improvement as one of the two most important pillars of managing a company (Watanabe, 2007). The successful implementation of the principles of the Toyota Production System has revolutionized many industries, and the principles of TPS are used by many other manufacturers like Porsche or VW (Fear & Knoop, 2007).

The inclusion of process improvement into models is popular, especially since the appearance of seminal papers like (Fine (1986)), or Dorroh, Gulledge, and Womer (1994), who presented a model to determine the amount of resources to be devoted to knowledge acquisition. Chand, Moskowitz, Novak, Rekhi, and Sorger (1996) developed a dynamic model and analyzed the effect of continuous process improvement on capacity allocation to maximize profit over time. They introduce the concept of productivity knowledge that can be increased by improvement activities. Li and Rajagopalan’s (1998) study models quality assurance efforts, level of productivity and quality knowledge improvement efforts as decision variables. All these studies advocate early significant investments with declining rate in knowledge discovery programs. Besides this extensive theoretical development of dynamic quality-based learning models Ittner, Nagar, and Rajan (2001) carried out a direct empirical test of these models. Carillo and Gaimon (2000) identify conditions whereby investment into process change occurs at an increasing rate over time, but in their model process change may cause immediate losses. In one of their later studies, Carillo and Gaimon (2004) define two models to gain insights on how plant performance is impacted by training and process change. Vörös (2006) builds a model whereby demand directly depends on the performance quality of the product. The inclusion of quality improvement process into the dynamic approaches has been recently analyzed by Chenavaz (2012) and it was found that under multiplicative separable demand function process innovation is the main determinant of a firm’s pricing policy over time and product innovation has no impact. In the paper of Li and Lee (2010) the driving dynamics of quality is considered in case of peer-production. Among others, they found that a monopolistic platform provider has no incentive to offer multiple quality classes of services. The operations-marketing interface is further analyzed by De Giovanni (2011) where both advertising and quality improvement contribute to the build up of goodwill, and the co-operation of manufacturer and retailer leads to a better market position.

Considering simultaneous quality and process improvement activities Vörös (2006) pointed out also that the dynamics of quality and process improvement activities can be increasing as well, however he missed to fully characterize the dynamics of improvement activities. Thus, according to the wide variety of research reports, already alone the dynamic behavior of improvement activities is a challenging question.

This study attempts to identify all the factors that shape the dynamic nature of improvement activities and provides a complete analysis of when are the dynamics of improvement activities increasing or decreasing. The paper determines a key expression and finds that the dynamic behavior of the components of this key expression explains mainly the dynamics of improvement activities.

Interestingly, in all the theoretical models mentioned above, time is a continuous variable, and the tools of optimal control theory are used. Models many times tend to assume continuous differentiability and time independent model parameters, and we rarely see multi period models in this field. Recently, one of the latest contributions is made by Berstein and Kök (2009), who develop a multi-period model and consider a decentralized assembly system with process improvement activities. Among others, they point out that under cost contingent contracts, there always exists an equilibrium (in Stackelberg competition) where in each period either all suppliers invest in process improvement or no supplier does. They provide a procedure to calculate the optimal investments into productivity knowledge.

This paper develops multi period versions of optimal control models to analyze the dynamic nature of price and improvement activities. In this model the time horizon is divided into periods and in each period we have to make decision on the intensity of improvement activities. In turn, improvement activities, if they are at positive level, increase the productivity knowledge. The level of productivity knowledge at each period determines unit production costs. In each period we make decision on price level as well, which determines the volume of demand at the period. At the end of the planning horizon the accumulated knowledge can be sold at a given price. A strong characteristic of the model is that the input parameters of demand function may vary from period to period.

Although the Berstein and Kök (2009) single firm model is a multi period one, their model is also analyzed for the special case when the parameters of the linear demand function are time independent in order to ease the understanding the nature of more general structures. This analysis helps us to reveal relationships between model structures and the dynamics of improvement activities. Besides the insights provided by the multi period technique, we give the explicit description of the optimal solution for this special parameter setting.

Altogether, our study intends to extend our knowledge in four points: for rather general models, among the most interesting findings there is the identification of the factors that shape the dynamics of improvement activities. Moreover, finding relationship between model structure and the dynamics of improvement activities, the paper classifies models from which the dynamics of improvement activities simply must follow. This result allows us to position the well known models mentioned above in a table which classifies the model structures (see Table 2 later). The study reveals relationship between the successful or less successful implementation of a business strategy and the dynamics of improvement activities (see Table 1
                      later), and gives the explicit solution of models with linear demand and investment cost functions.

The next section develops a rather general multi period model, and Section 3 analyzes this model with linear demand and investment cost functions. Based on this, in Section 4 the analysis turns back to the basic model and Section 5 explains why the dynamics must sometimes follows from model structures. Section 6 presents the conclusions.

In this section we formulate a general model and the final aim is to analyze it. To ease the discussion, first we specify the functions of the general model in the next step, and later we turn back to the base case. We suppose that our firm’s product has unique characteristics others cannot copy, substitute, or imitate easily, thus our firm can behave like a monopoly with certain extent. This way demand can be described by the function D
                     
                        t
                     (p
                     
                        t
                     ) at period t, where p
                     
                        t
                      is the selling price of the product at period t, and we divide the planning horizon into T periods (t
                     =1,…,
                     T). The unit production variable cost is c(q
                     
                        t
                     ) at period t, where q
                     
                        t
                      measures the accumulated productivity knowledge at period t. This productivity knowledge can be increased by improvement activities at each period, and the extent of the improvement activities at period t is measured by the variable y
                     
                        t
                     . The cost of this productivity improvement effort is f(y
                     
                        t
                     ) at period t. We suppose that at the end of the planning horizon the accumulated productivity knowledge can be sold at the unit price of P. As the lowest possible value of this parameter can be zero, the inclusion of the selling price of productivity knowledge extends the scope of the study, more importantly, positions our model closer to real life. Managers frequently introduce new product generations on the basis of knowledge accumulated during the life of previous generations, purchase knowledge, or sell it when they quit the business. Thus the accumulated productivity knowledge may have value. Let us note that Li and Rajagopalan (1998) already have used the concept.

                     r), where r is the discount rate, and a
                     
                        t
                      are positive parameters.

In Model (1) the discounted gross profit, plus the terminal value of the accumulated productivity knowledge are maximized under the rule of how productivity knowledge is accumulating. We suppose that productivity knowledge accumulates as a linear function of improvement efforts.

To ease the exploration of the nature of the model varified in (1), first we define simplified versions. Berstein and Kök (2009) point out interesting characteristics of the model in (1) when the unit variable cost function c(q
                     
                        t
                     )=
                     c
                     0(q
                     
                        t
                     )−β
                      (where c
                     0 and β are positive parameters), the productivity improvement (investment) cost function f(y
                     
                        t
                     )=
                     ky
                     
                        t
                     , k
                     >0, where k is constant parameter, moreover P
                     =0, and a
                     
                        t
                     
                     =1 for all t. We further simplify their model with assuming time independent parameters at the demand function. We are going to point out some properties of the dynamics of variable y (the level of improvement efforts) with linear demand functions. Let us assume the parameters of the demand function do not depend on time, i.e. D
                     
                        t
                     (p
                     
                        t
                     )=
                     α
                     −
                     γp
                     
                        t
                     , where α and γ are positive parameters.

Technically we can assume that γ
                     =1 in the demand function. Before turning to the multi period case, it will be useful to study the properties of the following one period model:

                        Proposition 1
                        
                           Process improvement is not always beneficial. Too high heritage of productivity knowledge and poor results of improvement efforts, or expensive development hinder investments into productivity knowledge. On the other hand, large marginal benefit of improvement efforts spurs investments.

                                    1
                                 
                              
                              )

                              k

The left-hand-side of (8) is the function Φ we defined in (3). If k
                     ⩾
                     Φ
                     
                        max
                     , then y
                     =0, and as we assumed that α
                     >
                     c
                     0 (q
                     0)−β
                     , there will be positive level production, i.e. (6) has feasible solution. (Otherwise sell the knowledge at the highest possible price.)

On the other hand, if k
                     <
                     Φ
                     
                        max
                     , the equation Φ
                     =
                     k has solution for q, and we denoted it by q
                     
                        opt
                     . If this q
                     
                        opt
                     
                     <
                     q
                     0, then (5b) is strict inequality, and by (5c), y
                     =0. Otherwise, y
                     =
                     q
                     
                        opt
                     
                     −
                     q
                     0 and (5b) is equality.

Now let us turn to (6), and multiply both sides with the optimal production quantity (α
                     −
                     p), and denoting the optimal profit volume without investment cost by Π, we can write the following:
                        
                           (9)

                     Based on (7), substituting the optimal price into (9), we have

                     Consequently, δ

                     =
                     δΦ/δq, what we have already analyzed. Thus we know that δ

                     Π/δq
                     2 changes sign exactly at q
                     
                        max
                     , and until this point Π is convex, and after concave. When y
                     =0, then L
                     =
                     Π. When y

                     −
                     ky, and each unit growth of the productivity knowledge heritage (q
                     0) substitutes one unit of y, and thus save the cost of k. Consequently, the increase of the objective function is linear in q
                     0 until the point q
                     
                        opt

                        Example 1

                           =6.75. Thus the equation Φ(q)=
                           k has solution for q, moreover this solution is q

                     Proposition 2. fully characterizes the dynamics of the process improvement activities and gives the explicit solution of the problem. The proof can be found in Appendix A.

The managerial insight provided by Proposition 2 is that in case of stable environment development takes place at most the first period only. Then the resources inherited and developed in the first period are utilized throughout the time horizon and no further development is suggested. The stable environment is expressed by the fact that the parameters of the demand function do not change over time expressing that the reaction of customers for price changes is the same in each period. Only a very favorable, large selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of the time horizon can modify these dynamics. There will be a positive level investment at the final period, because the accumulated knowledge can be sold at a very lucrative price. So, in case of linear demand and investment cost functions with time independent parameters, only large, favorable selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of time horizon involves the increase of improvement activities at the final period. Otherwise, improvement activities are kept at zero level over time, except the first period, only if the heritage of the productivity knowledge is low, and the marginal benefit of the improvement activities is sufficiently high. Price and production levels are constant over time, except when improvement activities are at positive level at the final period.

                           =5. Moreover, let us suppose that the accumulated productivity knowledge has no value at the end of the time horizon, thus P
                           =0.

Then again, the marginal benefit of improving productivity knowledge, as function of q, is described as

                           . As the value of P
                           =0, activities are at zero levele at the final period. As k
                           2

                              max
                            (and lower than k), improvement activities will be at positive level at the first period, and are zero during the rest of periods. The solution of the equation Φ(q)=

                            for each period, and demand (or production) level is 3.4 units in each period. Unit variable production cost does not change over the time, which is 1.26. It is interesting to note that while the level of improvement activities is decreasing over time, the accumulated productivity knowledge is significantly larger at the five-period model than at the one-period model. The recommended activity level is seven time units during the first period and zero during the rest of periods.

Utilizing the insights we gained with the linear functions, we decrease the specifications, and turn back to model (1) with the following assumptions. Let us assume that a
                     
                        t
                     
                     =
                     a for all t, and connected with the functions of the model, we assume that c(q) is decreasing and convex function of q. Concerning the demand function, we assume that D
                     
                        t
                     (c(q
                     0))>0, i.e. there are customers who are willing to pay more for the product than its production cost. This means that the system is able to produce a profit. We further assume that D
                     
                        t
                     (p
                     
                        t
                     ) is decreasing in price and there exists a finite K, for which D
                     
                        t
                     (p
                     
                        t
                     )<
                     K, in each period. The cost of process improvement is measured by f(y
                     
                        t
                     ), which is increasing and strictly convex. These assumptions are used widely in the related literature and one can find an extensive explanation for the diseconomies of scale connected with increasing knowledge in Carillo and Gaimon (2004), for example.

                     Similar relationship for modeling the accumulating knowledge has been used by Chand et al. (1996), Li and Rajagopalan (1998) or Berstein and Kök (2009), while Carillo and Gaimon (2000) assumed that process change can cause immediate losses as well. The meaning of this assumption is that parameter a may have negative values temporarily. (In our assumptions parameter a is positive.)

In this case the objective function reduces to the form of

Otherwise, when the convex cost function f increases so rapidly that its derivative has no values to match the right-hand side, improvement activities are set to zero. The improvement activities are not efficient as their costs exceed benefits determined by the right-hand side.

The statements are proved in Appendix B. Similar findings for undiscounted cases are noted already in Li and Rajagopalan (1998). However, it is interesting to note that Carillo and Gaimon (2000) do not discount the generated revenue and salvaged value, and they are the first to mention the possibility of increasing improvement dynamics. We believe this observation comes from their assumption that process change can cause immediate loss in effective capacity.

For discounted cases, the proposition gives the complete identification of forces that drives the dynamics of process improvement activities. It gives up the wisdom that the advantage of extensive investments at the beginning of the time horizon is the utilization of increased productivity knowledge through longer time periods, which fuels the belief that improvement activities should be decreasing over time.

One of the important relationships determined in Appendix B by (B4) is that

                      values play role in setting the difference between two consecutive values of marginal costs of improvement. When the future looks nice, the hope of large salvage value spurs late investments. Similarly, high capital cost pushes investments closer to those late periods where knowledge is better utilized.

When the current advantage of knowledge increase is relatively high, there is tendency for decreasing improvement efforts, but when future benefits are high, late investments are encouraged. The current and late benefits of the improvement efforts are determined by the dynamics of

By Camillus (2008), the operational excellence based on cost efficiency is one of the most important strategic tools. If the company is outstanding in utilizing operational resources, the operations advantage can be the driving factor of the business strategy (Hayes, Pisano, Upton, & Wheelwright, 2005).

When the product positioned and designed well, moreover the efficiency of operations allows using optimally low prices, demand will be large. Additionally, when competitors cannot imitate, copy or substitute the product – see the concept of Collis and Montgomery (1995) –, the company will have sustainable position, and there will be a tendency for an increasing dynamics for

The efficient utilization of resources results in positive activities, and productivity knowledge will grow. As a result of this not only the unit production cost will drop, but price as well, which increases demand. Efficient operations create market this way, and finally

                      will grow with larger extent. These thoughts are summarized by Table 1. As it has been indicated, the expected selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge and the cost of capital also influence the dynamics of the improvement activities.

The next section explains that already a stable economic environment is enough to have decreasing dynamics of improvement activities. We suppose that a stable economic environment is expressed by the static parameters of the demand function. Actually, in most models when the tools of control theory are used, the parameters of demand functions do not change over time.

To be able to compare the results of the previous section with those of optimal control models, we specify some functions in model (1). So, let the parameters of the demand function be the same in each period, i.e. D
                     
                        t
                     (p
                     
                        t
                     )=
                     D(p
                     
                        t
                     ), satisfying both (16) and D(c(q
                     0))>0.

From (15), let us suppose that the optimal price at period t is determined by the following function:

                        t−1. Finally arriving at period one in similar way, we can say that improvement rates are decreasing over time. Let us note, that if period t is the last one with positive improvement rate, then there is no period between period 1 and t with zero improvement rate.

We have also seen the role of salvage value in the proof of Proposition 2. According to this, depending on the value of P, improvement rate at the final period can be even larger than in previous periods. This event forms a quasi convex shape for the improvement rates.

Like in Proposition 2, a similar analysis can be conducted when f(y)=
                     ky, as the basic nature of the unit cost function and demand function has not changed.

Let us note that at the model of Chand et al. (1996) the cost of improvement is formulated in the same way like in the Berstein and Kök (2009) model. In the Chand’s et al. (1996) model the system is normalized, model parameters do not depend on time, the salvage value (the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge at the end of the horizon) of the productivity knowledge is similarly set to zero, but an upper bound is inserted for capacity utilized jointly by production and improvement activities. The effectiveness of improvement activities is lower and lower as productivity knowledge converges to its upper bound, which is one

                     kδ section of Proposition 2 can be implemented here. When y

                     2, leaving room for y
                     2 to be positive. These observations are in full harmony with the properties of the optimal control version developed by Chand et al. (1996).

Based on this analysis, sometimes the dynamics of improvement activities follows from the model structure directly. It has been an important finding that when the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero at the end of the time horizon (salvage value of the accumulated knowledge is zero), additionally the parameters of the demand function are static over time, the dynamics of the improvement activities must be always decreasing. Additionally, if the investment cost is linear and static, improvement activities are at zero level over the time periods. At most, it may be positive at the first time period. Only a sufficiently high selling price of the productivity knowledge may change this rule, encouraging positive investment at the final period. Table 2
                      below classifies models according to the expected dynamics of improvement activities depending on the types of functions used in model (1).

This paper develops multi period models to characterize the dynamics of price and process improvement activity levels in order to find new properties. Interestingly, to analyze the property of process improvement activities, only optimal control models have been formulated, which tend to apply time independent demand functions. We have pointed out that in these models process improvement activities must be decreasing over time when the selling price of the accumulated productivity knowledge is zero or sufficiently low at the end of the planning horizon. (Except in the Carillo–Gaimon model, where although the discount rate is zero, but process change can cause immediate losses.) For some special structures, particularly when the investment cost function is linear, explicit solutions are derived. These solutions indicate that process improvement activities are zero in intermediate periods, and are positive at the terminal period in case of an attractive salvage value. They are positive at the first period when process improvement is beneficial and the initial productivity knowledge is sufficiently low. For more general model structures those driving forces of process improvement dynamics are identified that finally determine the quasi convex or concave nature of improvement rates. Providing access among optimal control and multi period models the paper resolves contradicting reports on the nature of the dynamics of improvement activities. In most cases contradictions simply stem from different model assumptions.

According to the findings, future expectations, capital cost, and dynamics of marginal total costs are the most important driving forces that directly shape and determine the quasi convex or concave nature of the improvement activities. However, the marginal total costs are mainly determined by the success of a business strategy. The marginal total cost has two major components: the demand and the marginal unit cost-the result of improvement efforts. If internal resources are utilized efficiently, there is significant cost saving due to productivity increase, and if additionally the positioning of the product is successful in the market, the demand may increase. These two components makes the dynamics of improvement rates quasi concave, indicating that it has sense to continue the utilization of accumulated knowledge further on. On the other hand, if improvement activities do not result in significant productivity increase, or demand rate decrease over time, the dynamics can be quasi convex. We showed also that time independent demand functions tend to exhibit this dynamics.

The limitations of our models hopefully provide ground for further research. Although we have formulated rather general objective functions, the constraint set requires further analysis. We assumed that positive level of improvement activities always includes the increase of productivity knowledge, moreover this relationship is linear and deterministic. The relief of these assumptions may lead to interesting results. Similarly, besides cost, including further competitive priorities, like quality for example, may expand our knowledge.

Subtracting (B1) from (B2), we can obtain a new picture on the driving forces that shape the dynamics of development activities:

                     From this it can be seen at once that when the cost of capital is zero, i.e. r
                     =0, the sign of the right hand side may not be positive, and is negative when demand is positive at period t. Consequently, when the cost of capital is zero, development activities may not increase over time.
