                  Improved authentication mechanisms are needed to cope with the increased data exposure we face nowadays. Keystroke dynamics is a cost-effective alternative, which usually only requires a standard keyboard to acquire authentication data. Here, we focus on recognizing users by keystroke dynamics using immune algorithms, considering a one-class classification approach. In such a scenario, only samples from the legitimate user are available to generate the model of the user. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the importance of proper data understanding and pre-processing. We show that keystroke samples from the same user present similarities in what we call typing signature. A proposal to take advantage of this finding is discussed: the use of rank transformation. This transformation improved performance of classification algorithms tested here and it was decisive for some immune algorithms studied in our setting.
