Alphorn of uncertainty

Project cumulative cost

Project financial status

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


               
               
                  In this paper, both the duration and the cost of an activity are modeled as random variables, and accordingly, the cumulative cost at each time point also becomes a random variable along a project’s progress. We first present the new concept of an “alphorn of uncertainty” (AoU) to describe the domain of cumulative cost variation throughout the life of a project and subsequently apply it to assess the project’s financial status over time. The shape of the alphorn was obtained by mixing Monte Carlo sampling with Gantt chart analysis, which enabled us to determine a project’s financial status related to specific payment modes. To validate the AoU, we designed and conducted an extensive numerical experiment using a randomly generated data set of activity networks. The results indicate that the AoU may be a promising method for the financial management of projects under uncertainty. Furthermore, financial status under uncertain conditions is not sensitive to an activity’s choice of duration distributions or to the form of cost functions. However, payment rules can greatly affect financial status over the duration of a project.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Projects are often subject to considerable uncertainty during their execution, which explains why activity durations are treated as random variables (r.v.s) in project scheduling problems. While much has been published regarding uncertainty in activity durations (Ballestin & Leus, 2009; Klerides & Hadjiconstantinou, 2010; Sobel, Szmerekovsky, & Tilson, 2009; Zhang, Tam, & Li, 2005; Zhu, Bard, & Yu, 2007), little has been conducted regarding other important parameters involved in a project’s progress that are greatly impacted by stochastic activity durations—in particular, activity costs, cumulative costs over time and profitability—and it is therefore reasonable to conclude that these parameters are also r.v.s. Unfortunately, discussions of cost or gain are usually conducted in a deterministic setting and the objective aims at minimizing total cost or at maximizing net present value (NPV). Clearly, total cost or NPV is only a performance indicator at the completion of a project, but financial status cannot be monitored while a project is in progress. That notwithstanding, project managers are often concerned with the financial status of pending projects, especially large-scale projects that continue over a long period of time (so-called ‘mega-projects’, see Flyvbjerg, Bruzellius, & Rothengatter, 2003). At different stages of project execution, contractors’ decisions are largely influenced by financial status. In reality, even some high-profit projects that are evaluated in the planning phase may turn out to be financial disasters due to sudden events occurring during the course of their implementations, such as cash shortages, equipment failures, and under- or over-estimation of task contents. Projects in uncertain environments may experience similar conditions more frequently. This embarrassing situation motivated us to investigate the effect of cost progress on financial risks during the execution of a project under uncertainty.

In this paper, we address the assessment of a project’s profits or losses over its life cycle under uncertainties involving both activity duration and cost. We submit that although the issue of time schedules has been extensively investigated in project scheduling literature, the cost progress on accompanying such schedules has largely been neglected. To the best of our knowledge, research on this topic has been scant. There are two research streams about project scheduling problems in deterministic settings that relate to this issue: the max-NPV and the earned value method (EV/EVM). Therefore, we briefly review these two streams from the perspective of cost progress.

In max-NPV and payment scheduling studies, a series of cash flows occurs as a project progresses. As contractors are induced to make expenditures through the use of various resources while activities are being executed, cost progress is involved, to a slight degree, in max-NPV. Because the time value of capital is considered when taking NPV as the performance measure, the time at which activity costs are disbursed will influence a project’s NPV. In the context of the max-NPV, activity expenses are differentiated into two types of cases. The first type of case is one in which the total cost is proportionally allocated to an activity’s beginning and ending events (Dayanand & Padman, 2001; He, Wang, Jia, & Xu, 2009), which can be easily understood by an activity-on-arc (AoA) representation. Alternatively, the total cost of an activity is assumed to have been incurred at either its beginning (Padman & Zhu, 2006; Szmerekovsky, 2005; Ulusory, Sivrikaya-Serifoglu, & Sahin, 2001) or its completion (Seifi & Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, 2008; Vanhoucke, Demeulemeester, & Herroelen, 2003; Varma, Uzsoy, Pekny, et al., 2007). The second type of case is one in which an activity’s total cost is uniformly (or unevenly) distributed as it progresses (Erenguc, Tufekci, & Zappe, 1993; Kavlak, Ulusoy, Sivrikaya-Serifoglu, & Birbil, 2009). Additionally, Chen, Zhang, Chung, et al. (2010) have stated that the constant cost for an activity arises at the beginning and that resource costs are incurred as resources are either occupied or consumed. Herroelen, Van Dommelen, and Demeulemeester (1997) gave an earlier review of the max-NPV with discounted cash flow. For recent comments on the max-NPV, we refer readers to Drezet (2008), Hartmann and Briskorn (2010), Weglarz, Jozefowska, Mika, et al. (2011), and He, Liu, and Jia (2012). As the max-NPV and payment scheduling problems involve payment behaviors between contractors and owners, methods of disbursing activity costs are of little concern.

The issues discussed in this paper are related to the concept of the EVM. In the past decade, the EVM in deterministic settings has received extensive coverage (Goodpasture, 2004; Marshall, 2007; Solomon & Young, 2006; Philipson & Antvik, 2009), but the uncertain nature of an activity’s progress is neglected in the traditional EVM. Additionally, probabilistic forecasting of project performances at completion is based on the concept of an S-curve in the EVM (Barraza, Edward Back, & Meta, 2004; Kim & Reinschmidt, 2009), while Naeni, Shadrokh, and Salehipour (2011) have discussed the EVM based on the fuzzy theory. However, the several researchers cited above have addressed predictions of project performance at completion, which do not involve either stochastic cumulative cost or financial status while a project is in progress. We share the basic tenet of the EVM, but note that we differ from the EVM in that we focus on at least two important issues. First, we take into account the inherent uncertainty of conducting activities; and second, we introduce multiple methods of expenditure among activities.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a description of the problem, assumptions and notations. In Section 3, we establish the rationale for the “alphorn of uncertainty” (AoU) and argue for the use of Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) to secure the AoU. This section also presents the application of the AoU to financial assessments associated with two payment modes during the execution of a project. Section 4 designs a full numerical experiment to gain new insights for projects’ financial statuses related to stochastic activity durations and costs. Conclusions and future extensions are presented in Section 5.

                     There are many realized scenarios for cumulative cost curves over the duration of a project due to stochastic durations and costs of activities, which accordingly form a cluster of cumulative cost curves. The upper bound (u.b.) and the lower bound (l.b.) on the cumulative cost curves at each time tf
                      during project execution can be described mathematically as follows:

The specific shape of an alphorn is formed between the u.b. and the l.b. over the progress of a project. This shape is very similar to the one developed by weather forecasters to forecast bounds on of all possible paths of a hurricane. Such an alphorn contains all possible paths of a project’s cumulative cost curves over its life, which supplies the new concept of the “alphorn of uncertainty” (AoU) that is defined and treated by this paper and that assesses a project’s financial status during its implementation. In theory, the AoU is the exact confidence interval in the form of two-dimension along a project’s progress, namely,

During project execution, contractors are extremely concerned about the financial status of a project under the stochastic cumulative cost. Contractors are subject to two types of cash flows: an outflow of funds to use when executing activities and an inflow of funds in the form of payments from owners. An owner’s payments can be organized in many ways, as discussed in the earlier-cited paper of Herroelen et al. (1997). In general, two modes of remuneration represent income to a contractor: either (i) payments are made according to a fixed time schedule (for example, once per quarter), which this paper denotes as ‘scheduled payments’, or (ii) payments are tied to the achievement of certain milestone events. In either mode, the cumulative net value (CNV) of a project at any time is a r.v. due to stochastic cumulative cost, which represents the difference between cumulative remuneration earned and cumulative costs incurred to date. Moreover, time points of remuneration earned are also r.v.s if they are tied to achieving milestones. The CNV may be positive, indicating income that exceeds expenses, or negative, indicating the opposite, which has serious implications for the profitability of a project and/or the process of making a bid.

Following the above description and definitions, we first find the u.b. and the l.b. on cumulative cost curves with the progress of a project (AoU). Then, combined with payment modes, we propose to analyze a project’s financial status over its duration based on its AoU.

Recalling that DTCTP_C|T in discrete time–cost trade-off problems (De, Dunne, Ghosh, & Wells, 1995) identifies a realization of project schedules that minimizes the total cost subject to a given deadline, which is the same as searching the minimal cumulative cost at completion from

                         project schedules, but more difficulty, we need to find the minimal and the largest ones at each t simultaneously. In other words, we solve a DTCTP_C|T (the given deadline is up to date tf
                        ) at each t over the life of a project, so we can conclude that DTCTP_C|T is a special case of finding the AoU where the random duration and cost of an activity are de-randomized as discrete values. Likewise, the problem of finding the AoU can be regarded as a generalization of DTCTP_C|T with the consideration of randomness in multiple discrete activity modes (duration, cost) at each t over the life of a project. Because DTCTP_C|T has been proven to be strongly NP-hard for general ANs (De, Dunne, Ghosh, & Wells, 1997), the calculation of the AoU must be strongly NP-hard as well when the random duration and cost of an activity are discretized. Additionally, the computational complexity is extensively discussed in deterministic project scheduling problems, but finding the AoU is a special stochastic project scheduling problem and we can adopt DTCTP_C|T to objectively illustrate the complexity of finding the AoU. Furthermore, with respect to our problems, because the distribution of an activity’s duration is continuous, the number of realized scenarios of project schedules is enormous even for a small AN. Therefore, in view of its possible use in real projects, we resort to a mixture of Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) with Gantt chart analysis to find the AoU.

To avoid obscuring the essential thesis of this paper, we begin by assuming the simplest possible forms, as doing so allows us to focus on the stochastic behavior of cumulative cost over time. Accordingly, the central theme of this paper is not clouded by complicated formulas. Later (see Section 4.1), we deviate from this simplicity and address different duration distributions of, and various time–cost functions for, activities.

Uncertainty often rises along a project’s progress because increasingly more activities come into play, and the situations studied are characterized by increased parallelism near the end of the project, in which more overlapping activities occur. Nevertheless, activity costs, which are r.v.s, are piled on top of both previously undertaken (unfinished) and currently ongoing activities. The critical question is how this accumulation proceeds. To illustrate the issue and the approach proposed for its resolution, we carried out a miniscule project of five activities, as shown in Fig. 1
                           . The durations of all activities were assumed to be uniform distributions, written as dj
                           
                           ∼
                           U[aj
                           ,
                           bj
                           ]. Additionally, the function of cost disbursement over time was assumed to be linear for all activities, namely Cj
                           (t)=
                           κj∗
                           (t
                           −
                           sj), and the marginal coefficient κj
                            of activity j (j
                           =1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) is supposed to be 1. The project in Fig. 1 is small enough to enable us to achieve certain analytical results such as the exact distribution of the realization time of node 3.

During the course of project execution, the cost accumulation at time t depends on the activities being executed (labeled “a”), but the activities in progress are not determined because of their random durations. For the AN in Fig. 1, Yi
                            denotes the realization time of event i (i
                           =2, 3 and 4). It is clear that each Yi
                            is a random variable. For time t belonging to the interval (Y
                           2,
                           Y
                           3), the cost is accumulated by one of the following six scenarios: (1) at the rate of (κ
                           2
                           +
                           κ
                           3
                           +
                           κ
                           4) if activity #2, #3 and #4 are “a”; (2) at the rate of (κ
                           2
                           +
                           κ
                           4) if activity #2 and #4 are “a” but #3 has been completed; (3) at the rate of (κ
                           3
                           +
                           κ
                           4); (4) at the rate of (κ
                           2
                           +
                           κ
                           3); (5) only at the rate of κ
                           2; and (6) only at the rate of κ
                           3. Similarly, the cost accumulations at other times are similar to t{t
                           ∈(Y
                           2,
                           Y
                           3)}. Therefore, the cost accumulation at each t is random during the life of a project. For the cumulative cost up to the current t, the number of its realized scenarios is equal to that of the realized scenarios for the project duration. The following discussion explains the approach adopted to answer the question raised and the methodology used for resolving it. First, however, we address a naive approach to expose its pitfalls.

Intuitively speaking, two extreme scenarios on cumulative cost curves can be defined as follows.

Using the Gantt chart, cost accumulations over time in the two extreme scenarios can be easily constructed and are shown in Fig. 2
                           . We label the two scenarios as ‘Optimistic Realization’ for UCopt
                           (t) and ‘Pessimistic Realization’ for UCpes
                           (t), respectively. In the same way, we also plot the middle scenario at each activity’s mean duration {(aj
                           
                           +
                           bj
                           )/2} in Fig. 2, which is marked by ‘Mean Realization’ with a project duration of 12.5 weeks and a total expense of $17.5.

Based on this analysis, one could conclude that any realization of activities, such as their average values, should result in a cost accumulation that lies between the two extreme scenarios. Thus, one might think that the two extreme scenarios define the l.b. and u.b., respectively, on the cumulative cost curves. Unfortunately, this is not true, as illustrated by the following counterexample (shown in Table 1
                           ), but note that the durations of some activities are not uniformly distributed within their limits. Similarly, Cj
                           (t)=
                           κj∗
                           (t
                           −
                           sj) and κj
                           
                           =1 (j
                           =1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are supposed.

It is easy to construct the cumulative cost curves for three scenarios: the optimistic, the pessimistic, and the average. To conserve space, the diagrams are not included in this paper; however, the results are presented in Table 2
                           :
                              
                                 (1)
                                 The average cumulative cost exceeds the pessimistic cost (the presumed u.b.) in periods 6, 7 and 8 (underlined values).

The average cumulative cost falls below the optimistic cost (the presumed l.b.) in periods 3, 4, 5 and 6 (values with a ‘†’).

The pessimistic cumulative cost (the presumed u.b.) falls below the optimistic cost (the presumed (l.b.) in periods 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (values with a ‘†’).

Therefore, the two cumulative cost curves under the optimistic and the pessimistic scenarios are not the l.b. and the u.b., respectively, the cumulative cost over time, as was heuristically reasoned. The method of obtaining the correct values is an open issue to address at another time. For now, we first analyze general properties under two extreme scenarios. The shortest duration (Tmin
                           ) and lowest cost (Cmin
                           ) to complete a project are incurred under the optimistic scenario, whereas the longest duration (Tmax

                           Tmax
                            under the pessimistic scenario is the exact u.b. on the AoU, but the cumulative cost at t
                           =
                           Tmin
                            under the optimistic scenario is not the accurate l.b.. Also, note that the pessimistic project duration does not necessarily correspond to the highest intermediate cost scenario (the l.b.) because more expensive activities may begin later in the life of a project.

With respect to the mode of payment for milestone events, the realization time of an event may be derived by some complicated convolution calculations for very small ANs. In the small project in Fig. 1, recall that Yi
                            denotes the realization time of event i (i
                           =2, 3 and 4), now Ci
                            (i
                           =2, 3 and 4) denotes the cumulative cost at time Yi
                           . All {Yi
                           } and {Ci
                           } are also r.v.s, so Y
                           3 then can be determined as follows:

Similarly, the mean and the variance of Y
                           4 can also be secured, but to do so requires more cumbersome calculations than those required for Y
                           3. The above expressions for Y
                           3 indicate that the analytic method is tedious even for very small ANs, such as the project in Fig. 1, let alone for general ANs. Unfortunately, it would be more onerous to calculate C
                           3 analytically because of a subtle point that must be taken into consideration. That is, C
                           3 consists of two parts. The first is the sum of the cost of the three finished activities #1, #2 and #3, and the second is the cost of the portion of activity #4 that has been accomplished at Y
                           3. This latter, however, may be significant and very difficult to obtain because Y
                           3 is a r.v.. Moreover, we wish to obtain the cumulative cost at each t during project execution. Therefore, to gain the l.b. and the u.b. on cumulative cost curves, we propose to use the MCS approach in which a ‘sample’ is a single realization of a project.

We randomly generated the duration of each activity according to its distribution to realize a single scenario. For each such scenario, we constructed the Gantt chart and determined, for each time point of interest to us, the subset of active activities and thus secured the cumulative cost at that time, as shown in Fig. 2. Repeated sampling provides different scenarios of project realizations that, collectively, yield the desired bounds. This approach was implemented for the project in Fig. 1, with the result plotted in Fig. 3
                           . Observe that the maximal project duration, which we know to be 17, was not realized in 1000 samples. It is probable that running enough samples will result in the realization of the maximal project duration. Furthermore, both bounds on the cumulative cost curves could be “smoothed out” to give a better picture. However, we refrained from doing so because our objectives are to emphasize their existence, to establish the methodology of securing them, and to conduct the requisite analysis of them related to the financial aspects of a project rather than its cosmetic appearance. Clearly, an alphorn shape is formed between the lower and the upper bounds of the cumulative cost curves over time, which allows for the assessment of the financial status during project implementation.

To fully comprehend the effect of uncertainty on, and the role of the AoU in, the bidding/budgeting/financial processes, the detailed discussion that follows compares a primary method based on averages, which unfortunately is commonly used, with our proposed approach based on the AoU. For the small project in Fig. 1, the total project cost at all average activity durations is $17.5 at 12.5months, as shown in Fig. 2. Assuming a markup of approximately 40%, the bid on the project would be $24.5. The two payment modes are mentioned in Section 2 and are detailed in Table 3
                         for the small project. The financial status is analyzed under the two different payment modes.

Despite the fact that both durations and costs of activities are r.v.s, most project managers are still willing to resort to ‘averages’ that in their view, move the problem from the stochastic domain to the deterministic domain, with which it is much easier to cope. We illustrate this behavior with the small project depicted in Fig. 1. The cumulative cost based on all average durations is shown in Fig. 2. The following treatment highlights the pitfalls of such an approach (Elmaghraby, 2005).

                                 Mode 1: scheduled payments

The financial status of the project is depicted in Fig. 4
                           , from which it can be observed that the project appears to enjoy excess income over expenditures for the first 2.5 months, whereas the picture is quite different from 2.5 to 12.5 months, when the project must borrow money (most of the time) to meet expenses. The cross-hatched area below the cumulative cost curve amounts to approximately 17.5 dollar-months. Assuming a commercial rate of interest equal to 8% per month, the cost of borrowing would amount to $1.56.
                              1
                              This value is evaluated using the following logic: the areas of excess receipts over expenditure (the yellow triangle) are approximately balanced by the areas of deficit between t
                                 =3 and t
                                 =5 and between t
                                 ≈5.5 and t
                                 =6. This leaves the trapezoid between t
                                 =6 and t
                                 =10 plus the triangle between t
                                 =10 and t
                                 =12.5.
                           
                           
                              1
                            This, in turn reduces the final ‘value gained’ from 24.5 to 22.94, which in turn reduces the ‘markup’ from ≈40% to ≈31% (22.94−17.5)/17.5).

                                 Mode 2: payments based on realizations of milestone events

The cumulative cost curve remains unchanged, but the payments are carried out at the realizations of nodes 3 and 4. Node 3 is realized at t
                           =7 and node 4 at t
                           =12.5. The financial status of the project is depicted in Fig. 5
                           , from which it is observed that the cost of borrowing is ≈$0.85,

                              Evaluated using the following reasoning: the excess income between t
                                 =0 and t
                                 =2.75 is approximately equal to the deficit between t
                                 =2.75 and t
                                 =5.25, and the excess income between t
                                 =7 and t
                                 =10 is approximately equal to the deficit between t
                                 =10 and t
                                 =12.5, leaving the trapezoid between t
                                 =5.25 and t
                                 =7 as the net deficit.
                           
                           
                              2
                            resulting in a net profit of ≈$23.65 or a net ‘markup’ of approximately 35%. This is still below the targeted ‘markup’ of 40% but is well above the 31% markup secured by the previous modes of payment.

No matter which payment mode is adopted, the CNV at each time is a r.v., which depends on the cumulative cost incurred at a specified time. To illustrate this concept, consider again the small project in Fig. 1 based on Payment Mode 1, and the financial status at time t
                           =7 is depicted in Fig. 6
                           . Consider that for t
                           =7, the cumulative receipts amount to only $10, but the cumulative cost (secured using MCS with a sample size of 5000) has a mean ≈11.86 and a variance ≈1.652, which implies that, with a probability≈0.95, the cumulative cost is in the interval of [8.56,15.16]. The combination of the mean and the variance also implies that the cost shall not exceed the income, with a probability given by

                           ) is approximately 87%. Furthermore, the pessimistic cumulative cost is $13 and the optimistic cumulative cost is $9 at t
                           =7, so the probability of a cumulative cost over $13 is 24.51% and the probability of a cumulative cost below $9 is 4.18%, which again shows that the two extreme scenarios are not the u.b. and the l.b. of the AoU. Moreover, the probability of a cumulative receipt of $10 over $9 (the optimistic scenario at t
                           =7) is only 8.74%, while the probability of a cumulative receipt of $10 over $13 (the pessimistic scenario t
                           =7) is zero because the probability of a cumulative cost of $13 over a cumulative receipt of $10 amounts to 62.57%. From the perspective of managers using the AoU versus the pessimistic/optimistic scenarios, there is no reason to panic when the cumulative cost exceeds the value under the pessimistic scenario at a time t because it does not mean that cumulative cost will exceed the upper bounds at time t. Likewise, project managers cannot be excessively optimistic when the cumulative cost is less than that under the optimistic scenario at time t.

@&#EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS@&#

The small network in Fig. 1 was adopted to introduce the basic concept of the AoU, and we propose to use it as a tool for financial assessment over the duration of a project. To validate the AoU with respect to the financial management of projects, a full numerical study is performed on a set of more general instances that were randomly generated by ProGen in PSPLIB (Kolish & Sprecher, 1997). Different duration distributions and various functions of cost disbursement among activities are introduced, and parameter settings are summarized in Table 4
                         to generate the data set of instances. For each instance with the given number of non-dummy activities, sixteen combinations

                         of duration distributions and cost functions of activities can be propagated, which are calculated based on the last row in Table 4. Thus, the data set consists of 2400 (4×3×20×16=3840) instances of ANs.

The existing literature has adopted several types of probability distributions to model random activity durations, including beta, uniform, triangle and exponential distributions, and so on. The results obtained by previous researchers can provide theoretical references for choosing distribution forms, but our focus in this paper is the utility of the AoU to a project’s financial status. Therefore, simplicity and diversity are considered when we choose distribution forms for activity durations. Furthermore, for project management in reality, activity durations are usually greater than 0 and fall into a certain range denoted as [a,
                        b], similar to the optimistic and the pessimistic estimations in PERT. Consequently, three distributions with finite support [a,
                        b] were chosen for activity durations and are presented in Table 5
                        .

We argue that k
                        1
                        >
                        k
                        2 for the right-skewed beta distribution because of human indolent behaviors (Tukel, Rom, & Eksioglu, 2006). The parameters of the three distributions of activity durations are set forth in the right column of Table 5. Note that the duration limits [aj
                        ,
                        bj
                        ] of an activity j (j
                        =1,2,…,
                        J) are the same under any of the three distributions for a specific instance.

The total cost to complete an activity is gradually disbursed over its progress in the form of a simple linear, or a more complex convex/concave, or a stepped linear (or nonlinear) function, and so forth. Moreover, the method of cost disbursement varies among activities because executing different activities requires different resources that behave differently when their utilization is stretched or shortened. The exact functional relationship between the disbursed cost of an activity and time should be evaluated empirically on the basis of real data. However, this is not our immediate concern, and the model that we propose is applicable to all forms of time–cost relationships except that it has an additional (and often considerable) computing burden. Therefore, we suppose that there are multiple forms of time–cost functions among activities. In particular, we address the impact of uneven disbursements on the cumulative cost. Note that for any activity, regardless of which cost function is used, the total cost to complete it is the same only if its duration is determined in one sample. Three forms of functions of cost disbursement are selected among all activities for an instance and are as follows:
                           
                              The linear: c
                                 =
                                 ht.

The quadratic convex: c
                                 =
                                 h
                                 1

                                 t.

The quadratic concave: c

For activity j, it is assumed that hj
                         denotes the linear cost coefficient, and that h
                        1
                        
                           j

                        2
                        
                           j
                         represent coefficients for quadratic convex functions. Likewise, h
                        3
                        
                           j

                           j
                         are coefficients for quadratic concave functions. Firstly, hj
                         is a randomly generated integer from the interval [1,5]. Then according to linear cost, three data points are chosen to fit the other four coefficients (h

To analyze the effect of duration distributions on financial status, either only one or three distributions in a sample are adopted to generate activity durations, as the four subcases (i, ii, iii and iv) are shown in the left column of the fifth row in Table 4. Similarly, either only one or three functions in one sample are used to observe the impact of the form of cost disbursements on financial status, as the four subcases (
                           
                              ①
                           
                        , 
                           
                              ②
                           
                        , 
                           
                              ③
                           
                         and 
                           
                              ④
                           
                        ) are also given in the right column of the fifth row in Table 4. Either three duration distributions of, or three cost functions for, activities in an AN are included in almost equal proportions.

For each instance in the data set, the project cost is equal to Cavg
                         at each activity’s mean duration, with a completion time of Tavg
                        . Based on this information, we allow a markup rate m so that a contract’s quoted price (QP), negotiated between an owner and a contractor, is QP
                        =
                        Cavg
                        (1+
                        m). The larger for the size of an AN, the higher the risk to contractors, so we set m as 0.3, 0.35, 0.4 and 0.45 for J
                        =20, 30, 40 and 50, respectively.

The two modes of payments, which are the scheduled payments (Mode 1) and the realizations of milestone events (Mode 2), are adopted in Section 3.3.1. However, except for the beginning and the end of a project, the diversified features of milestone events for different ANs cannot be generalized, and thus, the differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 consist of slightly different time points for obtaining payments. Therefore, we selected Mode 1 to execute a full numerical experiment assessing financial status during the execution of a project.

Usually, because the frequency of payments can greatly impact financial status over the duration of a project, we consider four scenarios with different numbers of payments (denoted by np
                        ) during project execution. The amount of and time for each payment under different np
                         are summarized in rows 2 through 5 of Table 7
                        . Although each np
                         is different, the amount of the first payment is always 20% of the QP at a project initiation; the remaining 5% of the QP need not be considered because it is paid pending satisfaction with the project’s performance over a specified period of time. Based on a preset payment rule (including the np
                        , the amount of and time for each payment) in Table 7, we find that the cumulative amounts of payments from clients are less before the halfway point of a project, so financial status may be challenging in a project’s early stages. Therefore, five time points, which are listed in the last row of Table 7, were selected to appraise financial status over the duration of a project. The details of the four payment rules and the five assessing time points are summarized in Table 7.

@&#EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS@&#

If we let Pt
                         denote the probability of cumulative payments exceeding cumulative cost at time t, then the financial status at t is assessed by Pt
                        . We adopted the average Pt
                         among specific instances from the data set to evaluate the financial status at the five assessing time points.

In reality, project managers may exhibit different attitudes towards the same financial risk at time t, so we also distinguish three levels of financial status-related risk: the first is optimistic if Pt
                         is greater than or equal to 90%, the second is moderate if 50%
                        
                           
                              ⩽
                           
                        
                        
                        Pt
                        
                        <90%, and the third is pessimistic when Pt
                        
                        <50%. We determined the percentage of the financial status at different levels at each assessing time point. Accordingly, the following three indices are defined to evaluate the level of financial status among specific instances from the data set.
                           
                              
                                 Op: the percentage of optimistic financial-status levels among specific instances.


                                 Pe: the percentage of pessimistic financial-status levels among specific instances.


                                 Mo: the percentage of moderate financial-status levels among specific instances, and Mo
                                 =1−
                                 Op

                                 Pe.

To more objectively correct the naive approach in Section 3.2.2, we also extract the data about this argument from the full numerical experiment. In reality, the u.b. of the cumulative cost curves usually receives more attention during project execution, and thus, the pessimistic cumulative cost for each instance is recorded at the time of the third payment when np
                        
                        =5. A ratio is adopted to express the deviation between the pessimistic cumulative cost and the u.b. of the AoU at time t, which is given as follows:

The AoU of each instance in the data set was obtained by mixing the Monte Carlo sampling with the Gantt chart analysis. Usually, the larger the number of activities in an AN, the more the realized scenarios of the project, which suggests that the sample size (denoted by S) of MCS should be greater. After conducting a large number of pilot experiments, we found that there is a slightly positive correlation between sample size and the accuracy of the AoU when S is greater than 5000 for J
                        =20. Thus, the initial sample size (S
                        0
                        =5000) was set, and the precision of the AoU is tracked in time interval [0,
                        Tavg
                        ]. The S over S
                        0 was increased at the rate of 200 samples, and the u.b. and the l.b. during the interval [0,
                        Tavg
                        ] were checked and updated. If the u.b. and the l.b. in [0,
                        Tavg
                        ] could not be improved, the MCS was stopped. Our simulation program was coded and compiled using Matlab2009. The experiments were then performed on a Pentium-based personal computer with 2.67Gigahertz clock-pulse and 4.0G RAM.

The results of the financial status based on the data set are presented in Tables 8–11
                        
                        
                        
                        , and the indices in the tables are given in the form of a percentage. The numbers in the first column of Table 11 correspond to eight subcases listed in Table 4. The outcomes of Dev(t) from the numerical study are statistically calculated in Table 12
                        .

The meanings of some interesting phenomena can be evidenced from the results presented in the above tables.
                           
                              (1)
                              For ANs with different sizes in Table 8, though a slight difference in financial status arises at a specific Ati
                                  (i
                                 =1, 2, 3, 4, 5), we note that financial status is slightly improved with the increase of network size. Additionally, it is observed that the financial status at Ati
                                  (i
                                 =2, 3, 4 and 5) also improves slightly as network complexity grows, as shown in Table 9. These conclusions partly result from the fact that, in general, the durations of large, complex projects may be longer than those of smaller projects, and thus the cumulative cost climbs more steadily along a project progresses, so the financial status during the project’s execution is better under a fixed payment rule. However, there are no obvious correlations between financial status and the size or the complexity of an AN over a project’s duration.


                                 Table 10 indicates that financial status over the duration of a project largely depends on the number of payments, and we intuitively know that larger number of payments results in better financial status. When np
                                 
                                 =2, the cumulative amount of payments remains at 20% of the QP before the completion of a project, and accordingly, the Avg. of the Pt
                                  changes from Op at At

                                 2, and becomes zero at At
                                 4 and at At
                                 5. When np
                                 
                                 =3, the Avg. changes to Op at At
                                 4 and Me at At
                                 5, respectively. Similarly, compared to np
                                 
                                 =2, the financial status is greatly improved at Ati
                                  (i
                                 =2, 3, 4 and 5) when np
                                 
                                 =5. On the other hand, the financial status at At
                                 1 is the same when np
                                 
                                 =2, 3, 4 and 5; and also is the same at At
                                 2 when np
                                 
                                 =2, 3 and 4, while the financial status at At
                                 3 is the same under np
                                 
                                 =2 and 3. The reasons for these outputs are found in Table 7. At At
                                 1, the cumulative remuneration is always 20% of the QP regardless of np
                                 . At At
                                 2, the cumulative remuneration remains at 20% of the QP under np
                                 
                                 =2, 3 and 4. At At
                                 3, no additional payments except 20% of the QP can be obtained from a client under np
                                 
                                 =2 and 3. Therefore, the payment rule negotiated between contractors and their clients, which includes the np
                                 , the time and the amount of each payment, has a substantial impact on financial status while a project is in progress; moreover, the earlier a contractor can gain income, the better its financial status.

We observe that financial status is not sensitive to the choice of duration distributions or the form of cost functions among activities, as is shown in Table 11. This result is surprising, and indeed, it differs from a deterministic environment. There are two possible reasons for this outcome. First, the duration limits [aj
                                 ,
                                 bj
                                 ] of an activity j are fixed no matter which distribution is adopted and the AoU for each instance is obtained by an adequate sample size. Therefore, the effect of duration distributions on financial status is not obvious. Second, the total cost to complete an activity j is kj∗dj
                                  only if dj
                                  is determined in a sample and kj
                                  is fixed for a specific instance. Then, the cumulative cost at any time t consists of two parts, as is shown in expression (1). Obviously, if an activity has been completed, the form of its cost function has no impact on cumulative cost at time t. Moreover, when the end of a project is near, the proportion of the cost sum of completed activities to the cumulative cost is greater at time t. For those activities being executed, the disbursed cost of their accomplished parts depends not only on time t but also on their total cost, furthermore, the total cost of an activity relies on its random duration, so the effect of cost functions on financial status is weakened. This result also stems from the fact that the stochastic duration leads to the random total cost of an activity. However, under the two uneven cost functions (
                                    
                                       ②
                                    
                                  and 
                                    
                                       ③
                                    
                                  in Table 4), the financial status deviates more from the general subcase (
                                    
                                       ④
                                    
                                  in Table 4) than it does under the linear function (
                                    
                                       ①
                                    
                                  in Table 4). Nonetheless, there remains a little difference in financial status under the four subcases of the cost functions. The financial status under the two uneven subcases mildly fluctuates from the general subcase, so it may incur slightly more financial risks compared to other subcases of cost functions.

From Table 12, we observe that the largest mean deviation amounts to 30.77% under J
                                 =50, and the maximal deviation is 71.46% under J
                                 =20. These results can demonstrate that, on average, using the pessimistic case as an approximation of the maximum cost is grossly inaccurate.

Often, contractors may have information about duration distributions and methods of cost disbursements for activities, and in those cases the AoU of cumulative cost curves is tracked as it evolves with the progress of a project. Combining with our theoretical and experimental analyses, we conclude some managerial implications for project managers and contractors, which are set forth as follows:
                           
                              (1)
                              The AoU defines the specific range for cumulative cost curves over a project’s progress, which replaces only deterministic one curve under certain conditions. Thus, the AoU constitutes a 100% confidence interval for the BCWS (budget cost for work scheduled) in an uncertain EVM, namely

                                  at time t. This means that project managers can integrate financial status assessments with the EVM to accurately judge the state of progress in uncertain environments; however, this greatly differs in certain cases. In reality, project managers usually focus on the u.b.. For instance, when examining t, the positive financial status is incurred because of a serious delay. Thus, project managers must impose progress. On the contrary, advanced execution may result in a negative financial report at a specific point in time, indicating that no modifications are needed. Moreover, different managers may display different tolerances for the same risk level, and accordingly, they can decide whether to correct a project’s progress. When the progress of a project slows down in a time interval, managers with high risk preferences might think that no measures are needed to accelerate progress because they can judge the current status to be transient and anticipate a quick return to normal progress, whereas others with low risk tolerances might feel nervous about their status and immediately implement actions to accelerate the project. Therefore, the AoU can provide the flexibility in making decisions when project managers use the EVM to monitor a project’s progress under uncertainty conditions.

Before signing payment contracts, managers can discover information about the general financial status over the life cycle of a project based on its AoU and the various payment rules. It is possible that contractors under some payment rules may suffer from a worse financial status, whereas they may enjoy better financial status throughout most of a project under other rules. Therefore, an assessment of financial status based on the AoU can provide important information for contractors when they negotiate with their clients to settle on a payment rule. To arrive at a more favorable financial status over the lifespan of a project, a contractor should, to the greatest possible extent, select the best payment rule. Furthermore, if project managers have knowledge of the AoU, they may modify the project progress to avoid high financial risks at certain time points.

Therefore, the AoU may be considered a promising method of financial management for projects under uncertainty.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Both the duration and the cost of an activity are modeled as r.v.s, and the cost incurred to complete it depends on its random duration. Accordingly, we first present the concept of the AoU to describe the variation domain of the cumulative cost over the life of a project. We then apply the AoU to assess the financial status along a project progresses under two payment modes. Furthermore, we designed and conducted a full numerical experiment to validate the AoU. Finally, we conclude that the AoU may be a promising method of financial management for projects under uncertainty, and that financial risk levels over a project’s lifespan can be gained based on the AoU. Moreover, financial status is not sensitive to the choice of duration distributions or to the form of cost functions for activities under uncertain conditions, but payment rules can greatly affect financial status over the duration of a project.

Our study leaves several issues unaddressed, two of which we consider to be interesting extensions. Perhaps it is most important to decide what to do if the AoU indicates an unacceptable project cost at future moments in time. This question calls for the study of optimal project compression in a stochastic environment. Additionally, we determine the AoU using a numerical calculating method for the reason of practicality, but we must emphasize that an exact algorithm, rather than the analytical method, may exist because distributions of stochastic activity durations are known. Therefore, exploring an exact efficient procedure to find the AoU is a challenging open question.
