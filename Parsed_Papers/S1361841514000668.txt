                  The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) signal can be made sensitive to functional parameters that provide information about tissues. In dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI these functional parameters are related to the microvasculature environment and the concentration changes that occur rapidly after the injection of a contrast agent. Typically DCE images are reconstructed individually and kinetic parameters are estimated by fitting a pharmacokinetic model to the time-enhancement response; these methods can be denoted as “indirect”. If undersampling is present to accelerate the acquisition, techniques such as kt-FOCUSS can be employed in the reconstruction step to avoid image degradation. This paper suggests a Bayesian inference framework to estimate functional parameters directly from the measurements at high temporal resolution. The current implementation estimates pharmacokinetic parameters (related to the extended Tofts model) from undersampled (k, t)-space DCE MRI. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a simulated abdominal DCE phantom and prostate DCE data, for fully sampled, 4 and 8-fold undersampled (k, t)-space data. Direct kinetic parameters demonstrate better correspondence (up to 70% higher mutual information) to the ground truth kinetic parameters (of the simulated abdominal DCE phantom) than the ones derived from the indirect methods. For the prostate DCE data, direct kinetic parameters depict the morphology of the tumour better. To examine the impact on cancer diagnosis, a peripheral zone prostate cancer diagnostic model was employed to calculate a probability map for each method.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a common imaging biomarker of vasculature and perfusion. DCE-MRI is mainly used for the diagnosis of cancer in different anatomical regions such as the prostate (Buckley et al., 2004), the head and neck (Agrawal et al., 2012), the breast (Furman-Haran et al., 2013), the cervix (Andersen et al., 2013), the brain (Jain, 2013) and the liver (Armbruster et al., 2014).

Briefly, in DCE-MRI a paramagnetic contrast agent (Gadolinium) is administered via intravenous injection, resulting in shortening of the T1 relaxation time from its native value T10.

                     0(r) is the proton density image, TR is the repetition time and α is the flip angle.

Some of the important microvascular exchanges occur rapidly hence high temporal resolution is necessary to capture the enhancement process especially immediately after the contrast agent is injected. The temporal resolution of the acquisition can be improved using undersampling techniques in (k, t)-space.

Parallel imaging techniques can increase the temporal resolution by reducing the number of phase encoding steps and using knowledge of coil sensitivities in the reconstruction (Pruessmann et al., 1999; Griswold et al., 2002).

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging theory from signal processing (Donoho, 2006) that can recover images using a non-linear reconstruction from undersampled data by promoting sparsity in an image transform domain. In MRI, the artifacts due to undersampling of the k-space data must be incoherent in the image transform domain. Several CS techniques have been proposed for reconstruction of dynamic MR data, a popular scheme is kt-SPARSE (Lustig et al., 2007), which minimizes an l

                      is an operator that in DCE MRI reconstruction would transform the modelled signal z(r, t) to a sparse representation (i.e. a wavelet transform in the spatial direction and a Fourier transformation in the temporal direction) and ε is a small number usually set at the noise level. Another popular sparse reconstruction algorithm is focal underdetermined system solver (kt-FOCUSS) based on work of Gorodnitsky et al. (1995) and modified by Jung et al. (2007) to become suitable for dynamic MRI applications. A more detailed description of the kt-FOCUSS algorithm follows in the theory section. Dynamic reconstruction can also involve low rank matrix completion techniques which are usually combined with sparsity (Gao et al., 2011; Lingala et al., 2011). A popular rank minimization technique is the kt-SLR algorithm proposed by (Lingala et al., 2011) which minimizes a cost function that involves a rank prior Ψ
                     1(z), and a sparsity prior Ψ
                     2(z).

Traditional DCE analysis fits the pharmacokinetic parameters w(r) related to the extended Tofts model so that the modelled enhancement signal x(r, t; w) is close to the reconstructed dynamic MR data z(r, t).

In this work we suggest a direct estimation of the kinetic parameters from undersampled dynamic (k, t)-space data with a Bayesian inference algorithm. An overview of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 1
                     .

The suggested scheme is evaluated on a simulated DCE MRI abdominal phantom, and on simulated prostate DCE MRI measurements for undersampling acceleration factors of 4 and 8. The performance of the suggested scheme is compared against indirect approaches where dynamic contrast enhanced MR data were reconstructed using zero-filled fast Fourier transformation or kt-FOCUSS and kinetic parameters w(r) were fit to these reconstructed images using the extended Tofts model.

kt-FOCUSS is computationally efficient and was shown to recover accurate solutions even for highly undersampled (k, t)-space data. kt-FOCUSS uses a “soft ” sparse constraint suitable for dynamic MR reconstruction, and is implemented as a re-weighted quadratic optimization (Jung et al., 2007). kt-FOCUSS minimizes an unconstrained cost function, which aims to recover the space by frequency r–f image ρ

                        where λ is the Lagrangian multiplier, F is the 2D Fourier transform along the r–f direction, H is a weighting matrix and q is the solution of the minimization. In other words, q is minimizing the quadratic optimization and H is re-weighting q. The r–f image ρ is initialized from interleaved low-frequency (k, t)-data. The resulting low resolution image is used to initialize the weighting matrix H and this solution is pruned to achieve a sparser image. The image is transformed to the r–f space because it is sparser in that domain, especially if the signal follows a periodic motion. This process is repeated iteratively (Jung et al., 2007).

The enhancement signal is formulated as a Casorati matrix, which is likely to be low rank because there is an expected correlation between images (columns of the Casorati matrix). This prior is incorporated to ensure that the algorithm can handle undersampled data. If the algorithm was solely a nuclear norm minimization, then the noise of the acquired data would not be modelled and it could not benefit from the convergence properties of the Bayesian inference algorithm used here (Gelman and Shirley, 2011).

Although the selection of proposal density is not trivial and can affect convergence (Rosenthal, 2010), normal proposal distributions usually work well in practice and this is why they were chosen in this scheme.

The prior probability distribution p(w) depends on hyper-parameters {σ

                           Ktrans, σ
                           ve, σ
                           t0} that are tuned automatically. For each hyper-parameter an acceptance probability is defined as the percentage of the times the respective candidate sample parameters (one of vp
                           (r), K
                           trans(r), ve
                           (r), t
                           0(r)) has been accepted. If the acceptance probability falls within a certain range [0.3, 0.6] the hyper-parameters are kept the same, otherwise they are modified (scaled).

It is assumed that Markov chain reaches the target distribution after a number of iterations (denoted as burn-in iteration); hence the variables from the early iterations are thrown away. To reduce sample correlations, thinning was used and only every thinth draw (thinning iteration) from the Markov chain was kept. If for example the thinning variable is equal to 5, only the samples from the mod(i, 5) equal to zero iteration will be kept.

The techniques described were implemented in MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA).

The proposed Bayesian inference algorithm was implemented as a Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. Section 2.2.2 describes how the involved parameters were initialized. The total number of iterations was 500, burn-in iterations were 300, thinning equal to 5, and tune iteration (number of iterations for tuning) was 67.

This approach was compared against techniques that fit the modelled enhancement signal to the reconstructed dynamic enhancement images and are denoted as “indirect”. For the indirect techniques, DCE images were reconstructed with either fast Fourier transformation after zero-filling (denoted as “Indirect(ZF-FFT)”), or kt-FOCUSS (denoted as “Indirect(ktFOCUSS)”). The parameter settings for kt-FOCUSS (Jung et al., 2007) were 40 inner iterations, 2 outer iterations, weighting matrix power factor 0.5, and initial estimate corresponding to low-frequency values.

The fitting algorithm minimizes the l
                        1-norm (Press et al., 1984) between the reconstructed measured data and the modelled enhancement signal with a simplex algorithm (fminsearch in MATLAB). To avoid local minima, the onset time t
                        0 was randomly initialized 20 times and the pharmacokinetic parameters that best fit the data were reported.

A normal volunteer underwent a fast gradient echo DCE-MRI protocol (flip angle 10°, repetition time 2.3ms). Informed consent and ethical approval was obtained.


                        T1-weighted abdominal images were acquired in multiple time frames without contrast injection. The first time-frame was manually segmented into: liver, bowel, right and left heart, aorta, portal vein. Such segmentation was used as a map to simulate contrast enhancement using the extended Tofts model and a population arterial input function (Parker et al., 2006). T1 values were taken from (Tofts, 2010) and pharmacokinetic parameters for each organ were chosen in agreement with a previous study (Melbourne et al., 2008). Fifty DCE images were generated from the ground truth kinetic parameters with temporal resolution 3 s; and were transformed to (k, t)-space with fast Fourier transformation. The noise of complex valued (k, t)-space MR data can be reasonably modelled by an additive white Gaussian distribution on both real and imaginary components (with i.i.d. random variables) (Gudbjartsson and Patz, 2005). The level of noise was adjusted to achieve a signal to noise ratio (SNR) similar to the one reported in liver studies in the literature (Banerji et al., 2012). In practice the SNR is not known and here the SNR of the abdominal images was determined using a noise estimation algorithm (Coupe et al., 2010; Dikaios et al., 2013a). One of the advantages of modelling noise in the acquired (k, t)-space domain is that it does not suffer from spatial variations that are caused by image reconstruction.

For the undersampling pattern, phase encoding lines were randomly selected per volume and per time frame from a distribution where the centre of k-space was more densely sampled. Undersampling patterns for 4 and 8-fold acceleration were generated using a Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate a sampling pattern with minimum peak interference (Lustig et al., 2007).

The local institutional review board approved the study and waived the requirement for individual consent for the retrospective analysis of patient data collected as part of clinical trials/routine care (R&D No: 12/0195 date: 16/7/2012).

A prostate patient with significant peripheral zone prostate cancer (definition for clinically significant cancer was ⩾Gleason 3+4 or ⩾4mm cancer core length) underwent prostatic multi-parametric MRI (T2, DCE and diffusion weighted MRI; Fig. 2
                        ) prior to template-prostate-mapping (TPM) biopsies as part of standard of care.

Imaging used a 1.5T static magnet (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and pelvic phased array coil. 0.2mg/kg (maximum 20mg) of spasmolytic (Bucsopan; Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) was administered intravenously to reduce peristalsis. DCE-MRI was performed with a T1 weighted volumetric FLASH sequence with TR/TE 5.61/2.5ms, flip angle 15°, field of view 269mm, slice thickness 3mm, temporal resolution of 16 s, and number of time points 35.

The original DCE images were then projected to (k, t)-space with fast Fourier transformation where normally distributed noise was added; undersampling masks for 4 and 8-fold acceleration were generated as described in Section 3.2. Noise was added directly to (k, t)-space MR data. Note that noise in the original magnitude MR images is considered as signal when used in simulations. Similar to the abdominal data, the level of applied noise was adjusted to match the noise level of prostate images.

The proposed direct method was compared with the Indirect(ZF-FFT) and the Indirect(ktFOCUSS) methods. All comparisons were conducted for fully sampled (FS), 4 and 8-fold undersampled (US4 and US8 respectively) (k, t)-data.

For the abdominal DCE phantom the kinetic maps from the different methods were compared using an entropy similarity metric (mutual information) to assess which method matches the ground truth kinetic parameters best. Similarly we examined which DCE images (reconstructed with ZF-FFT, kt-FOCUSS or estimated from the parameters w for the direct method) best matched the DCE images generated from the ground truth kinetic parameters.

For the prostate data where no ground truth kinetic maps were available, an experienced radiologist assessed the derived kinetic maps to examine which method depicts cancer best.

Figs. 4 and 5 show kinetic parameters of the Indirect(ZF-FFT), Indirect(ktFOCUSS) and the direct method derived from 4 and 8-fold undersampled data. Figs. 3–5 illustrate better correspondence of the direct kinetic parameters with the ground truth kinetic parameters than the other two methods. This was verified quantitatively as shown in Table 1
                        . Direct kinetic parameters yield consistently higher mutual information (similarity with the ground truth kinetic parameters) than the Indirect(ZF-FFT) or Indirect(ktFOCUSS) kinetic parameters.

                         shows that direct method provided a better match (higher mutual information) to the ground truth DCE images than kt-FOCUSS reconstructed DCE images.

To illustrate how the current algorithm (and the Indirect(ktFOCUSS) approach) would be affected by respiratory motion, we regenerated the abdominal DCE phantom including motion derived from non-rigid registration (Rueckert et al., 1999) of the free breathing T1 weighted time series. The range of motion was [2.87 2.63] pixels×1.95mm in the right–left and [8.35 1.81] pixels×1.95mm in the superior inferior directions. Since an image registration step could be easily incorporated prior to DCE analysis, DCE images reconstructed with kt-FOCUSS were registered using RDDR algorithm (Hamy et al., 2014) which was developed specifically for DCE registration. Fig. 7
                            illustrates the kinetic maps of the direct and the Indirect(ktFOCUSS) method with and without the registration step for 8-fold undersampling. All the kinetic maps have degraded due to motion (compare to Figs. 3 and 5) but direct kinetic maps exhibit some resilience to motion.

Kinetic maps of K
                        trans are illustrated in Fig. 8
                        , where the Indirect(ZF-FFT), Indirect(ktFOCUSS) and the direct methods are compared for fully sampled, 4 and 8-fold undersampled (k, t)-space data. Dikaios et al. (2013b) showed that K
                        trans is better at classifying peripheral zone prostate cancer compared to vp
                         and ve
                        ; hence this was selected for illustration. Kinetic maps from the direct reconstruction depict the peripheral zone prostate cancer better than the Indirect(ZF-FFT) and Indirect(ktFOCUSS) methods.

DCE images calculated from the direct kinetic parameters were compared with DCE images reconstructed with ZF-FFT and kt-FOCUSS (Fig. 9
                        ). Direct DCE images have good contrast between different features, and resemble the original DCE image shown in Fig. 2(d) even for high undersampling factors. Although not easily visible direct DCE images in Fig. 9 are contaminated by high frequency noise.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

Functional parameters related to the pathophysiology (e.g. perfusion, vessel permeability, metabolism) or the tissue (e.g. diffusion, T1 and T2 relaxation times) are classifiers of diseases. Parametric maps are usually estimated indirectly via images.

In this work we derived the parametric maps directly from the measurements (i.e. from (k, t)-space for DCE MRI). Direct parametric reconstruction has been applied in dynamic PET (Tsoumpas et al., 2008) and demonstrated better recovery of the associated parameters.

A Bayesian inference algorithm is suggested to perform direct parametric reconstruction from highly undersampled DCE-MRI measurements. The proposed algorithm (denoted as direct) is based on a complete noise model of the measured data, and employs a low-rank prior to ensure local coherence in time.

Direct kinetic maps of the abdominal DCE phantom accurately recovered the ground truth kinetic parameters even for highly undersampled (k, t)-space data (up to 8-fold), outperforming indirect schemes (using ZF-FFT and kt-FOCUSS reconstruction). Abdominal DCE images estimated from direct kinetic maps were also more accurate than abdominal DCE images reconstructed with ZF-FFT or kt-FOCUSS. The bias of the direct method varies across different organs (Fig. 3), this is clearly visible in areas with different kinetics (i.e. heart, aorta) where the bias is approximately 10 times higher than the rest of the organs. This has also been observed in PET direct reconstruction (Tsoumpas et al., 2008; Rahmim et al., 2012), where the strong correlation between the two temporal basis functions of the Patlak plot slows down the convergence. To overcome this problem, PET direct algorithms that decouple this temporal correlation were suggested (Rahmim et al., 2012), similar ideas could be investigated for the proposed direct algorithm.

Direct kinetic maps of the prostate (i.e. K
                        trans) depict peripheral zone cancer better than indirect schemes with a clearer benefit at higher undersampling factors. The differences between the direct and the indirect schemes can be identified as follows:
                           
                              i.
                              Indirect schemes (using either FFT or ktFOCUSS reconstruction) employ non-linear fitting (i.e. simplex algorithm) to derive the kinetic maps. Non-linear fitting is prone to hit local minima in the presence of noise (and aliasing artefacts related to undersampling).

The direct method allows for a complete modelling of the noise (of the acquired data) in the parameter estimation process.

The direct method has been implemented in a Bayesian inference framework (using MCMC), which has a theoretic guarantee to converge if run long enough (Gelman and Shirley, 2011).

One of the limitations of the suggested direct algorithm is that it does not explicitly account for patient motion, and may thus be more suitable for organs such as the prostate, where motion is of low magnitude. Results (Fig. 7) indicate that whilst indirect methods can incorporate a registration step, the direct approach has an inherent robustness to motion.

If the motion field during the acquisition is known, it could be easily incorporated into the direct method by modelling the enhancement signal accordingly

                         is a motion matrix that warps the pixels from motion state s (reference image) to the motion state at time t.

Rigid motion can be estimated with optical tracking devices but estimating non-rigid motion in advance is less trivial. There is ongoing work using motion models (e.g. King et al., 2012) that could be applicable in DCE imaging. Alternatively, motion fields could be estimated in a joint reconstruction scheme during the minimization process, where besides the kinetic parameters, the motion field will also be updated (Jacobson and Fessler, 2003; Odille et al., 2008) where he proposed a joint reconstruction scheme for motion correction in PET.

The current implementation assumes that the pharmacokinetics are described by the extended Tofts model. The forward signal model in the direct approach should reflect signal changes throughout the entire field of view and the Tofts model with a single bolus input may not be adequate in the liver, where a dual input signal compartment model is preferred (Materne et al., 2000). The effect of having organs with enhancement that is not adequately described by the kinetic model used has been discussed by Kotasidis et al. (2011). To apply the direct approach on clinical abdominal DCE MRI, the algorithm could be modified to identify organs where the Tofts model is inadequate and apply the correct pharmacokinetic model. Indirect approaches process image pixels independently and an incorrect model would affect only the image regions where the model is not applicable.

The direct method is more computationally expensive than the indirect methods (depending on the number of iterations). For the current settings it can be up to 7 times slower. The computational cost of the direct method will depend of course on the number of tuning iterations, but with the aforementioned settings (using Matlab 7.12.0 on a Xeon 1.6GHz with 12GB RAM) results were achieved in approximately 17h.

Pharmacokinetic parameters related to the enhancement have been advocated as a biomarker of cancer. For prostate cancer localization DCE-MRI remains the mainstay of commercial computer aided diagnostic software (Engelbrecht et al., 2003, Puech et al., 2004). Dikaios et al. (2013a,b) proposed the following logistic regression diagnostic model for peripheral zone prostate cancer based on an early enhancement image (E
                        early) and a K
                        trans map that predicts cancer with a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.754 (following leave-one-out analysis)

                         illustrates predictive probability maps calculated from an E
                        early image and a K
                        trans map derived from the direct and indirect methods. An experienced radiologist reviewed the probability maps (after reviewing the multiparametric MRI images (i.e. T2 weighted, apparent diffusion coefficient, b
                        =1400s/mm2 diffusion weighted, and an early enhancement image)). The probabilities within the tumour for the direct parameters are higher than the ones for indirect methods. In addition the morphology of the tumour is retained within the probability map of the direct kinetic parameters, even for 8-fold undersampling of the (k, t)-space data.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The concept of direct parametric reconstruction from (k, t)-space data is a promising challenge as it extracts the functional information which dictates the signal alterations directly from the measurements. This paper provides a Bayesian inference framework to accurately estimate pharmacokinetic parameters from undersampled (k, t)-space data. Results on a simulated abdominal DCE phantom and prostate data indicate that the proposed scheme recovers accurate parametric kinetic maps, and in an example prostate cancer case, represents better the tumour morphology, even for highly undersampled measurements.
