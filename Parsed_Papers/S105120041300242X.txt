                  Fitting a pair of coupled geometric objects to a number of coordinate points is a challenging and important problem in many applications including coordinate metrology, petroleum engineering and image processing. This paper derives two asymptotically efficient estimators, one for concentric circles fitting and the other for concentric ellipses fitting, based on the weighted equation error formulation and non-linear parameter transformation. The Kanatani–Cramér–Rao (KCR) lower bounds for the parameter estimates of the concentric circles and concentric ellipses under zero-mean Gaussian noise are provided to serve as the performance benchmark. Small-noise analysis shows that the proposed estimators reach the KCR lower bound performance asymptotically. The accuracy of the proposed estimators is corroborated by experiments with synthetic data and realistic images.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The fitting of a geometric object to a set of noisy data points has been a fundamental and important problem that has applications in many areas including coordinate metrology [1], aquifer characterization and petroleum engineering [2], computer graphics [3] and object classifications [4,5]. Recently, it has attracted research interests for biometric matching [6] and robotic applications [7].

Among different geometric shapes for data fitting, circle and ellipse are most popular. Circle and ellipse fittings are challenging non-linear estimation problems. Many methods for circle fitting have been proposed over the years [8–16]. The Kåsa method [8,9], which has a closed-form solution and is simple to apply, appears to be the most widely used in practice. It is able to reach the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) [14] accuracy when the noise components in x and y coordinates are independent and have equal variances (isotropic observation noise) [15]. The ellipse fitting problem is more difficult than the circle fitting and conic formulation is often used. A few closed-form solutions are presented in [17,18] and [19]. Iterative solutions include the Fundamental Numerical Scheme (FNS) [20], the Heteroscedastic Errors-In-Variables (HEIV) method [21,22] and the renormalization method [23]. These iterative methods have better performance than the closed-form solutions and they have been proven analytically to reach the Kanatani–Cramér–Rao (KCR) lower bound [24] accuracy.

All of the above circle and ellipse fitting solutions as well as the KCR lower bound are designed for a single circle or ellipse. Not many studies in the literature are available for the fitting of coupled geometric objects, such as concentric circles and concentric ellipses. Many objects encountered in practice are circularly concentric. A simple example is the inner and outer boundaries of a pipe. Another example is the inner and outer edges of an iris image. When viewing from different angles, concentric circles would become concentric ellipses. The concentric circles and concentric ellipses fitting methods proposed here have potential use in automatic inspection for pipes, iris recognition for biometric applications, calibration for cameras and ellipticity estimation of steel coils. Kim et al. [25] solved the camera calibration problem by determining the position of a projected circle center through concentric circles formulation. Motivated by determining the original size of the ruined Abhayagiriya stupa, Dampegama [26] provided a specific solution to this problem using concentric circles estimation. [27–29] presented more general solutions to the concentric circles/ellipses estimation problems. Benko et al. [27] considered simultaneous fitting of multiple curves and surfaces for reverse engineering using an iterative method that requires good initial guesses. The work by Marot and Bourennane [28], although it is extendable to concentric circles fitting, focused on the radius estimation only. OʼLeary et al. [29] proposed a quadratically constrained total least-squares method for the fitting of coupled geometric objects in metric vision. This method yielded closed-form solution under isotropic noise but no KCR lower bound performance evaluation was given.

In this paper we develop new solutions for the fittings of concentric circles and concentric ellipses without requiring uncorrelated noise assumption. The proposed estimators are based on non-linear transformation of the unknown parameters to be estimated through the formulation of weighted equation error minimization. The proposed solutions have explicit forms. It can produce a non-iterative solution but the performance is suboptimal. Self-initialized iterative refinement can improve the estimation accuracy to optimum. To validate the efficient performance of the proposed solutions, we also provide the KCR lower bounds for the concentric circles and concentric ellipses fitting problems.

The proposed concentric circles and concentric ellipses estimators are different from the previous solutions in [25,26] which are specific to their particular problems. More importantly, comparing to [29] the proposed estimators are shown analytically and validated by simulations to achieve asymptotically (over the small-noise region) the optimum KCR lower bound performance. When contrasting to FNS and HEIV methods extended to the fitting of coupled objects, the proposed estimators have higher noise tolerance levels before the thresholding effects take place.

The proposed methods can be reduced back to the fittings of a single circle and a single ellipse. In such cases, they maintain the KCR lower bound performance for both isotropic and anisotropic noise. Anisotropic noise, meaning that the noise components in the x and y coordinate points are correlated, occurs quite often in practice such as in robotics and archaeology [7,16].

In this paper, we use the common notations that bold capital letters represent matrices and bold lower case letters denote vectors.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 formulates the estimation problems. Section 3 derives the estimators for concentric circles and concentric ellipses through parameter transformation and equation error formulation. Section 4 provides the KCR lower bounds for the fitting problems under additive zero-mean Gaussian noise. Section 5 analyzes the proposed solutions and compares their performance with the KCR lower bounds. Section 6 presents simulations and experimental results to support the theoretical developments and provides performance comparisons with some existing fitting methods. Section 7 concludes the paper.

For ease of illustration, we shall only consider a pair of objects that has two circles or two ellipses coupled together. The coupled geometric shapes considered here have the same center and are scaled versions of each other. Examples of such kind of objects include the inner and outer boundaries of a pipe and the inner and outer edges of an iris. The derived solutions can be easily extended to more than two coupled geometric shapes or reduced to one in a very direct manner.

                         can be generated to yield a better solution. The process can be iterated to improve performance. The convergence of the iterations has been studied in [32]. Through extensive simulations, we find that iterating Eqs. (7)–(10) twice is sufficient. Further iterating to regenerate the weighting matrix is not likely to yield better results.

The proposed solution (10) is expected to behave similarly to the ML solution obtained directly from the data model (1) when the SNR is high. The transformation we use here is non-linear and introduces higher order noise components. Hence we expect the proposed solution will deviate from the actual ML solution as the SNR decreases. The proposed concentric circles estimator is translation invariant.

                        . To avoid the trivial solutions, the monic constraint should be imposed in (19), which is described below.

The monic solution rewrites the cost function (19) as

                         (the least-squares solution), from which a better

                         can be generated to yield a better solution. Through extensive simulations, we find that iterating Eqs. (17)–(22) twice is sufficient. Further iterating to regenerate the weighting matrix does not lead to much improvement in accuracy.

The proposed solution (22) is expected to behave similarly to the ML solution obtained directly from the data model (1) when the SNR is high, based on the same rationale as in the concentric circles case.

The monic solution requires 
                           
                              
                                 k

                         to be not close to zero. To ensure this requirement, we add to the x and y coordinate points of the measurements a large constant, 500 in our case. After obtaining the monic solution we can simply subtract this constant out from the center estimate. The other parameter estimates are not affected by the translation in the data points. In Appendix A we provide a formal mathematical justification of our strategy regarding to

Kanatani [33] has derived the lower bound for the parameter estimation accuracy of an unbiased curve fitting estimator. However, most of the existing curve fitting estimators from the literature are biased. Chernov and Lesort [24] modified the lower bound from Kanatani for biased estimator and called it the KCR lower bound. The KCR lower bound applies to the fitting problem of any algebraic curve and provides the lower bound on the leading term of the mean-square parameter estimator error.

In this section, we present the KCR lower bounds for the fittings of concentric circles and concentric ellipses that are derived based on the formulations in [24] and [34].

[29], the Kåsa method [8,9] and the Pratt method [3] are also shown for comparison purpose. When applying the Kåsa method on the concentric circles, the parameters of the two circles are obtained independently and the common circle center estimate is computed as the average of the two independent circle center estimates.

                            to 10 and the correlation coefficient δ is 0.8. Fig. 1 shows that the proposed estimator reaches the KCR lower bound accuracy for the concentric circles center estimate very well as expected from the theory. The OʼLeary and the Kåsa methods have constant differences of about 2.7 decibel (dB) and 1.5 dB with the KCR lower bound before the noise power reaches 1, above which larger deviations occur. For the radii estimates shown in Fig. 2, the observations are similar in which the proposed method attains the KCR lower bound accuracy until the noise power exceeds 0.1 while the OʼLeary and the Kåsa methods always deviate away from the bound.

To investigate a little further, we compared the estimation bias when the weighting matrix

                            is equal to (9) and when it is set to be an identity matrix for the simulation case corresponding to Figs. 1 and 2. The results are tabulated in Table 1
                            when the noise level is fixed at

                            is equal to an identity matrix. However, choosing

                            as in (9) did provide smaller estimation variance. It is non-trivial to analyze how the weighting matrix would affect the estimate bias theoretically. We plan to look at it in more detail and report the findings elsewhere.

The proposed concentric circles estimator can also generate a non-iterative solution by setting

                                    c
                                 
                              
                            in (10) to an identity matrix. In such a case, its performance would be suboptimal. Figs. 3 and 4
                           
                            show the results of the non-iterative solution together with those from the OʼLeary and Kåsa methods. From the plots we can observe that the performance of the non-iterative solution is similar to the one from the OʼLeary method for both the concentric circles center and radii estimates. It is slightly worse than the Kåsa method for the center estimate but yields better results for the radii estimates. However, the proposed solution in non-iterative form is more computational efficient than the OʼLeary and Kåsa methods. Table 2
                            shows the relative computation time in matlab over 10 000 ensemble runs when the noise power is 
                              
                                 
                                    10
                                 
                                 
                                    −
                                    4
                                 
                              
                           . The non-iterative solution requires less computation time than the other two methods. The iterative solution of the proposed estimator requires more computation time than the non-iterative version but provides much better estimation performance.

The proposed estimator can reduce back for the fitting of a single circle. By using the same setting as in Figs. 1 and 2, Figs. 5 and 6

The performance of the OʼLeary method [29], the Taubin method [17], the FNS method [20] and the HEIV method [21] are also evaluated for comparison. Note that except the OʼLeary method, these methods are originally developed for the single ellipse fitting based on the conic ellipse equations and we have extended them for coupled ellipses. We convert their conic parameter estimates to ellipse parameters as defined in (3) when performing the comparison.

A non-iterative solution can be generated from the proposed concentric ellipses estimator by replacing

                           , the non-iterative solution has a similar performance as the other two methods. However, Table 2 indicates that the non-iterative solution is more computation efficient than the others. The relative computation time is obtained from matlab over 10 000 ensemble runs at the noise level of

                           . The iterative solution of the proposed estimator requires more computation time than the non-iterative version but provides much better accuracy.

The proposed estimator can be simplified for the single ellipse fitting. Figs. 11 and 12

We shall apply the proposed estimators on several real images to test their performance. The real images we use here are either taken by a digital camera or from the iris database CASIA-IrisV3 [35] collected by the Chinese Academy of Sciencesʼ Institute of Automation (CASIA).

The left parts of Figs. 13 and 16
                            depict images of the concentric circles and concentric ellipses captured by a digital camera with a

                            resolution. The images are clean and have been converted to 8 bpp gray scale with each pixel value between 20 and 224. To examine the estimatorsʼ performance under noise, we normalize the gray scale images by 255, add zero-mean Gaussian white noise of certain power

                           , truncate each pixel value to be within 0 to 1 and multiply by 255 to restore the original dynamic range. The Canny edge detection [36] is applied to the noisy images to obtain the edges of the concentric circles and concentric ellipses. The edges are converted to binary images as shown on the right parts of Figs. 13 and 16. The binary images define the data points on which the proposed estimators are applied.

Using the data points from concentric circles edges in Fig. 13, Figs. 14 and 15

                            ensemble runs are performed at each noise power level. Instead of the mse, the variances of the parameter estimates are shown for the performance comparison because the true parameter values are not known. Fig. 14 indicates the variance of the center estimate from the proposed method is lower than that from the OʼLeary method. The difference between them is about 2 dB when the noise power is not larger than

Note that the edge detection is in terms of pixel coordinates in integers and the noise in the data is quantized to integer values. As a result, when the noise power varies from

One main application of ellipse fitting is in biometrics for iris recognition [37,38]. Iris recognition requires accurate extraction of the inner and outer boundaries of the iris (pupil and limbus). We shall show below the experimental results of applying the proposed concentric ellipses estimator with 
                              Q

                            in (21) to the edge data points extracted from an iris image. The iris (eye) images are from the CASIA-IrisV3 iris database with a resolution of 
                              320
                              ×

                            pixels. The images are processed directly without adding any noise. However, due to the blurring behavior in the images, the exacted edges will have inherent noise. Each figure to be presented has four subfigures. The upper left subfigure shows all the edges detected from the original eye image using the Canny edge detection technique [36]. The upper right subfigure shows only the edges belonging to the inner and outer boundaries of the iris. The lower left subfigure displays the original eye image with the estimated concentric ellipses from the proposed method superimposed. The lower right subfigure shows the ellipses obtained by other methods.

                            data points are sampled randomly from each of the iris inner and outer boundaries for the estimation.


                           Fig. 19
                            represents an eye image that contains the whole iris inner boundary and only a portion in the outer boundary. The advantage of the concentric ellipses fitting over the single ellipse fitting is clear in this case. The lower left plot of Fig. 19 shows the accurate fitted concentric ellipses from the proposed method. The lower right plot shows two fitted ellipses obtained separately from the method derived by Harker and OʼLeary [39]. Both methods fit the inner iris boundary very well. However, the single ellipse fitting method has difficulty for the iris outer boundary and gives wrong result, while the proposed method fits the outer ellipse quite well.


                           Fig. 20
                            compares concentric ellipses fitting between the proposed method (lower left) and the OʼLeary method [29] (lower right) for this particular eye image in which the edges are relatively clean as shown in the upper right plot. Both methods give comparable results in this case.


                           Fig. 21
                            gives the results when the data points from the iris outer boundary are a little noisier than those in Fig. 20. Comparing the fitted ellipses from the proposed method (lower left) and the OʼLeary method (lower right) shows that the common ellipse center estimate from the OʼLeary method shifts to the left and it performs a little worse than the proposed method, especially on the iris inner boundary.


                           Fig. 22
                            depicts the results when the outer ellipse data points are quite noisy. The fitted ellipses from the proposed method (lower left) are much better than those from the OʼLeary method (lower right). The common ellipse center estimated from the OʼLeary method is much worse than the one from the proposed method.

To provide better measures of the performance comparison, Table 4
                            shows the total-square errors between the 50 measurement points and their closest points from the fitted ellipses for Figs. 20–22. The second column is from the proposed method and the third column is from the OʼLeary method. The relative percentage reduction in the total-square errors of the proposed method relative to the OʼLeary method is shown in the fourth column. The amount of improvement increases as the extracted edge data points become noisier due to the inherent characteristics of the images. For the image in Fig. 22, a 32.79% error reduction is achieved.

This paper provides computationally efficient solutions for the fitting of concentric circles as well as for concentric ellipses. The proposed estimators have explicit solutions and are derived through equation error formulation and non-linear parameter transformation. They can be in non-iterative forms by setting the weighting matrix to identity. The non-iterative form has better computational efficiency than the other non-iterative solutions from the literature and achieves comparable accuracy. The iterative form is self-initialized and provides better performance. The KCR lower bounds for the parameters of concentric circles and concentric ellipses are provided. The first order analysis shows that the proposed estimators in iterative form approach statistical efficiency asymptotically. Compared to the other iterative solutions from the literature, the proposed estimators appear to have higher noise tolerance level for the thresholding effect. Simulations on synthetic data and experimental results from real images validate the theoretical developments and the promising performance of the proposed estimators.
