                  Compared with the Monte Carlo method, the population density method is efficient for modeling collective dynamics of neuronal populations in human brain. In this method, a population density function describes the probabilistic distribution of states of all neurons in the population and it is governed by a hyperbolic partial differential equation. In the past, the problem was mainly solved by using the finite difference method. In a previous study, a continuous Galerkin finite element method was found better than the finite difference method for solving the hyperbolic partial differential equation; however, the population density function often has discontinuity and both methods suffer from a numerical stability problem. The goal of this study is to improve the numerical stability of the solution using discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. To test the performance of the new approach, interaction of a population of cortical pyramidal neurons and a population of thalamic neurons was simulated. The numerical results showed good agreement between results of discontinuous Galerkin finite element and Monte Carlo methods. The convergence and accuracy of the solutions are excellent. The numerical stability problem could be resolved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method which has total-variation-diminishing property. The efficient approach will be employed to simulate the electroencephalogram or dynamics of thalamocortical network which involves three populations, namely, thalamic reticular neurons, thalamocortical neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

To simulate brain activities, it is necessary to develop an efficient and effective modeling method because information in the brain is processed in large-scale neuronal networks across many functionally specialized areas, each of which has a myriad number of interconnected neurons [1]. The population density method is developed for this purpose, in which neurons in a large scale neuronal network are grouped into neuronal populations based on the types of neurons’ dynamics, and each neuronal population has its own population density function (PDF) representing the distribution of states of all neurons in the population [2,3]. Such a method can serve as a computational tool to efficiently evaluate the population dynamics of a neuronal population consisted of homogeneous yet slightly different neurons by using statistical information of their state variables. In addition, it can also serve as a theoretical method to explore the dynamics of a large-scale neuronal system consisted of heterogeneous neurons through the interaction arising from sub-populations consisted of homogeneous neurons [4,5]. In contrast to neural mass models [6–8], the relationship between the brain activity and the specific dynamics of neurons can be built based on the model of individual neurons in PDF. It is believed that the population density method is applicable for investigating generation mechanisms of many brain activities. To trace the population dynamics, the hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), that is, the governing equation of the PDF, has to be solved to obtain the time evolution of the PDF.

Up to now, two common types of neuronal models are used in the population density approach to model large-scale neuronal networks in the brain. One of them is the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model that can simulate the tonic firing mode of cortical pyramidal neurons [9]. By neglecting the induced dynamics of presynaptic inputs, the governing equation of LIF model can be simplified to a one-dimensional hyperbolic PDE [4,5]. The other is the leaky integrate-and-fire-or-burst (LIFB) model that can simulate the transition between the tonic and the burst firing modes manifested by thalamic neurons [10]. Similarly, by neglecting the induced dynamics of presynaptic inputs, the governing equation of LIFB model can be simplified to a two-dimensional hyperbolic PDE [11]. Unfortunately, even for the one-dimensional governing equation, solutions of the above models are intractable by analytic methods due to its high nonlinearity.

Numerical schemes are usually used to solve the governing equation, especially the finite difference methods [4,5] or finite volume methods [11]. The finite element method (FEM) had never been utilized until we proposed the continuous Galerkin FEM in our previous work [12]. It was concluded that the continuous Galerkin FEM has higher computational efficiency and lower discretization error when compared with the finite difference method. In addition, the geometrical flexibility of FEM is critical to deal with sophisticated neuron models that usually have complicated geometries within the computational domain. However, it lacks the property of so-called total variation diminishing so that it becomes unstable when the solution of the governing equation exhibits sharp variation within a small spatial interval or even discontinuity [13,14]. For the LIFB model, the solution could be discontinuous along a certain dimension if one state variable lost its dynamical behavior. As a result, an alternative numerical scheme must include the total-variation-diminishing property.

In this work, the discontinuous Galerkin FEM is used because it possesses the total-variation-diminishing property and, meanwhile, reserves the advantages of the continuous Galerkin FEM [15]. In the discontinuous Galerkin FEM, the continuity of solution values at inter-boundaries between meshes is released, and the total-variation-diminishing property is maintained by using a slope limiter. Additionally, the discontinuous Galerkin FEM allows parallel computing to increase computational efficiency [16]. So, in terms of the characteristics of lower discretization error, higher geometry flexibility, superior computational efficiency and parallel computing, it is believed that the discontinuous Galerkin FEM is a promising approach in solving the governing equation of the PDF. The goal of this work is to formulate the discontinuous Galerkin FEM and apply it to solve two populations in a neuronal network, namely, the cortical pyramidal and the thalamic neuron populations. The results will be compared with those obtained from the Monte Carlo method. Convergence and accuracy of solution and numerical stability of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM will be discussed.

The structure of this article is as follows: In section 2, two governing equations derived from the LIF and LIFB models are introduced. In section 3, the implemented algorithms of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM are presented for solving governing equations of LIF and LIFB models. In section 4, dynamical behaviors of neuronal populations are simulated to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM. Discussion and conclusions are, respectively, presented in section 5 and section 6.

The first step of simulating neuronal population dynamics by means of the population density method is to derive the neuronal model that describes how action potentials (spikes) are generated in a neuron. After deriving the neuronal models, the governing equations based on these neuronal models are described, and the implemented algorithm of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM will be presented in the next section.

                        Fig. 1 illustrates the idea of the population density method using the LIF model as an example. The basic concept of the population density method comes from statistical mechanics [4], especially that for describing macroscopic states of an ensemble of N-particles [18]. Imagine that the alteration in the states of neurons within an individual neuronal population corresponds to the movement of particles in a space. Thus PDF, ρ(x, t), represents the probability density of neurons׳ clustering at a given state point, x, within an enclosed state space and at a specific time moment, t. Then, the macroscopic states of a neuronal population can be obtained using ensemble averages if its PDF is known and its dynamics is the time variation of those macroscopic states. The PDF must be known with respect to time so it is necessary to solve the governing equation that describes time variation of the PDF and it is derived from conservation of total number of neurons within an individual neuronal population.

The discontinuous Galerkin FEM is in fact a modified method of the continuous Galerkin FEM. Thus, it follows the same procedures as the FEM to obtain an approximation of the PDF [19,20]. The procedures include (1) constructing uniform meshes in whole computational domain, (2) creating FE approximation of the solution with linear shape functions for LIF model or with bilinear quadrilateral shape functions for LIFB model, (3) deriving element equations by Galerkin method [21] and (4) solving element equations mesh by mesh by using second-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time marching algorithm [22]. The details about above procedures can be found elsewhere [15,19,20,23,24]. In this section we are going to highlight the difference between the discontinuous Galerkin FEM and the continuous Galerkin FEM.

Due to the release of continuity of solution values at inter-boundaries between meshes, the element equations can be solved mesh by mesh in the discontinuous Galerkin FEM. As a result, numerical fluxes across inter-boundaries have to be determined, which is not required in continuous Galerkin FEM. Through Galerkin method[21], the following element equation for the mesh (i, j) can be obtained

                         is defined as a flux vector consisting of all numerical fluxes across boundaries of the mesh (i, j). By the upwind scheme [25], the numerical flux is set to the stream probabilistic flux from the upwind direction.

The major difference between the discontinuous Galerkin FEM and continuous Galerkin FEM is the involvement of the total variation diminishing property. In the discontinuous Galerkin FEM, it is achieved by combining a second-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time marching algorithm with a slope limiter [19,22]. So, the time marching algorithm is modified as follows:

So far, two primary differences between the discontinuous Galerkin FEM and the continuous Galerkin FEM have been described. Then, the performances of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM and the continuous Galerkin FEM will be compared in the following section.

Simulations of neuronal population dynamics based on LIF and LIFB models are employed to compare performances of the numerical schemes presented in the previous section. The Monte Carlo simulation has been considered as the golden standard for the comparison of accuracy. Its algorithm is given in Appendix. The model parameters in the simulation tasks are listed in 
                     Table 1. The convergence and grid convergence of solutions obtained by discontinuous Galerkin FEM to those of Monte Carlo simulations were examined using the LIF model. Performances of continuous and discontinuous Galerkin FEMs were compared for three cases of simulations using the LIFB model. Three computer codes written in Matlab and run on a personal computer (Windows 7 64-bit and CPU clock rate 3.4GHz) were developed according to the algorithms presented in previous section and Appendix respectively.

The scale of a neuronal population whose dynamics could be successfully simulated by population density method was determined. As shown in 
                        Fig. 2, increasing the total number of neurons in a single neuronal population (LIF model) enabled the convergence of the population density functions obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation and the population density method. The results matched considerably with each other when the total number of neurons reaches 10000. Such a scale of neuronal population was as large as a macro cortex column that has been considered as a basic functional unit of the cortex. In this case, the population density function was accurately solved by the discontinuous Galerkin FEM as suggested by the convergence of the solution.

The quality of the solution obtained by discontinuous Galerkin FEM could be evaluated by the grid convergence test, in which as element size went infinitesimal, the approximated solution should converge to a constant value. As shown in 
                        Fig. 3, the resultant steady-state mean firing rate of the LIF model computed by using the discontinuous Galerkin FEM approached a constant value, which revealed the convergence of the method. The steady-state mean firing rate converged to 14.92pps which was slightly greater than the value obtained by using the Monte Carlo simulation by 0.33pps. Such a difference might come from the uncertainty of the Monte Carlo simulation. Nevertheless, the value was within the 95% confidence interval of the steady-state mean firing rate, estimated by the Monte Carlo method.

The order of the convergence rate of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM is still unknown although its convergence has been proved by the grid convergence test. Evaluating the convergence rate is beyond the scope of this article. However, the solution can stay in the 95% confidence interval even when the number of elements was as low as 30. It implies high convergence rate of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM. Other studies have proved a second order of convergence rate of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM with linear shape functions [26,27].

Three simulated cases for the LIF model are presented for comparing performances of the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin FEMs. The former has the total variation diminishing property while the latter does not. Two cases that exhibit discontinuity in exact solutions are simulated. The first one is an extreme case in which the steady-state population density function forms a delta function at the equilibrium point of the neuronal model due to the absence of presynaptic input. As shown in 
                        Fig. 4(a), the steady-state population density function solved by the discontinuous Galerkin FEM yields a pulse function at V=− 65mV if 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                           =
                           0
                        pps. The pulse function approximates the delta function if smaller mesh is utilized. However, solution obtained using the continuous Galerkin FEM is unstable, oscillatory and even with negative values, which is mainly due to discontinuity of the solution and the lack of total-variation-diminishing. The solution is erroneous because the PDF should be non-negative. Similar results can be found in the second case of 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                           =
                           800
                        pps. As shown in Fig. 4(b), several sharp peaks emerge from the population density function below V=−60mV (also see Fig. 2) and the solution obtained by the continuous Galerkin FEM is oscillatory and with negative values. On the contrary, the solution from the discontinuous Galerkin FEM stays stable, non-oscillatory and positive. The last is the case of 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                           =
                           80
                        pps, in which the steady-state population density function appears smooth so that solutions of both methods are not distinguishable (Fig. 4(c)). From the simulations one may find that the total-variation-diminishing property is necessary for obtaining solutions that are free of computational errors, especially when the exact solution exhibits discontinuity like the delta function.

Although adding randomness in the amplitude of ε can greatly smooth out the population density function for some cases, such as the above case of 
                           σ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                           =
                           800
                           
                        
                        [5], a delta-like PDF still cannot be avoided because the relaxation or idling state in the brain is always reflected by low, even zero, inputs to neuronal populations. Additionally, even though the input is very high, a delta-like population density function will appear for multi-dimensional neuronal models due to the lack of dynamical behaviors in some state variables. In the following, we will show this by the LIFB model.

The first case is pure-tonic dynamics of the LIFB model, in which the Ca+2 current is never activated. The response of the Ca+2 current to the input is given by

                        Fig. 5-a, -b, -c. In this case, a step input changes from 200pps to 600pps at t=0.5s for a duration of 0.2s (see Fig. 5-a). The mean current

                         remains zero due to the persistent closure of the inactivation gate (h=0, see Fig. 5-b). As shown in Fig. 5-c, the initial input, 
                           σ

                        pps, is not large enough to fire action potentials (r (t)<0.01pps) until the input is increased to 600pps after that the mean firing rate rises rapidly and converges to 13.4pps in 0.08s preceded by a reaction period of 0.02s. The corresponding population density functions at t =0.5 and t=0.6s are depicted in 
                        Figs. 6-a and 6-c. Both instantaneous population density functions reveal that all neurons are highly concentrated at h=0, which is caused by the fact that all neurons are strongly depolarized such that the inactivation gate h is never de-inactivated (V>−65mV). As shown in Fig. 6-a, neurons stimulated by the input of 200pps are located within the range (−60mV, −45mV) which is far away from threshold voltage (V
                        
                           th
                        =−35mV). On the contrary, when the input rises to 600pps, neurons are located within the interval between the resetting voltage (V
                        
                           r
                        =−50mV) and threshold voltage (see Fig. 6-c). It is noted that a delta-like population density function appears along the h-direction because the state variable h loses its dynamics during pure-tonic dynamics, which has made continuous Galerkin FEM fail.

The second case of the LIFB model is the burst-transient dynamics, in which the mean current I
                        
                           T
                         exhibits transient behavior. In this case, the step input changes from 50pps to 665pps at t=0.5s for the same duration of 0.2s (see Fig. 5-d). The transition in input causes the de-inactivation of the gate h such that the mean current 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    I

                                 T
                              
                           
                         increases to 3.34μA/cm2 in 0.01s at the initial stage after transition, and then, starts to decay due to the closure of the inactivation gate h in the depolarized level of membrane potential (see Fig. 5-e). After t=0.6s, 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    I
                                    ¯

                        becomes zero. The mean firing rate reveals sharper overshoot, up to 102.1pps, after the input increases to 665pps, and then decreases to 17.5pps. The large overshoot is due to the activation of the I
                        T current. 
                        Fig. 7-a shows the corresponding population density function at t=0.5s. At the time a large fraction of neurons are in hyperpolarized zone (V<V

                        T current is activated after the transition to 665pps in input. The activation of the I
                        T current strongly increases the firing rate, which is the so-called burst response. The I

As shown in Fig. 7(c), at t=0.6s, neurons are highly concentrated at h=0 due to the closure of the inactivation gate in all neurons such that the elicited mean firing rate in the time interval t

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

In this study, the discontinuous Galerkin FEM was proposed as a computational tool to solve the governing equation which describes temporal course of population density functions in the population density method. The simulation results show solutions obtained using the discontinuous Galerkin FEM converges to those from the Monte Carlo simulation with robust stability property. However, both convergence and stability properties of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM were not proved mathematically because the goal is to validate it as a computational tool for the population density method. In fact, mathematical proof of stability of discontinuous Galerkin FEM can be found in other relevant studies [19,26,27], which also provides us parameters to analyze the stability when solving the population density functions. First, the slope limiter granting the total variation diminishing property of the discontinuous Galerkin FEM leads to nonlinear stability [19,23]. Our simulations first showed that the solution became unstable if the slope limiter was turned off, especially for the LIFB model. Second, the time step,

It has been demonstrated that the accuracy of the discontinuous Galerkin method depends on the order of shape functions [26,27]. Employing high-order shape functions can increase the accuracy of the solution. Cockburn et al. suggested that a higher order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta method should be used to solve the FE equations [19]. However, it is a challenge to derive the coefficients of high-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta method when the order is greater than four [22]. Another challenge is how to construct the slope limiter for multi-dimensional problems, for example, the LIFB model. For these problems, not only is more complicated form of element meshes but also more constraints on the slope limiter to enforce the total variation diminishing property when compared with one-dimensional problems [15]. Therefore, in order to simplify the implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, linear and bilinear quadrilateral shape functions were used in the LIF model and the LIFB model, respectively. Another reason for adopting quadrilateral elements for the LIFB model is that the computational domain is a rectangle. Indeed, the slope limiter is related to the types of shape functions and element shapes and it is not unique. For multi-dimensional problems, it is necessary to employ triangular elements to mesh the complicated computational domain. Therefore, the slope limiter should be adapted to what we used in this study. Cockburn et al. devised a generalized slope limiter that enforced a local maximum principle for the triangular element shape in multi-dimensional cases [28,29].

Although computing efficiency is an important issue in numerical analysis of engineering or biological systems it was not addressed here because this study focused on determining an effective and accurate numerical method for solving the population density of neuronal networks. Although Matlab codes for implementing the discontinuous Galerkin FEM are not very efficient but due to its macro code nature it is easier to realize other numerical methods and comparing accuracy and efficiency of all the methods. In [24] the discontinuous Galerkin FEM was compared with two other methods, namely the second-order upwind finite difference method [30] and the discontinuity capturing Petrov-Galerkin FEM [31,32]. The discontinuous Galerkin FEM is superior to the others in accuracy with the same computing efficiency. However, low efficiency of Matlab codes may occur when simulating several neuronal populations using our method. In the future, it may be necessary to program the discontinuous Galerkin FEM in compiled codes such as C or Fortran to improve the computing efficiency especially for multiple population problems such as the modeling of EEG or mu wave. Furthermore, high-performance computation can be benefitted by excellent parallel-computing property of discontinuous Galerkin FEM. As shown in Eq. (12), the element equation only depends on the density of the element’s neighbors and the

Biswas et al. investigated the parallelizability of discontinuous Galerkin FEM and concluded that it possesses total parallel efficiency of over 89.2% [16].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

An algorithm of discontinuous Galerkin FEM was derived and employed to solve the population density functions of LIF and LIFB models. Solutions obtained by discontinuous Galerkin FEM have higher accuracy when compared with those obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation. By using the total variation diminishing algorithm and slope limiter in the discontinuous Galerkin FEM, the oscillatory and negative PDF obtained by the continuous Galerkin FEM in some cases can be resolved. The results revealed that the discontinuous Galerkin FEM is better than continuous Galerkin FEM for simulating dynamics of large-scale neuronal networks in the brain. The efficient approach will be employed to simulate the electroencephalogram (EEG), that is, dynamics of thalamocortical network which involves three populations, namely, thalamic reticular neurons, thalamocortical neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons.

It is noted that direct simulation method is considered as the true neuronal population dynamics to which population models must converge. The neural network in direct simulation method is composed of individually uncoupled 10000 neurons possessing statistically identical Poisson spike trains and biophysical models. The neuron models, Eq. (1) and Eqs. (4–7), are computed by the forth-order Runge-Kutta method with a time step of 0.1 millisecond. After each time step, if the membrane potential attains to threshold voltage, it is reset to resetting voltage without changing h for LIFB model, and an action potential is marked. The population density within each mesh defined by the meshing process in discontinuous Galerkin FEM is the ratio between the number of the neurons located at this space and the total number of neurons in the population. We define the time-dependent firing rate at time t by counting all action potentials that occur between time t and t+∆t over all neurons, and dividing this count by ∆t. ∆t is 1 millisecond in all simulations.
