                  A methodology based on adaptive likelihood ratios (ALRs) for the detection of emerging disease clusters is presented. The martingale structure of the regular likelihood ratio is preserved by the ALR. The upper limit for the false alarm rate of the proposed method depends only on the quantity of evaluated cluster candidates. Thus Monte Carlo simulations are not required to validate the procedures’ statistical significance, allowing the construction of a fast computational algorithm to detect clusters. The number of evaluated clusters is also significantly reduced, through the use of an adaptive approach to prune many unpromising clusters. This further increases the computational speed. Performance is evaluated through simulations to measure the average detection delay and the probability of correct cluster detection. We present applications for thyroid cancer in New Mexico and hanseniasis in children in the Brazilian Amazon.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Statistical methods for the analysis of periodic data obtained through surveillance systems (as used in public health, crime and environmental monitoring) are important to detect and locate clusters of cases of diseases in space–time, which may indicate a rapid change in the pattern of observed events. Usually a cluster is an unexpected agglomeration of events in space–time. When the surveillance period is pre-specified and the events are evaluated according to their spatial distribution, a (spatial) cluster is represented by a subset of spatial locations within the study area, where the rate of occurrence is significantly elevated. If the space is ignored in the analysis, the cluster is represented by the group (or sequence) of observations which are associated to the change in the temporal data pattern. However, when both space and time are simultaneously monitored, a space–time cluster is identified by a spatial location/time interval pair where the change occurs.

In the spatial scale, the problem of cluster detection may be solved through hypothesis testing. We assume that the geographical map is divided into 
                        L
                      areas (ZIP codes, districts, counties, etc.). For each area, the relative risk is defined as the disease rate of this area divided by the global disease rate. The null hypothesis states that the disease rate is constant over all the map. The alternative hypothesis states that there is a cluster (a connected region with less than 
                        L
                      areas) within the map for which the disease rate is elevated. The location and size of the cluster is considered unknown, thus there are many cluster candidates to be tested. A number of computational algorithms were devised to detect spatial clusters (Cançado et al., 2010; Duarte et al., 2010; Duczmal and Assunção, 2004; Duczmal et al., 2006; Duczmal and Buckeridge, 2006; Duczmal et al., 2007, 2008; Kulldorff, 1997; Kulldorff et al., 2006; Neill, 2012; Patil and Taillie, 2004; Tango and Takahashi, 2005; Takahashi et al., 2008; Yiannakoulias et al., 2007), see Duczmal et al. (2009) for a revision.

In the temporal scale, the detection of disease rate change caused by a cluster of observations can be solved employing methods developed for monitoring industrial processes, as for example the CUSUM method (Page, 1954; Roberts, 1966) or the mixture of likelihood ratios (Pollak, 1987); a good revision is presented in Lai (1995). Usually those methods assume that in the control state there is a known rate 
                        
                           
                              θ
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                      of disease cases, and under the presence of an epidemic the rate changes to 
                        
                           
                              θ
                           
                           
                              1
                           
                        
                     , also known. In practice it is difficult or impossible to maintain these assumptions. As alternative approaches, adaptive (Lorden and Pollak, 2005; Pavlov, 2003; Tartakovsky et al., 2006) and dynamic (West, 1986) methods have been proposed.

A space–time cluster is defined by its location in space and its time interval of occurrence. We are interested in the detection of a spatial cluster beginning at some unknown time and still existing in the current time. The Prospective Space–Time Scan Statistic for disease surveillance (Kulldorff, 2001) computes clusters’ 
                        p
                     -values through Monte Carlo replications. However, the 
                        p
                     -value is not adequate to measure the statistical significance of this method. A local Knox statistic combined with cumulative sum methods (CUSUM) using approximations by the normal distribution to monitor space–time cluster in point processes, was proposed elsewhere (Rogerson, 2001). When those approximations are employed, several problems occur (Marshall et al., 2007). Variants of the space–time scan statistic were also devised (Duczmal et al., 2011; Neill, 2011, 2009). Other statistics employed the CUSUM technique (Sonesson, 2007). Based on a partition of the study region, Porter (2007) employs an adaptive version of CUSUM methods and the Shiryaev–Roberts method to detect changes in Poisson processes. Nevertheless, when the outbreak occurs in the boundary between regions, or in a small portion of an area, the detection is compromised due to the inadequacy of the geographic limits of the partition. A variable temporal window method to detect space–time clusters employed the scan statistic combined with a score test (Tango et al., 2011). Cumulative Bayes factors were used to monitor aggregate area map clusters with known disease rate (Lima and Duczmal, 2009, 2012). Adaptive methods for the detection of space–time clusters, combining algorithms for the detection of spatial clusters with temporal monitoring techniques were also presented (Lima, 2011). In general, it is difficult to obtain desirable properties for the methods discussed above which could be useful for disease surveillance. Usual measures like power of detection and significance are not adequate to evaluate the methods, because the process is subject to change during the surveillance (Sonesson, 2007). More precisely, measures such as false alarm rate, false cluster location and detection delay are more adequate in this situation.

A possibility should be to monitor space–time clusters using the definition of an ample class of possible spatial candidate clusters and apply the purely temporal methods described above for each possible candidate. However, this procedure is prone to the problem of multiple testing, and eventual methodologies should be adjusted for those multiple comparisons in the space–time domain. In order to present a solution for this problem, we develop a novel methodology, based on adaptive likelihood ratios to compare the null hypothesis (inexistence of clusters) against the alternative hypothesis (presence of an emerging disease cluster). The adaptive likelihood ratio (ALR) preserves the martingale structure of the regular likelihood ratio, which allows the determination of an upper limit for the false alarm rate of our proposed method, which depends only on the quantity of evaluated candidates. This important property allows the use of a relatively fast computational algorithm to determine the cutting point to control the false alarm rate, thus making a viable tool for the detection of emerging space–time clusters in geographical maps. Our developed codes will be available in the public domain and may be requested from the authors.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we formulate the space–time cluster detection problem using likelihood ratio methods. In Section  3, our proposed adaptive likelihood ratio strategy is presented, along with the extension of the adaptive approach to the clusters’ configuration space. A real data application is studied in Section  4. Numerical comparisons are presented in Section  5. Finally, the conclusion remarks are presented in Section  6.

                      belongs to some open set in the finite dimension space. The objective of the surveillance is to verify if an emerging cluster exists. We are interested in detecting a cluster beginning at the unknown time 
                        ν
                        ≤
                        n
                      which is still present at the current time 
                        n
                     . The cluster can be understood as the portion of the space–time into which occurs the most significant change from the average pattern of cases of disease, at location 
                        Z
                      and at the unknown time 
                        ν
                     .

The detection of change is obtained through the data evaluation at

                        Z
                     . The instant of change is the first moment in time for which there is enough evidence to support the belief that a change has occurred in the disease cases pattern. Mathematically, the monitoring is realized using an alarm function

Generally, 
                        Z
                      represents some regular geometric shape, as circles, ellipses (Kulldorff et al., 2006) or other irregular shapes (Duczmal et al., 2009) such that the cardinality of 
                        Z
                      depends on the shape and size of 
                        Z
                     . Care must be taken to avoid an excessively large cardinality of 
                        Z
                     . Besides, a good monitoring function must be adjusted for the problem of multiple comparisons, have small detection delay, and have the capability to detect correctly at least a substantial part of the emerging cluster.

                                  is a natural choice for the detection of emerging clusters, avoiding the problem of choosing different thresholds for each region, because each region may have different change points in time. Note that we assume that the control threshold

                                  is the same for every potential emerging cluster. We stress the fact that the value 
                                    B
                                  depends on the false alarm rate, and if we choose a common value 
                                    B
                                  for all candidate solutions then we can guarantee that this rate is the same for every cluster. If there is a value

This in turn would imply a larger delay for the detection time. The gain thus obtained with the expected reduced delay shows that the adaptive approach is not just a theoretical expedient.

                         are sequentially updated as soon as we receive new information. The parameter 
                           ϵ
                         is used to control the influence of past information in the evaluation of the surveillance statistic. When 
                           ϵ
                         has larger values, more importance is given to recent changes in the process. Otherwise, for small values of 
                           ϵ
                        , a larger weight is given to information coming from more distant past periods of time. For example, using 
                           ϵ
                           =
                           0.7
                         the information from two time steps into the past is roughly 30% as important as the current time step. When 
                           ϵ
                           =
                           0
                         we have the 
                           
                              
                                 τ

                         statistic. When 
                           ϵ
                           =
                           1
                         only the information from the previous step is used.

By definition, the cardinalities of

                         and 
                           Z
                         are equal. This fact is a potential obstacle for the utilization of the procedures MAX and MIX-ALR because cardinality 
                           
                              |
                              Z

                         of the set 
                           Z
                         may be very large if flexibly shaped irregular clusters are included. This implies that the obtained values for MAX and MIX-ALR may be so small that the alarm does not ring, even in the presence of an emerging cluster in the map. To solve this problem, an adaptive procedure is also recommended for the space of spatial configurations

In this section we study the dataset of 557 new cases of hanseniasis in children less than 15 years old, registered by the 62 municipalities of the Amazonas state in Brazil, from January 2003 to December 2007. The global disease rate for the population at risk in the state is 0.07 cases per 10 thousand individuals. Hanseniasis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, transmitted from one person to the other, and its occurrence is related to poor living conditions. It is endemic in the Amazonas state, and occasionally may be epidemic. The high incidence for children less than 15 years old is considered an important indicator of early age exposure to the pathogenic agent.

In this application we consider clusters of elliptical shape with different center locations, sizes, shapes and orientation angles. It is assumed that 
                              z
                            represents an ellipse (Kulldorff et al., 2006). Here we used ellipses with shape parameters 1, 2, 4 and 6. Each ellipse contains at maximum 25% of the total population. The number of distinct elliptical clusters is 
                              J
                              =
                              5054
                           , determined after the removal of redundant sets of areas defined by the ellipses.

We present for illustration only the alarm function GW-ALR. The GW-ALR graph is presented for two sets of space clusters: the circular-GW-ALR (only for circles, with shape parameter equal to 1) and the elliptic-GW-ALR as explained above. In Fig. 5
                           (a) we employ 
                              B
                              =
                              20
                            and 
                              ϵ
                              =
                              0.8
                           . The first surveillance period (equal to 1) corresponds to January 2006 and the last one (equal to 24) corresponds to December 2007. In this graph, at time 
                              t
                              =
                              19
                            the value of circular-GW-ALR is equal to 37.260, above the threshold 
                              B
                              =
                              20
                           , ringing the alarm in the space location shown in Fig. 4(a). The same thing happens for the elliptic-GW-ALR, with value equal to 36.094, and spatial location shown at Fig. 4(b). The location given by the circular-GW-ALR is excessively large compared with the corresponding location given by the elliptic-GW-ALR. Also, note that the last cluster is not connected. This is called a historical cluster with final time 
                              t
                              =
                              19
                           . After a while the cluster disappears and the successive data does not bring relevant cluster information. However, the surveillance function is still influenced by the presence of cases in the detected cluster. In order to eliminate this influence, a possible solution is to intervene and isolate the detected cluster at time 
                              t
                              =
                              19
                            and remove the observations belonging to the cluster which rang the alarm. The function of alarm is then run again, updating the process. The resulting graph, after the intervention, is displayed in Fig. 5(b).

                         values, for the three GMAX, GMIX and GW methods, implying that the detected cluster was higher than the true cluster, although with good precision.

Generally speaking, GMAX-ALR is more accurate to detect the cluster (has higher

In comparison, the GW-ALR method has the smallest delay when the intensity of change in the process is small; for larger values of change, the procedure GMIX-ALR has the smallest delay. The Prospective Scan has the largest delay for all the cases. However, it has the largest (

This happens because in the latter, the spatial part is estimated with the data obtained up to the instant of time before the current time. All the four methods have good precision of cluster location in terms of

                        ; even when the delay is small, sensitivity is elevated. Generally, GW-ALR presented smaller delay, but less spatial precision. On the other hand, GMIX-ALR had larger delay, being more precise to delineate the cluster, which had become more evident through time.

Although many clusters may be approximately circular, it is very common to find irregularly shaped clusters (e.g. non-circular or non-square shaped clusters) arising in real situations, such as disease concentrations along rivers, roads, shores and valleys. For example, a pollutant plume or the extent of underwater contamination may assume an irregular geographic shape. Most urban environments exhibit a complex population distribution over an array of traffic ways, for which the circular cluster shape is not entirely adequate. This approach makes sense especially for our application, due to the presence of numerous rivers in the study area. In this fashion, many heuristics were developed in the last decade to find arbitrarily shaped clusters (Duczmal et al., 2009).

The number of possible cluster candidates increases exponentially with the number of regions in a map. Even though all cluster solutions could be known, selecting the best cluster is an ill posed problem. The immense number of candidate solutions concurs to reduce the power of detection, because high likelihood ratio clusters can be constructed simply by adjoining elevated risk regions, forming very irregularly shaped clusters. Those clusters spread through large portions of the study area and do not bring useful information about the location of possible legitimate clusters, which are generally smaller and have somewhat lower likelihood ratio values. In practice, some kind of penalty function is used to avoid excessive freedom of clusters shape (Cançado et al., 2010; Duarte et al., 2010; Duczmal et al., 2006; Duczmal and Buckeridge, 2006; Duczmal et al., 2007, 2008; Kulldorff et al., 2006; Neill, 2012; Yiannakoulias et al., 2007).

The Elliptic Spatial Scan has been considered a satisfactory compromise between computational cost and effectiveness for the geographic delineation of irregularly shaped clusters, and has been described in detail elsewhere (Kulldorff et al., 2006). An ellipse is defined by the 
                           x
                         and 
                           y
                         coordinates of its centroid, and its size, shape, and angle of the inclination of its longest axis. The shape is defined as the ratio of the length and width of the ellipse. For a given map, we define a finite collection of ellipses 
                           E
                         as follows. For computational reasons, in this work the shapes 
                           s
                         in 
                           E
                         are restricted to 1, 2, 4 and 6. A finite set of angles is chosen such that there is an overlapping of about 70% for neighboring ellipses with the same shape, size and centroid; for the chosen shape values 
                           s
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           ,
                           4
                         and 6, the number of different orientation angles are 1, 6, 12 and 18 respectively; for 
                           s
                           =
                           2
                           ,
                           4
                         and 6, those numbers correspond to differing orientation angles between consecutive neighboring ellipses by 30°, 20° and 10°, respectively. The ellipses’ centroids are set identical to the cells’ centroids in the map. We choose a finite number of ellipses whose sizes define uniquely all the possible zones 
                           z
                         formed by the cells in that map whose centroids lie within some ellipse of the subset. The collection 
                           E
                         is thus formed grouping together all these subsets, for each cells’ centroid, shape, and angle. Further, define 
                           E
                           
                              (
                              s
                              )
                           
                         as the subset of 
                           E
                         that includes all the shapes listed above, up to and including 
                           s
                        . The choice of the collection 
                           E
                         and its associated collection of zones is done beforehand and only once for a given map. The spatial scan statistic is thus applied to the collection of zones defined by 
                           E
                           
                              (
                              s
                              )
                           
                        . A simple scheme for the computation of the elliptical cluster shapes is easily achieved through consecutive rotations followed by linear stretching of the centroids’ coordinates map, and the straightforward application of the circular scan algorithm. The circular scan is a special case of the elliptic scan, where the shape is restricted to 
                           s
                           =
                           1
                        .

The Elliptic Scan evaluates, for

                         When the number of time steps 
                           n
                         is large, the adjustment for multiple tests becomes computationally expensive. In our adaptive approach, the behavior of the number of spatial cluster candidates evaluated at each time step for 
                           L
                           =
                           32
                         locations, is shown in Fig. 7
                        . Note that at most 32 candidates in the spatial part of the cluster are evaluated at each time step. This graph shows that much more flexible shapes (ellipses instead of circles) could be used, with only a small increase in computation time.

The flexibility of shape is an advantage in our adaptive approach because only 
                           L
                         cluster candidates must now be evaluated at each time step (for a map with 
                           L
                         locations); in comparison, it may be necessary to evaluate a very large number of cluster candidates when using other non-adaptive flexible shape methods: there may be as many as 
                           
                              (

                                    L

                              1
                              )
                           
                         candidate clusters just considering the spatial domain. In practice it makes the algorithm faster and reduces the detection delay, simply because many cluster candidates are discarded due to their small probability of representing the emerging cluster. In other words, at each time step the algorithm prunes the branches of the growing tree of potential candidate clusters, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion characteristic of non-adaptive methods.

When time is also considered, a total of 
                           n

                         space–time comparisons may be required for 
                           n
                         time steps. The analysis of the accumulated data requires an adjustment for the multiple comparisons. Thus the number of multiple tests increases with the size of the collection of candidate clusters and the total time of surveillance. However, with the adaptive approach the number of comparisons is drastically reduced.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this work we developed a novel method for statistical disease surveillance in aggregated area maps to detect emerging space–time clusters. We combined monitoring techniques originally devised for the temporal scale with adaptive estimation and algorithms for spatial cluster detection, and proposed a novel space–time surveillance method based on the utilization of the adaptive likelihood ratio (ALR). Essentially, the ALR is a genuine likelihood ratio, thus preserving the martingale property, such that the methods developed in this paper do not require the use of Monte Carlo simulations to validate the procedure’s statistical significance. In practice, this greatly reduces the time to compute the solutions.

Three alarm functions to detect emerging clusters were defined: the maximum of all ALRs, mixtures of ALRs, and weighted ALRs. We studied one application, with unknown baselines to illustrate our methods. The results obtained for the application were similar to the Prospective Space–Time Scan. However, when the class of cluster candidates was augmented, we observed difficulties in the detection, which motivated the introduction of another adaptive estimator in the configuration space of spatial clusters. Following this approach, we defined generalized versions of the three previous ALR functions: GMAX-ALR, GMIX-ALR and GW-ALR. With those three generalized alarm functions, this novel approach presented two advantages: (i) the computational speed increased, due to the fact that Monte Carlo replications to evaluate the significance of the cluster were not needed; and (ii) the configuration space was reduced, producing more efficient algorithms. Thus, in a map with 
                        L
                      areas, the adaptive approach presents the advantage of requiring at most 
                        L
                      candidates, and the same time controlling the false alarm rate. The flexibility of shape may be used in our adaptive approach, without being necessary to evaluate a very large number of cluster candidates.

Although we assume the mutual independence between the random vectors, an important feature of the adaptive approach is the ability to capture the spatial and temporal correlations through the estimation. Although it is virtually impossible to derive the methods’ properties analytically (detection delay and precision), an empirical analysis based on simulations was obtained, with very satisfactory results. Those performance results suggest that the adaptive likelihood ratio strategies, working in both adaptive levels of parametric space and clusters’ configuration space, are very effective in the surveillance of space–time disease clusters.

Next are summarized the recommendations for the use of the ALR procedures and the choice of their parameters. The value of the false alarm rate (
                        
                           FAR
                        
                     ) depends on the user’s choice. For example, under the null hypothesis, using 
                        
                           FAR
                        
                        =
                        0.05
                      we expect about one false alarm out of every 20 evaluations of the surveillance statistic. The parameter 
                        ϵ
                      is used to control the influence of past information in the evaluation of the surveillance statistic. Larger values of 
                        ϵ
                      bestow more importance to recent changes in the process. A value of 
                        ϵ
                        =
                        0.7
                      gives weight of 70% for one time step before the current time, 21% for two time steps before the current time and 9% for the remaining time steps. For example, in daily surveillance, with a time window of three days, a value of 
                        ϵ
                        =
                        0.7
                      or 
                        ϵ
                        =
                        0.8
                      is recommended. There is a trade-off between delay of detection and spatial location precision. Using the ARL methods we observe smaller delays and reduced PPV values, compared to the prospective scan statistic, as seen in Table 3. The Prospective Scan has the largest delay for all the cases. However, it has the largest (PPV) value, compared to the GMAX, GMIX and GW ALR methods. In epidemiological studies using historical data, the spatial location precision is more relevant; in this case the Prospective Scan is preferred. However, in disease surveillance, the spatial location precision may be sacrificed in order to reduce the delay of detection, which assumes paramount importance, favoring the ALR methods. The best results in our simulations were obtained for the alarm functions GMIX and GW-ALR. Simulations show that when the intensity of change in the process is small the GW-ALR method has the smallest delay; otherwise, for high intensity changes, the smallest delay is attained by the procedure GMIX-ALR.
