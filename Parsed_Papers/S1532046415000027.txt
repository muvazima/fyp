                  When validating risk models (or probabilistic classifiers), calibration is often overlooked. Calibration refers to the reliability of the predicted risks, i.e. whether the predicted risks correspond to observed probabilities. In medical applications this is important because treatment decisions often rely on the estimated risk of disease. The aim of this paper is to present generic tools to assess the calibration of multiclass risk models.
                  We describe a calibration framework based on a vector spline multinomial logistic regression model. This framework can be used to generate calibration plots and calculate the estimated calibration index (ECI) to quantify lack of calibration. We illustrate these tools in relation to risk models used to characterize ovarian tumors. The outcome of the study is the surgical stage of the tumor when relevant and the final histological outcome, which is divided into five classes: benign, borderline malignant, stage I, stage II–IV, and secondary metastatic cancer. The 5909 patients included in the study are randomly split into equally large training and test sets. We developed and tested models using the following algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes and nearest shrunken centroids.
                  Multiclass calibration plots are interesting as an approach to visualizing the reliability of predicted risks. The ECI is a convenient tool for comparing models, but is less informative and interpretable than calibration plots. In our case study, logistic regression and random forest showed the highest degree of calibration, and the naive Bayes the lowest.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

For medical applications, prediction models that provide probabilistic (risk) estimates of an event of interest are useful for clinical decision support, personalized healthcare, and shared decision making. Prior to the implementation of such tools in clinical practice, validation with respect to discrimination and calibration is required [1–6]. A model should be able to distinguish between different possible outcome categories (discrimination). This can be evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) or multiclass extensions of this approach. Calibration assessment is often overlooked, but is of importance for several applications where risk models may be used. Such applications include decisions whether or not to treat a patient [7], start preventive action, or to inform the choice of treatment [8]. Calibration is also relevant when informing patients about risk [9], when comparing hospitals with respect to quality of care (e.g. benchmarking based on mortality risk) [10], and when identifying high risk patients for inclusion in clinical trials [11]. The optimal use of risk models in these situations relies on reliable risk estimation. For example, a classic result from decision analysis states that the adopted risk threshold to decide whether or not to take further action implies specific misclassification costs [12]: the odds of the risk threshold equals the ratio of the harm of a false positive test result to the benefit of a true positive result. For example if a risk threshold of 10% is adopted, the assumption is that 1 true positive is worth 9 false positives. If a poorly calibrated risk model is then used to assess whether patients exceed the planned threshold, inappropriate decisions may be taken.

For binary outcomes, the relationship between predicted and observed probabilities can be visualized by means of a calibration plot [1,13,14]. Observed probabilities are sometimes obtained by computing event rates within groups of patients with similar predicted probabilities (e.g. decile split). However, often flexible smoothing methods such as local regression (loess) or splines are used to link predicted probabilities to estimated observed probabilities [1].

Recently, our group extended binary calibration plots to multiclass models based on multinomial logistic regression (MLR) [15]. We proposed two frameworks, one parametric and one non-parametric. Logistic regression is a common algorithm to build binary and multiclass clinical prediction models, and naturally works with risk estimates. However, machine learning algorithms are also used for clinical risk prediction [16–21], and are very frequently used in high dimensional and/or “large p, small n” prediction studies (i.e. a large number of predictors and a small number of patients) [22–24]. Moreover, although using machine-learning approaches for classification problems is often less suited to probability estimation, methods do exist to facilitate this [25–30]. The calibration performance of risk models is an issue that is often neglected, and it is not surprising that with a few exceptions this is frequently the case for models based on machine learning algorithms [13,26,27,30–32].

The aim of this paper is to introduce a non-parametric framework to evaluate the calibration of multiclass risk models irrespective of the modeling technique used. Based on this framework we also derive a calibration measure to quantify and compare calibration performance between models. We illustrate these methods with a case study looking at the classification of ovarian tumors. We develop and validate risk models to diagnose tumor pathology based on logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes and nearest shrunken centroids.

The accurate diagnosis of ovarian tumors prior to surgery is crucial when choosing appropriate patient management and referral. As different types of malignancies require different management, we aimed to develop a model to predict the risk that an ovarian tumor is benign, borderline malignant, a stage I cancer, a stage II–IV cancer, or secondary metastatic cancer. We used data from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) consortium [37–39]. These data are derived from 5909 patients collected between 1999 and 2012 at 24 centers in 10 countries [40], and were randomly divided into a development and validation set stratified for the final outcome. The outcome is based on the histo-pathological diagnosis of the mass after surgical removal by laparotomy or laparoscopy as well as the stage of the tumor (when relevant) as assessed by the surgeon. Pathologists were blind to the data collected for the study and the results of any risk models we developed. The following predictors or features were considered for model development without further selection: age (years), serum CA125 (U/ml), oncology referral center (yes/no), maximum diameter of the lesion (mm), proportion of solid tissue (between 0 and 1), presence of more than 10 cyst locules (yes/no), number of papillary projections (0, 1, 2, 3 and more than 3), presence of acoustic shadows (yes/no) and presence of ascites (yes/no) (Table 1
                     ). The proportion of solid tissue is defined as the ratio of the maximum diameter of the largest solid component and the maximum diameter of the lesion. These nine variables are the predictors from the multinomial risk prediction model ADNEX [40]. Some values for serum CA125 were missing and were imputed in order not to lose these records. We used predictive mean matching regression [41] using variables that were either related to the level of CA125 itself, or the unavailability of CA125 via an indicator as to whether the CA125 level was missing or not [42].

We develop and validate various binary and multiclass risk models to diagnose ovarian tumors. The models are based on logistic regression and machine learning algorithms (see Appendix C). In the first part of the study, we develop binary models to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. We then discuss multiclass problems by developing models to distinguish between benign, borderline malignant, stage I invasive, stage II–IV invasive and secondary metastatic ovarian tumors. The available data were split into a development set and a validation set. The split was random, using a 1:1 ratio with stratification according to the multiclass outcome. R version 3.0.3 (www.r-project.org) was used for the statistical analysis.

The ability to distinguish between different outcome categories (discrimination) as well as the reliability of predicted risks (calibration) is assessed.

Discrimination of a binary risk prediction model was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) [43]. For the multiclass risk models, several measures were used that are related to the AUC. First, we calculated AUCs for pairs of categories based on conditional risks (e.g.

The PDI is a direct multiclass version of the AUC and estimates the average proportion of correctly identified cases within a group of cases each belonging to a different outcome category [46]. For J outcome categories the value of M-index and PDI for a model that gives random predictions is 0.5 and 1/J (e.g. 0.2 if J
                           =5) [46].

As an overall group-level measure we calculated the calibration-in-the-large or mean calibration for every outcome category. This measure equates to the difference between the observed event rate of an outcome category and the average predicted probability of this category (i.e. the predicted event rate). For the assessment of the calibration of individual risk predictions we used the non-parametric recalibration framework explained in Section 2 to produce calibration plots and to calculate ECI.

In the first part of the study we focus on the binary diagnosis of ovarian tumors as benign or malignant. The binary risk models were logistic regression, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes and nearest shrunken centroids [47–51] (Table 2
                        ). More information concerning the different models and the tuning of the hyperparameters is given in Appendix C.

In the second part we focus on the multiclass diagnosis of ovarian tumors as benign, borderline malignant, stage I cancer, stage II–IV cancer, or secondary metastatic cancer. Multiclass risk models can either be a combination of binary risk models or an ‘all-in-one’ model. Among the algorithms we implemented, only the SVMs could not give all-in-one multiclass risks. When binary models were combined, two types of combinations were used: a tree of nested dichotomies (or binary tree) [52], and pairwise coupling [53]. For the former a tree of binary prediction models is constructed. In our case study, from a clinical viewpoint the first two dichotomies of the binary tree are straightforward: first a model to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, then for the malignant tumors a model to distinguish between borderline and invasive tumors. The invasive tumor category has three subgroups: stage I, stage II–IV and secondary metastatic cancers. Since it is less obvious what the most clinically relevant tree is for these three categories, we constructed three possible trees and computed the average (Fig. 1
                        ). For pairwise coupling, the pairwise probabilities

For multiclass risk prediction, we applied nine algorithms (Table 2). For logistic regression, all-in-one multinomial logistic regression (MLR), sequential dichotomous logistic regression (LR-BT) and pairwise coupling logistic regression (LR-PC) were used. For support vector machines, a binary tree (SVM-BT) and a pairwise coupling (SVM-PC) approach were applied.

Confidence intervals for ECI and the ECI difference between two models were obtained with bootstrapping using the bias-corrected method on 1000 bootstrap samples of the validation data. We always reported 95% confidence intervals, however we used the following procedure to test for differences between models with respect to calibration. We ranked the models based on their validation data ECI, and compared the best model with every other model. A correction for multiple testing was used using a method similar to the Holm step-down method. We compared the best model with the worst model using 
                           
                              α
                           
                        
                        =0.05/(m
                        −1), where m is the number of models. If significant, the best model is compared with the second to worst model using 
                           
                              α
                           
                        
                        =0.05/(m
                        −2), and so on. Once a test is not statistically significant, all remaining tests are considered not significant as well.

For the logistic regression and machine learning models we used the following R-packages: rms, vgam, klaR, pamr, randomForest, kernlab and caret. The function sigest() of the R-package kernlab is used for automatic sigma estimation, while the functions train() and trainControl() of the R-package caret were used for the determination of optimal tuning parameters.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The optimal hyperparameter values based on maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the logloss were different for the SVM regularization parameter C (10 based on accuracy vs 1 based on logloss) and for the number of neighbors for kNN (20 vs 50). Minimizing the logloss resulted in a simpler model compared with maximizing accuracy. This implies less over-fitting and smoother results, which means that better calibration performance can be expected.

The validation AUCs demonstrated good discrimination for all approaches (Table 3
                        ). kNN had the worst discriminative ability with a validation AUC of 0.890, RF the best with a validation AUC of 0.948.

The mean calibration of the risk of malignancy was close to zero for logistic regression. Overall it ranged between 0.25% (logistic regression) and 3.93% (naive Bayes) on the validation data suggesting that the risk of malignancy was on average slightly underestimated (Table 3). Most models showed an ECI close to zero, exceptions based on accuracy were kNN, NB, and NSC (Table 3). Logistic regression had the best ECI. Ranking models based on mean calibration or ECI yields different results, which is explained by the fact that these measures do not capture the same information. In general terms the mean calibration measures calibration on the group level whereas ECI focuses on the individual level. For example, kNN based on logloss has relatively poor mean calibration but a relatively good ECI.

The calibration plots for logistic regression (lowest ECI) and NB (highest ECI) are shown in Fig. 2
                        a–b. We have plotted the curves for the risk of a benign tumor and for the risk of malignancy, even though plotting only one would be sufficient because both curves are complementary. The reason we have shown both curves is to make the plots consistent with the calibration plots for multiclass models, where it is convenient to show curves for every category. It is interesting to observe that the ECI value of 1.67 for NB corresponded to calibration curves that are very deviant from the (ideal) diagonal line. Although 1.67 appears close to 0, the NB model is not well calibrated.

For SVM and kNN, different hyperparameters were selected when relying on logloss vs accuracy as a selection criterion. As expected, models based on logloss showed better calibration. This is illustrated in Fig. 2c–d for kNN. A similar yet less explicit difference was observed for SVM.

For all machine learning approaches except RF, hyperparameter values obtained by maximizing accuracy were different from the values obtained by minimizing logloss resulting in different risk probabilities.

The best multiclass AUC results were obtained for the logistic regression models (0.790–0.798) and RF (0.792), the worst for kNN (0.684–0.686) (Table 4
                        ). Regarding pairwise AUCs (Table S1), it was clear that it was most difficult to distinguish between borderline and stage I cancer, and between the different types of invasive cancers (stage I, stage II–IV, and secondary metastatic cancer).

Overall the logistic regression approaches had the best mean calibration, while NB was clearly worse, specifically when accuracy was used to tune the hyperparameter (Table S2). This is remarkable given that the available data were randomly split into development and validation sets. For the other models the deviation was mild (up to 4%). The ECI was lowest for the logistic regression approaches (0.26–0.30) and kNN based on logloss (0.28), and highest for NB (4.82 when based on logloss, 8.25 when based on accuracy) (Table 4). When comparing the ECI of the best model LR-PC with those of every other model, with the application of a Holm-based step-down method to correct for multiple testing, we conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the ECI of LR-PC and the ECI’s of MLR, LR-BT, SVM-BT based on logloss, kNN based on logloss, and RF (Table 5
                        ). The other models’ ECI was significantly lower.

The multiclass calibration plots of the best calibrated models according to ECI (LR-PC as the best logistic regression model, SVM-BT based on logloss as the best SVM model, RF, and kNN based on logloss) are shown in Fig. 3
                        . As highlighted in Section 2, contrary to the calibration plots for binary outcomes, there is no one-to-one relationship between predicted and observed probabilities. For that reason we added spline smoothers to summarize the trend. In Fig. 4
                         simplified calibration plots with only the smoothed curves are shown. All models are fairly well calibrated. The most clear deviation is that higher estimated risks for the small categories (borderline, stage I cancer, secondary metastatic cancer) are typically too extreme (overfitted) as the curves for these outcome categories deviate more from the diagonal as the predicted probability increases.

The ECI was always lower when hyperparameter tuning was based on logloss compared with accuracy, except for SVM-PC where results were nearly identical for both methods (Table 4). For four algorithms (SVM-BT, kNN, NSC, NB), the 95% confidence interval on the ECI difference did not include 0 (Table 5). Even if we were to correct for multiple testing, significant differences would remain except for SVM-BT. Hence minimization of logloss resulted in better calibration, which is illustrated for kNN and NB in Fig. 5
                        . This figure also shows the clear miscalibration of risks based on NB, even when logloss was used.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

When validating a risk model for medical applications, discrimination as well as calibration should be assessed [1–6]. The model needs to be able to distinguish the different outcome categories but also to reliably predict the risk of a certain outcome. In this paper we have described a generic recalibration framework to visualize and quantify the lack of calibration for multiclass risk models irrespective of the modeling approach used. To illustrate this we have used the diagnosis of ovarian tumors as a case study. Different models were developed and validated with respect to discrimination and calibration: logistic regression, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors, random forest, naive Bayes and nearest shrunken centroids. Overall, logistic regression and random forest models showed the best calibration, whereas the calibration of naive Bayes was disappointing. An explanation for the latter might be that the independence assumption is unrealistic for the data leading to inaccurate estimates [55].

The recalibration framework was used to visualize calibration by means of a calibration plot as well as to quantify the lack of calibration through the estimated calibration index (ECI). The ECI focuses on calibration of individual patient risks, and therefore has an advantage over mean calibration, which is a group level measure. Mean calibration assesses whether estimated event rates are accurate. Lack of mean calibration is also captured by ECI, but ECI captures other aspects as well such as over-fitting (risk estimates that are too extreme).

Both visualization and quantification have their advantages and disadvantages. Calibration plots are more informative and interpretable than ECI, because ECI summarizes the calibration plot for every outcome into a single number. Therefore, for the evaluation of a single model one should focus on calibration plots. The ECI should not be used as a stand-alone metric in this situation because the result is hard to interpret without corresponding plots. The well-known Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and its extensions are often used to evaluate miscalibration of a single model. Hosmer–Lemeshow statistics were not discussed in this paper due to reported drawbacks with their use such as instability, low power, sensitivity to sample size and arbitrariness of the construction of subgroups [56,57]. If the aim is to compare multiple models, however, ECI can be used. Given that ECI compares predicted probabilities with observed probabilities that are in fact estimated, we advise bootstrapping to obtain confidence intervals or to test for a statistically significant difference between models. We always have to keep in mind that two models with the same ECI may have different calibration curves and thus a different type of miscalibration.

Since there is no one-to-one relationship between predicted and observed probabilities for the multiclass calibration plots (see Fig. 3) we use smoothed curves to visualize the general relationship. If only the smoothed curves are shown (as we did in Figs. 4 and 5 for clarity), information is lost. Nevertheless, we believe these smoothed relationship is most important in the assessment of calibration performance. Yet if this relationship is good, meaning that it is close to the diagonal line, it is still possible that predicted and observed probabilities are away from the diagonal line for many patients. So far, it is our experience that it is very difficult to develop a model where, the result for every patient in a validation dataset is close to the diagonal line. Further research on this issue is needed.

The tuning of risk prediction models is an important issue [26]. For logistic regression, variable selection, non-linear effects and interaction terms can be considered as tuning [26]. We have not investigated the inclusion of non-linear effects or interactions, although non-linear effects are probably present [58]. In real clinical applications such tuning is advised, for example by modeling continuous predictors using spline functions, however the amount of tuning should depend on the sample size that is available [58]. Machine learning approaches have different tuning parameters (e.g. number of neighbors for kNN and number of considered variables in each split for RF) [26]. The choice of optimization method for these hyperparameters may influence model performance [31]. As expected, we noticed in our study that considering logloss as an optimization method for tuning resulted in better calibration compared with accuracy. We acknowledge that other optimization methods can be considered and may yield different model performance [31].

In the literature, many machine-learning models are available and the optimal hyperparameter values of these models can be obtained using different optimization techniques. Different methods can be used to create probabilities, certainly for multiclass outcomes [25,28]. This results in a plethora of possible algorithms to develop binary and multiclass risk models. In this paper we considered some approaches as an illustration of the multiclass calibration tools that may be used. We did not attempt to compare algorithms with respect to their capacity to produce calibrated risk estimates. The latter would be of interest, but to do this we believe that a large benchmark study would be required to compare a large battery of algorithms on multiple datasets.

We compared different degrees of freedom for the vector splines in the vector spline MLR analysis, and concluded that 2 degrees of freedom were sufficient [15]. Procedures for automatic selection of the level of smoothing for the calibration plots, for example by using generalized cross validation, would be desirable [59].

We randomly divided the data into development and validation data, with stratification for the multiclass outcome. This random split allowed the construction of calibration plots, but the results may depend on the split. However we expect that the dependency is limited due to the large sample size. Also, in real applications it is more interesting to use an external validation dataset, for example by using new data collected later in time or data from different hospitals. An advantage of using such a random split is that it should lead to few problems with mean calibration, because the development and validation are two random samples from an identical population. Miscalibration in our case study was more likely to be related to over-fitting.

Another limitation is that we decided to use single imputation for CA125. This approach ignores the fact that we are uncertain about whether the imputed values are correct [42]. An alternative to deal with the issue of uncertainty would be multiple imputation [42]. However, since the aim of this study was not the development of risk prediction models for clinical practice, we made a pragmatic decision to use single imputation.

The generic recalibration framework is an interesting approach to visualizing the reliability of predicted risks and quantify lack of calibration. The estimated calibration index (ECI) is easy for comparing models, but is less informative and interpretable than calibration plots.
