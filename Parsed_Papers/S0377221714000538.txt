                  This paper considers the issue of performing testing inference in fixed effects panel data models under heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We use numerical integration to compute the exact null distributions of different quasi-t test statistics and compare them to their limiting counterpart. The test statistics use different heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors. Our results reveal that the asymptotic approximation is usually poor in small samples when the test statistic is based on the covariance matrix estimator proposed by Arellano (1987). The quality of the approximation is greatly increased when the standard error is obtained using other heteroskedasticity-consistent estimators, most notably the CHC4 estimator. Our results also reveal that the performance of Arellano’s test improves considerably when standard errors are computed using restricted residuals.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Fixed effects (FE) regression models usually display some sort of heteroskedatiscity (non-constant error variance). The fixed effects estimator (FEE) remains unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal when the error variances are not constant. Its usual covariance matrix estimator, however, is no longer valid since it estimates the wrong covariance matrix. The FEE has been widely used in panel data (PD) econometric analyses to deal with individual heterogeneity. In a heteroskedastic linear FE model, when heteroskedasticity is of unknown form, the common practice is to use the FEE coupled with a consistent estimator for its covariance matrix. The estimator proposed by Arellano (1987), which is an extension of the HC0 heteroskedasticity consistent estimator estimator introduced by White (1980), is the most commonly used estimator in practical applications. It is consistent under both homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity and allows for whithin group correlation.

For instance, when using a FE regression model in two-stage DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) modeling it is important to account for unequal error variances, i.e., for heteroskedasticity. Banker and Natarajan (2008) note that the second stage can be performed using a log-linear model. It is important, however, that the basic assumptions hold true, as noted by Simar and Wilson (2011). Accordingly, McDonald (2009) and Lee and Johnson (2011) recommend the use of heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.

The results in our paper are important for those who carry out empirical analyses using FE models. In such analyses, testing inferences are made on the parameters that index the model in order to determine which covariates should be in the model and which covariates should be removed from the model. Testing inference based on the CHC0 estimator available in the literature can be considerably liberal, which means that often one will keep in the model independent variables that are not relevant. Some of the alternative testing strategies proposed (and numerically evaluated) in this paper yield much more accurate inferences.

Our main aim in this paper is to consider alternative heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors and to use numerical integration to compute the exact null distribution of the corresponding quasi-t test statistics. In particular, we consider adaptations to FE panel data modeling of the following covariance matrix estimators: HC2, proposed by Horn, Horn, and Duncan (1975); HC3, introduced by Davidson and MacKinnon (1993); and HC4, proposed by Cribari-Neto (2004). We construct the estimators using both unrestricted and restricted residuals. The exact null distributions we compute are then compared to their asymptotic counterpart in order to assess the quality of the first-order approximation used when performing testing inference. Similar results for linear regressions with cross-sectional data can be found in Chesher and Austin (1991) and Cribari-Neto, Ferrari, and Oliveira (2005). We also report numerical evidence on the powers of the tests.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the FE model and the different covariance matrix estimators. In Section 3 we write the test statistics as ratios of Gaussian quadratic forms.

Numerical results are reported in Section 4. Finally, some concluding remarks are offered in Section 5.

The model of interest is the linear FE regression model:

The presence of individual effects makes estimation of Model (1) difficult, since the number of such effects grows with n. The FEE follows from the idea of transforming the model in order to eliminate the fixed effects. This can be done by subtracting from each variable its time average. To that end, one can use the following matrix:

S2 assures the strict exogeneity of

Conversely, if S4’ is valid, then errors do not have constant variance. If S1 through S4 are valid, then the FEE is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of

In order to maintain some conformity with the terminology employed in cross-sectional data models, we shall denote the CRMC estimator in (3) by CHC0. All other estimators we consider shall be denoted accordingly: the HC2 estimator applied to FE regression models shal be denoted by CHC2 (Clustered HC2), and so on.

The CHC0 estimator does not impose any restrictions on the form of heteroskedasticity; however, independence of errors among individuals is assumed. It is consistent when 
                        
                           n
                           →
                           ∞
                        
                     , with T fixed. To guarantee consistency when

                           →
                           ∞
                        
                     , some additional considerations must be made; see Hansen (2007) and Stock and Watson (2008).

The properties of the CHC0 estimator are well known. Kezdi (2005), for instance, analyzes the process of obtaining standard errors when there are both heteroskedasticity and serial autocorrelation. According to the author, researchers often ignore such a problem, probably because the most commonly used statistical software do not provide robust standard errors in FE models. Not surprisingly, this can lead to serious distortions in the estimates of such standard errors. He shows that the finite sample behavior of the estimator is mostly determined by the number of individuals, and not by the sample size 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    nT
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     .


                     Hansen (2007) analyzes the asymptotic properties of the CHC0 estimator when the number of individuals increases and the time dimension is fixed. The usual analysis is then extended to situations in which both the number of individuals and the number of time observations increase and to situations in which the number of time observations increases but the number of individuals is held fixed. He states conditions under which hypotheses tests based on CHC0 are asymptotically valid.


                     Stock and Watson (2008) proposed a bias-corrected version of the HC0 estimator which is consistent in FE models. Under certain circumstances, their estimator outperforms the CHC0 estimator. Their estimator can be extended to deal with autocorrelated errors.

It is well known that the HC0 estimator, albeit consistent, tends to underestimate the true variances in finite samples. A variant of HC0 that incorporates a finite-sample adjustment is the HC2 estimator. It is obtained by replacing

Our chief goal is to use the numerical integration algorithm developed by Imhof (1961) to compute the exact null distributions of different quasi-t statistics in order to compare them to their asymptotic counterpart. To that end, we need to to assume normality and write the test statistics are ratios of Gaussian quadratic forms. Our interest lies in testing

                      indicates that the probability is computed under the null hypothesis. The probability in (7) can be numerically evaluated using the numerical integration algorithm introduced by Imhof (1961).

We shall now use the Imhof algorithm to compute different the quasi-t statistics exact null distributions; the statistics use the consistent covariance matrix estimators discussed in Section 2. The computed distributions are then compared to their asymptotic counterpart. In order to do so, we shall assume normality.

The regression model used in our numerical evaluation is

                      were randomly obtained from two different distributions, namely: standard lognormal (data with leverage points) and standard uniform (no leverage point in the data). It is noteworthy that in PD models leverage points can appear in block or isolated. In this study, the CHC’s are assessed in the presence of isolated leverage points. Numerical experiments involving block leverage points were carried out and the results were similar to the ones report below. A thorough discussion of the different types of panel data contamination can be found in Bramati and Croux (2007).

Taken together, the results in the two tables show that the first order approximation used in the test becomes poorer when the strength of heteroskedasticity increases. The worst approximations at

                      are those for the null distributions of the CHC0 and CHC2 test statistics.

In what follows we shall plot the exact null distributions of the different test statistics (dashed lines) together with their asymptotic counterpart (solid lines). The closer the two curves, the better the asymptotic approximation used in the test.

                     Fig. 2
                      contains similar plots, but for leveraged data. As before, there is strong heteroskedasticity. Visual comparison between these panels and those in Fig. 1 reveals that the first order asymptotic approximation becomes less reliable for all test statistics, especially for the CHC0 and CHC2 quasi-t test statistics. It is noteworthy that the approximation to the CHC4 statistic null distribution remains fairly accurate even when the data contain atypical observations.

Inspection of Figs. 1 and 2 show that the introduction of leverage points clearly worsens the quality of the first order asymptotic approximation used in quasi-t testing inference. Notice that the distance between the dashed and continuous lines increases under leveraged data. The exact null distribution functions of the four test statistics evaluated at

                      (Table 2). The test based on the CHC4 estimator is the least sensitive to leverage points.

With constant error variances the CHC4 (CHC0) test remains the least (most) sensitive to the high leverage data points. As expected, the quality of the first order asymptotic approximations used in the quasi-t tests improves when the sample size increases. The tests also become less sensitive to high leverage observations.

                     . Notice that they are much closer to their asymptotic counterparts than when the tests statistics were based on unrestricted residuals. Overall, the CHCR0 null distribution is now the one that is best approximated by the limiting

                      distribution. The worst approximation is that for the CHCR4 null distribution. For instance, the corresponding CHCR4 probabilities are 
                        
                           0.9935

                     . When the data have no leverage point, the approximations are considerably more accurate and, as a consequence, the tests become less size distorted. For instance, with

The dashed lines are now above the solid curve which means that the tests are conservative. The poorest approximations are those for the null distributions of the CHCR3 and the CHCR4 quasi-t test statistics. The best approximation again is obtained using the CHCR0 test statistic.

The approximations tend to worsen when heteroskedasticity becomes stronger. It is noteworthy that the asymptotic approximation to the CHCR4 null distribution is poor. In particular, at

The conclusions we draw from these figures are in agreement with our previous conclusions. The main conclusion is that the test that most benefits from the use of restricted residuals is the CHCR0 test, especially under heteroskedasticity.

All numerical evaluations so far focused on the test statistics null distribution functions and were carried out using numerical integration. It is also important to evaluate the powers of the tests, that is, one minus the type II error probabilities. We have performed such an evaluation using Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical integration was not used because the results presented in Section 3 are no longer valid when the null hypothesis is not true. The number of Monte Carlo replications is 10,000, there is severe heteroskedasticity (

                     . The tests use exact (estimated from size simulations) critical values, so that all tests are forced to have the correct size. That is, we compare powers of tests that are not size distorted. The simulation was performed using the Ox matrix programming language. The estimated powers are presented in Table 7
                     .

The results show that the powers increase with the sample size, as expected. They also show that the tests whose statistics employ unrestricted residuals standard errors display similar performance. The same hold true for the tests based on restricted residuals. A final and important conclusion is that tests based test statistics constructed using restricted residuals clearly outperform those based on unrestricted residuals when the sample size is not large. That is, by using restricted residuals standard errors one reduces the type II error probability.

We have considered testing inference in FE regression models under heteroskedasticity of unknown form. In particular, we focused on the quasi-t tests whose test statistic use the Arellano estimator (CHC0) and also on similar tests based on alternative estimators (CHC2, CHC3 and CHC4). We wrote the test statistics as ratios of Gaussian quadratic forms and used numerical integration to compute their exact null distributions, which were then compared to the limiting null distribution. We constructed the heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimators using both unrestricted and restricted residuals. The numerical evaluations were carried out under both equal and unequal error variances. We considered regression structures with and without high leverage data points. We also report the results of Monte Carlo simulations that were carried out to evaluate the powers of the different tests. Our numerical evidence shows that CHC0 quasi-t testing inference can be quite unreliable in small samples. Our results also show that the most accurate asymptotic approximations are those used in the CHC4 (unrestricted residuals) and CHCR0 (restricted residuals) tests. We recommend that testing inference in FE regression models be based such quasi-t test statistics.

There are several directions for future research. Heteroskedasticity-consistent estimators based on residuals obtained from robust estimation of the FE regression parameters can be considered. It is also important to consider interval estimation, i.e., confidence intervals and regions that are asymptotically correct under heteroskedasticity of unknown form in FE regression models. Finally, it would also be important to obtain bias corrections that can applied to the different covariance matrix estimators since they can be quite biased in small samples.
