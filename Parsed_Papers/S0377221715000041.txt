                  We study various two-agent scheduling problems on a single machine with equal job processing times. The equal processing time assumption enables us to design new polynomial-time or faster-than-known optimization algorithms for many problems. We prove, however, that there exists a subset of problems for which the computational complexity remains 
                        NP
                     -hard. The set of hard problems includes different variations where the objective functions of the two agents are either minimizing the weighted sum of completion times or the weighted number of tardy jobs. For these problems, we present pseudo-polynomial time algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Scheduling models assuming equal processing time jobs address one of the most important and widely studied special cases in the scheduling literature. These models deal with the real life applications of mass production of similar items, or the repetitive manufacturing of the same product. When producing the same product in large quantities to satisfy different orders, these orders, and the jobs which form them, can have different due dates and costs while the job processing times are the same. Thus, manufacturing systems which allow a certain level of customization to otherwise identical products, often operate under the assumption of identical job processing times. These models can also be used for lower-bounding or approximating scheduling problems with general processing times by splitting the jobs into a pseudo-polynomial number of equal-length jobs. Due to the importance and relevance of this special case, a large number of papers consider various scheduling problems with job-independent processing times (see, e.g., Bansal, Kimbrel, and Sviridenko, 2006; Baptiste, 1999; Brucker and Kravchenko, 2008; Chen and Bulfin, 1990; Karhi and Shabtay, 2013; Lee, Leung, and Pinedo, 2011; Mosheiov and Oron, 2008; Mosheiov and Yovel, 2006; Shabtay, Arviv, Edan, and Stern, 2014; Van Den Akker, Diepen, and Hoogeveen, 2010).

Our main aim in this paper is to study the single machine scheduling problem with two competing agents and equal job processing times, and to provide the best possible complexity classification of different variants of the problem. We note that some variants of this special case have already been studied in the literature by Elvikis and T’kindt (2014) and Elvikis, Hamacher, and T’kindt (2011). In addition to providing a large set of polynomial time procedures for numerous problem settings, one of the most important findings of our paper relates to the complexity of single machine problems with equal processing time jobs. Although problems with equal processing time jobs on a single machine setting allow the construction of polynomial time procedures for most scheduling objectives and settings, when two competing agents are assumed some variants are proven to be 
                        NP
                     -hard. In addition, we identify several important relationships between different problem variants, and show that a large subset reduces to a bicriteria shortest path problem in an acyclic graph.

In the following three sections we present a general definition of the single machine scheduling problem with two competing agents, present a brief literature review and state our research objective.

Single machine scheduling problems with two competing agents can be stated as follows: We are given two sets of jobs

                        (2)) problem is solvable in polynomial time, we aim to find a faster optimization algorithm to optimally solve the special case of unit processing times.

                     Agnetis et al. (2004) prove the following important symmetry property.

                        Lemma 2
                        
                           (Agnetis et al., 2004). The 1||ε(F
                           (1)/F
                           (2)) and 1||ε(F
                           (2)/F
                           (1)) problems are equivalent in the sense that if we have an algorithm solving an instance of 1||ε(F
                           (1)/F
                           (2)), and Q is an upper for the solution value of the1||ε(F
                           (2)/F
                           (1)) problem, then the same algorithm can be used to solve 1||ε(F
                           (2)/F
                           (1)) by solving log Q instances of 1||ε(F
                           (1)/F
                           (2)).

In some cases, we may not have strong upper bounds for the value of the 1||ε(F
                     (2)/F
                     (1)) problem, but we know that there are only N different values possible for the value of F
                     (2), which can be computed in O(N) time and sorted in O(Nlog N) time. If we have an optimization algorithm for the 1||ε(F
                     (1)/F
                     (2)) problem, then due to the fact that the value of F
                     (1) is non-increasing for increasing upper bounds for F
                     (2), we can solve the 1||ε(F
                     (2)/F
                     (1)) problem by solving a series of O(log N) 1||ε(F
                     (1)/F
                     (2)) problems. Thus the following symmetry property holds as well.

                           (2)/F
                           (1)) problems are equivalent in the sense that if we have an O(X) time algorithm to solve the 1||ε(F
                           (1)/F
                           (2)) problem, and N is the number of different F
                           (2) 
                           values possible, then the same algorithm can be used repeatedly to solve the 1||ε(F
                           (2)/F

                      has a deadline Dj
                     , meaning that it cannot be scheduled in a processing slot later than Dj
                     . The question is whether we can schedule the jobs so that each job Jj
                      will be assigned to a processing slot that is not later than Dj
                     . We refer to this auxiliary problem by feasibility scheduling with deadlines and unit processing times, and provide the following procedure for its solution.

                           The single machine feasibility scheduling problem with deadlines and equal processing times can be solved in linear time and space by applying
                           Algorithm 1. Moreover, if for a given instance 
                           Algorithm 1 
                           provides a YES answer, then it outputs a schedule where the jobs are scheduled in a non-decreasing order of Dj, and each job is scheduled as close as possible to its deadline.

The correctness of the algorithm follows from the discussion preceding it. Constructing the sets A(k) for k = 1, …, n requires O(n
                           2) time; there exist O(n
                           1) time slots for which both conditions A(k) = ∅ and

                            hold; calculating j* takes O(n
                           1) time. Thus the claimed complexity follow.□

                     , or in an EDD order, respectively. For these cases, we can modify the above algorithm so that instead of solving a linear assignment problem, we assign the jobs of agent 1 to the remaining n
                     1 processing slots according to the corresponding ordering rule. Thus, the following corollary holds.

                      problem. The algorithm iteratively assigns jobs to processing slots starting from the last slot (j = n) down to the first (j = 1). At each iteration j, the algorithm simply assigns the yet unassigned job with the greatest weight among all jobs with due date not less than j (if it exists). At the end of the algorithm any unassigned job is assigned to the end of the schedule and gaps in the schedule can be eliminated by moving jobs to the left.

                            and DUB
                            are the maximum total cost and duration values of any path in the graph. These values are bounded from above by the values of the longest path in the graph with respect to the costs and durations, respectively. Thus, we have the following theorem.

There are many more algorithms to solve variations of the

                           . Among the possible algorithms, one can find a set of fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTASs), such as the ones presented by Ergun, Sinha, and Zhang (2002); Hassin (1992); Lorenz and Raz (2001).

                        (2)(π))) represent a permutation and its corresponding objective value for each of the two agents, and let Πe
                         be a set of triples that includes all Pareto-optimal points and a corresponding Pareto-optimal solution for each one of these points. Next, we present the definition of a succeeding Pareto-optimal point and then show how we can use this definition to construct set Πe

                        . Now, given a Pareto-optimal solution πi
                        , any pairwise interchange between any two jobs of the same agent in πi
                         will not lead to a new Pareto-optimal point (due to Lemma 5). Thus, in order to determine a succeeding Pareto-optimal solution we need to perform a set of pairwise interchanges between jobs belonging to different agents. It is easy to observe that, (i) any move of a single job that belongs to agent 2 one position to the left, will decrease F
                        (2) by 1 (independent of the identity of the job), and (ii) any move of a job that belongs to agent 1 one position to the right, will increase F
                        (1) by the job’s weight. Thus, given a Pareto-optimal permutation πi
                        , the succeeding Pareto-optimal permutation will be determined by performing a pairwise interchange between the least weighted job of agent 1 that has an adjacent job of agent 2, with this adjacent job. Accordingly, starting from π
                        1, we perform a series of pairwise interchanges between job

                         problem. Based on Smith’s WSPT rule (Smith, 1956), if θ ≥ 1, an optimal solution is obtained by scheduling all jobs of agent 2 prior to all jobs of agent 1, and if θ < 1, the an optimal solution is obtained by scheduling all jobs of agent 1 prior to all jobs of agent 2, where the internal sequence of the jobs of each agent can be arbitrary. Thus, we have the following corollary as well.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that π is an efficient permutation. We use induction to complete the proof. We prove that if there is an efficient permutation π with

                         problem does not satisfy Condition 2, as we cannot provide any indexing rule for agent 2’s jobs that could fix their order in an optimal permutation. However, by exploiting the fact that there exists an optimal permutation in which the on-time jobs of agent 2 are scheduled according to the EDD rule, while the tardy jobs are scheduled at the end in an arbitrary order (see Lemma 6), we can use a slightly different reduction to show that the

                                 1, n
                                 2, l) for l = 0, …, n
                                 2, we include a single arc to the destination vertex (n

It is easy to observe that any path from node (0, 0, 0) to node (n
                        1, n
                        2, l) in G = (V, E) represents a feasible schedule with l jobs included in E
                        2. Moreover, the total cost and duration of such a path correspond to the F
                        (1) and F
                        (2) values, respectively. The following theorem now follows from the results of Hassin (1992) for the bicriteria

                         and from the fact that G = (V, E) includes

We study variants of the two competing agents scheduling problem on a single machine, where all job processing times are equal. The variants differ by the objective function used by each agent and the type of bicriteria analysis under consideration. A summary of the results derived appears in Table 1, where ONPH (or ONPC) stand for ordinary 
                        NP
                     -hard (or 
                        NP
                     -complete) and n replaces n

                     2. The two main sets of results that we found to be more interesting are:

                        
                           •
                           
                              Set 1: Problems that are 
                                 NP
                              -hard (or

                              Set 2: Problems that are 
                                 NP
                              -hard when processing times are arbitrary but solvable in polynomial time when processing times are all equal.

In this paper we prove that all variants of problems

Future research of the two-agent scheduling problem with equal processing times may include objective functions not considered here, such as the total weighted tardiness, and different machine settings, such as flow shop, job shop and open shop.
