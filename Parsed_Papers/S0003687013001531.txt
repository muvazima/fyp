                  The present work is dedicated to the study of cold thermal environments in food distribution industrial units through a subjective assessment based on an individual questionnaire which aims to describe the working conditions of employees often exposed to cold. The survey was carried out in Portugal and the sample consists of 1575 valid responses obtained in 61 industrial units. The results show that the food distribution activity sector is characterized by a female population (78.1%) and by a young work force (63.4% of the workers are less than 35 years old). Despite the availability of cold protective clothing (52.8% of the workers indicate one garment) its characteristics require improvements. In addition almost 1/3 of the respondents consider the thermal environment cold and 79.6% of the workers report that working in the cold is harder in wintertime. The results also highlight that 37.3% of the workers report having health problems.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The occupational exposure to extreme thermal environments, either hot or cold, represents an issue that should be duly considered due to the very significant number of workers involved. Based on a field survey carried out in Portugal, this work is dedicated to the study of cold thermal environments. The occupational cold exposure, assessed in terms of the Required Clothing Insulation Index (IREQ) (ISO 11079, 2007) developed by Holmér (1984), was first characterized by Oliveira et al. (2008) in an extensive study that has quantified the thermal conditions of six activity sectors mainly in food production, conservation and distribution industrial units. This study, based on the IREQ index, shows that in Portugal the number of people working in cold environments is much more important than was initially predicted.

However, it is widely recognized that the activities developed in both moderate and extreme thermal environments should be evaluated from multiple perspectives and subjective assessments are being looked at with growing interest. Cohidon et al. (2009) studied the perceived health status and psychosocial factors of meat industry employees in France through a postal survey that included 3000 workers. Yasuo et al. (2010) performed a cross-sectional study involving 991 workers in 126 kitchen facilities in Japan to evaluate subjective thermal strain in different working environments using a self-reporting questionnaire survey and subjective judgment scales. The interrelationships of subjective assessments (thermal sensation, perceptions and preferences for individual and climate parameters) as well as their connections with the prevailing thermal conditions were analyzed through interviews to 967 visitors of Szeged, Hungary, by Kántor et al. (2012). Arezes et al. (2013) tested thermal comfort of trekking boots through objective and subjective evaluations and Boschman et al (2013) assessed the psychosocial work environment and mental health among construction workers using a questionnaire. The importance of the subjective surveys is also raised by international standards, namely in the case of cold thermal environments (ISO 15743, 2008; ISO 28802, 2012).

The increasing awareness of the importance of this tool lead the authors to a new and detailed approach that resulted in an additional study focused in a subjective assessment of the occupational exposure to cold thermal environments. Hence, the present contribution represents a complementary analysis of a previous study (Oliveira et al., 2008) but the aim is now restricted to food distribution industrial units. Despite being focused on Portuguese workers, the present analysis can be of potential interest and regarded as a valid contribution to other countries and industrial activities.

The present survey was carried out in large and medium size supermarkets owned by an important economic group, which has been formally invited to participate in this study and has immediately accepted and encouraged the project. This active cooperation included the participation of all the industrial units of the group distributed all over Portugal main land. This full cover of the territory and the participation of 61 industrial units turned into the first large characterization of the working conditions through individual questionnaires.

@&#METHODS@&#

The economic group that participated in the present study owns 68 industrial units, 14 large and 54 medium supermarkets, spread out through all provinces of Portugal main land (Table 1
                        ). The questionnaire was distributed to all workers that performed activities in the cold (2480), but only 1575 inquiries with validated answers (63.5% of the population) were collected. All the workers anonymously and voluntarily participated to the survey and did not receive any recompense.

Therefore, the sample represents very well the population that works in cold thermal environments in the supermarkets of the target group, and is also supposed to roughly represent the whole Portuguese population of workers of the sector, perhaps with some bias to the best practices given the prestige of the target group.

The questionnaire is formally divided in Parts I (Questions I.1–3) and II (Questions II.1–24) and its structure is shown in Table 2
                        . To complete the questionnaire a period of 15 min was considered to be sufficient.

In particular, Question I.3, on the clinical history, is based on ISO standard 12894 (2001) which lists the health effects, both physiological changes and disorders that may arise as a result of cold or hot exposures. For the characterization of the thermal environment of workplaces, ISO 10551 (1995) was taken into account. Questions I.1–3 and II.1–8 are multiple choice questions, while Questions II.9–24 are based on a 10-degree judgment scale. The questionnaire was aimed to describe the working conditions as perceived by the respondents.

The present statistical analysis was based on SPSS and Excel softwares. A discrete random variable is associated to each question of the Questionnaire; e.g., variable I.1 (Age of worker) is associated with Question I.1. The following statistical tools were used to process each variable or group of variables: i) unbiased mean and standard deviation estimators; iia) probability and distribution functions; iib) ad hoc pseudo probability functions; iiia) marginal probability functions; iiib) differential marginal probability functions taking one of them as a reference; iiic) differential marginal probability functions taking the simple probability function of the base variable as a reference; iv) joint probability functions of a pair of variables; and v) linear regression of one variable on another one, including the respective coefficient of correlation. When applying any of the former tools to a particular variable (or pair of variables), the inquiries with no valid answer(s) to the pertinent question(s) are withdrawn from the base sample of n = 1575 inquiries.

All processed statistical data are supported by an extensive set of figures which are available on request. However, in the paper only a small subset is presented, either for general illustrative purposes or because they contain significant data.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The age of workers (variable I.1) is divided into five classes. The mode class of the probability function spans from 26 to 35 years old and gathers 40.6% of the workers. The mean age is estimated in 32.7 years. While 22.8% of the workers are 18–25 years old, only 5.9% are 46–55 years old.

Regarding the sex (variable I.2), 78.1% of the workers are women. The mean age of women is 33.3 years while for men is 30.7 years. In accordance, the marginal probability function of the age of women is 12% higher than the one of men in the 36–45 years old class, and 12% lower in the 18–25 years old class.

Variable II.2 (Length in the activity) is divided into six classes: less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, 10–20 years and more than 20 years. Picking up the central point of each class, the mean value of variable II.2 is estimated in 5.6 years. Only 14.7% of the workers have more than 10 years of activity while 40.8% have less than 3 years and 17.1% even less than 1 year. Fig. 1
                         shows that in the class of workers most recently admitted there are significant percentages of workers with 26–35 years old (34%) and even with 36–45 years old (15%). Moreover, in the class of workers admitted just 1–3 years ago, 25% have 36–45 years old and 6% have more than 46 years old.

Regarding the workplace (variable II.1), 76.9% of the workers carry out the activity exclusively in one workplace, 13.6% in two, 6.2% in three and only 3.2% in more than three. The average number of workplaces per worker is 1.4. In Fig. 2
                           , the probability function of variable II.1 (computed from the sample of disaggregated multiple answers to Question II.1, which totalizes n′ = 2184 workplaces of n = 1570 workers) is compared with the pseudo probability function expressed per equivalent worker working in full time in the workplace, computed with the following formulae:

The fractions f
                           ij are estimated assuming that working time is uniformly distributed among the various workplaces. When one of these workplaces is the Cold Chamber, the former hypothesis is corrected ad hoc by taking into account the answer of the worker to Question II.8 (Time spent in the coldest workplace). Fig. 2 shows that the workplaces with the most equivalent full time workers are the Delicatessen (20.4%) and Fish Market (17.0%) and the ones with the least workers are the Manufacturing Zone (0.1%) and Meat Cutting up Room (0.4%).

The marginal probability functions of variable II.1 (Workplace) for women and men (variable I.2), based on the sample of disaggregated multiple answers to Question II.1 (with dimension n′ = 2184), show that women work notably more than men in the Delicatessen (+16%) and Fish Market (+16%), but only slightly less in all other workplaces, particularly in the Fruits and Vegetables (−7%).

In a subjective scale of 10 levels, the mean ± standard deviation of variable II.16 (Physical demand of work) is 7.0 ± 2.6. To discriminate the workplace (variable II.1) in respect to variable II.16, marginal probability functions are used, (vd. Fig. 3
                           , not all workplaces are shown for lack of space). The workplace most physically demanding is the Manufacturing Zone (8.3 ± 1.9), and the least demanding is the Expedition/Reception (5.8 ± 2.6).

The mean ± standard deviation of variable II.17 (Repetitive character of the activity) is 7.2 ± 2.9. The cross correlation of variables II.17 and II.1 (Workplace) shows that, as in the case of variable II.16 (Physical demand), the most and least repetitive activities are the Manufacturing Zone (8.0 ± 2.1) and Expedition/Reception (5.2 ± 2.8), respectively. The joint probability function of variables II.16 and II.17 is represented in Fig. 4
                            through a bubbles chart. Notice that 32% of the workers report rather high subjective levels of physical demand (II.16 ≥ 8) and repetition (II.17 ≥ 8) in their work. Moreover, the linear regression of II.17 (y) on II.16 (x), y = 7.24 + 0.40·x (ρ = 0.35), puts in evidence a small positive association between both variables. In the case of moderate environments, the relationship between repetitive tasks and musculoskeletal disorders is well known. The results obtained in the present study clearly highlight the occurrence of repetitive activities. Thus, if musculoskeletal complaints are observed, those may be due to the combined effects of cold exposure and repetitive work (Pienimäki, 2002; Mäkinen and Hassi, 2009) which may result in an increased occurrence of carpal tunnel Syndrome (Yagev et al., 2007), increased muscle strain and fatigue (Oksa et al., 2002).

Two variables of the questionnaire characterize the number (II.6) and duration (II.7) of the rest periods. Regarding variable II.6, 49.4% of the workers do not have any rest periods, 47.3% have one or two and only 3.3% have more than two rest periods. The average number of rest periods per worker is 0.9. Fig. 5
                           a highlights the difference between the marginal probability functions of variable II.16 (physical demand of the activity) for II.6 (number of rest periods) and shows that the physical demand of the activity does not determine or even influence the number of rest periods (e.g., marginal frequencies of the higher levels of physical demand [II.16 = 7, 9, 10] are lower among workers taking one or two rest periods than among workers taking no rest periods, and vice-versa). For activities performed in more than one workplace, Fig. 5b shows that periods of 1–3 h in the coldest workplace (e.g., the cold chambers) seem to induce or allow the worker to take a rest period. On the contrary, periods longer than 5 h tend to discourage it.

Notwithstanding is the fact that more workers (915) answered the Question II.7, on the duration of the rest periods, than those (744) that report taking at least one rest period (workers for which II.6 > 0), 94.0% of the workers take rest periods of less than 30 min and 77.6% even of less than 15 min. The mean duration of a rest period is 17 min.

The subjective assessment of cold in the workplace (variable II.19) has an average score of 6.2 ± 2.6. The mildest workplaces on cold are the Bakery/Confectionary (4.8 ± 2.5) and Manufacturing Zone (5.1 ± 1.9), and the hardest ones are the Meat Cutting up Room (7.4 ± 3.1) and Butchery (7.4 ± 2.3). Curiously, the Cold Chambers are not considered the coldest workplaces (6.7 ± 2.6).

The frequency of draughts in the workplace (variable II.21) has a score of 6.3 ± 3.0. The workplace with the least draughts is the Milk-food Products (5.5 ± 3.1) and the one with the most is the Expedition/Reception (7.9 ± 2.6). During the field survey it was observed that the majority of the forklifts used in large cold stores are open. As driving creates a relative wind speed the cooling of the body is increased which may be particularly hard in cold thermal environments (Holmér et al., 2008). The joint probability function of variables II.21 and II.19 (Cold) shows that 22% of the respondents work in thermally hard environments with subjective scores of both cold and draught equal or higher than 8 in 10. Besides, the linear regression of II.21 (y) on II.19 (x), y = 6.28 + 0.39·x (ρ = 0.34), shows a small positive association between both variables.

The average subjective score given to variable II.22 (Workplace colder in winter than in the rest of the year) is rather high, 7.6 ± 2.4. In agreement with this, the joint probability function of variables II.22 and II.19 (The thermal environment of the workplace is cold?) shows that, for any level of question II.19, the latter tends to be colder in winter. Moreover, 32% of the respondents carry out their activity in workplaces that, despite being usually rather cold (II.19 ≥ 8), become even colder in winter (II.22 ≥ 8). In fact, the linear regression of II.22 (y) on II.19 (x), y = 7.62 + 0.45·x (ρ = 0.47), puts in evidence a significant positive association between both variables.

The probability and distribution functions of variable II.8 (Time spent in the coldest workplace) [hours] are represented in Fig. 6
                           . The mean of II.8 is 2.2 h. However, these data should be interpreted with caution because, among the 1369 workers that answered to Question II.8, only 362 acknowledged to work in more than one workplace (Question II.1).

Despite the seven protective measures against cold listed in Question II.4, 93.6% of the workers choose only one and 5.8% two. The mean is 1.1 measures per worker. These results highlight that more information about physiological and subjective reactions, health aspects, risk of accidents and protective measures, including clothing and first aid, must be given to the workers associated to activities in the cold (Holmér et al., 2008). Guidelines for preventive measures and management of cold related risks are also being raised by international standards (Anttonen et al., 2009) and ISO Standards 15743 (2008) and 28802 (2012) represent good examples. Analyzing the answers per worker (1556), which gives place to a non-normalized but more interesting distribution than the analysis of answers per measure (1665), the four options that are most often chosen are: (1) Add more clothes (80.0%), (6) None (10.5%), (4) Increase the physical activity (8.7%) and (5) Go to a warmer environment (4.6%).

Variable II.5 (Available protective garments) allows a discriminating study of measure (1) of variable II.4. Regarding the number of garments, 52.8% of the workers use just one, 24.3% use two, 13.2% use three and 6.4% use four. In average, each worker uses 1.8 pieces of cloth. Of the eight pieces of garment discriminated in Question II.5, the five that are used most often (non normalized distribution per worker, in a total of 1463 workers) are: (5) the Waistcoat (64.1%), (4) the Coat (50.9%), (1) the Gloves (31.0%), (6) the Trousers (14.9%) and (2) the Boots (13.0%). Independent cross correlation analyses between variable I.2 (Gender) and variables II.1 (Workplace) and II.5 (Cold protective garments available), allow the following conclusions: i) marginally, women use more the Waistcoat (+6.4%) and less the Coat (−7.2%) than men; ii) the Gloves are most used in the Milk-food Products (+7.9% than the generality of workers/workplaces) and least used in the Delicatessen (−9.0%); iii) the Boots are most used in the Fish Market (+9.3%); iv) the Coat is most used in the Expedition/Reception (+15.0%) and least used in the Meat Cutting up Room (−13.3%); v) the Waistcoat is most used in the Meat Cutting up Room (+26.0%) and least used in the Expedition/Reception (−19.8%) and vi) the Trousers are least used in the Meat Cutting up Room (−8.1%).

The critical weather station (variable II.3) is winter for 79.6% of the workers and summer for almost all the rest (16.7%). A cross correlation analysis between variables II.22 (Workplace colder in winter than in the rest of the year) and II.3 shows that, for II.22 > 7, the marginal probability function of II.22 is significantly higher when the critical weather station is winter than when it is summer, the differences increasing consistently with II.22, from +5.3% to +17.9%. For II.22 ≤ 7, the situation is reversed, with differences ranging from −1.6% to −8.0%. This suggests that cold is the variable determining the hardness of the working conditions in winter.

The average sensation of cold (variable II.9) is 5.5 ± 2.7. The joint probability function of variables II.9 and II.19 (Subjective assessment of the “objective” cold level of the workplace) puts in evidence that P(II.9 > II.19)−P(II.9 < II.19) = −26%, which means that workers show a bias to say that the thermal environment is colder (II.19) than their cold sensation (II.9). Two alternative/complementary causes that could be interesting to investigate are: i) the effectiveness of protective garments; and ii) the workers acclimatization to cold. Nevertheless, as expected, the linear regression of II.9 (y) on II.19 (x), y = 5.53 + 0.61·x (ρ = 0.58), shows a positive association of both variables. The difference between the marginal probability functions of variable II.9 for women and men (variable I.2) highlights that women are more sensitive to cold than man (mean value of II.9 is 5.7 for women against 5.0 for men). The workplace where the marginal cold sensation is the lowest is Fruits and Vegetables (4.5 ± 2.5) while the highest corresponds to the Meat Cutting up Room (6.9 ± 2.8)).

The mean value of variable II.10 (Tolerance to the cold in the workplace) is 5.7 ± 2.4. The linear regression of variable II.9 (Cold sensation, y) on II.10 (x), y = 5.55–0.12∙x (ρ = −0.10), shows a rather small negative association between both variables. The negative sign of the slope is reasonable because workers that tolerate better the cold (high II.10) should also feel less cold (low II.9). Fig. 7
                           a refers to the difference between the marginal probability functions of variable II.10 for women and men (variable I.2) and shows that the tolerance of women to cold is lower than the one of men (mean of II.10 for women and men is 5.6 and 6.0, respectively). Fig. 7b highlights that, generally, workers with less years of activity (variable II.2) tolerate better the cold than veterans with 10–20 years of activity.

The score of the subjective level of transpiration (variable II.15) is 5.7 ± 2.6. Variable II.15 (y) shows a reasonable positive association with variable II.16 (Physical demand of work, x): y = 5.69 + 0.44∙x (ρ = 0.35). The consequence is that 45% of the workers have relatively hard physical conditions (II.15 and II.16 > 5) and 21% very hard physical conditions (II.15 and II.16 ≥ 8).

Variable II.11 (Comfort in the workplace) has a score of 6.3 ± 2.4. The correlation coefficient (ρ = 0.08) between variables II.11 and II.15 (Transpiration) shows that transpiration does not seem to affect the sensation of comfort in the workplace, although 52% of the workers report subjective transpiration levels higher than 5. In agreement, 32% of the workers feel comfortable (II.11 > 5) despite sweating often (II.15 > 5), while, for the same levels of transpiration, only 9% feel uncomfortable (II.11 < 5). In addition, the physical demand of the activity (variable II.16) does not seem to influence the comfort (ρ = −0.03), although 75% of the workers give subjective scores above 5 to variable II.16. In fact, 17% of the workers feel very comfortable (II.11 ≥ 8) despite the equally high levels of physical demand of their work (II.16 ≥ 8). On the contrary, as expected, the sensation of cold (variable II.9, x′) and the draughts (variable II.21, x″) are negatively associated with comfort (II.11, y), as demonstrated by the respective linear regression analyses: y = 6.26–0.24∙x′ (ρ′ = −0.26) and y = 6.27–0.10∙x″ (ρ″ = −0.12).

The tolerability of the thermal environment of the workplace (variable II.20) has a global score of 6.0 ± 2.1. There is a reasonable positive association between variables II.20 (y) and II.10 (Tolerance to the cold, x), y = 6.01 + 0.36∙x and (ρ = 0.41). Moreover, 10% of the workers consider the thermal environment tolerable (II.20 > 5) despite being themselves few tolerant to cold (II.10 < 5), while only 5% consider the thermal environment less tolerable (II.20 < 5) although they are themselves rather tolerant to cold (II.10 > 5). The positive association between variables II.20 (y) and II.11 (Comfort in the workplace, x) is even higher (y = 6.01 + 0.39∙x and ρ = 0.45), which, again, is quite reasonable. The independent linear regression analyses of variable II.20 (y) on variables II.9 (Cold sensation, x′) and II.21 (Draughts frequency, x″) show a small reasonable negative association between II.20 and II.9 (y = 6.02–0.15∙x′ and ρ′ = −0.19) and the independency of II. 20 and II.21 (ρ″ = −0.06).

Variable II.24 (Global satisfaction with the thermal ambient of the workplace) has an overall score of 5.9 ± 2.3. Independent control linear regression analyses of variable II.24 (y) on variables II.11 (Comfort sensation, x′) and II.20 (Tolerability of thermal environment, x″) confirm the existence of reasonable positive associations between both pairs of variables: y = 5.85 + 0.42·x′ (ρ′ = 0.45) and y = 5.85 + 0.52·x″ (ρ″ = 0.49). Finally, independent causal correlation analyses between variable II.24 and variables I.1 (Age) and II.2 (Years of activity), lead to the following conclusions (Fig. 8
                           a,b): i) the younger the workers are, generally, the more satisfied (II.24 = 6–8) or the less unsatisfied (II.24 = 1–3) with the thermal environment than tend to be relative to the oldest respondents (with 46–55 years old; the striking anomaly for II.24 = 10 is supposed to be statistically non significant due to the small number of workers involved); and ii) a similar, however less clear effect is observed for the association of variables II.2 and II.24, i.e., workers with less years of activity seem to be more satisfied or less unsatisfied with the thermal ambient than veterans (>10 years of activity).

Variable II.23 (Difficulty of acclimatization to the workplace after a prolonged absence), has a score of 5.4 ± 2.8. Women complain more than men on this regard (mean is 5.6 for women and 4.8 for men). Interestingly, while young workers (variable I.1) show more difficulty of acclimatization than the oldest, with more than 45 years old, workers with less years of activity (variable II.2), particularly below three years, seem, on the contrary, to have less difficulty of acclimatization than veterans with more than 10 years of activity. The workplace where the acclimatization is most difficult is the Milk-food Products (6.0 ± 2.8) while the one where it is less difficult is the Bakery/Confectionary (4.7 ± 2.6), which is in agreement with similar analyses for variables II.9, 10, 20 and 24.

The variable parallel to II.24 for the rest place is II.18 (Satisfaction with the thermal environment of the rest place). As expected, II.18 has a higher score (6.4 ± 2.6) than II.24 (5.7 ± 2.6). Fig. 9
                            shows that workers that take no rest periods tend to be slightly more unsatisfied (for II.18 ≤ 5) or less satisfied (for II.18 ≥ 8) with the thermal environment of the rest place than the generality of workers, which is reasonable. The former tendency, though milder, is inverted for workers that take rest periods.

The global subjective score of variable II.12 (Adequacy of the cold protective garments) is 5.5 ± 2.8. The positive association between variables II.12 and II.13 (Sufficiency of the cold protective garments) is very high, as shown by the linear regression analysis of II.12 (y) on II.13 (x): y = 5.47 + 0.80∙x (ρ = 0.82). A control correlation analysis between variables II.12 (y) and II.9 (Cold sensation, x) puts in evidence: i) a reasonable negative association between both variables (y = 5.48–0.26∙x and ρ = −0.25); ii) that 19% of the workers find the protective garments adequate (II.12 > 5) but, nevertheless, feel cold (II.9 > 5), which is difficult to understand; and iii) that 10% of the workers do not feel cold (II.9 < 5) but do not consider the protective clothes adequate (II.12 < 5) either, which is also puzzling though less significant than ii). In addition, the difference between the marginal probability functions of variable II.12 for women and men (variable I.2) demonstrates that women consider the protective garments less adequate than men.

The scores of variables II.13 (Sufficiency of the protective garments) and II.14 (Comfort of the protective garments) are 5.1 ± 2.8 and 5.4 ± 2.6, respectively. Two control correlation analyses were performed for variable II.14 (y). The first one, with variable II.4 (Protective measures adopted against cold) = (Dress more clothes), shows no association between both variables. The second one, with variable II.11 (Comfort in the workplace, x), shows that: i) both variables are positively associated (y = 5.39 + 0.52∙x and ρ = 0.48), as expected; but ii) 14% of the workers feel comfortable (II.11 > 5) though they consider the protective garments uncomfortable (II.14 < 5). Fig. 10
                            shows that, neglecting a small anomaly for II.14 = 9, there is a bias of women to consider the protective garments less comfortable than men. Finally, although no correlation (ρ = −0.03) is found between variables II.14 and II.16 (Physical demand of work), 34% of the workers find the protective garments comfortable (II.14 > 5) although they have high levels of physical demand (II.16 > 5), which is positive. Unfortunately, 27% of the workers have equally physically demanding work (II.16 > 5) and consider them uncomfortable (II.14 < 5).

Of the 37.3% of workers reporting health problems (variable I.3), 88.1% of them mention only one type of problem and 10.2% two. In average, there are 1.1 health problems per worker. Fig. 11
                           a shows the prevalence of the typologies Other (e.g., rheumatologic) and Respiratory.

Independent discriminative cross correlations between variables I.3 and I.1 (Age), I.2 (Gender) and II.1 (Workplace) allow the following conclusions: i) the marginal occurrences of Cardiovascular and Metabolic problems tend to increase with the age of workers, while the Respiratory problems tend to decrease (Fig. 11c); ii) Respiratory problems are dominant in the youngest workers, although they are always important in any age (Fig. 11c); iii) above 26 years old, the typology Other becomes marginally dominant (Fig. 11c); iv) the highest marginal frequency of Cardiovascular problems occurs between the 36 and 45 years old, the Respiratory problems between the 26 and 35 years old and the Metabolic and Other problems between the 26 and 45 years old (Fig. 11d); v) men tend to have more Respiratory problems than women, while Other health problems prevail more among women (Fig. 11b); vi) Respiratory and Other health problems prevail in all workplaces; vii) the workplace with the highest marginal incidence of Cardiovascular problems is the Expedition/Reception although it is neither the most physically demanding (variable II.16) nor the one in which the workers feel most cold (variable II.9); and viii) the workplaces with the highest marginal prevalence of Other health problems are the Meat Cutting up Room and Other.

To investigate potential causes behind variable I.3, cross correlation analyses with many other variables were performed. The following conclusions are highlighted: I) the marginal frequency of Respiratory problems decreases with the years of activity (variable II.2), in agreement with observation i) above on the influence of the age of worker, while the Other problems increases (Fig. 11e); II) the increase of the time spent in the coldest workplace (variable II.8) seems to reduce Cardiovascular (for II.8 = 5–8 Hours) and Respiratory (for II.8 = 3–5 Hours) problems but to increase Metabolic (for II.8 = 3–5 Hours) and Other (for II.8 = 5–8 Hours) problems (Fig. 11f); III) no correlations are detected between the occurrence of either Cardiovascular or Metabolic problems and the cold in the workplace (variable II.19), not either between the occurrence of any type of health problem and draughts (variable II.21); and IV) generically and understandably, all typologies of health problems exhibit a mild negative association with variable II.13 (Sufficiency of cold protective garments), in the sense that workers with health problems tend to consider the protective garments more insufficient (workers with Respiratory problems voted 8% more in the least score II.13 = 1 than the overall set of workers) or less sufficient than the generality of workers.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The present paper addresses the occupational exposure to cold thermal environments in the food distribution activity sector through a subjective analysis. The results consider the conditions observed in Portuguese plants and the outcomes are then more important to the workers concerned. However, the methodology that was applied in the survey is meaningful for any occupational hygienist interested in cold stress studies. In addition, since the conservation temperatures are about the same in all countries, the main conclusions of the present work can be generalized and considered valid in any country.

The food distribution sector is characterized by a young population with a short-length professional career. Surprisingly, it was observed that the cold exposure required in this activity sector is generally guaranteed by women. Almost 1/3 of the respondents consider that the thermal environment, despite being usually rather cold, it is even colder in winter. Workers with less years of activity seem to be more satisfied with the thermal ambient than veterans with more than 10 years of activity. In addition, the results highlight that the average feeling of cold and the occurrence of Metabolic and Other Health problems are slightly higher among women. The health problems reported, all listed in ISO standard 12894 (2001), should promote an active medical supervision of individuals continuously exposed to cold environments. Regardless the wide distribution of cold protective clothing, further improvements are still required, a matter that is pointed out by women which consider the protective garments less adequate than men. Finally, this study provides guidelines to improve working conditions and to adopt preventive measures and good practices which are aimed to reduce the health problems related with cold environments.
