                  Most of the existing methods for dam behavior modeling require a persistent set of input parameters. In real-world applications, failures of the measuring equipment can lead to a situation in which a selected model becomes unusable because of the volatility of the independent variables set. This paper presents an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling that is based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and is optimized for given conditions using genetic algorithms (GA). Throughout an evolutionary process, the system performs real-time adjustment of regressors in the MLR model according to currently active sensors. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a case study of modeling the Bocac dam (at the Vrbas River located in the Republic of Srpska), whereby an MLR model of the dam displacements has been optimized for periods when the sensors were malfunctioning. Results of the analysis have shown that, under real-world circumstances, the proposed methodology outperforms traditional regression approaches.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Dams have strong interactions with environmental, hydraulic and geomechanical factors, such as air and water temperature, water level, pore pressure, and rock deformability, each of which influences the structural behavior of the dam [1]. To describe and predict the structural behavior of dams, over the past decades, a number of deterministic, statistical and hybrid mathematical models have been developed.

For a long time, statistical models have been applied to dam safety monitoring to find out the contribution of external loads to dam displacements [2]. A number of statistical models based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and their advanced forms such as hierarchical regression, stepwise multiple regression, robust regression, ridge regression, and partial least squares regression have been shown to be more or less successful in dam modeling [3]. The advantages of the statistical models are the simplicity of formulation, the speed of execution and the availability of any type of correlation between independent and responses variables. In contrast, deterministic models require solving differential equations, for which closed form solutions could be difficult or impossible to obtain [4]. Therefore, many models that are based on numerical methods, such as the finite element method, have been developed as well [5]. Recently, numerical and statistical methods have been enriched with various heuristics from the artificial intelligence (AI) domain, creating hybrid models that combine their advantages. Some of these artificial intelligence techniques and heuristic algorithms are artificial neural networks (ANN) [6], genetic algorithms (GA) [7], support vector machines (SVM) [8], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) [9,10], Monte Carlo simulations [11], the modified complex method [12] and the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) [13].

Recently, Rankovic et al. [9] presented a study in which the objective was to develop an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict the radial displacements of Bocac arch dam. ANFIS models have been proposed as an alternative approach for an evaporation estimation of the Yuvacik Dam [10]. In his paper, Mata [6] presented a comparison between MLR and ANN models for the characterization of dam behavior under environmental loads for the Alto Rabagao arch dam. In their study, Wang et al. [14] investigated several Artificial Intelligence techniques for modeling monthly river flow discharge time series, which included an ANN approach, an ANFIS technique, GP models and support vector machines (SVM), and compared their performance with traditional time series modeling techniques, such as autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models. To improve prediction, support vector regression (SVR) upgraded with GAs is often combined with existing ANN and ARMA techniques [8]. Hybrid algorithms and their applications in prediction and optimization are also presented in a number of papers. Gholizadeh and Seyedpoor [15] used a hybrid methodology with a combination of metaheuristics (GA and Particle Swarm Optimization-PSO) and neural networks to propose an efficient soft computing approach to achieve optimal shape design of arch dams that were subjected to natural frequency constraints. There are several recent studies that describe applications of AIA techniques, which imitate the function of the natural immune system. For example, Xi et al. [16] proposed an immune statistical model to resolve the data analysis problems of dam horizontal crest upstream–downstream displacements.

The above-mentioned methods play a crucial role in modeling structural dam behavior. However, all of the methods require a persistent set of input parameters, i.e., all of the measurements must be available during the entire examined period. In real-world applications, failures of the measuring equipment can lead to a situation in which the selected model becomes unusable because of volatility of the independent variables. In this paper, the concept of an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling (ASDBM) that is resistant to the variations in the set of measured variables is presented. This system is based on a multiple linear regression model of a dam, the form of which is optimized for the given conditions using genetic algorithms.

The adaptive system for the generation of optimized models of dam behavior is a hybrid solution that is based on linear regression models and genetic algorithms. The theoretical background of the applied methods is given in the following sections.

An MLR is a method that is used to model a linear relationship between a dependent variable (a predictant) and one or more independent variables (predictors). The general form of an MLR can be written as follows:

Genetic algorithms are search techniques that are inspired by the theory of natural selection, in which strong species have a greater opportunity to survive and pass their genes onto future generations via reproduction [18]. GAs are probabilistic algorithms that maintain a population of individuals, P(t)=
                        x
                        1(t),…,
                        xn
                        (t), for the iteration (generation) t, where each individual represents a potential solution to the problem. Each solution xi
                        (t) is evaluated to quantify its fitness. Subsequently, a new population (iteration t
                        +1) is formed by selecting better individuals from those of generation t. In GA terminology, a solution vector x
                        ∈
                        X is called an individual or chromosome and corresponds to a unique solution x in the solution space. The chromosomes are made of discrete units called genes. Each gene controls one or more features of the chromosome. In this paper, genes are assumed to be binary digits, according to the original implementation of GAs by Holland.

GA uses two operators to generate new solutions from the existing solutions: crossover and mutation. In crossover, two chromosomes, called parents, are combined together to form new chromosomes, called offspring. By iteratively applying the crossover operator, genes of good chromosomes are expected to appear more frequently in the population, which eventually leads to convergence to an overall optimal solution. The mutation operator introduces random changes into the characteristics of chromosomes, for the purpose of reintroducing genetic diversity back into the population and assisting the search to escape from local optima.

Reproduction involves selecting a set of chromosomes that will survive into the next generation. There are different selection procedures in GAs depending on how the individual fitnesses are used. Proportional selection, ranking, and tournament selection are the most popular selection procedures. The procedure of a generic GA [19] is given in Fig. 1
                        .

After the random generation and evaluation of initial solutions, the population is subjected to the iterative process of mating (crossover), mutation, evaluation and selection for the next iteration (generation). The iterative process is terminated when there is a satisfactory quality of the solutions or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Among the main problems in real-time applications of predictive models are irregular operations of the measuring equipment, which lead to an impermanent set of available measured variables. The goal of the developed ASDBM system is to achieve an automatic real-time generation of the optimized predictive regression model that is robust to possible changes in the set of input parameters.

The ASDBM is a hybrid system that is based on multiple linear regression and genetic algorithms. The core of the system is a module for dam behavior prediction using MLR. As mentioned above, regression models are not tolerant of changes in the set of input variables. Therefore, a module for adaptive generation of the optimized regression model according to currently available measurements has been developed. According to genetic algorithm theory, the determination of the optimal number and form of the regressors in an MLR model is considered to be an optimization problem in which each MLR model represents an individual in the population. The fitness of every single individual is determined by the accuracy and complexity of the model that represents that individual.


                        Fig. 2
                         shows a schematic view of the developed system. The structural dam behavior (1) can be considered to be a black box that transforms the vector of input variables X into the vector of output variables Y. This system is approximately described by the mathematical model (13) based on MLR, which produces a prediction of the structural dam behavior 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Y
                                 
                                 
                                    ^
                                 
                              
                           
                         given the known input variables. Feedback (15) performs a comparison (14) between the measurements and model results, and provides possible preventive actions in the case of a significant deviation.

To create the learning and testing data sets (8) for the MLR model, all of the significant measurements (e.g., H – headwater, P – amount of precipitations, TA
                         – air temperature, TS
                         – structure temperature) as well as the output variables are stored in the database (3). Depending on the number and type of active sensors (2), the regressor generator (4) creates a container of basis functions (5) that are applicable with the currently available measurements. For example, if the precipitation sensor is inactive, then the container will not include basis functions (potential regressors) that have the precipitation amount as a parameter.

Using previously created basis functions, the GA module (5) generates the initial population of regression models (6). Every single individual (MLR model) is formed as a random choice of regressors from the set of available basis functions. The fitness of every single individual in the initial population is determined through the evaluation process (7a) using two criteria: the accuracy and complexity of the model represented by that individual. The accuracy is a degree of closeness of the model results to the measurements for the same historical inputs (8). Considering the fact that an individual represents only the number and type of the regressors, it is necessary to calculate coefficients of regressors, to assess the accuracy of the MLR model (see Section 2.1). Once the coefficients are calculated, the accuracy of the model can be determined using standard statistical parameters, such as the root mean square error or the determination coefficient. The complexity criterion represents an evaluation of the model in terms of the computer time that is required to calculate the results and is determined by the number and type of regressors.

New individuals are obtained from existing individuals through the processes of crossover (9) and mutation (10), and their fitnesses are evaluated, as described earlier (7b). Individuals that will pass to the next generation are chosen in the selection process (11) according to their fitness. A search for a better combination of regressors is continued until the termination criteria is reached, such as a satisfactory model accuracy, the number of generations or the searching duration (12). Once a termination criterion is satisfied, the optimized regression model (13) that is compatible with the currently available sensors is obtained. This model can be further used for dam behavior prediction, analysis, and comparison with measurements and possible actions.

The aim of the proposed system is the determination of an MLR model that is optimized for currently available measurements. Having in mind that the regressors in MLR can appear in various functional forms, the goal is to find the best-fitted model based on the data at hand. This task is not simply to find the parameters of the MLR model but is also to clarify the best functions of the predictors. The mathematical programming model and optimization algorithm that find an optimal MLR model are described in the following sections.

In the structural modeling of concrete dams using MLR, regressors can be roughly divided into several groups: the effects of hydrostatic pressure, the effects of temperature and the effects of time (aging, which is considered to be irreversible) [6]. The effects of hydrostatic pressure variation are usually represented by polynomials, power, exponential or logarithmic functions, depending on the water level. The displacements of the monitoring point located at the dam, which are affected by temperature variations, can be modeled in several ways: using the air or water temperature or using the temperature of characteristic points inside the structure. To represent the time effect, usually the number of days since the beginning of the analysis is considered.

Because the objective function of the problem contains both binary and non-linear variables (Eqs. (4)–(9)), it can be classified as a highly complex non-linear optimization problem and cannot be solved by classical methods. In addition, an enumerative search in the solution space is not applicable because of an exponential increase in the computational time, with a growth in the number of independent variables and states. To overcome this problem, the genetic algorithm described in the following subsection can be used.

We define the response variable as a linear regression model and assume that the states of the independent variables are regressors. Each gene in the chromosome includes a corresponding regressor in the model or excludes it. Therefore, all of the chromosomes have a form of the mentioned binary variable

                                          (
                                          ζ
                                          )
                                       
                                    
                                 
                               and can exist in one of two possible states: zero (excluded) or one (included) (see Fig. 3
                              ).

An example of the genetic structure of the individuals in a population pool is shown in Fig. 4
                              . The first group of genes includes or excludes the influence of some hydrostatic pressure regressors (χ genes). The second group comprises genes that are related to precipitations (π genes). These genes are followed by genes that involve temperature effects (θ genes) and genes that describe irreversible time processes (τ genes). The MLR model represented by the chromosome in Fig. 4 is given in the following equation:

                              ) is the number of regressors in model ζ.

In this study, the single point crossover operator has been used. Once the crossover point is randomly selected, two mating chromosomes are cut at corresponding points, and the sections after the cuts are exchanged (Fig. 5
                              a). To avoid the local minima problem, each bit is independently flipped with a probability of p, using a bit-flip mutation operator (Fig. 5b).

The binary tournament selection that was employed performs a tournament between two individuals and selects the winner. To assure that the best individuals always survive to the next generation, an elitism strategy has also been used.

The presented ASDBM system has been developed in the Microsoft .NET software environment and comprises a data acquisition service, an MS SQL database, the module for the adaptive generation of the optimized regression model using genetic algorithms, and the prediction module. A special component of the system is the interface to the R software [21], which is employed for the calculation of regressor coefficients and the coefficient of determination of the MLR models within the evaluation process.

The following sections present the validation of the developed ASDBM system for the case study of modeling Bocac dam displacements, in which sensor malfunctions appear periodically.

The Bocac dam at Vrbas River is a medium-size dam that is located in the Republic of Srpska, approximately 25km from the city of Banja Luka (Fig. 6
                     ). This dam is a double curvature arch dam, which is 66m high and has a 221.4m long crest. The dam is equipped with a monitoring system to measure parameters such as concrete conditions, water and air temperatures, the reservoir water level, horizontal and vertical displacements, rotation, movements of joints, strain, stress, uplift pressure, foundation displacements and seepage [9].

Three pendulums were installed to measure radial and tangential deformations. In this paper, the radial displacements of the point P1 at the block 5, measured by coordinometer V5-1, are analyzed with the proposed ASDBM system (Fig. 7
                     a and b).

The data set included 2550 data samples. The training set varied and comprised daily measurements from January 2004 to the moment of recalculation of the optimized model. Recalculation was performed every time that any of the sensors became enabled or disabled.

The effect of the hydrostatic pressure on the dam displacements was taken explicitly into account through the parameter H, as shown in Eq. (6). The range of the input variable H was from 272.28 to 282.24m. The thermal effect was accounted for by the air temperature TA
                      (−10.72 to 32.5°C), which was measured by sensor TZ-3 (Fig. 7a), and the structure temperature TS
                      (1.63–20.52°C), which was measured by sensor TB-20 (Fig. 7a and c). Although a natural correlation between the air and structure temperature exists, the Pearson coefficient r
                     =0.66 is less than 0.7, which allows us to use these two variables as independent input parameters [22]. Precipitation does not have a significant influence on concrete dams, but we have also included it as an input variable to test the system capability to reject variables without a physical influence. The range of the input variable P was from 0 to 367.6ml, where P represents a 15-day moving average of real precipitations. The time effect includes the dependency of the measured values on the degradation of the material properties during the structural lifetime. All of the input variables were normalized to a scale from 0 to 1. In this study, the radial displacement of the point P1 is considered to be an output (response) variable. The range of the response variable V5-1Y was from −4.1 to 15.8mm.

The developed ASDBM system was tested on the data that were measured between 1.1.2010 and 31.12.2010 (D.M.Y. date format is used), during which periodical malfunctions of sensors were occurring (Table 1
                     ). The parameters of the GA for each period in Table 1 were as follows: the number of individuals in the population pool (number of linear models) was 100, and the number of generations was 70, while the complexity parameter was

At the beginning of the considered period, all of the sensors were active; thus, the set of 30 potential regressors ρI

As described in Section 3, the ASDBM system optimized the MLR model, using historical data from those days between 1.1.2004 and 31.12.2009, with all of the necessary measurements presented simultaneously. The best solution given in Eq. (15) contained 9 regressors, and the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination was

According to the MLR model given in Eq. (15), the prediction of radial displacements of the point P1 during period I, when all of the sensors were active, was calculated (Table 1/I). The root mean square error of the prediction was RMSEorgI
                     =1.236mm. On 21.1.2010, a temperature sensor TZ-3 malfunction occurred. If the displacement prediction is continued using the original model that assumes that all of the sensors are active, then the prediction error would increase to RMSEorgII
                     =2.423mm because of the lack of air temperature data. To eliminate inaccuracies, the ASDBM system used a set of basis functions ρII
                      without the air temperature (Eq. (16)) and generated a new optimized MLR model, as shown in Eq. (17):

The adjusted coefficient of multiple determination for the learning period from 1.1.2004 to 20.1.2010 (only those days when all of the sensors except for sensor TZ-3 were active) was

                     , while the prediction error of the adaptive model for period II was RMSEadpII
                     =0.988mm, which is a significantly better prediction than the original prediction. Fig. 8
                      shows a comparison between the measured displacements of the point P1 and the displacements predicted using the original and the adaptive model. The learning data are not shown, for the sake of brevity.

Starting from 19.2.2010 and progressing until 25.6.2010, all of the sensors were active again. On 19.2.2010, the ASDBM system generated a new optimized model using learning data from 1.1.2004 to 18.2.2010 (only those days when all of the sensors were active). The new model had a learning accuracy of

                      and a prediction error for the period III, RMSEorgIII
                     =1.835mm.

The prediction accuracy of the ASDBM system becomes the focus of attention, especially during periods in which a significant number of sensors were inactive. For example, during period IV, the air temperature sensor was the only active sensor (see Fig. 8). If the prediction is continued using the original model that assumes that all of the sensors are active, then the prediction accuracy would rapidly drop to RMSEorgIV
                     =3.718mm. Instead, on 26.6.2010, the ASDBM system generated a new optimized model (Eq. (19)) using the feasible basis functions that are given in the following equation:

                      in Table 1 leads to the conclusion that the accuracy of the model strongly depends on the available input variables; this coefficient varies from 0.902 (when all of the variables are included) to 0.699 (when only the air temperature measurements were considered). In contrast, accurate models based on a large number of input parameters exhibited a significant drop in the prediction accuracy when some of the input variables were unavailable. Although models with a smaller number of input parameters are usually less accurate, their usage on circumstances in which there are a reduced number of measurements produces better predictions than the predictions that are obtained by models with a larger number of input variables. Therefore, the ASDBM system adapted a prediction model every time the set of available sensors was changed. Using this adaptive model in the case of air temperature sensor malfunction, the original model prediction error RMSE=2.423mm was reduced to 0.988. Similarly, in the period when the air temperature sensor was the only sensor that was active, the original RMSE=3.718mm was reduced to 1.743 using the adaptive model.

It should be noted from equations (15, 17 and 19) that regressors with the precipitation variable P are never used in the models, although they were available in the basis function container. This choice is reasonable because the precipitation has no significant influence on the concrete dams, which is the type of dam used in this case study.

For the sake of clarity, only one response variable (radial displacement of the point P1) was modeled in this case study. In fact, the dam monitoring system usually provides many outputs, which can be used in the assessment of structural behavior. According to the characteristic of MLR method to model each response variable independently, presented principle can be applied for modeling more output components simultaneously and independently of each other.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the concept of an adaptive system for dam behavior modeling (ASDBM) that is resistant to the variations in the set of measured variables is presented. Using genetic algorithms, the system optimizes the multiple linear regression model of a dam according to currently active sensors. The MLR model is optimized based on two criteria: the accuracy and the complexity. For measuring the model accuracy, the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination is used, while the total number of regressors is used as a measure of the model complexity. According to the proposed approach, several software modules have been developed.

The performance of the ASDBM system was tested using the Bocac dam case study, in which the radial displacements of a point inside the dam structure as a function of the headwater, precipitation, temperature and time have been modeled. Every time that any sensor became active or inactive, the ASDBM system adjusted the MLR model according to the currently available set of input data. In the time periods in which one or more sensors were inactive, the proposed system showed a significantly better prediction than the original MLR model (which assumes that all of the sensors are always active). In addition, the system has shown the capability of rejecting variables that have no influence on the modeled dam. This capability makes the proposed system useful for monitoring activities and makes it a robust and powerful predictive management tool. The robustness with respect to instrumental error in the monitored data can be improved if the “least square method” component (Fig. 2, label 7) is simply replaced by more robust linear regression method such as robust regression or resistant regression, that are less sensitive to outliers and heteroscedasticity [21].

The main limitation of this approach lies in the fact that it does not directly consider the mechanical properties and any possible damage. Additional analysis in the form of non-destructive tests (static and dynamical), computational mechanical modeling and inverse analysis will also be required. Further research should be directed toward the improvement of the complexity criterion using the statistical significance of individual regressors. Another direction for further investigation should be the development of a novel evolutionary heuristic that would force the genetic modification of individuals according to the statistical significance of their regressors.
