                           Algorithm for denoising of Fiber Optics Gyroscope sensor signal is proposed.


                        
                        
                           
                           Hardware architecture of the algorithm is developed.


                        
                        
                           
                           The resource utilization of the proposed algorithm is compared with DWT and Kalman filter.


                        
                        
                           
                           Co-processor of the proposed algorithm is developed.


                        
                        
                           
                           An acceleration of 65Ã— over software implementation is obtained using the developed co-processor.
