                  In this paper we study two reverse auction formats in a single period setting, the sealed pay-as-bid and the open format, when suppliers are capacity constrained. In the pay-as-bid format we characterize the asymmetric bidding equilibrium for the case of two suppliers with uniformly distributed cost. We find that the pay-as-bid auction allocates business inefficiently and that a supplier’s bid is nonincreasing in the opponent’s capacity and is typically decreasing in its own capacity. We then characterize a descending price-clock open auction implementation and find that it is optimal and that the buyer’s expected cost decreases as capacity is more evenly spread. Finally, we find that the pay-as-bid auction results in a higher expected cost to the buyer as compared to the open auction.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Procurement managers frequently use reverse auctions as a tool for leveraging supply side competition when procuring standardized items. The winner-take-all is a prototypical reverse auction format in which the buyer invites the suppliers in its supply base to bid for supplying multiple units of a homogeneous good. In such an auction the buyer awards the contract to the supplier that offers the best market price for supplying that good. To successfully implement a winner-take-all auction requires, amongst other conditions, that each of the participating supplier has sufficient supply capacity to meet the buyer’s demand.

However, buyer’s demand for the item might exceed the available capacity of any individual supplier in its supply base. This situation arises, for example, when a big multinational firm consolidates the demand for standardized components, like customized fasteners or nuts and bolts, across its multiple divisions or when an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) consolidates the demand for standardized components required by its tier-1 sub-assembly providers, and then procures these components from multiple suppliers of such components who individually might not have the sufficient capacity to meet the OEM’s cumulative demand (see Moses & Anupindi (2009)). Other situations where a buyer might face capacity constrained suppliers might arise when national or state laws require firms to procure a certain fraction of business from small and medium scale enterprises, whose individual capacities are much smaller than the fraction of business that buying firm needs to procure from such enterprizes. For example, California’s Public Utilities Commission requires three large investor-owned utilities (IOUs) in the state to procure up to 1 giga-watt of energy from small renewable energy projects that have an installed capacity of 20 megawatt or less (see CPUC (2014)). In this case the utilities use reverse auctions (titled “renewable auction mechanisms”) to solicit bids on price per unit of energy (dollar/megawatt hour) at which the owners of renewable energy projects would be willing to supply energy to the utility for a duration ranging from 10–20 years.

Evidently a winner-take-all auction cannot be organized when suppliers participating in the buyer’s auction do not have sufficient capacity to individually meet the buyer’s demand. However, auction mechanisms that multi-source (i.e., source from more than one supplier) can allow the buyer to leverage supply side competition, as long as the overall capacity in the buyer’s supply base exceeds the buyer’s demand. A natural question that then emerges is: what auction mechanism can the buyer use to multi-source, when participating suppliers are individually capacity constrained, but in total have the sufficient capacity to meet the buyer’s demand? In this paper we present two easy to implement auction formats that a buyer can use to multi-source in such a scenario: a sealed pay-as-bid format and an open descending price-clock format. We then analyze both these auction formats in a single period setting (i.e., for a one time procurement event) to determine how the suppliers would bid in these auctions and consequently determine the buyer’s expected cost of purchasing the goods from these auctions.

Analyzing these auctions is interesting from both theoretical and practical perspectives. On the theoretical front, capacity constraint introduces asymmetry between the suppliers (since each supplier might have a different capacity). Analyzing the bidding equilibrium in sealed-bid auction with asymmetric suppliers is known to be a challenging problem to solve and not much is known about the features of the resulting asymmetric equilibrium. Thus, one objective of this paper is to characterize the asymmetric equilibrium in a simple procurement setting, i.e., a single period sealed-bid auction with two participating bidders (suppliers) whose costs are uniformly distributed.

Characterizing the equilibrium allows us to study the features of such an asymmetric equilibrium in a procurement auction. For example, the paper addresses the question regarding the efficiency of sealed auction, when suppliers are capacity constrained. A two supplier auction would be efficient if the lower cost supplier gets the maximum possible allocation (i.e., the minimum of its capacity and the buyer’s demand). From the equilibrium bids of two suppliers we find that the sealed-bid format is not efficient because the higher-cost supplier can bid lower than the lower-cost supplier, if its capacity is smaller than the lower cost supplier’s capacity. Characterizing the equilibrium also allows us to investigate how the suppliers’ equilibrium bids would react to changes in their or the opponent supplier’s capacity. We find that a supplier decreases its bid as the capacity of the opponent supplier increases and it typically decreases its bid as its own capacity increases.

Besides uncovering such theoretical insights, there are also practical motivations for investigating these auctions. First amongst these is that the implementation of an open descending auction, when suppliers are capacity constrained, is not obvious. A winner-take-all auction (when suppliers have no capacity constraints) can be easily implemented through a descending price-clock mechanism: in such an auction the suppliers drop out of the auction as the price-clock reaches their per-unit cost and the buyer awards the business to last remaining supplier and pays it the price at which the second last supplier dropped out. But how can such an auction be implemented when the buyer has to multi-source (due to the capacity constraints of its suppliers)? In this paper we present a descending price clock format that can be used when suppliers are capacity constrained. We find that the equilibrium bidding strategy of suppliers in such an open auction is to drop out of the auction when the price clock reaches their per-unit production cost. Moreover, analysis of the sealed-bid and the open-descending format allows us to compare the buyer’s ex-ante (expected) cost in both these formats. Interestingly, we find that under the standard regularity conditions (à la Myerson (1981)), the open descending auction is optimal for the buyer and that the sealed-bid auction results in a relatively higher expected cost for the buyer. These finding are managerially relevant since they point to the fact that a buyer can reduce its procurement cost by organizing an open descending auction rather than a sealed bid auction, when suppliers are constrained on their capacity.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present the related literature. In Section 3 we present the model and analyze the asymmetric equilibrium in the pay-as-bid auction. In Section 4 we present the open-auction implementation and compare the open auction with the pay-as-bid auction. Finally, we present our concluding remarks in Section 5. All the proofs are presented in the online supplement to this paper.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The existing work on asymmetric auctions can be grouped into five broad categories: (1) asymmetric auctions with two bidders that draw their types from heterogeneous distributions; (2) asymmetric auctions with n ≥ 2 bidders; (3) auctions in which the principal asymmetrically discriminates against the bidders; (4) asymmetric procurement auctions; and finally (5) asymmetric multi-unit auctions in electricity markets.

We first discuss the work that investigates asymmetric auction with two participating bidders whose types are drawn from heterogeneous distributions. Criesmer, Levitan, and Shubikt (1967) characterize the equilibrium with two bidders whose private values are uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1] and [0, β]. Plum (1992) extends that result to Power distribution

                     . Lizzeri and Perisco (2000) establish equilibrium with two bidders that have inter-dependent values and reserve price. Maskin and Riley (2000) derive comparative static results on the bidding equilibrium with two bidders whose valuations have the same form of distribution, but over different supports [βi, αi
                     ] for each bidder/buyer i. They show that typically “strong” buyers shade their bid and “weak” buyers bid more aggressively resulting in allocation going to “weak” buyers. They also show that revenue equivalence typically does not hold with asymmetric bidders. In our paper we find that bidders/suppliers with higher capacity bid less aggressively whereas suppliers with lower capacity bid more aggressively, thus resulting in high cost (and low capacity) bidders getting higher than necessary allocation. Moreover, we show that revenue equivalence between pay-as-bid and open bid format fails with asymmetric bidders. Kaplan and Zamir (2012) characterize the bidding equilibrium with two bidders whose valuations are uniformly distributed over a generic support. We too characterize asymmetric equilibrium with two bidders, however the source of asymmetry in our model is suppliers’ limited and heterogeneous capacity. Moreover, our model investigates multi-sourcing, which is in contrast to the work discussed above that looks at sole-sourcing. Thus our work complements to this stream of literature by characterizing asymmetric bidding equilibrium in a multi-sourcing procurement context.

Literature that investigates asymmetric auctions with n ≥ 2 bidders typically focuses on the question regarding the existence of equilibrium (and does not characterize the equilibrium in closed form). Lebrun (1999) establishes the existence of equilibrium when bidders have independent private values and when the value distribution has common support. Maskin and Riley (2003) establish equilibrium under affiliated private values and positive value interdependence but do not consider reserve prices. Athey (2001) establishes existence of equilibrium for a general class of auctions under the single crossing condition. All of the work mentioned above focuses on winner-take-all auction. In the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish and characterize asymmetric equilibrium in multi-unit split-award auctions.

Asymmetry might also arise when the principal biases against a bidder. Balestrieri (2008, chap. 3) analyzes bidding equilibrium with two buyers when the auctioneer/seller has a preference bias towards one bidder. Mares and Swinkels (2014) analyze a first price sealed bid auction when the two suppliers’ costs are distributed asymmetrically and when the buyer biases one of the supplier (e.g., better quality). Haruvy and Katok (2013) conduct laboratory experiments with auctions in which the auctioneer/buyer exercises its discretion on winner determination based on non-price “quality” attributes of the suppliers. In our paper we do not model the buyer as having discretionary power, on the contrary the auction rules are clearly specified upfront, which according to Jap (2007) has a positive impact on buyer-supplier relationships.

In the literature that investigates the use of asymmetric reverse auctions for procurement, Arozamena and Cantillon (2004) study the incentives of suppliers to invest in cost improvement, when that investment is observed by competitors. Cantillon (2008) analyzes the effect of a buyer sponsoring its suppliers’ cost reduction on to its expected cost. She finds that asymmetries hurt the buyer’s revenue and therefore the buyer is better off in investing uniformly in its suppliers. We too find that asymmetries increase the buyer’s expected cost and that for a given total capacity the buyer can minimize its expected cost if capacity is symmetrically endowed to each supplier. However, our work differs from Cantillon’s work in the sense that asymmetry is not induced by buyer/supplier investments in cost improvements, rather asymmetry in our model is exogenous and arises due to suppliers having different capacities.

Close to our model’s setting, Iyengar and Kumar (2008) investigate an auction in which suppliers have limited and heterogeneous capacities. Their model assumes that both cost and capacity of suppliers is their private information. They find that the allocation and payment in the optimal mechanism replicates a mechanism in which only cost is suppliers’ private information. This is because under a direct mechanism the buyer does not have to give any rents to the supplier for them to truthfully bid their capacity. We complement the work of Iyengar and Kumar (2008) by showing that an open descending price clock auction would make a similar allocation and payment as an optimal mechanism and hence is also optimal.

Finally, the literature that investigates equilibrium in competitive electricity markets is also relevant to our work. Klemperer and Meyer (1989), Green and Newbery (1992) and Green (1996) characterize the supply functions that firms would submit in equilibrium in an oligopolistic market. Ausubel and Cramton (2002) compare uniform price auctions with pay-as-bid auctions when bidders have the same capacity. In contrast to this work we analyze auctions when bidders are heterogenous in their capacity.

The buyer requires Q units of homogenous goods, which it can procure from the n qualified, risk neutral suppliers in its supply base. A supplier i has an available supply capacity of up to Ki
                      units for the buyer. We assume that each supplier’s capacity is fixed, i.e., it cannot make ex-post (after the auction) investments to increase or decrease its capacity. Without any loss of generality we assume that Ki
                      ≤ Q (since for the concerned auctions any supplier’s capacity greater than Q would be redundant). Moreover, to avoid trivial solutions we assume that overall the buyer’s supply base is over-supplied, i.e., 
                        
                           
                              ∑
                              
                                 i
                                 =
                                 1
                              
                              n
                           
                           
                              K
                              i
                           
                           >
                           Q
                        
                     ; otherwise there would be no competition in the buyer’s supply base. We also assume that the capacity of suppliers is public information. We denote the vector of suppliers’ capacity by 
                        
                           K
                           =
                           
                              K
                              1
                           
                           ,
                           …
                           ,
                           
                              K
                              n
                           
                        
                     .

The per-unit cost of production, ci
                     , for supplier i is constant and is its own private information. The per-unit cost of suppliers is i.i.d. with a continuous support within interval 
                        
                           [
                           
                              c
                              ̲
                           
                           ,
                           
                              c
                              ¯
                           
                           ]
                        
                      and its c.d.f. and density are denoted by F(c) and f(c), respectively. This distribution is known publicly.

Finally, we assume that the buyer can satisfy its demand by procuring from other sources outside its supply base, at a price of 
                        
                           
                              c
                              
                                 o
                                 u
                                 t
                              
                           
                           ≤
                           
                              c
                              ¯
                           
                        
                      per-unit. The buyer also sets a reserve price at R ≤ cout
                     , to indicate the maximum bid that it would accept in its auction.

The buyer invites the suppliers to bid for its business in a sealed pay-as-bid auction. In this auction each supplier can submit a single bid stating the per-unit price at which it would supply the good to the buyer. The buyer’s allocation and payment rules are analogous to the first price sealed bid auction. Specifically, the buyer first fills its demand from the capacity of the lowest bidder until it exhausts the capacity of the lowest bidder and then the buyer satisfies its remaining demand from the capacity of the second-lowest bidder until it exhausts the capacity of that supplier and similarly procures, sequentially, from other higher bid suppliers until the buyer satisfies its demand. The buyer then pays each bidder the per-unit price quoted by the bidder.

To derive the bidding equilibrium for the sealed pay-as-bid auction, we further assume that the per-unit costs of the suppliers are uniformly distributed in the interval 
                           
                              [
                              
                                 c
                                 ̲
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 c
                                 ¯
                              
                              ]
                           
                        . Moreover, we restrict the supply base size to 
                           
                              n
                              =
                              2
                           
                         suppliers. As we show later, the problem of characterizing bidding equilibrium with two suppliers is quite challenging, since it requires solving a system of two non-linear differential equations. Indeed, it might be the case that there are n >2 capacity constrained suppliers that bid for the buyer’s business. For instance, in the renewable auction mechanism mentioned in the Introduction, there might be n > 2 suppliers of renewable energy that bid for the utility provider’s demand, which exceeds the individual capacity of any of the suppliers. Characterizing the bidding equilibrium in such a case would involve solving a system of n non-linear differential equations, which is a significantly more complicated problem.

                           Other arbitrary rules for allocating in case of a tie can also be used, for example, the supplier with the higher capacity gets allocated upto its capacity and the other supplier gets the buyer’s residual demand.

Indeed, in order to determine the equilibrium bids bi
                         and bj
                        , through the first order conditions, we first need to determine the inverse bidding function vi
                        (.) and vj
                        (.). The following Lemma helps us in determining the domain of vi
                         and vj
                        .

                              The minimum bids of supplier i and supplier j are similar, i.e.,

The above Lemma implies that the domain of the inverse bidding function of both suppliers is similar, i.e., [ 
                           b
                        , R]. In other words the highest bid of both suppliers would be R and their lowest bid would be 
                           b
                         . Since the cost of both suppliers is distributed in the interval 
                           
                              [
                              
                                 c
                                 ̲
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 c
                                 ¯
                              
                              ]
                           
                         and assuming that the equilibrium bidding functions are nondecreasing and continuous, implies that for any equilibrium bid b ∈ [
                           b
                        , R], one can uniquely identify the costs

If we can solve Eq. (5) for vi
                        (b) and vj
                        (b) and show that the resulting functions vi
                        (b) and vj
                        (b) are nondecreasing and continuous in b, then vi
                        (b) and vj
                        (b) would indeed represent the equilibrium inverse bidding strategies. To solve these differential equations we follow the approach of Kaplan and Zamir (2012), who have used a similar approach to solve the asymmetric bidding equilibrium (when bidders are asymmetric in their cost distribution) under uniform cost distribution.

Adding Eq. (5a) and(5b) gives

                              ϵ

                              0
                           
                         amount less than R for a cost between

Thus we can reduce a system of differential equations in Eq. (5) to a single differential equation in vi
                        (b) — as characterized by Eq. (8). Note that replacing vi
                        (b) with vj
                        (b) in Eq. (8) would give the differential equation formulation of the inverse bidding function of supplier j. Thus solving Eq. (8) would give us the structure for both vi
                        (b) and vj
                        (b). The next Lemma characterizes the solution to the differential Eq. (8).

If vi
                        (b) (as characterized by Eq. (9)) is to represent the equilibrium inverse bidding function of supplier i, then it should satisfy the two assumptions that we had made on the inverse bidding function: first that it is nondecreasing and second that it is continuously differentiable. Indeed, the function vi
                        (b) in Eq. (9) is differentiable. The theorem below proves that vi
                        (b) is also nondecreasing and therefore represents the equilibrium inverse bidding function of supplier i.

                           Theorem 1
                           
                              The inverse bidding strategy in 
                              
                                 Eq. (9)
                               
                              represents the equilibrium inverse bid function of supplier i.
                           

Note that the equilibrium inverse bidding function for supplier j would be symmetric to that of supplier i, i.e., one can obtain vj
                        (b) and Zj
                         by swapping the sub-script i with sub-script j in Eq. (9) and Eq. (10). Also, it is worth pointing out the differences between the asymmetric equilibrium derived in Eq. (9) with the asymmetric equilibrium derived in Kaplan and Zamir (2012). More specifically, in Kaplan and Zamir (2012), the source of asymmetry was the heterogeneous distributions (uniform distribution with different support) from which the bidders drew their private valuations. However, in this paper the asymmetries arise due to the ex-ante limited and heterogeneous supply capacity of the suppliers. Moreover, Kaplan and Zamir (2012) investigated asymmetric equilibrium in a winner-take-all auction. However, this paper characterizes asymmetric equilibrium in a multi-sourcing (split-award) environment.

Note that Theorem 1 only characterizes the equilibrium inverse bid functions of capacity constrained suppliers when their costs are uniformly distributed. Such a closed form solution is not available for non-uniform distributions; in which case one has to resort to numerical solutions of differential equations. More specifically, the equilibrium inverse bidding functions for a general cost distribution, f(c), can be found by numerically solving the following differential equations:

                         Note that the equilibrium bids in the constrained capacity case are much higher than the equilibrium bids in the unconstrained case. This is intuitive since each supplier is competing less when the other supplier is capacity constrained, i.e., each supplier is assured of getting some business from the buyer and therefore does not bid aggressively. Fig. 1 also indicates that for a given cost the supplier with higher capacity bids higher than the supplier with lower capacity. The next proposition formalizes this result.

                           Proposition 1
                           
                              For uniformly distributed costs, the equilibrium bid curve would be higher for the supplier with the larger capacity of the two.
                           

Although Proposition 1 formalizes the result only for uniformly distributed cost, however numerical results, as seen in Fig. 1, indicate that the result is robust for non-uniformly distributed costs. The intuition behind this result is the following. Each supplier is competing only for

                         Thus a supplier i selects a bid, bi
                        , that optimally balances its assured surplus with its expected additional surplus. If supplier i is the higher capacity supplier, then the amount of its assured business

                         is greater than the amount of assured business that supplier j gets, which is 
                           
                              Q

                        . Intuitively, for a given cost, supplier i would strike this balance at a higher bid as compared to supplier j and thus supplier i (who has the higher capacity) would bid higher than supplier j.

Moreover, Proposition 1 implies that a supplier with lower cost amongst the two (if it is also the supplier with the higher capacity amongst the two) might bid higher than the other supplier, thus resulting in the buyer allocating first to the supplier with higher cost and then to the supplier with lower cost. We see this is in Fig. 1 where supplier i (with higher capacity) might have a lower cost as compared to supplier j (with lower capacity) but it might still bid higher than supplier j. In that case the buyer would first allocate 400 units to supplier j and then the remaining 600 units to supplier i. Thus such an auction is inefficient since the buyer allocates more than it should to the supplier with higher cost. In contrast an efficient auction would have allocated 800 units to supplier i (the lower-cost supplier) and the remaining 200 units to supplier j. Finally we ask the question, would the equilibrium bid function as calculated from Eq. (9) converge to the inverse bid function of a symmetric first price winner-take-all reverse auction as capacity constraints are relaxed? In the proposition below we answer this question.

Next, we investigate the effect of changing capacity on to a supplier’s equilibrium bid. First we look at the impact on the bid of a supplier as the capacity of the opponent supplier is changed. Intuitively, any increase in the capacity of the competing supplier j decreases the assured amount of business,

                         that supplier i gets. Moreover, the additional

                         would increase in Kj
                        , if supplier j’s bidding strategy remained invariant to an increase in Kj
                        . In which case supplier i’s bid of bi
                         that balances the marginal change in its expected additional surplus with the marginal change in its assured surplus would decrease as Kj
                         increase. However, we do not know how supplier j would change its bid if its capacity increases. Thus it is not upfront obvious how supplier i’s equilibrium bid would in Kj
                        . The next proposition shows that the supplier reduces its bid as the capacity of the opponent supplier increases.
                           4
                        
                        
                           4
                           An alternate explanation for this could be that supplier i’s allocation on being the lowest bidder stays the same whereas its allocation on being the higher bidder decreases as Kj
                               increases. Therefore the relative difference in allocation that supplier i would get by being the lowest bidder as compared to it being the highest bidder increases in supplier j’s capacity and hence supplier i has a greater incentive to be the lowest bidder.
                        
                        
                           Proposition 3
                           
                              The bid of a supplier is not increasing in the opponent supplier’s capacity.
                           

We now investigate how an increase in a supplier’s capacity influences its own bid. Using the same reasoning as before one can argue that supplier i’s assured surplus stays the same as its capacity Ki
                         increases and therefore the marginal effect of bi
                         on the assured surplus would remain unchanged as Ki
                         increases. Thus the change in supplier’s bid, bi
                        , as its own capacity, Ki
                        , changes would depend entirely upon how the marginal effect of bi
                        , on its expected additional surplus, changes with Ki
                        . However, the direction of the marginal effect of bi
                         on the expected additional surplus is not obvious as Ki
                         increases, since we do not know whether marginally decreasing bi
                         would result in a higher or a lower increase in the expected additional allocation as Ki
                         increases. This is because an increase in Ki
                         would, on one hand increase

                         (according to Proposition 3) and therefore increase

                        . In Fig. 2
                         we see that typically a supplier decreases its bid as its own capacity increases. However at higher costs and thus higher bi
                         we find that the supplier increases its bid as its capacity increases.

Moreover, in Fig. 2 we check the robustness of sensitivity results when cost are non-uniformly distributed. For the case of exponentially distributed costs, we find that the bid of a supplier is non-increasing in the opponent supplier’s capacity and that a supplier’s bid is not always non-increasing in its own capacity.

In this section we discuss the open descending price-clock auction that the buyer can organize when faced with n capacity constrained suppliers. For this we remove the additional restrictions, that we had imposed in Section 3.1, on suppliers’ cost distribution and supply base size and revert back to the more general assumptions made at the beginning of Section 3.

In the open auction format the buyer announces the reserve price R at which it will start the clock price. The suppliers can exit the auction at any time. After this announcement and before starting the price clock,

Exiting the auction does not give any additional allocation or payment to the supplier that exits, above what it has already received.

In such an auction, all the suppliers that have a per-unit production cost greater than R would exit the auction as soon as the reserve price, R, is announced; since staying in the auction would only get them a positive allocation at a per-unit price which is less than their per-unit production cost. Moreover, each of the m suppliers that remains in the auction after the reserve price is announced, i.e. each i ∈ M
                     0, will exit the auction when the price clock reach its per-unit production cost ci
                     . If supplier i exits the auction any sooner (at bi
                      > ci
                     ), then it only loses the opportunity of getting a non-negative allocation at a profitable price had some other supplier exited between bi
                      and ci
                     . If supplier i exits the auction later (at bi
                      < ci
                     ), then it only increases the likelihood of getting an allocation at a loss making price in case some other supplier exits the auction between ci
                      and bi
                     . Thus in the open descending auction, the equilibrium strategy for all the suppliers (except the last remaining supplier, since the auction stops as the second-last supplier exits the auction) is to exit the auction when the price clock reaches their respective per-unit cost.

We now characterize the non-negative quantity, q
                     
                        i, d
                     , that a supplier i ∈ Md
                      would get as the d
                     th supplier exits the auction. Before that, we define two additional terms to depict the state of the auction as the d
                     th supplier exits the auction. The first term is the residual quantity that the buyer needs in order to fulfill its demand of Q. We call this quantity as the buyer’s residual demand and denote it as RDd
                     . The second term is the total remaining capacity that a supplier i ∈ Md

                     th highest cost supplier (amongst the suppliers in the set M
                     0).

The above implementation of the open descending price clock auction is quite intuitive, i.e., at the per-unit price equal to the drop put price of a supplier, allocate to each of the remaining suppliers the amount of business that they are sure to get at that point (i.e., the amount of business for which they do not have to compete for). The descending price-clock auction would also be efficient in its allocation, i.e., unlike a pay-as-bid auction, the open auction would never result in the higher cost supplier getting an extra allocation, that could have been given to the lower cost supplier. Finally, note that this descending-price clock auction implementation is similar in spirit to the ascending price-clock clinching mechanism (proposed by Ausubel (2004)) for the auctioning of multiple units through an open forward auction.

We next investigate whether the open descending price-clock auction would be optimal for the buyer at a given reserve price of R? To answer this question we compare the allocation and the payment given to a supplier with the allocation and payment given to the same supplier in an optimal allocation mechanism, à la Myerson (1981). If the allocation and payment are the same in the two auctions then indeed the open auction format is also optimal for the buyer. To determine the optimal mechanism we consider only the class of truth-revealing mechanisms, i.e., an allocation and payment rule for which suppliers’ best strategy is to bid their per-unit cost. According to the revelation principle, such a truth-revealing mechanism would also include the mechanism that is optimal for the buyer, i.e., a mechanism that minimizes the ex-ante (expected) cost of the buyer.

Using standard mechanism design approach the optimal mechanism under dominant strategy equilibrium can be characterized as follows:

                           For constant per-unit cost Mookherjee and Reichelstein (1992) show that both dominant and Bayesian Nash equilibrium are cost equivalent.

                        Eq. (13) shows that the buyer would allocate greedily, i.e., the buyer would first allocate to the lowest cost supplier its capacity; then the buyer allocates to the second lowest cost supplier the minimum of its capacity and the residual demand of the buyer (the residual demand of the buyer is the quantity that it still needs to procure to completely satisfy its demand of Q). The buyer continues like this until it fulfills its demand of Q. The payment to each supplier consists of its cost ciqi
                         of supplying the good and its information rent.

Note that the above optimal mechanism has a similar structure to the optimal mechanism characterized in Iyengar and Kumar (2008), when both cost and capacity are private information of the suppliers. Indeed, under the assumption that suppliers do not overbid their capacity, they show that an optimal mechanism, when suppliers are privately informed on both cost and capacity, would be similar to the optimal mechanism if the private information was restricted to cost only (with capacity known publicly). The intuition behind that result is that when only capacity is private information of the suppliers then the buyer does not have to give any information rents for them to truthfully reveal their capacity. (The optimal mechanism design in Iyengar and Kumar (2008) is designed for maximizing buyer’s surplus as compared to the optimal mechanism in Lemma 4, which minimizes buyer’s cost.)

We now show that for any given reserve price, R, the allocation and payment in Eqs. (13) and(14) to a supplier i are similar to those in the open descending price clock format. Note that since truthful revelation of cost is a dominant strategy for suppliers in both the open auction and the optimal auction, therefore an open auction that allocates and pays similar to the optimal auction would also be optimal. The next Theorem shows that the open descending price auction is optimal.

                           Theorem 2
                           
                              For a given reserve price R ≤ cout and for
                              
                                 
                                    c
                                    +
                                    F
                                    (
                                    c
                                    )
                                    /
                                    f
                                    (
                                    c
                                    )
                                 
                               
                              non-decreasing in c, the open auction format is optimal for the buyer.
                           

Thus Theorem 2 states that the open descending price clock auction is indeed optimal, i.e., it minimizes the buyer’s expected cost when suppliers are capacity constrained. Moreover, Theorem 2 helps us to carry out sensitivity analysis on the open auction format by investigating the effect of changing parameters on the optimal mechanism characterized in Lemma 4. It has recently come to our attention that Chen, Dawande, Gupta, and Janakiraman (2014) have shown a similar descending-clock implementation of the optimal mechanism when the suppliers are capacity constrained. (Chen et al. (2014) show this result using a different approach, namely through optimization over a polymatroid).

We next investigate whether increasing the spread of capacity decreases the buyer’s expected cost in the open auction. Intuitively, increasing the spread of capacity, i.e., distributing total supply base capacity more evenly amongst the suppliers, should increase the competition amongst the suppliers and hence reduce the buyer’s expected cost. The Proposition below formalizes this intuition . For this we define the spread of capacity by the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI) of concentration, i.e., by

                                    )

                        . Thus any increase in the spread of capacity is equivalent to reducing the concentration of capacity.

                           Proposition 4
                           
                              For a given total capacity and a given supply base size, the buyer’s ex-ante (expected) cost decreases as the capacity is spread more evenly across suppliers.
                           

It follows from Proposition 4 that spreading a given total capacity amongst a larger supply base would also result in a reduction of the buyer’s expected cost. Indeed, any net increase in the total capacity would result in the reduction of the buyer’s expected cost since the allocation would only shift from higher cost suppliers to lower cost suppliers.

We have already seen in Theorem 2 that the open auction is optimal for the buyer and is also efficient in its allocation. We now investigate whether the pay-as-bid auction would result in the same or a higher expected cost for the buyer as compared to an open auction. In general, any two multi-unit auctions would result in the same expected cost for the buyer if the allocations in these auctions are ordered by cost of suppliers, i.e., when both auctions give the same allocation to a given rank of the supplier’s cost (see Klemperer (1999)).

                           Assuming other factors like reservation payoff are similar in both the auctions.
                        
                     

However, we know from Proposition 1 that when suppliers have asymmetric capacities then lowest cost supplier is not necessarily the lowest bidder in the pay-as-bid auction format. Since the open auction format is optimal for the buyer therefore the pay-as-bid auction would typically result in a higher expected cost to the buyer as compared to an open bid auction, when capacities of the suppliers are asymmetric. In Fig. 3
                         we compare the buyer’s expected cost in the pay-as-bid and open auction format when the suppliers have asymmetric capacity constraints. We see that the difference in buyer’s expected cost is non-monotonic as the capacity of one of the supplier is increased. Indeed, when 
                           
                              
                                 K

                              Q
                           
                         then there is no competition in the market and both suppliers would bid the reserve price R in both formats of the auction, thus resulting in the same expected cost for the buyer. As capacity of supplier j is increased, then the resulting asymmetries in the capacities of the suppliers results in the pay-as-bid format having higher expected cost than the open bid.

                         both auction formats are once again equivalent and any further increase in Kj
                         brings back asymmetries into the auction and as a result the open-bid format outperforms the sealed bid format.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper we investigate two types of reverse auction formats that the buyer can organize when its suppliers are capacity constrained. We first look at the pay-as-bid auction and investigate the suppliers’ equilibrium bids in this auction. For two suppliers whose cost are uniformly distributed, we characterize in closed form their equilibrium inverse bid functions. This is a novel methodological contribution to the procurement auctions literature in which no known solution to the asymmetric bidding equilibrium existed so far. Analysis of the equilibrium bids shows that a pay-as-bid auction is not necessarily efficient in allocation, i.e., the auction may allocate more than what is strictly necessary to the higher cost suppliers. Moreover, we find that the equilibrium bids of the suppliers are not increasing in the opponent supplier’s capacity and are typically decreasing in their own capacity except when their cost are high enough, in which case the supplier might increase its bid as its capacity increases.

We then investigate the open-bid auction. For this, we present a descending price-clock auction implementation in which it is the dominant strategy of each supplier to drop out when the price-clock reaches the supplier’s per-unit cost. Moreover, we find that such an open auction implementation is also optimal. We also find that the buyer’s expected cost in the open auction decreases when the capacities are spread more evenly across the suppliers. Finally, we compare the open auction format with the pay-as-bid auction format and find that the two auction formats do not necessarily result in the same expected cost to the buyer. We find that asymmetries in the suppliers’ capacities result in higher expected cost to the buyer in the sealed pay-as-bid auction format as compared to the open-bid format.

From a managerial perspective the analysis presented in the paper (both for the sealed and the open bid auction) could be useful for evaluating the trade-offs when investing into suppliers capacity. On one hand, as we saw in the paper, the constraints on capacity reduces competition in the supply base, as a result of which the suppliers bid less aggressively, therefore increasing the buyer’s expected cost. However, on the other hand, the buyer could invest into the capacity of one or multiple suppliers, and increase the competition in the supply base (since the suppliers would no longer be capacity constrained). These benefits of increased competition need to be balanced against the cost of investment. The model presented in this paper can help the procurement managers in striking this balance and in managing their overall procurement costs.

This work can be extended in three main directions. The first direction is to characterize the asymmetric equilibrium in the pay-as-bid auctions for a generalized number of bidders and for a general distribution of cost. Any such effort would be a significant methodological contribution to the auctions literature. The second direction for this work could be to investigate the sealed auction bidding equilibrium when suppliers are privately informed about both their cost and capacity. The auction format used for that case would be similar to the format presented in this paper. Such a format will not result in suppliers underbidding on capacity, since that would only decrease the amount of business that a supplier gets without affecting the price that it gets paid. To prevent over-bidding of capacity the buyer can impose a high penalty if the supplier cannot supply upto the quoted capacity. Even though, supplier would honestly quote their capacities however analyzing the bidding equilibrium would still be challenging since the suppliers do not know each other’s capacity and as a result they might have different priors about each other’s capacity.

Finally, the third direction for future work could be to analyze the bidding equilibrium for pay-as-bid auctions in which suppliers can submit their supply curves (multiple price-capacity bids) to express their economies of scale or their cost of expanding capacity ex-post. Submitting supply curves is quite common in auctions, e.g., wholesale electricity market. However, these auctions are often held as uniform price auctions rather than pay-as-bid auctions for several reasons concerning fairness, markets entry and simplicity of bid calculation. It would be interesting to analyze the bidding equilibrium for pay-as-bid auction in such cases to shed more light on the comparative performance of the two types of auctions.
