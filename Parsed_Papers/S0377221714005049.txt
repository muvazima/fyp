                  Profiling engineered data with robust mining methods continues attracting attention in knowledge engineering systems. The purpose of this article is to propose a simple technique that deals with non-linear multi-factorial multi-characteristic screening suitable for knowledge discovery studies. The method is designed to proactively seek and quantify significant information content in engineered mini-datasets. This is achieved by deploying replicated fractional-factorial sampling schemes. Compiled multi-response data are converted to a single master-response effectuated by a series of distribution-free transformations and multi-compressed data fusions. The resulting amalgamated master response is deciphered by non-linear multi-factorial stealth stochastics intended for saturated schemes. The stealth properties of our method target processing datasets which might be overwhelmed by a lack of knowledge about the nature of reference distributions at play. Stealth features are triggered to overcome restrictions regarding the data normality conformance, the effect sparsity assumption and the inherent collapse of the ‘unexplainable error’ connotation in saturated arrays. The technique is showcased by profiling four ordinary controlling factors that influence webpage content performance by collecting data from a commercial browser monitoring service on a large scale web host. The examined effects are: (1) the number of Cascading Style Sheets files, (2) the number of JavaScript files, (3) the number of Image files, and (4) the Domain Name System Aliasing. The webpage performance level was screened against three popular characteristics: (1) the time to first visual, (2) the total loading time, and (3) the customer satisfaction. Our robust multi-response data mining technique is elucidated for a ten-replicate run study dictated by an L9(34) orthogonal array scheme where any uncontrolled noise embedded contribution has not been necessarily excluded.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Structured knowledge acquisition remains at the forefront as a key field of intense interest in information sciences as it is exhibited by current reviews on the subject (Liu, Li, Liu, & Chen, 2012; Mariscal, Marban, & Fernandez, 2010). Statistical engineering provides the inference capability for the knowledge gaining effort (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2009). It is statistical engineering that fuels innovation for products and services that succeed in sustaining global demand (Goh, 2010; Pantula, 2011). A fruitful strategy for imbuing cutting-edge information into designing competitive products while building insight in how to improve existing processes has been associated with the area of Design of Experiments (DOE) (Taguchi, Chowdhury, & Taguchi, 2000; Box, Hunter, & Hunter, 2005). DOE studies are generally geared towards screening projects. In harvesting information, DOE provides the profiling apparatus where screened effects undergo a fastidious statistical filtering (Bose, 1961). Classical DOE methodology requires structured data generation engineered through the use of fractional factorial designs (FFDs) followed by a data processing phase (Mukerjee & Wu, 2010). In this work we will spotlight a particular brand of FFDs which is favored by many researchers in a wealth of technological applications. Such FFDs are the ones that belong to the so called orthogonal array (OAs) family. It is noted that OAs constitute part of the standard engineering toolbox for robust on-line design in Taguchi methods (Taguchi, Chowdhury, & Wu, 2004). Accordingly, OAs are applied broadly in information research in diverse studies that range from improving computer vision and medical imaging processing, to enhancing spam-filter performance and software development, and from optimizing vapor deposition processes to screening milling operations and simulated annealing (Besseris, 2009a, 2010b, 2010c; Chang, 2008; Chen & Sun, 2000; Jung & Yum, 2011; Orfanakos & Besseris, 2010; Tansel, Gulmez, Demetgul, & Aykut, 2011). Customarily, the data analysis part in DOE is entrusted on mainstream multi-testing techniques such as the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or regression-based approaches related to the General Linear Modeling (GLM) principle (Ilzarbe, Alvarez, Viles, & Tanco, 2008). The OAs are utilized optimally in programming the data collection phase of a study only when they are saturated (Besseris, 2009b). OA saturation is synonymous to complete utilization of all available array columns for a selected OA sampling scheme. In the state of saturation, resource usage and research budgeted expenditures are minimized. Thus, from a data mining perspective, while maximum information is recovered from collecting datasets that have been planned on saturated OAs, the cost to gain that information is optimally suppressed at the same time. However, working with saturated OA schemes takes a toll on selecting a proper mainstream technique to handle the output data. This is because saturated OAs are not generally symbiotic with standard multi-factorial contrasting tools such as ANOVA and GLM. Both of these last two methods emerge as inoperative in saturated OA schemes because both approaches require information about the unexplainable error which is practically incalculable under saturation. As a result, inferences drawn with either ANOVA or GLM techniques are not poised to be considered in an objective manner. This phenomenon stems from the fact that at the saturation point, all available DFs become depleted due to their complete allocation to the tested effects, allowing no capacity to be distributed to the estimation of the unexplainable error (Besseris, 2012). Without the ability to pinpoint the contribution arising from the unexplainable error, the required F-test ratios in ANOVA and the standard errors in GLM cannot be decoded. In summary, saturation in OA sampling schemes simply equalizes the supply of data with the maximum demand for identifiable information but in the process removes the discovery capability from ANOVA and GLM methods. In spite of lacking any solid basis to sizing-up statistical significance, heuristic approaches exist to assist in interpreting experimental outcomes using the fitting components of ANOVA or GLM results. Response graphs and response tables typify a line of such diagnostics (Box et al., 2005; Taguchi et al., 2004). Squeezing out maximum information at the saturation point during an OA analysis has been a topic of heightened interest for the past half-century where more than thirty techniques have been devised to restore objectivity in the multi-factorial decision making (Besseris, 2009b). Most of the proposed work has been confined to the saturated-unreplicated case addressing the uni-response problem. Addressing the multi-response multi-factorial profiling case has been dealt with recently using nonparametrics which includes the additional option to prioritize the profiled traits for a group of unreplicated responses (Besseris, 2009c). A pure order-statistics single-response methodology has been proposed for a non-linear unreplicated-saturated OA scheme assorted with an illustrative application drawn from the area of improving the quality performance of an information technology system (Besseris, 2010a).

The technique that is presented in this work is intended to extract simultaneous multi-response information induced from multi-factorial contrasting. The main aim of our proposal is to provide a robust tool capable of deciphering process or product behavior in pragmatic modern operational surroundings. As it will become more evident later in this report, the bulk of potential assumptions arising with such types of techniques is maintained rather lean in our approach. The main theme of our method is to stochastically screen for multi-effect status and non-linearity simultaneously. This technique becomes then a convenient ‘two-in-one’ (combo) profiler. Ordinary profilers test at two preselected operational endpoints taking the risk that in the examined range the response will be a monotonous increasing or decreasing function. This assumption might be valid unless the shape of the curve is concave or convex. If the latter occurs then predictions may be digressed. There are several advantages that are realized with this new approach. Our method integrates the robust data reduction of replicates with the super-ranking concept to downgrade the replicated multi-response problem to its corresponding unreplicated counterpart (Besseris, 2009c, 2010d). The overall method may claim to offer some stealth features because is operable without an assuring knowledge of the various distribution laws that ought to be tagged to the investigated responses. Theoretically, our method possesses a stochastic intelligence that ‘flies-by’ without being gaged against any statistical entity that might resemble to the concept of the unexplainable error. Nevertheless, the approach intimately conforms to leading edge tendencies in information technology to facilitate forecasting under unknown and unknowable disturbances (Cicerone, Di Stefano, Schachtebeck, & Schobel, 2012).

The type of the sampling schemes that will be adopted in the developments that follow have been in accord to the non-linear OAs insomuch as they are regularly embraced in the recent information and knowledge engineering research (Chang, Chen, & Liao, 2010; Chang & Chen, 2011; Khaw, Lim, & Lim, 1995; Kim & Yum, 2004; Lin & Jules, 2006; Wang & Huang, 2007). Finally, our formalism is distinguishable in another practical aspect that of being indifferent to the so-called sparsity assumption (Besseris, 2009b). Sparsity is a binding notion for quite a few methods that aspire to process saturated OA datasets. In simple terms, this means that without the sparsity assumption several techniques that depend on it are rendered inoperable. Sparsity takes for granted that only a small number of the examined effects will turn out to be statistically significant. From a knowledge discovery standpoint, sparsity discounts in advance the key role of the examined effects. In other words, sparsity is naturally biased against the anticipated extent of influences on the investigated phenomenon. Henceforth, the sparsity postulation has been rescinded in our developments to the benefit of exploring the total content of information without any preset restrictions on how much information should be eventually extracted from the profiling endeavor.

The measurement of web site performance has been linked directly with corporate overall performance for a wide spectrum of organizational types (Welling & White, 2006). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to acquire and further develop techniques that conveniently and efficiently metamorphose web usage data to propitious knowledge discovery (Liu, 2011; Raju & Satyanarayana, 2008). The ideal tactic to gain knowledge regarding web-page performance issues is to examine weblog transactions (Facca & Lanzi, 2005). Integrating web data which may emanate from multifarious streams, ranging from page-accessing to querying information, offers new grounds for exploratory work on web analytics (May & Lausen, 2004). Several grassroots techniques exist for data-mining website behavior, particularly when the webpage view behavior has been captured through well-planned queries (Mecca, Mendelzon, & Merialdo, 2002; Mena, 1999). Data preparation techniques that consolidate structured sampling and efficient collection schemes are deemed as highly desirable particularly when information is required for characterization of World Wide Web browsing patterns (Cooley, Mobasher, & Srivastava, 1999). Subsequently, the problem of screening and optimizing complex web-site properties has attracted modern data-processing treatments which indicate that there is a great anticipation for further research on this subject (Asllani & Lari, 2007). To assist in setting up screening studies, several web search quality measures have been proposed which lend themselves to efficient data mining (Sufyan Beg, 2005a; Sufyan Beg, 2005b; Sufyan Beg & Ahmad, 2007). Indicative examples for tracking web site enhancement may include consideration of quality measures that address the theme of information overload as well as the issue of tracing search depth capability (Lin, 2006).

An effort is attempted to enhance the performance of web-page loading time in conjunction with the important input relayed from concurring customer satisfaction data. In this study the three characteristics to be measured are: (1) the time to first visual (TFV), (2) the total loading time (TLT) and (3) customer satisfaction (CS). TFV which is also known as “time to first paint” or “time to start render” is the time it takes for a viewer to identify the onset of a page content (Sterne, 2002; Croll & Power, 2009). TFV measures web page loading efficiency in the time span from which a web page URL has been keyed-into a browser window to the time the user detects the first visual element on the browser window. During this time the user is looking at a blank page. Viewers desire this time interval to be instantaneous if possible. Correspondingly, TLT (also known as “time to display” or “time to full screen”) readings were collected when the web page was completely loaded. TLT signifies the time interval from which a web page URL has been entered on the browser window to the time the HTML document has been fully displayed. Again, viewers demand that this time to be instantaneous. TFV and TLT are measured in ms, respectively. CS has been measured in a five-point Likert-type scale where the maximum satisfaction level is allotted to a value of 5.

We screen the concurrent behavior of the above three responses by profiling the following four controlling factors which was thought that may influence directly the page-content transactions: (1) the number of Cascading Style Sheets files (CSS), (2) the number of JavaScript files (JS), (3) the number of Image files (Im) and (4) the Domain Name System aliasing (DNSA). Meanwhile, there was a lack of any succinct knowledge regarding whether the ensuing trends were to be monotonously increasing or decreasing with respect to each effect when contrasted against each response individually. Therefore, it was decided to select a sampling scheme that is known to accommodate scoping potential non-linear effects, if they were present. One scheme that allows testing for four factors simultaneously while tracking alternating slope tendencies is the L9(34) OA (Taguchi et al., 2004). To plan a dataset collection with an L9(34) OA, it requires setting-up trials adjusted at three distinct settings per investigated controlling factor. The selected experimental settings are listed in Table 1
                         in terms of their corresponding controlling factors which are also expressed in coded form for convenience in referencing them. As a side note, it needs to be clarified here that for CSS and JS files, the zero count setting was achieved by inlining the code while converting Im files to base64 coding.

Data collection was attained by the real browser monitoring tool of WatchMouse™ on transactions performed on the managed web-hosting by Liquid Web®. The web page tested in this research had typically about 5million visitations per month while the content size fluctuated in loads of about 3MB depending on the respective trial set-up. The step-by-step procedure for carrying out the web experiments as well the data manipulation of the supporting weblogs is detailed by Ziogas (2012). At the inception of this project, data from the scheduled transactions were gathered for ten consecutive days. That time frame was appointed arbitrarily and in the absence of any prior knowledge with respect to an anticipated degree of repeatability for the planned trials. Estimating statistically the sufficiency of the number of conducted replicates was to be determined a posteriori by inspecting all possible cross-correlations among the repetitive data. Therefore, exhibiting high correlation coefficients among replicates would provide a means of quantifying repeatability by establishing a satisfactory level of statistical significance. This last assumption is acceptable in the particular context of this research because we deal with characteristics that are not dynamic. Additional data would have been gathered, if they were needed, until repeatability was resolved in case where there was not a satisfying outcome from the initial dataset. The nine-run experimental recipe has been compiled in Table 2
                         where increasing run numbers have been assigned to each trial combination for ease of reference. All data processing in this article has been carried out with the software package MINITAB 16.0. Exact runs-tests and correlations have been calculated through the statistical software SPSS 19.0.

We describe the concurrent multi-response, multi-factorial screening of replicated trials. Data are engineered by a typical orthogonal array (OA) which is also selected to bridge over detection capabilities for non-linearity. A convenient choice for a generic three-level (setting) OA is considered suitable, and thus implemented, in treating simultaneously the potency of the examined effects along with curvature tendencies. Moreover, three-level arrangements are highly economical since data generation is maintained to an absolute minimum for detecting an underlying non-linearity. Technically, pure three-level OAs permit probing at two predefined operating endpoints and one intermediate setting for all investigated controlling factors in the collection scheme. An accessible way of constructing easily non-linear experimental designs is to adopt Taguchi-type OAs (Taguchi et al., 2004) of the L
                           n
                        (3
                           k
                        ) family (n
                        =number of runs, k
                        =number of tested effects). Therefore, L
                           n
                        (3
                           k
                        ) OAs are assumed in the developments that follow. For illustrational purposes, the L9(34) OA will be showcased particularly in more detail by the end of this outline since it suits directly the case study that follows in the next section.

We consider any arbitrary L
                           n
                        (3
                           k
                        ) OA where the investigated factors are labeled as X
                        1, X
                        2, …, Xk
                        . Then, their respective predetermined settings may be written simply as X
                        1
                        
                           j
                        , X
                        2
                        
                           j
                        , …, Xkj
                         (j
                        =1, 2, …, n). Furthermore, we consider examining a number of m characteristics that comprise of the responses Y
                        1
                        , Y
                        2
                        …Ym
                        . The generated responses may be identified in terms of r-replicated run-entries symbolized as: y
                        1
                        
                           jl
                        , y
                        2
                        
                           jl

                         (j
                        =1, 2, …, n; l
                        =1, 2, …, r). A comprehensive depiction of the relevant input/output DOE arrangement where factors and responses are positioned on the left- and right-hand side of the design, respectively, is shown in Fig. 1
                        .

Since the use of fractional factorial designs often reflects a situation where probing is to be constrained by finite sampling, the need for deploying practical and resistant measures with a substantial breakdown-point performance is apparent. In exploratory studies where information is extracted from minimal data volumes, suppression of breakdown point performance may become crucial in hindering robust decision-making. In our multi-response data reduction strategy, we will attempt first to compress the r-replicates for each of the m generalized responses down to merely two meaningful yet robust components for each response individually. One component will be based on the median (Med) measure which is a well-known robust estimator for capturing the central tendency of the r-replicates (Conover, 1999; Hoaglin, Mosteller, & Tukey, 2000). When data mining against unknown and possibly intermixed distributions, information may be obfuscated if the selected estimator yields a low break-down point. The median estimator possesses a known breakdown point of 50%, while the more commonly used alternative which is the mean measure may easily be upset since it is floored by a breakdown point of 0% (Hubert, Rousseeuw, & Van Aelst, 2008). For a particular response, q, and a given trial run, s, respectively, the relevant entries to undergo compression will be the set of {yqsl
                        } for l
                        =1, 2, …, r. To obtain a median estimation, the elements in {yqsl
                        } are rank ordered to {y′
                           qsl
                        } for l
                        =1, 2, …, r, where y′
                           qs
                        
                        1
                        ⩽
                        y′
                           qs
                        
                        2
                        ⩽⋯⩽
                        y′
                           qsr
                        . Then, we need to prepare the positioning point (p) formula (Hoaglin et al., 2000). If r is odd then p is defined as:
                           
                              (1)

The median operation in terms of the column arrangement provided in Fig. 1 for the qth characteristic is better now explained in Fig. 2
                        . To complete the stochastic description of a replicate dataset, a robust estimator will be needed indicating the extent of dispersion for the inspected data. An appropriate choice to measure robustly the spread of the data is the interquartile range (IQR) (Hubert et al., 2008). The IQR provides a parametric estimate of the replicate dataset variation while maintaining a non-parametric nature in gaging the characteristic estimate. IQR inference is also computationally inexpensive offering another incentive to adopt it. Likewise to median measure properties, the IQR as a dispersion measure fends off more effectively low-quality data and other intrusions since its breakdown point is set at 25%. Thus, in contrast to the ordinary candidate for variance estimation, i.e. the standard deviation – which possesses a breakdown point of 0% – the IQR is received as a justifiably advantageous alternative. To compute an IQR estimation, we need to borrow the non-central location measures of the first (Q
                        1) and third (Q
                        3) quartiles. By definition then: IQR

                        Q

                                 1

If Q, Q′ are not integers but half-way between two integers, then the mean value of the two integers will represent their magnitude.

For any other case, Q, Q′ are rounded off to the closest integer.

In Fig. 3
                        , the IQR compression process is exhibited for the qth characteristic in terms of the DOE arrangement of Fig. 1. Up to this stage, an important step has been attained in compacting the r-replicated data for the m-characteristics in two distinct ‘co-responses’ reflecting location and dispersion tendencies in a more concrete manner. The original input/output DOE representation of Fig. 1 has now been summarized robustly in terms of the median and IQR estimators displayed in Fig. 4
                        . At this point, it is imperative to check for possible correlations between the median and IQR columns within each characteristic individually. Only in the case that it turns out that they are both uncorrelated, we may proceed with including both entities in the non-parametric transformation step that follows. If the outcome is that they are strongly correlated then both measures essentially transmit the same information and thus one of them is redundant and may be omitted in any subsequent data processing. Since the generalized profiling framework we present in this work is not restricted by the normality hypothesis, the Kendall’s τb
                         correlation coefficient will be employed to check the level of association between the two measures (Conover, 1999). Equally important is to check at this moment the degree of association across medians for all characteristics and to repeat this process with the IQR vectors. Again, the Kendall’s τb
                         correlation coefficient may be used for this screening. The median response of a characteristic that will be found to correlate with that of some other characteristic(s) median response may be dropped since processing correlated characteristics only offer redundant information. The same argument holds for the correlation treatment across their corresponding IQR responses.

Next, the data compressed representation of the responses in Fig. 4 receives a separate rank-ordering for the median and IQR vectors for each characteristic individually. This transformation is elucidated in Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                        , respectively. The relative non-parametric quantities become simply now RMij
                         and RIQRij
                         (i
                        =1, 2, …, m; j
                        =1, 2, …, n). This rank-ordering is useful for three reasons: (1) it alleviates the perplexity of dealing with possibly multiple data distributions, (2) it facilitates concurrent handling of median and IQR estimator processing within a characteristic, and (3) it homogenizes the way that data processing will be incurred among characteristics in order to eventually propel an overall synchronous screening that takes in account the behavior from all characteristics. Therefore, the stage is set to accumulate all non-parametric median contributions from all characteristics to a ‘total median’ response. To achieve this, we adopt the mechanism for preparing the super-rank response for unreplicated-saturated multi-response profiling studies (Besseris, 2009c, 2010c). Before offering a proposal of how to apply this concept for the present situation, we introduce the added feature of our method that of allowing weights to be inserted among different responses. The role of weights is to place an emphasis on some of the examined responses over the rest, in case such information is available before the concurrent profiling commences. The weights are denoted as wi
                         (i
                        =1, 2, …, m) where in general the following relationship holds among them:

                        The process of aggregating the squared and weighted RMij
                         and RIQRij
                         quantities is shown in Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                        , respectively, leading correspondingly to the two totaled responses properly denoted as RMTi
                         and RIQRTi
                         (i
                        =1, 2, …, n). Both of the last two responses have accumulated the overall weighted central tendency and variation contributions in distinct separate accounts embodying simultaneously the information contained by all characteristics. However, there is an exception with respect to the viability of the operations shown in Figs. 7 and 8 that ought to be discussed here. It might be occurred from the previous step (Figs. 5 and 6) that some of the m median and/or IQR responses have been eliminated from further consideration as redundant. Ostensibly, a complication arises if the count of the remaining median and IQR responses that will enter the summation operations (Figs. 7 and 8) is not equal. Eventually, the RMT and RIQRT response entries may not be represented comparably in terms of a common basis for magnitude because one of the two will contain a larger number of summed elements. To remedy this in our formalism, we only need to normalize the intermediate quantities that participate in the summing operation (Figs. 7 and 8) by dividing the total sums with their corresponding number of elements that have been partaking in the summation. It is pointed that if the number of components in the summation operation remains equal after the elimination round for both types of responses, then the transactions would not require the normalization step. Therefore, the aggregation operations demonstrated in Figs. 7 and 8 hold as they are. Nevertheless, this time the upper limit index in the summation should be a number less than m. The RMT and RIQRT are already cast in uniform scale-less quantities that may be visualized as the squared elements of two n-dimensional vectors. Therefore, the RMT and RIQRT vectors may be added now to create the total contribution derived from location and dispersion effects concurrently from all engaging characteristics. The new vector entity that emanates from the joining of the two contributions is symbolized as Vi
                         (i
                        =1, 2, …, n) and its relationship with the RMT and RIQRT vectors is displayed as a matter of clarity in Fig. 9
                        . The V-vector receives one final rank ordering that aids in collapsing the statistical processing part of this technique to the equivalent of saturated-unreplicated problem encountered in the non-linear OA non-parametric treatment case (Besseris, 2012). This last re-rank transformation creates the master-response, MRi
                         (i
                        =1, 2, …, n) which is shown in Fig. 10
                        . The essence of this multi-transformational procedure outlined in this section was to facilitate the profiling process for the non-linear multi-response multi-factorial OA data where repetitive experiments have been collected as presented in the arrangement of Fig. 1. It comes to light that the information content of Fig. 1 may be compressed finally down to form a master vector, MR, which permits a great simplification of the initial problem to the arrangement shown in Fig. 11
                        .

We may now envisage solving the replicated multi-response profiling by reverting to the ordinary non-linear non-parametric treatment for unreplicated-saturated OAs.

Before providing a brief review of how to profile unreplicated-saturated OA schemes, we adapt the non-parametric analysis part to exemplify specifically the standard L9(34) OA. This OA choice is congruent to the size of the design necessitated for the exhibited case study undertaken in the next section. Hence, the generalized arrangement derived in Fig. 11 may now be explicitly systematized for the L9(34) OA in Fig. 12
                        . In Fig. 12, the four considered factors have been labeled as A, B, C and D, while the numbering within each column reflects each of the three coded factor settings without loss of any generality (Taguchi et al., 2000).

Based on the MR-vector, the effects will be rank-summed in order to estimate the P-statistic (Besseris, 2010d). The Pi
                        -statistic (i
                        =1–3) has been developed to be a versatile measure in gaging the statistical significance for one-factor, two-factor, and multi-factor performances. In order to accrue the uni-, bi- and multi-factor rates, it is necessary first to compute the sums of squared master rank-sums (SSMRS). To proceed with the evaluation of the SSMRS, we provide its generalized form first for each effect l (l

In this situation, the SSMRS will be expanded for the four coded factors as derived in Fig. 12. The four respective quantities are denoted as SSMRS

The critical values for the respective group of Pi
                        -statistic estimations are easily retrievable from the corresponding reference distributions listed separately for each group in Table I of the referenced work in Besseris (2010d).

The data manipulation procedure is progressed without any explicit assumptions on the distributional make-up of either the collected replicate data series or trial-run trends among the executed OA recipes. As such our technique is inherently deft in tracking and harmonizing data from multifarious origins without any knowledge about their stochastic fingerprinting. Moreover, since the contrasting scheme is not dependent on the variation amassed from the inert effects, hence our proposal is also calibration-free. This allows searching naturally for influence superiority without decoupling nonlinearity from the scheme. Our solver does not envisage the data conversion phase as a pure location contrasting process. Instead, its algorithm is made agile enough such that not to preclude dispersion information from entering the statistical engine. No specific assumptions are declared for the potential noise intrusions in the replicate observations. The technique should remain operable even if undetected oddities have found a way to invade the recorded measurements. Any deviant contributions are automatically dealt with the innately deployed robust estimators that promptly shun irregularities as outliers or extreme points.

@&#RESULTS@&#

The data output for the three investigated web site responses has been reproduced separately in three sub-sections (Appendix A). TFV and TLT column data express collectively mean responses out of 288 daily samples (Ziogas, 2012). Similarly, CS output was assembled from evaluations provided by a panel of ten viewers which had direct experience with the scheduled transactions (Ziogas, 2012). Additionally, any reference to selected groups of summary/descriptive statistics for various factor settings have also been appended for on-line publication due to editorial restrictions. The summary outputs cover all three tested responses at selected runs where a pronounced deviation from normality is exhibited.

A pre-processing data screening was initiated by inspecting for clues about the distribution make-up of the replicate group generated for each of the nine runs and for each response individually. A mere inspection of summary statistics per factor-setting revealed that there was a rampant differentiation from run-to-run often manifesting a dubious stochastic identity. Formalization of this deviation was assisted by the accompanying Anderson–Darling (AD) test results. In spite of being atypical to normal distribution, the majority of the AD test scores is localized at a significance level range of 0.05–0.10. This last hint renders decision making difficult with respect to considering a single underlying distribution or more. Indicatively, for the TFV, TLT and CS responses, the deviating replicate-groups are identified with: (a) runs # 1, 3, 6 and 8, (b) runs # 1, 3 and 8, and (c) runs # 3, 4, 6, and 7, respectively. In total, this translates to about 44% of the sample observations of either TFV or CS and 33% of the sample observations for TLT tend to derail replicate randomness. What makes this study even more interesting is that the p-value variation for the AD test ranges from highly significant outcomes such as that identified for the CS output for run # 6 (p
                        <0.005) to more challenging outcomes such as that identified with the TLT sample for run # 8 (p
                        =0.089). Moreover, contrasting the mean and median approximations in terms of the 95% confidence intervals demonstrates performance alterations among the two measures for TFV, TLT, and CS. Such alterations may spring out due to the dramatic fluctuations in the shape measures, skewness and kurtosis, furnished by in the summary-statistics tables. Indeed, variations in skewness range from −0.20 (TFV run #1) to −2.24 (CS run #6) signifying that the level of skewness in the samples transcribes a path from approximately symmetric to highly skewed. Interesting is the switching of the signs in the skewness calculations that connotes that there may be an intermixing of left- and right-skewed data. Moreover, the sample data are consistently plutykurtic with excess kurtosis extending to a value as much as about −6 (CS run #3). This may insinuate some distinct differences in the hidden probability distributions for all three individual responses that remain unknown to us to the extent that those datasets have been engineered. It should be mentioned that since the CS output was restricted to the more simplistic Likert-type scale, the behavior for the CS characteristic is not necessarily foreseeable. Therefore, two kinds of temporal measurements are pitted against psychometrical data. This crossing makes interesting the handling of the ensuing concurrent statistical filtering where continuous numerical scaling (TFV, TLT) will be blended seamlessly with categorical ordinal scaling (CS) to produce a homogenized master response. Overall, then, we realize that there is a great intermixing of a group of normal and non-normal replicate datasets. At this state, simplifications are not encouraged to be rendered by possibly promoting a uniform model assembled for different types of measurement scales. Clearly, the need for a non-parametric approach becomes now more prominent for this present perplexing situation. Before commencing the multi-response robust data reduction and rank-ordering transformation procedure, as outlined in the previous section, a dataset evaluation is beneficial to ensure that repeatability concerns have been alleviated. Therefore, the ‘runs-test’ was performed for the ten-replicate datasets for each of the nine trial combinations of the L9(34) OA with respect to the TFV and TLT responses. Both responses achieved p-values from the exact runs-test (two-tailed) that there were found to be of equal or greater magnitude than 0.3 (SPSS 19.0). Hence, replicate sequencing exhibited randomness in a non-parametric sense. Correspondingly, the CS data were tested through item response analysis to check self-correlation among the repetitions since the entries were based on the five-point Likert-scale. It is well-known that the information function emanates directly from the item response through the reliability function (De Ayala, 2009). Cronbach’s α is a popular reliability coefficient for measuring the internal consistency of a psychometric test result. The item response analysis was carried through the Item Analysis module of MINITAB 16.1. It was found that Cronbach’s α to be 0.92 which is well over the typical cutoff point of 0.9 for excellent internal consistency. Thus, there is a strong indication regarding the high reliability of the CS output. No time-dependent trending was detected by SPC for any of the three responses after variable-charting for individuals the replicate observations (Shewhart, 1986). At this point, it becomes apparent that additional data generation would be redundant. Hence, the data engineering part of the study necessitated no further intervention.

The original dataset is reduced and split to the partial responses, Med and IQR, as listed in Table 3
                        . Within each characteristic, the degree of association between the Med and IQR vectors is tested using the Kendall’s τb
                         correlation coefficient. It was found that for TFV, TLT and CS, the corresponding correlation coefficients were: 0.444 (p
                        =0.095), −0.278 (p
                        =0.297) and −0.114 (p
                        =0.718). We concluded that at a significance level of 0.05 there is no indication of association within the three pairs. Furthermore, the three pairs of Med responses were tested to check another possibility for correlated characteristics. Paired correlations for TFV–TLT, TFV–CS and TLT–CS revealed that τb
                         was estimated to be 0.056 (p
                        =0.835), −0.774 (p
                        =0.006) and −0.031 (p
                        =0.913), respectively. It immediately stands out that the relationship between the median vectors for TFV and CS is significant at a level of 0.05. This association is judged as rather moderate since the correlation coefficient is near but below a value of 0.8. Since this is a borderline case, it is not clear at this stage that retaining all three median-reduced responses will or will not furnish more information in the non-parametric profiling. Thus, three scenarios will be undertaken in the data analysis that ensues in order to quantify the need for inclusion of both, TFV and CS, median responses. In the first scenario, all median vectors will undergo the rank ordering process that follows. The second and third scenario will unfold excluding each time either the median-reduced response of CS or TFV respectively. For completeness, the corresponding correlation coefficients for the IQR response for the three pairs TFV–TLT, TFV–CS and TLT–CS were computed to be 0.000 (p=1.00), −0.272 (p
                        =0.355) and −0.272 (p
                        =0.355), respectively, providing no further evidence for possible association among them at a level of significance of 0.05.

Inasmuch as it is intuitive that customer satisfaction will diminish as TFV increases, there is not enough ground to completely omit yet either TFV or CS from entering the screening process. To simplify matters at this point of the investigation, we will consider that all responses carry the same weight in terms of importance as they are forwarded towards the synchronous profiling stage. Rank-ordering all six median and IQR responses from Table 3 results in a new set of non-parametric vectors, TFVRM, TVFRIQR, TFTRM, TFTRIQR, CSRM, and CSRIQR which have been recreated in Table 4
                        . On the same table, the non-parametric total effect has been accumulated in the response V which upon one final rank ordering produces the desirable master-response, MR.

Following the manipulations dictated by Eqs. (5)–(22), the relevant composite rank-sums ought to be prepared from each tested effect separately. In Table 5
                        , the master rank-sums (MRS) have been formed along with the squared rank-sums (SMRS). Comparing the values of the sums of SMRS (SSMRS) in Table 5, it is easily discerned that the effect hierarchy in decreasing order should be: (1) JS, (2) CSS tied with DNSA and (3) Im. In Table 6
                        , single and composite effects are contrasted completing the statistical filtering process. Only JS possesses a P
                        1 value of 801 (p
                        =0.050) which is statistically significant at a 0.05 level. This means that the JS-effect is the outright dominating factor in the group. Single-factor testing offers a view of that effect that is prominent (if it exists) against a background that that has been veiled by the interjected variation of the other three controlling factors in addition to the potentially unknown and unknowable manifestations.

The two-factor composite contrasting returns a P
                        2 value of 1502 (p
                        =0.088) which is statistically significant at a level of 0.10 and implicates both CSS and DNSA as the second most powerful effects (Table 6). Finally, the three-way composite contrasting reveals that the P
                        3 performance is not sufficient to promote the remaining Im effect as potent. Thus, Im should be filtered out. From Table 5, it is observed that the shape of the master response is affected in a non-linear fashion. Specifically, JS registers a peak MRS value of 21 in the middle setting (JS=4) where there is a drop-off limited only at the endpoint values. On the other hand, CSS and DNSA seem to sustain an up and down trend for their respective low to high settings. These trends become more pronounced by alternatively observing the tendencies of the V-response from Table 4 when cast in the ordinary main effects plot for means in Fig. 13
                        . Strictly speaking, the information presented in Fig. 13 is essentially subjective because it does not materialize to statistical fingerprinting. However, it facilitates perception by providing an intuitive angle for quantifying the relative strength among the effects. Now, we may note that the Im-effect does not muster any variation in order to perturb at all the V-response. On the contrary, the DNSA effect could compete with the CSS effect. This is in agreement with the two- and three-way composite outcomes captured by the P
                        2 and P
                        3 statistics in which DNSA was also admitted in the list of prevailing factors. The two- and three-effect composites returned a p-value of 0.088 (with JS) and 0.071 (with JS and CSS), respectively (Table 6). For future studies, it may be insinuated from our findings that the CSS-setting value of 0 may be abandoned. Instead, the upper endpoint should be stretched to a higher value for investigating opportunities to incite greater overall performance. In summary, the concurrent screening of the three characteristics indicates that optimum factor settings for this investigation are: 0 files for JS, 6 files for CSS and no DNSA. Practically, this may be paraphrased as that JS files should be kept to a minimum for an overall optimum performance.

To appreciate better the types of dependencies that surfaced during the profiling procedure, each response should be assessed individually. Three separate main effects plots have been prepared with input data from Table 4 where the squared rank quantities for Med and IQR entries have been consolidated to form a single representative entity for TFV (SRTFV), TLT (SRTLT) and CS (SRCS) in Fig. 14
                        . From this last figure, it is distinguishable that the JS, DNSA and CSS are reckoned as the prime influences through their partial influence in the SRTFV, SRTLT and SRCS vectors, respectively. Nevertheless, the predominant concave shape of SRCS due to JS (Fig. 14c) seems to dictate the trend observed for the V-vector in Fig. 13.

An attempt will be made now to decipher the information content of the input shown on Table 4 accepting that the median CS response might be considered as correlated to the corresponding median response for TFV. This leads to omitting the median CS response from any further statistical processing. Averaging the squared contributions of the two remaining median vectors and compiling them to the corresponding average value for all three available IQR vectors we recalculate the MRS, SMRS and SSMRS quantities as shown in Table 7
                        . Immediately, it is observed that this action causes a weakening of the JS effect on the overall screening effort in spite of being statistically important at a 0.1 level (Table 8
                        ). Similarly, the two-effect composite testing promotes only JS and CSS as the only active effects with a p-value of 0.062. The corresponding tracing of the SRTFV curve (Fig. 14a) shows that its shape is more open and extended on the upper endpoint limit due to JS. This comes in contradiction with the outcomes when retaining the median vector for CS. As a matter of consistency, we repeat the same procedure this time reversing the roles for TFV and CS. It is the median response for TFV that now is excluded from the transformations that come next. Again, the computed MRS, SMRS and SSMRS are tabulated in Table 9
                         and statistical inference is listed in Table 10
                        . There is a change in the magnitude of the leading SSMRS values but the overall picture stays the same. JS appears to dominate again the one-effect contrasting but only at a statistical significance of 0.086 which is cruder than when all input components were allowed being represented (Tables 5 and 6). The overall prediction leads to the identical decision as far as retaining JS as the preponderant effect but now DNSA joins the active list. Surprisingly, the p-value from Table 10 for P
                        2 is exactly the same of that from Table 8 at 0.062. This agreement is interpreted as that the bottom line is that omitting either the median response of TFV or CS causes the same alteration in the information delivery process with factors CSS and DNSA switched. Nevertheless, the sharper predictions obtained from our initial inferences (first scenario) indicate that the all six partial inputs should be included in the computations.

Finally, we provide a demonstration of the technique with the use of weights by placing emphasis on CS (w
                        2
                        =0.5) against either of the other two characteristics (w
                        2
                        =0.25). In Table 11
                        , we list the SSMRS performance for each factor. The JS clearly outperforms the rest of the effects possessing a SSMRS value of 821. The next effect which now is the DNSA is trailing behind with a SSMRS value of 693. In the vicinity of DNSA is positioned also the CSS with a SSMRS value of 689. The individual and composite filtering through the P-statistic has been tabulated in Table 12
                        . The dominant effect JS is significant to a level of 0.05. The pairs of factors, JS–DNSA and JS–CSS, are statistically significant at a level of 0.05 and 0.10, respectively. Therefore, the first conclusion derived from this weighted processing is that the particular weight selection strengthened the JS influence. Meanwhile DNSA and CSS switched power roles, with the DNSA to be favored from the weighing as the second more influential effect. If we need to make the profiling decision-making process cruder, then CSS also joins the other two effects this time at a level of 0.10 as it may be inferred from the P
                        3 performance of JS–DNSA–CSS (Table 12). In Fig. 15
                        , the main effects plot for the weighted V response demonstrates graphically the preponderance of JS as well as its strong non-linear character.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

A proposed approach is befitting for screening modern operations in indigenous circumstances where stochastic complexity has been magnified by a barrage of intertwined known, unknown and unknowable mechanisms entering, insidiously or not, the mining landscape. The main theme of our concept is within the scope of the IPK model (Information, Preferences, and Knowledge) (Hayek, 1945). In spite of appearing as a rigid and ossified procedure, the crux of the matter in our formulation is its primitive and yet flexible non-parametric mechanism. This mechanism robustifies the preferential multi-trait multifactorial inference with minimum computations while neglecting or even suppressing inherent probabilistic idiosyncrasies among the various investigated characteristics.

Meanwhile, it is imperative to comprehend the gains realized due to our data re-engineering stance in simple economical terms. It is best illustrated by exemplifying directly to the web-page performance project in the previous section. If it was to conduct trials in the customary two-step fashion for r replicates, then the total volume would be 17·r replicate runs. This is because of screening four controlling factors solely at their two endpoints, the L8(24) OA should have preceded the usage of L9(34) OA (Taguchi et al., 2004). Thus, the total experimental capacity becomes now 8·r
                     +9·r
                     =17 r, which obviously translates to an almost 90% increase in time, cost and effort. The overall strategy entails a stealth tactic contrived in four well-discerned parts. Firstly, the engineered data are pre-processed by compressing the collected data streams with pure robust estimators. This action aids in sidetracking the main obstacle of uncovering the underlying replicate distributions for each of the n experimental combinations in the selected OA.

In other words, the data compression step actualizes in releasing succinct information while the stochastic blueprint for the replicates remains cryptic to the experimenter all through the decision making process. By the completion of this first data-reduction step, the basic premise of describing any of the examined responses, in terms of robust measures of location and dispersion, now have been met.

Secondly, intermixing diverse types of response outputs, i.e. numerical and categorical, does not undermine the concurrent data processing, as it was exemplified in our case study. A resultant joint distribution emanates from the multivariate fusion activated by the master-ranking transformation. This joint distribution is rendered enigmatic while undergoing the recommended multi-factorial non-parametric processing. But the impending statistical manipulation proceeds effectively without being hindered in absence of such knowledge. On the third part, the non-parametric non-linear multi-factorial comparison test of Besseris (2010d) is utilized to remove any inert effects from further consideration. It is this part that upholds the stealth tactic because the multi-factorial solver now is encoded to “operate under the radar” in lack of any traces about the stochastic footprint of the new holistic MR-vector.

Finally, the fourth vital ingredient in our stealth formulation is that our technique is not coerced to be transparent to the unexplainable error as MANOVA or GLM schemes are known to be. Our choice of elementary estimators that transfer information into the terminal MR-response has been the median and the IQR. This combination of the two measures as the primary compressors may fare favorably in principle when placed side by side to the popular alternative known as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR has been adopted as the main data reduction metric in DOE studies (Taguchi et al., 2004). SNR is a measure that reflects the information status of a group of replicated trials from a signal analysis point of view. The repetitive runs play the role of a signal to be quantified against an uncontrolled background noise.

The SNR translator invariably maps the replicated DOE problem to its unreplicated version. Therefore, at the saturation limit, the unreplicated multi-factorial treatment still needs to be entrusted to unconventional methods (Besseris, 2009b). As much as it is easy to interpret the practical aspect attributed to the SNR properties, a bottom-line from a statistical perspective is not possible to be reached. This is because the SNR measure does not permit replicate behavior to be communicated in the standard language of stochastics, i.e. in terms of the separate notions of central tendency and variation. This differentiation has been attained in the methodology presented in our approach with the built-in safety feature that median and IQR estimators are robust. On the contrary, SNR decodes to the reciprocal coefficient of variation (CV). For a given sample data, CV is defined by the ratio of the sample standard deviation to the sample mean. As mentioned earlier, mean and standard deviation may not be considered robust statistics under uncontrolled noise experimentation plagued further by non-existent breakdown point efficiency. For pragmatic studies which are bound to be short-handed with data, the breakdown point performance comes out to be more crucial as a first line of preventive control to ward off uncontrolled data outliers intruding uninvitedly the basic experimental structure. Both the median and the IQR are known to have substantial breakdown points. Moreover, by detaching location and dispersion measures in our proposition, our overall problem-solving strategy becomes also more flexible to one more aspect. In opposition to SNR compressor, our formalism easily allows weights to be accommodated to the median and IQR estimations in case that the experimenter is urged to favor one measure over the other. SNR is too rigid to permit investigating the influence of zooming in one measure over the other while sizing up the concurrent contribution of the examined effects. This added extension becomes obvious now and an exhibition is left to a forthcoming publication since the length of this work has already made such a demonstration prohibitive.

We compare now the performance of the competing SNR-transformations with that of our proposed dichotomous approach of combining direct information from the independent median and IQR conversions. The original data (Appendix A) have been compressed in three new SNR translated responses labeled appropriately SNR–TVF, SNR–TLT and SNR–CS (Table 13
                     ). From this point on, we carry out the same procedure as in Section 4.3. Consequently, the three resulting SNR-compressed vectors were rank-ordered and their sums of their squared ranks formed the V-response. The MR vector was reconstructed by a final rank-ordering on the ensuing V vector (Table 13). From Fig. 16
                     , we observe the strong non-linear character of the ranked-and-merged responses (V-vector) against all four examined effects. Overall, the tracing of the effects is qualitatively similar to the one presented in the corresponding Fig. 13. Particularly, it may be noticed that the non-linear influence of the effects due to JS, CSS and DNSA appear visually to be more intensified when worked-out with the SNR translator in comparison to the tendencies of the same factors which are plotted in Fig. 13. However, by repeating the sequence of calculations for arriving to the corresponding P
                     1, P
                     2 and P
                     3 statistics (Tables 14 and 15
                     
                     ), we discover that the SNR-filtered datasets do not designate any profiled factor to the active list of effects. Indeed, by inspecting the p-value performance for the respective combinations of the four effects, after forming their single and composite P-statistic evaluations (Table 15), we observe that all estimations are substantially higher that those tabulated in Table 6. SNR-filtering blurs the concurrent multi-trait profiling process. By retrogressing on the processor capability of pinpointing robust location and dispersion diagnostics, the SNR-filter potentially instigates Type II statistical errors. We conclude that the SNR is a data compressor that dampens the amount of capturing precious information in this case of monitoring webpage transactions where synchronous multi-response fluctuations have been incurred.

An immediate impact of this work was to demonstrate the capability for seamless intermixing of different data types. We witnessed in our spotlighted case study the managing of the data fusion process for two distinctly different types of measurement scales, i.e. (1) those derived from numerical continuous sources (TFV and TLT) and (2) one categorical variable of ordinal scaling (CS). Nevertheless, CS measurements were furnished in a five-point Likert-type of scale. A Likert scale facilitates enormously the expressing of categorical variables in ordinal scaling because it quantifies, even in a weak form, the direction that a desirable characteristic should follow. Moreover, the Likert scale is flexible. A maximum rating of ‘5’ may be declared from the beginning to imply either maximum or minimum trait response. Automatically, this means that a minimum rating of ‘1’ may be either a minimum or maximum response. Hence, the Likert scale always secures a monotonous direction for tracking a categorical trait. Ergo, categorizing an ordinal characteristic to one of the three possible kinds defined by Taguchi’s approach should be also applicable for Likert-scale measurements.

Thereby, the ranking operations introduced in this work become immediately effective for Likert recordings since now ranking ordinal data is rendered meaningful. Indeed, in our elaborated example, CS was defined to receive excellent rating when scoring a value of ‘5’, thus, a value of ‘1’ is the most undesirable rating with a value of 3 to be a rating of average performance.

We remind that the rank-sum compressor in Besseris (2012) formulation was restricted to providing data reduction based on assessing only central tendency (median). Therefore, this presentation is more complete since it seamlessly factors in the influence of variance in an easy and cheap manner in order to compute a non-parametric measure that expresses homogeneously any characteristic before it is compounded with other outputs to build up a single grand response (The Master Rank response). Homogeneity in data handling has been ingrained in four levels by: (1) compressing the replicated responses, (2) splitting the examined response to location and dispersion non-parametric components, (3) forming individually distribution-free responses, (4) fusing the group of the transformed distribution-free responses into a single polymorphic response. The treatment of the multi-response multi-factorial OA problem is shown to be reduced surprisingly to the uni-response case, thus, demanding no new stochastic engine for calculating statistical significances of the concurrent treatment of multiple effects and multiple responses. That last feature extends immensely the flexibility of our approach while still sustaining the sparsity-free and calibration-free attribute for greater agility in profiling effects.

Future directions should involve a proposal for administering the dynamic OA schemes. This should involve the deciphering of the behavior for inputting a signal along with a group of controlling factors and noise. Particularly challenging would be harvesting information for multiple incoming signals. This work may be extended in taking additionally in account weighing of individual response location and dispersion properties. The theory may further be developed to simultaneously consider elements for costs of information. Then, through the total profiling effort, we would seek to synchronously minimize quality costs mainly originating from poor quality data and existing inefficient processes.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A methodology was developed regarding essentially an aspect of knowledge engineering which is attributed to sizing up a set of investigated controlling factors that viably may influence the behavior of an information system under study. The data engineering part of our developments is suitable to accommodate concurrently non-linear multiple characteristics while gaging against multiple parameters. This has been achieved by selecting a proper three-level OA arrangement. A key advantage of our technique is that it has been predesigned to deliver maximum information by driving the OA-engineered data in saturated mode.

Enabling the screening for simultaneous effect potency and curvature trends reduces the economics of information harvesting. Our technique targets recognizing simultaneous relationships of multi-factor and multi-response data schemes in an unknown and possibly unknowable environment. Therefore, the statistical processor is selected to be primitive enough in the sense that no particular distribution is adopted in order to facilitate the inference process. Raw data are compressed by proven robust descriptive statistics to facilitate rank-ordering transformations that are vital for concurrent multi-response profiling. Regardless of the response data types involved, a full non-parametric treatment yields the major influences that dictate stochastically what will eventually constitute information.

A web-site performance test case was utilized to illustrate the usefulness of our concept. Three web-site characteristics were homogenized by easy-to-conduct ranking operations. The responses were related to content loading time along with customer satisfaction data. The four controlling factors comprised of three commonly expected file types and the domain name system aliasing. Three scenarios were considered with respect to handling correlations among the various partial responses. It was shown that the outcome list may be differentiated depending on how one assesses the correlation information among the examined characteristics. Also a weighted version was provided to demonstrate the flexibility of our tactics.
