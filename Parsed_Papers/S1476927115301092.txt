                  The sudden emergence of a human infecting strain of H7N9 influenza virus in China in 2013 leading to fatalities in about 30% of the cases has caused wide concern that additional mutations in the strain leading to human to human transmission could lead to a deadly pandemic. It may happen in a short time span as the outbreak of H7N9 is more and more recurrent, which implies that H7N9 evolution is speeding up. H7N9 flu strains were not known to infect humans before this attack in China in February 2013 and it was solely an avian strain. While currently available drugs such as oseltamivir have been found to be largely effective against the H7N9, albeit with recent reported cases of development of resistance to the drug, there is a necessity to identify alternatives to combat this disease, especially if it assumes pandemic proportions. In our work, we have tried to investigate for the genetic changes in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence that lead to human infection by an avian infecting virus and identify possible peptide targets to design vaccines to control this upcoming risk.
                  We identified three highly conserved regions in all H7 subtypes, of which one particular immunogenic surface exposed region was found to be well conserved in all human infecting H7N9 strains (accessed up to 27th March 2014). Compared to H7N9 avian strains, we identified two mutations in this conserved region at the receptor binding site of all post-February 2013 human-infecting H7N9China hemagglutinin protein sequences. One of the mutations is very close (3.6Å) to the hemagglutinin sialic acid binding pocket that may lead to better binding to human host’s sialic acid due to the changes in hydrophobicity of the microenvironment of the binding site. We found that the peptide region with these mutational changes that are specific for human infecting H7N9 virus possess the possibility of being used as target for a peptide vaccine.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Human cases of infection with a novel avian influenza H7N9 were first reported in China on 31st March, 2013 (Huang et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2013). 192 Confirmed cases with severe sickness and 65 deaths were reported till January 3rd, 2014.The earliest H7N9 avian influenza virus was reported from America, spread to Europe and finally arrived in Asia, but it became human infecting H7N9 only in Asia in 2013 (Bai et al., 2014). Human infection with any H7 influenza virus is rare and H7N7, H7N3 and H7N2 are the only subtypes that were found to cause human infections previously. H7N9 was also the first reported case of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus associated with human mortality. The emergence of a novel reassortant avian influenza virus causing fatalities among humans is a significant threat for public health because if it spreads through human-to-human transmission it can lead to deadly pandemic; H7N9 may have been the result of reassortment between a H9 virus strain with a H7-type hemagglutinin and a N9-type neuraminidase, the rest of the 8 segments being part of the original H9 strain (Neumann et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2013; Kageyama et al., 2013). To date, however, human infections with avian H7N9 virus in most of the cases have a history of contact with live poultry market or farms, so it seems to occur through direct contact with infected poultry (Wu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2013).

Like other subtypes of influenza A virus, H7N9 causes mild to severe disease symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may progress to severe pneumonia. Blood poisoning and organ failure are also possible in case of severe H7N9 infection. Elderly people are specifically vulnerable as it was clinically seen that subtype H7N9 causes severe flu symptoms in elderly patients (>60 years of age) with longer duration (median 41.7 days) (Guo et al., 2014; Lam et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013). It was reported that most of the patients with confirmed cases of infection were critically ill and that approximately 20% had died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi-organ failure (Gao et al., 2013). It was seen that sex difference exist in H7N9 infection: males are more susceptible to infection than females (Wu et al., 2014; Ke et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013; Cowling et al., 2013a,b).

Since the influenza virus effortlessly evolves resistance to antiviral drugs, it is more effective to prevent infection using vaccination techniques. An approach to identify human antibody responses towards H7N9 strain confirmed relatively weak protective antibody response to influenza A (H7N9), and needed multiple immunizations to achieve protective immunity (Guo et al., 2014).

Effect of drugs available to inhibit influenza A infection was also bioinformatically found to have low binding efficacy with H7N9 neuraminidase (Woods et al., 2013) which substantiates the need of a novel vaccine to protect mankind from this emerging threat. A peptide vaccine is a type of subunit vaccine in which a peptide of the original pathogen is used to immunize an organism. Peptide-based vaccination appears promising as an approach to successfully induce an anti-neoplastic immune response, without any major side effects (Izumoto, 2012).

Apart from neuraminidase, the other major surface protein of the influenza virus is hemagglutinin (HA) which is responsible for viral entry into the host cell and also has potential to induce specific antibody response during natural viral infections in humans. Our investigation focused on this protein to identify potential peptide targets for an eventual vaccine that could inhibit virus entry and proliferation ab initio; the search should also identify the specific changes that rendered low pathogenic avian influenza into a deadly human infecting virus to the extent that the hemagglutinin played a role in it. To understand what types of changes occurred in new human infecting H7N9 strains we therefore investigated mutational mismatches among 120HA protein sequences of different H7N9 strains from NCBI which included both prior to and post human infection. We found several mutational changes. Further, to understand which mutational changes are significant, we analyzed all the protein sequences to find surface exposed regions with important mutations of HA. We found eight such regions and then analyzed these peptide regions for immunogenicity and identified a region which encompasses two mutations in the receptor binding pocket in close vicinity to the bound sialic acid and has a potential to be used as a peptide vaccine for H7N9 to control its further pandemic threat, due to its high immunogenicity towards both B and T cell.

We have analyzed HA sequences of all H7N9 strains after human infection in China from NCBI database (accessed up to 14th March, 2014). We have analyzed 120HA sequences (20HA sequences from before February 2013 and 100HA sequences after February 2013, from data available up to 14th March, 2014) of H7N9 prior to and post human infection. We discarded partial sequences and focused on full length sequences only. For comparison purposes, we have also accessed full length HA sequences of H7N7 (5 sequences), H7N6 (4 sequences), H7N5 (3 sequences), H7N3 (5 sequences), H7N2 (5 sequences) and H7N1 (3 sequences) viruses on the basis that several strains of these flu types have been observed to infect human beings. Supplementary Table 2 lists the accession numbers and the descriptive IDs of all the sequences used in this work.

We have used Clustal X to compare HA protein sequences of the influenza virus strains by multiple alignment. We have aligned HA protein sequences H7N9 strains from prior and post advent of human transmission. Clustal X was also used to align HA protein sequences of H7N9 and other H7 subtypes available in our database.

To extract the solvent accessibility profile we have chosen single H7N9 representatives from database of mutant H7N9 and subjected them to the solvent accessibility prediction server (the SABLE server) (Adamczak et al., 2005). The prediction algorithm of the server is neural network based and it has classification accuracy between 77% and 78.4% for all three states of a protein structure (Adamczak et al., 2005). The server generates relative solvent accessibility index for each amino acid ranging from 0 to 100 signifying how much of the residue is exposed to the solvent (100—complete exposure). The results (i.e., generated numbers) for each amino acid position are then subjected to a shifting window scan, where the average solvent accessibility (ASA) is measured for the peptide stretch covered by the window (14 amino acid long), and the next ASA value is generated by shifting the window by one position and so on until the complete length of the sequence is covered. Then ASA values for each amino acid position are plotted leading to an average solvent accessibility profile from the overlapping windows for the entire protein sequence (Ghosh et al., 2010). Our choice of 14 amino acid window size in this study is also based on previous reports that a 14-amino acid peptide is more potent antigenically compared to smaller peptides (Multhoff et al., 2001). In our investigation, from the peaks of the plot we detected 12 regions with high solvent exposure. For confirmation this was done for ten more mutant H7N9 sequences from the protein sequence database and the same set of peptide regions were found.

The ASA profile was further tested by submitting the same set of sequences to three other ASA prediction servers: the I-TASSER, HHpred and Jpred. All the servers’ predictions generate essentially similar results, and are comparable to the SABLE results.

Variability of selected sequences throughout the HA sequence pool were identified by graphical sliding window method (GSWM). The calculation of GSWM is done on a 20-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system used for graphical representation and numerical characterization of protein sequences (Nandy et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2012). In this method each amino acid is assigned to one of the Cartesian axes, say the i-th axis, and occurrence of the amino acid in the sequence causes the count for that axes, i.e. xi
                        , to increase by 1. Doing this sequentially for each amino acid as they appear in the sequence leads to a sequence of points in the 20D grid that traces out a 20-dimensioanl curve in the hyperspace which cannot be visualized but which is amenable to numerical computation.

                        , for small sequences one can add an arbitrary long sequence, say one instance each of each amino acid, i.e., a 20-aa peptide sequence, to all the sequences and compute their pR
                         values for comparison purposes.

We used this approach to compute pR
                         values of 14 aa (amino acid) peptides of our HA sequences. For each sequence, we subject the entire sequence to a shifting window scan where the protein descriptor, pR
                         (enhanced by the prefix sequence), is measured for the peptide stretch covered by the window, and the next pR
                         value is generated by shifting the window by one position and so on until the complete length of the sequence is covered. All the 120 H7N9 sequences of HA were analyzed by this method and the number of different values of the pR
                         that results at each position was determined. Variability of pR
                         values at each window at each amino acid position over all the HAs was then compared to determine which peptide stretches varied the least, implying relative conservativeness of those peptide stretches.

We have looked for prospective epitope regions in the surface exposed segments of HA sequences predicted by SABLE server (http://sable.cchmc.org/). It is well-known that optimal protective immune response against influenza is B cell mediated response (Stanekova and Vareckova, 2010), which requires presentation and recognition of antigen by T cell (Ghosh et al., 2012). IEDB server (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/bcell/iedb_input) has been used for predicting MHCII binding and predicting cross reactivity between prospective antigen and T cell (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2009). ABCpred server (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/) has been used to predict B cell response (Saha et al., 2006). Other than continuous epitope for B cells, this server recognizes discontinuous epitopes also. To confirm our predicted region’s ability to be detected within a discontinuous epitope we analyzed the HA protein sequence by ElliPro server (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/ElliPro/iedb_input) also which determines discontinuous epitopes available in the protein based on its 3D structure.

To determine the uniqueness of the identified region the peptide sequence was subjected to NCBI protein—protein BLAST to find out any structural similarities of the identified region with other proteins. We further analyzed the sequence in PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) for 3D alignment.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Hemagglutinin plays a critical step toward avian to human infection and pandemic emergence by successful adaptation of receptor binding (Lebarbenchon and Stallknecht, 2011). Human infecting influenza viruses preferentially recognize SAα2,6 Gal (sialic acid α2,6 galactose sialyloligosaccharide receptor) whereas avian viruses preferentially recognize SAα2,3 Gal (Shinya et al., 2006). H7N9 was solely an avian infecting strain before the month of February, 2013 and then suddenly it became a fatal human infecting strain (Guo et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2013). To determine the relatedness of the influenza virus HA proteins from the H7N9 strains isolated before and after avian to human transmission, we compared the protein sequences of HA by multiple alignment (Fig. 1
                     ). HA gene consists of 1700 nucleotides (approximately) which encodes for 560 amino acids. By multiple alignment study we found several mismatches between human infecting and avian infecting HA protein (Table 1
                     ). We took A/duck/Jiangxi/3292/2009(H7N9) as a representative of only avian infecting H7N9 and A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9) as a representative of human infecting H7N9 as mentioned in earlier studies (Xiong et al., 2013). Among several mutations we detected by multiple alignment, three mutations, G195V, T198A and L235Q, were found to be present in the receptor binding pocket (Supplementary Fig. 1A). For further confirmation we aligned 520 isolates of H7N9 after 2013 February (accessed till 27th March, 2015) and 40 isolates before 2013 February which generated mostly same result for each mutation and exactly same for the three mutations at receptor binding pocket (Supplementary File 1). While comparing prior and post sequences of H7N9 we found that not only the viruses isolated from human but strains isolated from avian origin (post 2013) have the selected mismatches (Supplementary File 1). For clear comprehension we have also aligned all the human strains reported after 2013 February separately which showed complete consistency in having selected mutations in the peptide regions (Supplementary File 2). Receptor binding pocket (RBP) is a cleft in HA head (membrane distal end) region by which the virus targets and binds to sialic acid (Dortmans et al., 2013). Conserved amino acids such as Tyr98, Trp153, His183 and Tyr195 form the base region and three loops (130-loop, 190-helix, and 220-loop) form the side region of the receptor binding site (H3 numbering) (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Shi et al., 2013). Amino acids forming the cleft are directly responsible for binding to the cellular receptor by involving hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions. Changes in receptor binding pocket may have an effect on host shift as observed in other avian infecting influenza viruses (Connoret al., 1994; Chutinimitkul et al., 2010; Stevens et al., 2006; Imai et al., 2012; Herfst, 2012). The three mutations in RBP play a crucial role by significantly increasing the hydrophobicity (Table 1) of the receptor binding pocket which may cause a change in the structure and morphology of the active site region, perhaps enhancing its binding property. Shi et al., 2013 in a different study using crystallography found one of the mutations detected by us (G–V) as responsible for allowing the avian ha to bind human receptor and they also proposed that may be this mutation with some other mutation is responsible for host shifting. These mutations are specifically important because during sialic acid binding they come in close proximity. Among them, G (Avian) to V (Human) is the closest one (3.6Å) (Supplementary Fig. 1B,C). Since surface exposed features such as active sites are responsible for the virion-cellular interaction leading to endocytosis and contain immunogenic regions for antigen-antibody interactions, we investigated such features in the case of the H7N9HAs. First, we used the SABLE solvent accessibility server (Adamczak et al., 2005) to determine relative solvent accessibility of each amino acid of the HA protein of A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9) strain [taken as a representative of mutant strain] (Supplementary Table 1) and then by using GSWM method we determined average solvent accessibility for amino acid over fourteen amino acids length stretches (Supplementary Table 1) as described in the Section 2 and plotted against the amino acid position to generate an average solvent accessibility profile (Fig. 2
                     A). From the peak regions of average solvent accessibility profile plot, 8 solvent accessible regions are identified and shown in 3D representation (Fig. 2B). All the H7N9 hemagglutinins were found to have similar profile (8 surface exposed regions) in surface exposed segments measured in terms of the amino acid position (data not shown). Similar results with respect to solvent accessibility profile were detected in three other servers (I-TASSER (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/), HHpredPredictProtein; http://www.predictprotein.org/) and Jpred (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/)) (Zhang, 2008; Soding et al., 2005; Cuff et al., 1998 
                     Soding et al., 2005; Cuff et al., 1998).

The process of vaccination is utilized to induce immunity against pathogens by stimulating antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or B cells (Sesardic, 1993). CTLs recognize peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on infected cells and destroy them (Hansen and Bouvier, 2009). B cells produce antibodies that bind and neutralize pathogens (Dorner and Radbruch, 2007). Both these processes are initiated and regulated by T-helper (Th) cells that recognize antigenic peptides presented by MHC class II (MHC-II) molecules. MHC-II molecules present antigenic peptides engulfed by antigen presenting cells. Peptide regions having both Th and B cell epitope can be useful for acting as peptide vaccine (Purcell et al., 2007).

To identify whether these 8 surfaces exposed region are potentially immunogenic or not we have utilized epitope prediction servers to analyze potential of these peptides for acting as a proposed peptide vaccines. Protein sequence of HA of H7N9 (A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9)) were submitted to the IEDB epitope prediction server for T-cell binding predictions (Vita et al., 2010) with allele HLA-DRB1*01:01/ HLA-DRB4*01:01 to determine potential immunogenic regions with low IC50 values. HLA-DRB1 was selected as it contains most common alleles with respect to number (79 alleles) and HLA-DRB4 was taken due to its presence at highest percentage (40.0%) (Mack et al., 2013). Taking the best predicted response within each segment of surface exposed residues for T-cell epitopes for the H7 subtypes as a guide we found four regions that best met the criteria of solvent accessibility and good immunogenic potential. The results are given in Table 2
                     . For each combinational library percentile score and Stabilized Matrix Method percentile score show that few peptides hold quite good score for being a predicted immunogenic antigen; among them peptide stretches, VNATETVERTNIPR (shaded red in the figures), LSNTDNAAFPQMTK (blue), HHSVSTAEQTKLYG (magenta) and FLRGKSMGIQSGVQ (cyan) appear to be relatively better candidates (Supplementary Table 3). Although for MHC-II presentation, peptides must not be surface exposed but we always kept that feature as essential parameter because we tried to design a peptide which would induce both B cell and T cell response against H7N9 virus.

It has been well documented that prevention of viral infection mainly depends on humoral antibody response (Wrammert et al., 2011), so other than continuous epitopes, discontinuous epitopes are also important for generating a potential peptide vaccine. So, we elaborated our search for immunogenic peptide by analyzing HA protein structure (PDB File 4BSE) for discontinuous epitope prediction using ElliPro server (Ponomarenko et al., 2008). As shown in the result (Fig. 3
                     ), discontinuous immunogenic region with high score encompass the region IV (highlighted blue). Additionally we have used ABCpred (Saha and Raghava, 2006), an artificial neural network based B-cell epitope prediction server for predicting B-cell epitopes on the whole HA protein. This server also yields positive result for the surface exposed region IV (Table 3
                     ). Now by using GSWM method on a 20 dimensional Cartesian coordinate system explained in the Methods section, we found that region IV showed least variability in all HA Sequence set of 120H7N9 except for two positions G–V (position 195) and T–A (position 198).

The region IV, which is calculated surface exposed, immunogenic and conserved, contains two specific mutations in receptor binding pocket we detected earlier (Supplementary Fig. 1A). When we elaborated our study to H7 strains that started infecting humans (Supplementary Fig. 2), we found that with the Q–L (position 235) mutation that is associated with all the avian to human host shift (Dortmans et al., 2013), G–V (position 195) and T–A (position 198) mutation were also conserved in other human infecting H7 strains (H7N1, H7N4) (Supplementary Fig. 2) substantiating the potential role of the detected mutations in host shift. So the region IV can be a potential peptide region for a new vaccine, which could inhibit the newly emerged human infecting H7N9 strains and also be effective against other H7 influenza viruses that have potential human infecting ability as the region is conserved in all human infecting and highly conserved (86%, 2 mismatches in 14 amino acid stretch) in avian infecting H7 influenza viruses (Supplementary Fig. 1).

To determine the uniqueness of the region identified by our procedure, NCBI protein–protein BLAST (Johnson et al., 2008) search was done for the sequences to rule out the existence of a common motif, sequence or structure for the peptide segment sequences within other organisms. The result showed there are no matches with any other sequence except the influenza virus super family. Also, a further analysis for 3D structural alignment in PSIPRED server (McGuffin et al., 2000) did not yield any confirmed result for the segment. Thus, these analyzes indicate the uniqueness of the peptides, which is an important consideration for generation of unique immune response.

There were several approaches to design peptide vaccine against different viruses (Ghosh et al., 2012) as well as influenza viruses (Taia et al., 2010) but our work flow is unique as we included in our selected peptide region, the conserved mismatches which are possibly responsible changes for host sifting from avian to human in not only H7N9 but in different H7 strains.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

With the potential of human to human transmission of the H7N9 virus being under active consideration of the scientific community, and current indications of possibility of rapid growth in strains resistant to existing drugs and vaccines, alternative drugs and vaccines need to be developed rapidly enough to prevent possible pandemics as H7N9 outbreak is more frequent (Bai et al., 2014) and evolution is stepping up. Peptide vaccines targeted for conserved regions, perhaps conjugated with such vaccines from other pathogenic flu strains, could be considered for immunization and protection against multiple subtypes.

From our study we found one mutational change (G>V, position 195) in HA of all studied human infecting H7N9 strains compared to avian infecting H7N9 strains. This mutation (G>V) is very close to the receptor binding site (3.6Å) and may play a crucial role inhuman infection. So this G>V mutation along with the Q–L (position 235) mutation that is associated with all the avian to human host shift (Dortmans et al., 2013), and T–A (position 198) mutation, conserved in other human infecting H7 strains (H7N1, H7N4) (Supplementary Fig. 1), may have the potential for host shifting.

We also found a well calculated surface exposed conserved region (region IV) encompassing G (avian)>V (human) mutation that is prevalent in case of all studied human infecting H7N9, which showed insilico immunogenic properties both for T-cell and B-cell. So, it would appear reasonable to identify this region IV as a potentially proposed peptide vaccine target candidate to diminish further pandemic threat of human infecting H7N9. We understand that most of the Insilco designed peptide vaccine failed to show efficacy in reality but our approach for the study was completely insilico as wet lab study with H7N9 live virus is not ethically permitted in our country as no H7N9 infection has been found in India, although India is under high risk as it is a hot humid country with high pandemic flu alert. Due to the ethical issue we could not validate our selected peptide region but our study can encourage validation of the peptide in countries where H7N9 is serious problem.

There is no conflict of interest.
