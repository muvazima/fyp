                  We study how retailers can time their service investments when demand for a product is uncertain and consumers care both about price and service when choosing which retailer to buy from. By “service” we mean activities a retailer can invest in and which can drive traffic into the store. We consider offering extended operating hours as an example of such service and examine the timing of service investments for two competing retailers. Specifically, we analyze two retailers who compete on price and service level, and characterize both the prices and the service levels, as well as the timing of their service investment decisions. Our model also considers two effects of retailer service—the effect on total demand for the product and the effect on a retailer’s market share. We show that investing in service before demand realization, although counterintuitive, can be beneficial for competing retailers. On the other hand, a large mismatch between actual and expected demand and a low probability of high demand justifies the postponement of service investments after observing demand. We also show that the incentive to invest in service before demand realization becomes more pronounced when service investments can increase the overall demand for the product in addition to protecting market share. Our findings have important implications for retailers with regards to the timing of their service investment decisions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The holiday season is one of the biggest opportunities for retailers to lure customers and retailers use several methods to accomplish this–among others–offering extended operating hours. An increasing number of retailers are keeping their doors open longer almost every year to entice last-minute holiday shoppers. Offering extended operating hours can have an important impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions. A retailer who stays open longer than its rival typically attracts additional demand since extended hours provide consumers with more convenience and flexibility (Inderst & Irmen, 2005). As a result, offering extended operating hours has evolved as a dimension of competition and such decision is usually made considering the local competitive environment among other factors. For example, according to Sonja Pothen, Target’s spokeswoman, the decision to extend Target’s stores holiday hours several years ago was based on guest traffic, sales volume, and local competition (Deprez, 2009). Another important decision that retailers face which affects consumers’ purchasing decisions during the holiday season is pricing. One common practice that some retailers follow (especially for seasonal products) is contingent pricing which allows them to adjust pricing decisions in response to market conditions. Thus, those retailers can set higher prices when demand is high and charge lower prices when demand is low. As a case in point, Kmart would often implement a contingent sales promotion strategy for its seasonal products (Wang & Hu, 2014).

Investing in activities to draw customers into their stores, which we will be referring to as “service”, is costly for retailers. In many cases, the return on this investment is uncertain due to uncertain market conditions and retailers would eventually need to balance the costs associated with keeping their stores open longer with potential sales increases. It is interesting that despite the uncertainty involved, some retailers make their investment decisions early on but others are more cautious and want to observe customer demand before committing to such investments. For instance, several retailers announce their extended holiday hours early in the season and stick to those hours, whereas others extend their holiday hours during the holiday season and after gauging demand. As a case in point, Best Buy has followed the former strategy while Macy’s and Toys“R”Us have followed the latter strategy in the past few years by announcing extended holiday hours just before Christmas (Levin, 2011; Woodruff, 2011).

Uncertain market conditions justify flexible pricing strategies such as contingent pricing that several retailers follow. However, it is puzzling why some retailers would want to commit to service investments pertinent to extended operating hours as opposed to respond contingently to changes in the market conditions. It makes one wonder under what conditions ex-ante versus ex-post investments in service might emerge as an equilibrium in a competitive environment. In this paper we attempt to provide some answers by building a simple stylized model. We focus on ex-ante and ex-post service investments relative to demand realization such as offering extended operating hours and study the timing of these service investments for retailers who sell the same or similar seasonal products and compete on price and service. Specifically, we consider two typical strategies: a commitment strategy where retailers announce their extended operating hours ahead of the holiday season and make them effective during the season, and a non-commitment (or contingent) strategy where retailers offer extended hours during the holiday season, i.e., respond contingently to observed demand. Offering extended operating hours may or may not entail immediate costs. If the extended hours during the holiday season are covered with the current employees working overtime, retailers do not incur any costs until the holiday season starts and the extended hours become effective. However, if new employees that require training are hired to cover the extended hours, then retailers will incur immediate costs before the holiday season. In such a setting, we address the following research questions: (1) What are the prices and service levels that arise when retailers can time their service investment decisions? (2) How do investment cost and competition influence the retailers’ price and service level decisions? (3) When is the best time for retailers to invest in service? To address these questions, we consider a stylized model with two competing retailers and analyze their respective price and service investment decisions, as well as their choice between committing to service investments upfront and investing in service after demand realization. Our model also captures two different effects that service levels can have on product demand: (1) service is a necessity to avoid losing market share to competition and (2) service could enhance the overall demand for the product.

The key insight of this paper is that retailers need to carefully consider their operating environment when timing their service investments. While a monopolist would be naturally better off making investment decisions after observing demand, our analysis reveals that competing retailers would in general benefit by committing to service investments before observing demand since commitment results in lower service levels and protects competing retailers from costly investments. It is only under conditions in which the mismatch between actual and expected demand is high and the probability of high demand is low where competing retailers may be better off postponing investment decisions after observing demand. Our analysis also shows that when service increases total demand in addition to protecting market share the incentive to commit to service becomes even more pronounced. Specifically, once the demand enhancing effect of service exceeds a certain threshold, commitment becomes the unique equilibrium.

The intuition behind our key findings is as follows. When service investments do not increase demand, service competition becomes a “race to the bottom” and under conditions of low or moderate demand uncertainty retailers prefer commitment, which is the strategy that leads to lower service levels. Only when demand uncertainty is high, i.e., the mismatch between actual and expected demand is large, retailers would prefer not to commit to take advantage of much higher information precision. Nevertheless, for this benefit to outweigh the benefit of lower service levels, retailers also should expect low demand with sufficiently high probability. When service investments increase overall demand, as the demand enhancing effect increases, retailers have an incentive to provide higher service levels which result in higher service costs. A commitment strategy could curb those costs by avoiding over-investments in service. On the other hand, a non-commitment strategy allows retailers to take advantage of much higher information precision at the cost of offering higher service levels. Once the demand enhancing effect exceeds a certain threshold, the benefit of lower service levels that commitment ensures outweighs the benefit of much higher information precision. Thus, there is no incentive for retailers to deviate to non-commitment.

Our findings help to a certain extent shed some light as to why retailers would commit to service investments in the presence of competition. Commitment results in lower service levels and protects competing retailers from costly investments. On the other hand, certain retailers such as Macy’s and Toys“R”Us preferred flexible strategies such as non-commitment especially during the most recent economic downturn. This is quite consistent with our results since a low probability of high demand and a large mismatch between actual and expected demand, which resembles the characteristics of an economic recession, justify non-commitment.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review related literature. In Section 3 we present the model of two competing retailers. In Section 4, we analyze the model and study the timing of offering extended operating hours. In Section 5, we conclude.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The main stream of literature that is relevant to our work explores price and non–price competition in retail channels. Papers in that stream consider competition in price and in another dimension often referred to as “service” or “quality”. That dimension is typically desirable to consumers but costly to provide. Certain papers in inventory and operations management literatures (e.g., Bernstein & Federgruen, 2004) have considered price and service competition, where “service”, unlike our setting, denotes the availability of product to satisfy demand and “service levels” represent fill rates. We do not focus on this stream of literature in this review.

In a multi-echelon setting, Winter (1993) studies a manufacturer selling through retailers competing on price and service and finds that vertical price restraints can achieve multi–echelon coordination. Perry and Porter (1990) study a monopoly manufacturer who sells his products through “monopolistically competitive” retailers, who provide service that can have a positive effect on their rivals’ demands. Perry and Porter (1990) use the term “monopolistically competitive” to refer to a situation where each retailer takes the price–service market variable and the average service for all retailers as given when choosing price and service to maximize its profits. The authors show that resale price maintenance and franchise fees could correct the sub–optimal level of retail service. Iyer (1998) studies how manufacturers should coordinate retail channels when retailers compete on both price and quality of service and consumers are heterogeneous in their locations and willingness to pay. Tsay and Agrawal (2000) consider a single manufacturer who sells its product through two different competing retailers. They identify the structure of the wholesale pricing mechanisms that can coordinate the channel and show that the retailers are better off when they compete on price and service rather only on price. Our work is different from the aforementioned papers in several dimensions. First, they focus on the coordination of multi–echelon channels, whereas we study competition in a two–firm, one–echelon setting. Second, they do not consider stochastic demand. Third, they take the timing of service decisions as exogenous.

A few more papers consider price and non–price competition, albeit without focusing on channel coordination. Xiao and Yang (2008) study price and service competition between two supply chains and analyze the effects of demand uncertainty and retailer risk aversion on the equilibrium outcome. Dumrongsiri, Fan, Jain, and Moinzadeh (2008) study the price–service competition between two channels of the same manufacturer (direct channel and retail channel) and examine the effects of service quality, consumer sensitivity to cost, service, and wholesale price on pricing and equilibrium outcomes. Lu, Tsao, and Charoensiriwath (2011) study service and wholesale price competition between two manufacturers selling through a common retailer facing consumers who are sensitive to price and manufacturer service. They examine the importance of manufacturer service and the role of bargaining power on the interaction between the competing manufacturers and their common retailer. Gilbert, Xia, and Yu (2007) and Xia and Gilbert (2007) focus on service activities that stimulate overall demand for the product. They consider how channel structure could be affected by the extent to which end demand can be stimulated by the upstream (i.e., supplier or manufacturer) or the downstream (i.e., dealer) supply chain party. Balasubramanian and Bhardwaj (2004) study a duopoly in which firms compete on price and quality. The manufacturing and marketing managers within each firm are presented with conflicting objectives regarding cost minimization and revenue maximization, respectively, and can choose between perfect coordination and compromise through bargaining. The authors show when the manufacturing–marketing conflict has positive outcomes and thus should be encouraged. Our work is somewhat related to the last paper, as we also examine two firms’ horizontal price and non–price competition. However, our focus is on the timing of non–price decisions under competition and demand uncertainty, which is fundamentally different from theirs.

In addition to the aforementioned (mainly OM and marketing) papers, there is literature in economics that examines two-variable competition. Competition is usually on price and quality (e.g., Motta, 1993; Shaked & Sutton, 1982) or on quantity and quality (e.g., Gal-Or, 1983; Motta, 1993) and in the context of horizontal and/or vertical quality differentiation. These papers are typically concerned with characterizing the equilibria, identifying their structural properties, comparing the equilibria under price and quantity competition, characterizing welfare measures, and understanding the impact of firm entry on market equilibrium. Our work is fundamentally different from prior economic literature because we are concerned with identifying the optimal timing of non-price decisions in competitive environments with uncertain demand. From that literature, Aoki and Prusa (1997) is somewhat related to our paper in the sense that they also examine timing of investment decisions. However, their timing of investment decisions is conceptually different from ours. They consider two firms that make quality investments either simultaneously or sequentially in the first stage, followed by price competition in the second stage; we, on the other hand, consider two firms who make their investment choice before or after they observe demand. Their focus is on whether there is a first mover advantage in quality choice whereas our focus is on understanding whether committing to service investments upfront is better than delaying them.

Another stream of literature that is somewhat relevant to our work is from economics and focuses on the effect of extending shopping hours (i.e., deregulation of shopping hours) on price competition in the retail industry. There are mixed results in that literature regarding the effects of deregulation of shopping hours on prices. Clemenz (1990) shows that deregulation may lead to lower prices, as longer shopping hours can facilitate the comparison of prices in a model with consumer search. By Morrison and Newman (1983) and Tanguay, Vallée, and Lanoie (1995) prices increase at large stores and fall at small stores. Inderst and Irmen (2005) and Shy and Stenbacka (2008) show that opening hour differentiation can relax price competition. Even though we consider the scenario of extending operating hours, our main focus is different from that stream of literature. Our primary interest is in understanding when retailers should make service investments that drive traffic into their stores, such as investments in extending operating hours when they face uncertain demand. Our paper concentrates on identifying whether committing to some extended operating hours prior to the season is a preferred strategy as opposed to delaying such a decision after the season has started.

Our paper contributes to the existing literature in several dimensions. First, prior OM and marketing literature on price and service competition considered the timing of service investment decisions as fixed. By endogenizing the timing of service investment decisions, we demonstrate that a retailer needs to consider his operating environment when making such decisions. Although a monopolistic retailer should aim for flexibility by employing a non-commitment strategy, our analysis of a competitive setting suggests that a retailer facing competition should generally commit to investments before observing demand. Only a large mismatch between actual and expected demand and a low probability of high demand justify non-commitment to such investments. Second, prior literature in economics has identified some mechanisms to relax price competition. One such mechanism is offering products that are differentiated by quality (Shaked & Sutton, 1982). Another mechanism is retail shopping hour differentiation, which can be viewed as a means to increase the degree of perceived product differentiation and therefore relax price competition (Inderst & Irmen, 2005; Shy & Stenbacka, 2008). Our work identifies that service commitment can be another way to mitigate price competition. When retailers can set prices after they observe demand, committing to service levels prior to demand realization allows retailers to see the effect of their service levels on prices and consequently choose such service levels that can dampen price competition.

We consider two retailers selling a product to consumers who are sensitive to the price (p) and the service level (s) accompanied with it. Thus, consumers’ purchase decisions are influenced not only by the product’s selling price but also by the amount of service that is associated with it. In our context, “service” does not refer to the availability of product to satisfy demand, as it often appears in inventory management problems, nor does it refer to any queuing-related aspects in a retail store. Service, as we discussed in the introduction, represents different activities that can drive traffic into the store including extended operating hours. Following the same approach with prior literature (e.g., Tsay & Agrawal, 2000) we aggregate these activities, which form the marketing strategies of a retailer, into a single decision variable for the retailer. Therefore, we treat a product as a bundle of price and service. In a duopoly, the impact of service on retailers’ demand can be twofold: (1) increased service enhances overall demand for the product; (2) a superior service level allows a retailer to capture some of the competitor’s market share. The first effect is present when retailers’ service investments can convert some non–buyers to buyers. For example, new consumers might be attracted to a retail store because of its extended operating hours. In other retail settings, however, stores simply compete for a slice of a pie with fixed size.

To distill the impact of the two aforementioned effects on the timing of retailers’ investments, we will first examine a purely competitive setting, wherein service investments are a necessity to avoid losing market share to competition. Later we will consider a setting where service could enhance the overall demand for the product. In our analysis, we adopt the demand model by Balasubramanian and Bhardwaj (2004), and modify it for an environment where demand is stochastic with two possible states. Thus, demand qik
                      for retailer i at demand state k depends on prices and service levels as follows:

                      and θs
                      are measures of the intensity of price and service competition, respectively. Large values of θp
                      relative to θs
                      imply consumers whose choice of retailer is much more sensitive to prices than to service levels. The opposite is true when θs
                      is much larger than θp
                     . Following (Balasubramanian & Bhardwaj, 2004), we assume that the retailers have identical own and cross effects with respect to both prices and service levels. As a result, the retailers are symmetric in our setting. Note that they may be asymmetric along other dimensions, but we assume that those dimensions do not affect consumer choice.

                      thereby suggesting diminishing returns on such expenditures. The underlying assumption of quadratic investment cost and diminishing returns is that a store manager will always target the “lowest-hanging fruit” when making such service investments, but achieving higher levels of service will be increasingly more costly (Tsay & Agrawal, 2000). In the case of extended operating hours, a store manager could cover some additional hours with current employees working overtime. However, as the number of extended hours increases, covering the additional hours becomes increasingly more costly as the store manager would need to hire additional part-time or seasonal employees. Parameter η > 0, referred to as the “service cost factor” in Tsay and Agrawal (2000), captures the retailer’s effectiveness in service deployment. To simplify notation, we normalize the retailer’s cost of purchasing from the supplier to zero. Thus, retailer i’s profit πik

A common strategy for many retailers is to offer extended operating hours during the holiday season. Holiday sales can make up to 40% of retailers’ annual revenue, thus, retailers try to accommodate and lure last-minute gift buyers by pushing the boundaries of normal hours; some retailers even stay open for more than twenty four hours straight. When a retailer offers extended operating hours, he incurs additional labor-related expenses. Therefore, extended operating hours come at an additional cost and retailers need to balance this cost with the potential sales increase. Because of the uncertainty involved, some retailers want to have a better idea about the demand during the season before committing to certain extended operating hours and hence postpone their decision making until the demand is known. Other retailers, however, decide on their extended operating hours ahead of the holiday season and stick to this decision throughout the season. We refer to the first strategy as non-commitment and the second one as commitment. In our analysis, we focus on situations where retailers have the ability to follow either of the two strategies. Offering extended operating hours can serve two purposes: (1) longer store operating hours could allow a retailer to capture some of his competitor’s market share and (2) longer store operating hours could enhance overall demand by capturing some consumers who would not have visited and purchased at the store otherwise. We analyze first the setting where offering extended hours plays the role of protecting market share. We then extend our analysis to situations in which offering extended operating hours could increase overall product demand.

Recall that offering extended operating hours may or may not entail immediate costs. We present the scenario where extending operating hours does not entail any immediate costs. This scenario reflects situations where the extended hours during the season can be covered with current employees. We have also analyzed the scenario where extending operating hours does entail immediate costs (not presented in the paper because of space limitations) and our key results remain the same. We next discuss some assumptions that guide our analysis.

                        Assumption 1
                        Both retailers make their pricing decisions after observing demand.

This is a common assumption made in the literature that examines responsive pricing or price postponement in retailing settings (e.g., Granot & Yin, 2008; Taylor, 2006; Van Mieghem & Dada, 1999). Such an assumption reflects retailers who cannot commit to prices before they observe demand. They resort to discounts, sales, and also are more amenable to haggling with customers over price. In addition, a contingent pricing strategy is quite common for the type of products (i.e., seasonal) that we consider in our paper.

                        Assumption 2
                        The retailers can commit to service and the service levels chosen by one retailer can be observed by the other retailer.

This assumption is realistic due to the nature of service that we consider. Committing to extended operating hours can be considered credible
                        1
                     
                     
                        1
                        It is beyond the scope of our analysis to model how the retailers credibly commit to service investments; rather our goal is to investigate the conditions under which a retailer would prefer commitment versus non-commitment of service investments in a competitive environment assuming that commitment is feasible.
                      as long as the extended operating hours are publicly announced, which is typically the case. It is highly uncommon for retailers to announce extended operating hours and then renege on this commitment as it would greatly harm their reputation. Moreover, pre-announcing the extended operating hours could be associated with advertising costs which could deter retailers from making adjustments to those hours once the season has started. This assumption is also consistent with prior literature that has treated other examples of commitment (e.g., price commitment) as credible due to either reputation issues or cost considerations (e.g., Gallego & van Ryzin, 1994; Papanastasiou & Sava, 2015).

                        Assumption 3
                        When service enhances the overall demand for the product rather than protect market share, this enhancement occurs only after demand realization.

For instance, when a retailer announces extended operating hours several weeks before the holiday season, such announcement will not affect current demand. Only when the season starts and the retailer actually implements additional operating hours will this service offering enhance demand by attracting new customers into the store.

With such setting in mind, we first analyze an environment where both retailers choose the same strategy. Assuming a symmetric strategy profile, we study whether retailers’ expected profits are higher under commitment versus non-commitment. Then we model the timing of service investments as a strategic choice for retailers: each retailer can invest in service before or after they observe demand and identify the equilibrium in the timing of service investments.

When retailers invest in service before they observe demand, events take place as follows: (1) Retailers choose service levels. (2) Demand realizes. (3) Retailers choose prices. Throughout the paper we use the terms “first period” and “second period” to refer to the time periods before and after demand realization, respectively. Let si
                            denote the service level of retailer i. In the second period, retailer i’s profit is

                              Proposition 1
                              
                                 When retailers commit to service investments, there exists a symmetric pure–strategy profile with positive prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits.
                              


                           Table 1
                            summarizes the prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits. In the Appendix we present conditions on the model parameters needed to ensure that the profit functions are well behaved and that prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits are positive. Table 2
                            presents the impact of changing various parameters on retailers’ expected profits.

There are several results in Tables 1 and 2. Here we discuss the most interesting ones. First, prices are independent of θs
                           , the intensity of service competition, and η, the service cost factor. This is due to two reasons: (1) the total market size is fixed; and (2) the strategy profile is symmetric. When service levels do not affect overall demand for the product, service parameters can still affect the price a retailer charges for the product, if consumers choose one retailer over the other because of superior service. In a symmetric profile, however, retailers choose identical service levels, and thus service competition does not have any effect on prices.

A noteworthy observation in Table 2 is that expected profits are not monotonic in the intensity of price competition θp
                           . In fact, it is the term

                            that determines how profits change with price sensitivity θp
                           . When consumers are more sensitive to service than price (i.e., at small values of

                           ), retailers respond by choosing high service levels. Thus, at small values of

                            a small increase in price sensitivity results in lower service levels and a relatively large reduction in the (quadratic) cost of service investments, which outweighs the profit loss due to increased price competition. On the contrary, when consumers are more sensitive to price than service (i.e., at large values of 
                              
                                 
                                    θ
                                    p
                                 
                                 /
                                 
                                    θ
                                    s
                                    2
                                 
                              
                           ), the opposite is true and more intense price competition results in lower expected profits. The very same intuition is behind the behavior of profits with respect to the probability of low demand. When γ is low, retailers expect high demand and set high service levels. In that case, a (small) increase in γ results in lower service levels and a relatively large reduction in the cost of service investments, which outweighs the revenue loss. When γ is high, the opposite is true; if demand becomes more likely to be low, expected profits decrease.

Finally, according to Table 2, expected profits are increasing in the service cost factor η. This is key to the comparison between the commitment and non–commitment strategies. In a purely competitive setting, service does not increase overall demand for the product and service competition is a “race to the bottom”: when service only affects the consumers’ choice of retailer, investing in service is an inevitable drag to the retailers’ bottom lines. Our analysis shows that the silver lining in such a situation is that expensive service results in smaller investments.

                           Table 3
                            summarizes the retailers’ prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits. In the Appendix we present conditions on the model parameters needed to ensure that the profit functions are well behaved and that prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits are positive. Table 4
                            summarizes the effects of changing parameters on retailers’ expected profits.

                              Proposition 2
                              
                                 When retailers do not commit to service investments, there exists a symmetric pure–strategy profile with positive prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits.
                              

In both Tables 3 and 4, most of the insights we discussed earlier continue to hold. Specifically, prices are independent of all service-related parameters and expected profits are increasing in the cost factor η. Furthermore, expected profits are increasing in price sensitivity θp
                            when consumers care more about service, and start decreasing once a threshold value of θp
                            is reached. A noteworthy observation in Table 4 is that expected profits are decreasing in γ. In this setting, prices and service levels are both decided once demand is realized and therefore expected profits, which are simply expectations over the realized profits, are decreasing in γ the probability of low demand.

A critical difference between the case in which retailers commit to service levels and the case in which they do not is that service levels are different, specifically service levels under commitment are lower than service levels under non–commitment. What explains this particular phenomenon is the nature of competition, not demand uncertainty. We have shown (not presented in this paper) that this result holds with deterministic demand as well. When retailers commit to service levels first and set prices later, the higher the service level one retailer sets, the lower the price its competitor will charge as a competitive response. This sounds intuitive and is, in fact, true when retailers can observe service levels before they set prices (see Eq. (3)). On the other hand, when retailers do not commit to service investments, they cannot observe each other’s service level before setting prices. As a result, they do not take the effect of service levels on each other’s price into account when they invest in service and thus invest more. The next proposition states the implication for retailers’ profits in the two scenarios —commitment and non–commitment.

                              Proposition 3
                              
                                 In a duopoly, if investments in service do not increase overall demand, expected profits are higher when both retailers commit to service investments.
                              

Because prices and quantities are the same in both commitment and non-commitment and expected profits are also the same in the absence of service competition (i.e., when

                            or η → ∞), the sole driver of the profit difference is the difference in expected service levels: on average, retailers end up investing more in service when they postpone that investment until after they observe demand. In other words, service commitment mitigates service competition and increases profits. Note that the difference in expected service levels between non-commitment and commitment would be

                           . Therefore, the case of commitment is strong when consumers care more about service than price and demand is strong. In these circumstances, service commitment substantially curbs service competition and the costs associated with it. Table 5
                            summarizes the impact of different parameters on the value of commitment, which we define as the difference in retailers’ profits when both commit and when neither one commits.

We next want to confirm that upfront investment in service is, in fact, an equilibrium action when retailers choose the timing of their service investment. The sequence of events is as follows. (1) Retailers decide between commitment and non-commitment. (2) Retailers choose a pair of prices–service levels either simultaneously (under non-commitment) or sequentially (under commitment). We next fully characterize the equilibrium for the special case where

                           Proposition 4 does confirm our earlier (static) analysis and insights. Both retailers committing to service levels upfront is either the unique or the Pareto–dominant equilibrium. The additional insight from Proposition 4 is that both retailers non-committing to service investments is also an equilibrium for intermediate values of γ and sufficiently large values of η. As γ approaches 1/2, retailers become very uncertain in their beliefs about future demand and the benefit from more precise demand information can be significant. In that case, part (bii) of Proposition 4 says that non-committing to service investments is an equilibrium when service investments are expensive (i.e., large η) and/or consumers are more sensitive to price than service (i.e., large

                           ). These two conditions imply weak service competition and consequently make the non-commitment of service investments more attractive in general. In the Appendix, we provide a partial characterization of the equilibrium for general u (see Proposition A-2). Here we discuss Fig. 1
                           , which depicts the equilibria in service investment strategies for different values of u and γ when

                           . Recall that parameter u models the mismatch between expected and actual demand, which becomes larger as u approaches 1. First, notice that as long as the mismatch between expected and actual demand remains small or moderate, Fig. 1 also confirms the results of the static analysis, i.e., both retailers want to invest in service upfront to avoid more intense service competition after demand realization. It is only under conditions of highly uncertain demand that this insight might not be true. In particular, Fig. 1 demonstrates that large values of u and γ favor symmetric non-commitment of service investments. In fact, symmetric commitment to service investments is not an equilibrium when u and γ are sufficiently large. To see why upfront investment fails to be an equilibrium in that case, note that unilateral non-commitment is very beneficial for the deviating retailer when uncertainty u is large because they alone can take advantage of much higher information precision, whose benefit they would have to share with the competitor otherwise. Nevertheless, for this benefit to outweigh the benefit of lower service levels that upfront investment ensures, γ must be sufficiently large, that is, retailers should expect low demand with sufficiently high probability. Otherwise, if demand is likely to be high, the deviating retailer can foresee that its service investment after demand realization will be heavy and costly and thus would be better off committing upfront to a lower service level. Therefore, both a large mismatch between expected and actual demand as well as relatively low probability of high demand are necessary for non-commitment of service investments to be the/an equilibrium choice for retailers.

So far we have shown that retailers should invest in service before observing demand and setting prices as long the probability of expecting low demand and the mismatch between expected demand and actual demand are not high. In the next section, we will see whether the case for commitment is as strong when retailers’ service investments go beyond just keeping consumers from defecting to the competitor.

                           , retailer i’s price and demand would increase as retailer j increased its service level (see Eqs. (6) and (7)).

In the first period, retailer i maximizes expected profit (

                            is sufficient to ensure positive prices, service levels, quantities, expected profits, and also concavity.

                              Proposition 5
                              
                                 When retailers commit to service investments, there exists a symmetric pure–strategy profile with positive prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits.
                              

Notice in Table 6 that prices are no longer independent of service parameters when service investments affect the overall market size. In addition, another important difference exists between this setting (i.e., service increases overall demand) and the previous, purely competitive, setting (i.e., service does not increase overall demand). The next proposition describes how retailers’ expected profits behave with respect to the service cost. Unlike the purely competitive setting, expected profits can be non-monotone (specifically concave) in the service cost in this setting.

                                 When retailers commit to service investments their expected profits change with the service cost as follows:

The intuition behind Proposition 6 is as follows. When the primary effect of service investments is to protect market share from competition rather than to increase overall demand, we are back to the setting where service does not increase overall demand: service investments hit retailers’ bottom line. In that parameter regime, costlier service is good news for retailers because it mitigates service competition and improves profits. On the other hand, when the market share effect is not as dominant relative to the demand–enhancing effect of service (i.e., bs
                            < θs
                            < 5bs
                           /2), then costlier service might be good or bad news for retailers. At low cost levels, which imply high service levels, more expensive service is good because it decreases costs more than it decreases revenues (due to decreased demand). At higher cost levels though, the opposite is true because the revenue loss is greater than the cost savings.

In summary, how exactly service cost affects profits is central to answering our main question. In competitive settings, this effect is counterintuitive and subtle. More expensive service can be a good thing for competing retailers, but that is true only if service is merely a way to prevent consumers from defecting to competitors. If service can entice non–buyers to become buyers, costlier service can be good or bad for retailers depending on what their current level of service is.

                                 When retailers do not commit to service investments, there exists a symmetric pure–strategy profile with positive prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits.
                              


                           Table 7
                            summarizes retailers’ prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits. Table 8
                            summarizes the effects of changing parameters on retailers’ expected profits. Notice in Table 7 that prices are no longer independent of service parameters when service investments affect the overall market size. In addition, retailers’ expected profits are non–monotonic in bs

                           . Note that the explanation behind this effect is competition; a duopolist increases its service investment not only to respond to more receptive consumers but also to counter competition; the former is productive, the latter is not. Therefore, when service is cheap to begin with, this leads to over–investment and losses.

To compare the profitability of the commitment and non-commitment strategies we performed an extensive computational study, because the complexity involved prohibits a comprehensive analytical comparison between the two strategies. We considered a large number of instances resulting from every possible combination of the values listed in the Appendix (see details of computational study and Table A-2) and we observed that in all instances considered commitment is more profitable than non-commitment (see Table A-3). We observed that the reduced service costs under commitment outweigh the increased revenues under non-commitment. But the value of commitment declines as service becomes more and more expensive (i.e., η increases). In fact, in the absence of service competition (i.e., η → ∞) both commitment and non-commitment become equally profitable. Thus, our numerical experiments support that commitment is a more profitable strategy than non-commitment even when service investments affect overall demand. In addition to the numerical study, we can actually prove analytically in the following proposition the superiority of commitment for the special case in which the market share effect is equal to the demand enhancing effect of service (i.e., bs
                            → θs
                           ).

                                 In a duopoly, if investments in service increase overall demand and the market share effect is equal to the demand enhancing effect of service i.e., bs
                                  → θs, expected profits are higher when both retailers commit to service investments.
                              

We now allow the retailers to choose the timing of their service investments. The sequence of events is the same as in Section 4.1.3. We next fully characterize the equilibrium for the special case in which the market share effect is equal to the demand enhancing effect of service i.e., bs
                            → θs

                            illustrates the equilibria in the timing of service investments for different values of u and γ when

                           . Fig. 2(a) is consistent with Fig. 1. As long as the mismatch between expected and actual demand remains small or moderate, both retailers want to invest in service upfront to avoid more intense service competition after demand realization. Nevertheless, similarly to the case where service does not increase overall demand, large values of u and γ favor symmetric non-commitment of service investments. However, when service can increase the overall demand, the incentive to commit becomes more pronounced. Note that the region where commitment is the unique or Pareto-dominant NE is larger in Fig. 2(a) than Fig. 1. Moreover, once the demand enhancing effect of service (bs
                           ) exceeds a certain threshold, commitment becomes the unique equilibrium (Fig. 2(b)) which is also consistent with our earlier insight from Proposition 9. To understand the intuition behind this result note that as the demand enhancing effect increases, retailers have an incentive to provide higher service levels which result in higher service costs. A commitment strategy could curb those costs by avoiding over-investments in service. On the other hand, a non-commitment strategy allows retailers to take advantage of much higher information precision at the cost of offering higher service levels. Once the demand enhancing effect exceeds a certain threshold, the benefit of lower service levels that commitment ensures outweighs the benefit of much higher information precision. Thus, there is no incentive for retailers to deviate to non-commitment.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we focus on ex-ante versus ex-post service investments such as offering extended operating hours and study the timing of such service investments in the retail sector. Service investments might affect overall consumer demand for a product, but, in the case of competing retailers, also prevent consumers from buying from the competitor. Intuitively, one would expect that a monopolistic retailer would naturally prefer not to commit to service, because service has the sole purpose of increasing demand for the product. On the other hand, our analysis shows that committing to service investments before observing demand, although counterintuitive, can be beneficial for competing retailers. By investing in service before demand, retailers avoid more aggressive service competition and hence costlier total investments later on, i.e., after observing demand. This strategic effect is more pronounced when investment costs are relatively low and consumers are more sensitive to the service than the price they experience at competing retail stores. On the other hand, a large mismatch between actual and expected demand and a low probability of high demand justifies holding back on service investments until uncertainty is resolved (see Table 9
                      that briefly summarizes conditions under which different strategies emerge as equilibrium under the different scenarios). We further show that the case of commitment becomes even stronger when service increases the overall demand for the product as opposed to only protecting market share.

There are some limitations of our model. For example, to simplify our analysis, we assume that the competing retailers can observe demand and then make their respective decisions. A more precise model would be to consider that the retailers possess a signal—that may or may not be reliable—about the demand and then act upon that signal. In addition, our current findings are based on the assumption that retailers follow contingent pricing. An interesting extension to consider for future research would be how retailers should time their service investment decisions when they engage in pre-announced pricing policies. One can also enrich our model to simultaneously endogenize service investment choices (i.e., committed versus contingent service) and pricing choices (i.e., committed versus contingent pricing) under demand uncertainty. Despite these limitations, our stylized model captures the core tensions of how demand uncertainty and the role of service on overall demand may interplay in influencing strategic service investment decisions.

We believe that our research underlines a number of contributions to retail practice. First, retailers should, in many cases, defy their intuition and consider committing to service investments upfront to avoid higher investment costs later, i.e., after they observe demand. We also make a compelling argument that if service investments increase overall demand in addition to protecting market share, competing retailers should most of the time avoid choosing their service levels after they observe demand. Although such flexible strategies seem intuitive, we show that they do not always maximize profits especially when demand uncertainty is small or moderate. On the other hand, a low probability of high demand and a large mismatch between actual and expected demand give grounds for non-commitment to service investments. In that case, which resembles the situation many retailers where faced with in the most recent economic downturn, it is better to postpone service investments. Second, retailers should recognize that service commitment could serve as a mechanism to relax price competition. Specifically, when retailers can set price after they observe demand, service commitment allows retailers to understand the negative effect of increasing their service levels on prices and therefore choose such service levels that mitigate price competition. Finally, retailers should understand how service costs affect their profits in order to make their service level decisions. In monopolistic settings, this effect is intuitive and straightforward. More expensive service is harmful for a monopolist. In competitive settings, this effect is counterintuitive and depends on the distinct role that service investments serve. If service is merely a way to prevent consumers from fleeing to competitors, then more expensive service can be beneficial for competing retailers because it prevents over-investment. On the other hand, if service can also entice non-buyers to become buyers, costlier service can be beneficial or harmful for retailers depending on their current level of service.

We use the notation [C] and [NC] to denote commitment and non–commitment settings, respectively. Thus, [C,C] and [NC,NC] denote symmetric commitment and symmetric non-commitment. To ensure that the various profit expressions are well behaved and that prices, service levels, quantities, and expected profits for the two retailers are positive for the different settings we impose the following conditions on the parameters.

                        Condition (A-3) is imposed to ensure that profit functions are well-behaved (i.e., strictly concave in service level) for the setting [C,C] and that service levels are positive. The above condition also implies that prices, quantities, and profits for the two retailers are positive. Condition (A-4) is imposed to ensure that that service levels are positive for the setting [NC,NC]. The above condition also implies that prices, quantities, and profits for the two retailers are positive and also ensures that profit functions are well-behaved (i.e., the relevant hessian for each retailer are negative definite).

                              To determine the equilibria in the timing of service investments, we first characterize the asymmetric strategy pairing [C,NC]. Without loss of generality, we examine the case where retailer 1 commits to service and retailer 2 does not commit to service.

In the second period, the profit functions for retailers 1 and 2 are given below:

                              . Thus, [NC,NC] is not an equilibrium.

For [C,NC] to be an equilibrium, first the expected profits from commitment should be less than those obtained by unilaterally deviating to non-commitment. This does not hold since ∀ λ > 4, profits in the [C,C] setting are higher than in the [C,NC] setting. Second, the expected profits from non-commitment should be less than those obtained by unilaterally deviating to commitment. This holds ∀ λ > 4. Since the first condition does not hold, [C,NC] never constitutes an equilibrium in service investments.
