@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Motion capture (MOCAP) is a prevalent and powerful technique to record the movement of human or other objects. It has been widely used in various areas such as computer animation, computer games, film production, sports medicine and athletic training. Since the commercial MOCAP systems are very expensive and the motion capture process is time-consuming, it becomes critical to reuse the abundant pre-captured motion data. With the rise of some novel motion capture systems and technologies like depth-based MOCAP [1,2], it brings explosive growth of motion data. A huge mass of human motion data have been accumulated in these years. Therefore, an efficient and effective human motion retrieval algorithm plays an important role in managing and accessing these available data.

Due to the high complexity and diversity of human motion, human motion retrieval is a very challenging task in computer animation and multimedia analysis communities. Similar to other multimedia retrieval tasks like image retrieval and document retrieval, feature representation is the corner-stone of human motion retrieval algorithm and system. A compact and discriminative motion feature representation cannot only significantly improves the performance of the retrieval algorithm but also dramatically reduces the consuming time of the algorithm. As we known, there is a big gap between the low-level visual feature and the high-level semantic meaning, so single low-level visual feature is usually unable to fully characterize all aspects of the motion data. In other words, it would be beneficial to fuse multiple visual features for motion data representation.

However, many researchers tended to use a single type of visual feature as motion data representation in the past years, which leads to under-performing retrieval performance [3,4]. In contrast, recent studies have shown that using multi-view features can dramatically boost the algorithms׳ performance in computer vision and machine learning [5–7]. The core problem in these methods is how to exploit these multi-view features that has specific statistic property and lies on some low-dimensional subspace space in the feature fusion phase. An intuitive way is to concatenate these multi-view features into a high-dimensional feature representation, which would bring in the risk of dimensional explosion as well as the redundancy of information. Because each visual feature characterizes different aspects of human motion and has dissimilar discriminative power with respect to a specific class of motion, it is wise to jointly take these multi-view features into account and exploit the embedded complementary information. In addition, we notice that although multi-view feature learning is a hot topic in computer vision and machine learning, less research effort have been made in the problem of multi-view feature learning and feature selection for human motion retrieval.

To this end, we propose an Adaptive Multi-View Feature Selection (AMFS) method in this article, which can automatically assign multi-view features with adaptive feature weights and select out a compact and discriminative feature subset from the original high-dimensional multi-view features. With the selected low-dimensional feature representation, it not only improves the motion data retrieval accuracy but also speeds up the whole motion data retrieval processing.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, some recent research work on motion feature representation and multi-view feature selection for motion data related tasks will be introduced. Then, the details of our proposed AMFS and its optimization method will be presented in Section 3. Finally, the experiments and some discussions are given in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

To solve the human motion retrieval problem, we resort to adaptive multi-view feature selection to learn a compact yet discriminative feature representation from multi-view features. Our method relates to two topics: human motion retrieval and multi-view feature selection. Thus, in this section we briefly review some related work on these two topics one by one.

With the explosive increase of multimedia data, extensive research effort has been dedicated to multimedia analysis, such as image and video annotation and retrieval [8,9]. To reveal and exploit the geometric structure of multimedia data, many graph-based models have been proposed in recent years. They can be used as geometric image descriptors [10–12] to enhance image categorization. Besides, these methods can be used as image high-order potential descriptors of superpixels [13–15]. Further, graph-based descriptors can be used as a general image aesthetic descriptors to improve image aesthetics ranking, photo retargeting and cropping [16,13].

Human motion data is a special kind of multimedia data, it has many similar properties with image and videos. Thus, many traditional multimedia retrieval approaches can be employed to process the motion data. In general, the main motion retrieval procedure includes three steps: (1) visual feature extraction; (2) training a search/ranking model; (3) similar human motion retrieval or ranking. To speed up the searching procedure, some data indexing techniques such as kd-tree and R-tree are used in approximate searching [17–19]. Indeed, the success of human motion retrieval heavily relies on the motion feature representation. Therefore, many researchers have focused their attentions on construction and learning efficient motion feature representation for content-based human motion retrieval.

As we known, textural labels [20] such as jump or kick have been used to search motion clips at the beginning. However, it requires the user to label all motion data in database in advance, which is very tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, due to the high ambiguity and subjectivity of keyword, it is difficult to choose a correct and meaningful labels for a given human motion sequence. In fact, how to measure the similarity between two texture labels is still an open problem in text mining.

To overcome the shortcomings of label-based methods, the content-based methods that extract numeric features from motion data and use them to measure the similarity between two human motion have been proposed [3,4]. Based on the used feature of the algorithm, we divide the exiting work into two categories: frame/pose based methods and sequence/clip based methods.

To describe the local motion properly, a number of frame/pose based motion features have been developed. Chen et al. [4] presented a geometric pose feature (GPF) which is effe;ctive in encoding pose similarity. Raptis et al. [57] proposed an approach that using joint angles as feature to recognize dance actions. Xia et al. [21] had shown a histogram of 3D joints descriptors, after generating a dictionary, the temporal motion model is created via HMM. Following a similar paradigm, Kapsouras and Nikolaidis [22] used joints orientation angles and angles forward differences as local features to create a code book and generate a Bag of Visual Word (BOVW) to represent the action. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was applied by Qi et al. [23] to represent character poses, wherein the motion sequence is encoded, and then DTW and a string matching algorithm are applied for motion comparison. Barnachon et al. [24] used histograms of action poses to represent the action and employed DTW for comparing and recognizing actions. Besides, these two approaches [23,24] have shown the potential for online action recognition. Moreover, sparse representation can also be applied in motion data retrieval [25]. Generally, to use pose/frame based features, it requires an integration step such as BOVW [22], DTW [23] or manifold embedding [10,26] to represent the whole motion clip.

The sequence/clip based motion feature utilizes some global properties of the motion sequence, e.g. moving path or trajectories. Muller et al. [3,27] presented the motion template (MT) that the motions of the same class can be represented by an explicit interpretable matrix using a set of Boolean geometric feature. To overcome the tolerate temporal variance problem in MT training process, dynamic time warping (DTW) was employed in their work. However, it still requires the training data in same class to have same number of cycles, otherwise MT will not be well trained. Moreover, both the training and comparing process of MT is time-consuming. Gowayyed et al. [28] proposed a trajectory feature named histograms of oriented displacements (HOD). Each 3D trajectory is represented by the HOD of its 2D projection to xy, xz and yz planes. A temporal pyramid method, where the trajectory is computed using the whole, halves and then quarters of the motion sequence, is applied to preserve the motion temporal information. Compared with previous trajectory features [29,30], HOD provides a fixed-length feature representation for variable length motion sequences, which benefits further analysis. Xiao et al. [31] proposed a probability graph model for motion retrieval. However their work requires selecting representative frames from motion sequence before generating the probability graph.

Recently, a new technique called sketch-based interface searching, has been introduced in motion retrieval. Chao et al. [32] used a hand drawing sketch as query to describe the body/joint trajectories. For both the input query and the motion clips in database, spherical harmonic is used to encode the joint/body trajectories for motion representation. Choi et al [33] proposed a sketch based motion retrieval framework that using skeleton stick figure as input query, where the motion clips in the database are converted to sequences of stick figures. Then the retrieval work is realized by matching stick figures. However, it requires special skills and experiences for drawing stick figure, which brings in some new difficulties for the user.

The traditional feature selection methods such as Laplacian Score [34] and Feature Ranking [35] are developed to select features that preserve the data property or data manifold structure. However, these learning methods were designed for the single-view feature data scenario, and they did not consider the correlations and complementary information between different features when they applied to deal with multi-view data that comprise multiple features in feature representation. Thus, some multi-view feature selection methods were developed for various applications like multimedia data ranking, annotation, recognition and retrieval [5,36,6,37–40], where the information and correlations between different features have been exploited. To integrate multimodel feature, Zhang et al. [41] presented the feature correlation hypergraph (FCH), where shared entropy is proposed to capture the high order correlation among multimodal features. Multimodel graph learning methods can also be implemented to video annotation [42] and image ranking [43]. Moreover, some metrics [44,45] have been developed specially for multi-view feature based methods, which measure the similarities and dissimilarities more accurately than the traditional Euclidean distance metric when using multi-view features.

However, as motion data belongs to a special kind of multimedia data, few multi-view feature based researches are reported on this topic. Some of previous multi-view feature selection approaches [6] can handle multiple real data applications, but no enough experiments on motion data have been taken and shown. Chen et al. [4] used feature selection method to boost their proposed geometric pose descriptor. However, his work focuses on the task of pose recovery from the monocular image. Gao et al. [46] developed a multi-modality action recognition approach based on collaborative representation [47]. Tang and Leung [7] proposed to select suitable kinds of features for each query and then split them. Their work [46,7] did not consider correlations between the original features, where some prior researches [5,6,38] have already shown that leveraging shared information is beneficial to improve the recognition accuracy. Therefore, we are going to develop a multi-view feature selection method for motion data retrieval that takes the discriminating power of each feature synergistically.

To this end, the local graph of each type of feature is constructed separately to flexibly model the visual similarity under each type of feature view. Then, these learned graphs are united with a non-negative view-weight vector to jointly fusion the original multiple features. Finally, we propose the objective function of MFS for adaptively learning feature weight and selecting out a compact and discriminative feature components from the original multiple high dimensional feature representation. The feature selection process brings in twofold advantages: (1) compared with the original multiple high dimensional feature representation, the selected feature subset becomes lower and compact, which leads to less computational cost; (2) after feature selection, only the most correlated feature components are hold thus the redundancy information is discarded, which potentially leads a better performance. The flowchart of our proposed AMFS is shown in Fig. 1

Since different visual feature describes different aspects about motion data, and they have dissimilar discriminative power with respect to one particular class of human motion. Thus, it would be beneficial to combine multiple visual features together for motion data representation. If we just concatenate all of these multiple features together, it does not only lack of physical meaning but also fail to exploit the complementary information between different visual feature. More worse, it would bring in some redundant information in feature representation. To overcome these problems, we hope to select out a compact yet discriminative feature subset

Since the local geometric structure information is important in real-world applications [48], we hope to preserve the local information of motion data during feature selection. To this end, a local regressive model is designed to character the local information of motion data [49]. We assume that for each data point, its selected low-dimensional feature can be expressed as a linear function mapping from its original visual feature.

In real-world applications, the local geometric structure of visual data is approximately linear [48]. Besides, it is computational efficiency for practical applications using linear method. Therefore, a linear method is chosen in this work rather than other complex nonlinear models [49]. That is to say, a linear regression model

The value range of α is between 0 and 1 since prior research [49] has shown that negative of α is lack of physical meaning and the non-negative constraint would make result much closer to the idea solution. One thing need to be pointed out is that, the solution to α in last equation is

                         otherwise. This solution means that only one best feature is selected, which does not meet our objective. Thus the method utilized in [50,5,6] is adopted for this problem, α

Inspired by [51], we develop an iterative approach to solve the optimization of our trace ratio represented objective function. It is clearly a nonlinearly constrained optimization problem. The convergence proof of proposed optimization method is omitted due to paragraph limitation, where similar proof can be found in [50,5,36]. The feature weight vector α is firstly initialized as

The updating of W and α should be recursively continued until it achieves convergence. Then, the local minimum solution for the selection matrix W and feature weight α can be obtained.

For Eq. (21), it needs to be pointed out that the parameter r can modulate the smoothness difference between graphes [42]. If 
                           r
                           →
                           1
                        , the difference between each graph would be expanded, only α
                        
                           v
                         of the smoothest graph would be close to 1, which is the “select best feature” which is mentioned at the explanation of Eq. (18). If 
                           r
                           →
                           ∞
                        , the effect of difference is reduced and α
                        
                           v
                         for each feature would be close to each other. Thus, the choice of parameter r depends on the complementation of the multi-view features. The value of r should be enlarged to explore the synergistic effect of multi-view features while rich complementation exists. Otherwise r should be small to keep the performance of the “best” feature.

The proposed AMFS method has been tested on a commonly used public mocap database HDM05 dataset [52] and MSR-Action 3D (MSR3D) dataset [53] to prove the efficiency of AMFS for motion retrieval. HDM05 dataset consists 2061 motion sequences belonging to 130 classes performed by 5 actors. Since many of original classes are close to each other, e.g. punchLFront1Reps and punchLFront2Reps we have combined similar action classes and finally generate 25 classes for 2061 motion clips. To further challenge our method, we choose the training and testing action sets that performed by different actors, e.g. 2 for training and 3 for testing. MSR3D has 567 motion sequences that belongs to 20 action types with 10 actors, while each actor performs each action 2 or 3 times. The 20-joints locations extracted by [54] are used instead of original depth image of MSR3D, where we randomly choose half of motion clips from each action class to be training data and the others are used as testing data.

At the beginning of AMFS, different kinds of features should be chosen to form the multi-feature representation. The power of AMFS is based on the complementarity between different types of features. During our experiments, we find that increasing features of similar type makes little effect on the final retrieval performance. Thus, we decided to choose only one typical sequence based feature HOD [28] and one pose based feature GPF [4] that both specially developed for motion data. Besides, for GPF, after feature extraction, a codebook is learnt via k means, then bag of visual word (BOVW) method LLC 
                           [55] is applied to generate a fixed length GPF-BOVW feature representation.

In this experiment, firstly, we compare the performance of our AMFS with the original two features on HDM05 dataset and MSR3D dataset. To exclude the factor of classification/ranking method, the simple Euclidean distance is used to rank the result for all the methods. Moreover, a retrieval performance test is also taken on both two datasets. It examines the performance of AMFS and two basic features. Moreover, several existing multi-view feature combination methods, Laplacian Score [34], Feature Ranking [35] and Unsupervised Discriminative Feature Selection (UDFS) [36,56], are also implemented as comparison. At last, we also test AMFS׳s parameter sensitivity and examined its convergence speed.

In Fig. 2
                        , it provides the retrieval result for two example query motion with 4 methods: AMFS, HOD, GPF-BOVW and Laplacian score. It shows the top three ranking results for every query motion given by each methods. AMFS generally outperforms the competitors.

The results in Fig. 3
                         show that our AMFS consistently outperforms using single features individually on both HDM05 and MSR3D datasets. The overall precision and detail performance on single action class provide the evidence that AMFS can combine the original features synergistically. The comparison of AMFS, and other multi-feature combination methods shows that AMFS is a effective method to generate relevance feature subset for human motion retrieval.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows the retrieval performance of AMFS, two single feature algorithms and three multi-feather combination methods on two datasets. AMFS generally outperforms other methods. The comparison of AMFS and the competitors shows that AMFS is benefited from the complementary of different features, which provides a better achievement.

The result of the sensitivity test for parameter μ and r is reported in Fig. 5
                        , where Fig. 5a is the test on HDM05 dataset and Fig. 5b is the test on MSR Action3D dataset. The variance range of parameter r is from 2 to 16 and the variance range of μ is 
                           [
                           0.01
                           ,
                           0.05
                           ,
                           0.1
                           ,
                           0.2
                           ,
                           0.3
                           ,
                           0.4
                           ,
                           0.5
                           ]
                        . The result demonstrates that our AMFS is robust to the parameter changing, meanwhile, it can still achieve a high retrieval accuracy even the parameter is not initialized carefully. Besides, the effect of parameter k, which is the parameter used to build the feature local graph, has also been tested. The result is shown in Fig. 6
                        .

As we mentioned in Section 3.2 that the objective function is solved using an iterative approach, the speed of reaching convergence is crucial for the computational efficiency in the real world motion retrieval. The result of convergence examination on HDM05 dataset is given in Fig. 7
                        . We noticed that AMFS can reach convergence within 20 iterations. Thus, it demonstrates that our optimization approach for AMFS is efficient.

@&#DISCUSSIONS@&#

Generally the AMFS improves the motion retrieval performance. It simultaneously discovers the intrinsic relation between visual categories in a compact and relevance selected feature subspace by leveraging the underlying data structure and similarity between different feature views. It is fast, insensitive to parameters and robust to large scale data.

Comparing with previous work on motion features that only using small subset motion data, e.g. 251 actions from HDM05 [15,28], the whole HODM05 dataset is employed for performance testing. The performance on the larger dataset shows that our AMFS is able to handle the challenge from real-world big data. Besides, AMFS can directly be used if a new effective motion feature is proposed in the future. Any new motion features can be easily integrated into our framework. All of these properties make it applicable for real world problem solving.

However, one thing still need to be pointed out is that, as indicated in [37], AMFS cannot guarantee the higher performance from single features if the data does not hold a manifold structure. Moreover, we find that added similar type of features will bring little effect to the performance. Besides, fluctuation could occur during experiment when the number of features increased, this is a problem need to be solved in future.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a multi-view feature selection method has been proposed to categorize motion data. We build a trace-ratio objective function and provide an iterative optimization approach. The AMFS discovers the intrinsic relations between visual words in each motion feature subspace to improve the retrieval performance. The performance of AMFS method has been evaluated on the HDM05 and MSR3D motion datasets. In order deal with the real-world problem, all the 2061 actions in HDM05 dataset are employed for performance test, and we choose different actors of motion for training and testing. The experimental results show that the AMFS method can improve the performance by combining different motion features synergistically and it has potential to be implemented in the real large motion dataset retrieval.
