                  This paper analyzes the performance of spectrum-sensing-based energy detection (ED) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) over generalized fading channels. The fading channel is modeled by the extended generalized-K (EGK) distribution. Exact and accurate analytical expressions for the average detection probability with different detection schemes, such as, single channel, diversity reception, and cooperative spectrum sensing, are derived and evaluated. Obtained expressions can be reduced to other well-known fading channels such as, Weibull, Nakagami-m, and Rayleigh. It is shown that the analytical framework can be used for both integer and non-integer values of the fading/shadowing parameters. The impact of key fading/shadowing parameters on the performance of energy detectors is discussed with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The accuracy of the derived analytical expressions is corroborated via Monte-Carlo simulation results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The recent revolution in wireless applications and services increased the demand for more frequency spectrum. This motivates researchers and telecommunication agencies to optimize the utilization of existing spectrum allocations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other agencies conducted several studies on the licensed portion of the spectrum [1]. These studies showed that most of the allocated (licensed) spectrum is vastly under-utilized. As a result, the cognitive radio technology is proposed to improve spectrum utilization [2]. In cognitive communication, the secondary users are only allowed to opportunistically access the licensed spectrum when it is not occupied by the licensed primary users. Thereby, spectrum-sensing-based energy detection (ED) is proposed as one of the most popular detection methods [3].

Performance analysis of spectrum-sensing-based energy detection in cognitive radio systems has been widely investigated in literature over different fading channels [3–12]. Sofotasios et al. provided analytical expression for the average probability of detection over Weibull fading channels. The results showed that the performance of the detector is highly dependent on the severity of the fading parameter. In addition, the results demonstrated that small variations in the fading parameters affect significantly the value of the average probability of detection [5]. In [3], the performance of an ED algorithm to detect an unknown deterministic signal corrupted by a flat band-limited Gaussian noise channel is presented. In [6], Kostylev extend the work in [3] to determine the probability of energy detection of a received communication signal over various fading channels such as Rayleigh, Rice and Nakagami-m fading channels. Generally, most previous studies consider the energy detector performance over multi-path fading channels [3,6,7]. However, there are few studies on the performance of ED spectrum sensing for composite multipath/shadowed fading environment [8,10]. Ejaz et al. explored the energy-throughput trade-off for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks [11]. To this end, an optimization problem is considered to minimize the energy consumed in spectrum sensing while satisfying reliability constraints and providing a given throughput to secondary users (SUs). To solve this problem, a heuristic solution is developed to determine the optimal sensing, reporting and transmission duration. Analysis and simulation results revealed the optimal value for sensing, reporting and transmission duration in order to achieve the best trade-off between energy consumption and throughput for SUs. Zhang and Bao considered the spectrum sensing technique for cognitive radio based on energy detection [12]. They proposed an improved spectrum sensing algorithm by linearly combining the criteria of the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. As a result of their algorithm, an optimal decision threshold is derived for energy detection which significantly improved the performance of primal user (PU) detection. The authors in [13] derived some alternative closed-form expressions for the probability of detection (over Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rice fading channels) to those reported in [6]. In addition, they analyzed the system performance under different diversity schemes such as equal gain combining (EGC), selection combining (SC), and switch and stay combining (SSC). In [14], the authors considered the problem of energy detection of unknown deterministic signal of a PU over Nakagami-m fading channel and assuming EGC technique. The authors derived series form exact expressions for probability of detection and false alarm in terms of the number of diversity branches. Herath et al. developed a comprehensive performance analysis of the energy detector over Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rice fading channels with single antenna reception or with antenna diversity reception [15]. The authors developed a new performance analysis method based on the contour integral representation of Marcum-Q function and moment generating function (MGF).

Recently, a new generalized composite fading distribution (termed extended generalized-K (EGK)) has been proposed in [16]. The EGK fading models can be used to perfectly fit experimental data that represent a wide range of realistic fading conditions. The EGK distribution is the most generalized distribution in the literature and it provides such a unified theory as to model the envelope statistics of known wireless and optical communication channels [16]. These fading distribution are listed in [16, Table I]. Composite fading channels, such as EGK fading channel, play important role in analyzing and understanding several physical problems in wireless communications including interference effects in cellular systems, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) network, distributed antenna systems, cooperative/multihop relay networks, and optical communications. As such, in this paper, performance analysis of spectrum-sensing-based energy detection over cognitive radio will be considered. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exist no analytical results for the average probability of detection (either for single-branch (no diversity) nor for multi-branch (with diversity)) for ED-based spectrum sensing over the EGK fading channels. Thereby, the aim of this paper is to analyze the performance of spectrum-sensing-based energy detection over the EGK fading channels. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

                        
                           •
                           New and unified analytical expressions for the average detection probability for different scenarios such as, single channel, diversity reception, and cooperative sensing are derived and evaluated.

The derived expression is valid for both integer and non-integer values of the fading and shadowing parameters.

New alternative expressions for the average detection probability over other well-known fading channels, such as Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Weibull channels, are derived from our results as special cases.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the system and channel models are discussed. In Section 3, the derivation of the average detection probability under different diversity techniques is analyzed. Some representative plots for our analytical and simulation results, along with their interpretations are illustrated in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

In CR networks, secondary users (SUs) are allowed to initiate communications with each others over specific frequencies only when these frequencies are not occupied by primary users (PUs). Therefore, SUs must opportunistically sense the spectrum for vacant channels (frequencies) before deciding whether to initiate communication or not. Hence, spectrum-sensing-based energy detection plays a crucial role in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The most simple, popular, and efficient method for energy detection in such environment is shown in Fig. 1

Referring to the energy detector shown in Fig. 1, the received waveform y(t) is filtered using a band-pass filter (BPF) with bandwidth W Hz to remove the out-of-band noise power. The output of the BPF is squared and accumulated to measure the energy in y(t) during the observation time interval T. The integrator output is multiplied by 
                           
                              2

                         to normalize the noise variance. At the end of the interval (0, T), the detector decides based on comparing y(t) and λ. If y(t) > λ, then s(t) is present; otherwise s(t) is absent.

The energy detector must make a decision at

The EGK channel describes signal fluctuations in the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to multipath, shadowing, or a mixture of such processes in the environment. The EGK fading distribution is a general distribution that includes most of the well-known fading distributions in the literature as either special or limit cases [16].

The PDF of the instantaneous SNR, γ, over the EGK fading channel is given by [16, Eq. 3]

Note that in order to evaluate the average detection probability in (7), the values of λ must be computed. Also, Pf
                      does not depend on γ. Therefore, the value of λ can be numerically computed for a given probability of false-alarm Pf
                      using (4). Interestingly, the average detection probability can be evaluated for any values of the fading and shadowing parameters, which are not necessarily integer values.

It is worth pointing out that although the expression in (7) involves an infinite series, it converges rapidly and steadily requiring a limited number of k terms of the infinite series with the truncated terms comprise the truncating error ε

Square-law selection (SLS) is an efficient diversity technique that can be easily realized. It is also known as selection combining. In this paper, we consider L-branch square-law selection (SLS). However, when the receiver employs SLS, it selects the branch that have the maximum decision statistic,

Likewise, the energy detector shows better detection capability for higher ζ (with fixed m). This is because as m → ∞ and ζ → ∞, the fading channel behaves as an AWGN channel and therefore the system performance improves. Note that, the values of u and

                        , of the fading channel on the energy detector, we plot in Fig. 3
                         the average probability of missed detection

                        . As anticipated, higher ms
                         and higher ζs
                         of the composite fading channel leads to better detection capability at the energy detector. This is because the shadowing and fading parameters play a symmetric role in the EGK distribution. As such, when ms
                         → ∞ and ζs
                         → ∞, the fading channel behaves as an AWGN channel and therefore the system performance improves. In addition, the results illustrate the detrimental effect of the fading phenomena. In Fig. 3, the values of u and 
                           
                              γ

                         which reduce the EGK model to some well-known fading channels such as the Weibull, Nakagami-m and Rayleigh fading channels. It is clear that the analytical results and Monte-Carlo simulations are in excellent agreement which validates our analytical framework.

                         = 4.5. It can be seen that as the value of u increases, the performance of the energy detector deteriorates. This is because the probability of false-alarm Pf
                         increases faster than the probability of detection 
                           
                              
                                 P

                              =
                              1

                              ,
                           
                         thus leading to a lower overall detection capability. In addition, Fig. 5 shows the impact of the average SNR 
                           
                              γ
                              ¯
                           
                         of the EGK fading channel on the energy detector. As expected, higher values of the average SNR 
                           
                              γ

                         of the fading channel leads to better detection capability.

In (7), the average probability of detection

                         in represented in terms of infinite series. Therefore, a truncation error is introduced when computing the value of 
                           
                              
                                 P

                         as indicated in (8). To explore the relative error of 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    P

                         we depict in Fig. 6
                         the truncation error as a function of the number of terms k (where k is the number of terms to represent the infinite series). In Fig. 6, the values of the fading and shadowing parameters are as follows: m = 1, ζ = 1, ms
                         = 5 and ζs
                         = 5. As expected, the results show that the relative error improves when the number of terms k increases. Furthermore, we have noticed that at low values of average SNR 
                           
                              γ
                              ¯
                           
                         and at high values of u the computational memory improves.

                         is illustrated in Table 1
                        . The values of the fading and shadowing parameters are set as follows: 
                           
                              m

                              ,

                                 s
                              
                              =
                              1
                              ,
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 ζ
                                 s
                              
                              =
                              5
                           
                        . It is clear from the table that the relative error ε
                           t
                         decreases as the number of terms k increases. In addition, the relative error ε
                           t
                         decreases as the value of the time-bandwidth product u increases. On the other hand, as the value of the SNR increases the relative error ε
                           t
                         increases.

The impact of the number of combined branches on the detection performance when employing SLS combining is depicted in Fig. 7
                        . The values of the fading and shadowing parameters are selected as m = 2, ζ = 0.9, ms
                         = 3.5, and ζs

                         = 5 dB. As expected, as the number of branches, L, increases the detection capability increases, especially at high values of Pf
                        . This is because the average received SNR at the input of the detector increases as the number of branches increases. Therefore, the system performance improves. As an example, the value of Pm
                         for 
                           
                              L

                              ,
                           
                         is approximately 75% larger compared to the corresponding case of 
                           
                              L
                              =
                              6
                           
                        . Thus, SLS combining has a significant effect on detection capability. Similar behavior can be noticed as the number of branches L increases, i.e., L > 6.

It is also important to numerically analyze the impact of the fading parameters on the system performance. It is illustrated in Fig. 8
                         that a slight improvement of

                                 d
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         can be noticed when increasing m while fixing ζ and increasing ζ with fixed m. In this scenario, the shadowing parameters are selected as ms
                         = 3.5, and ζs
                         = 4.5, u is set to 2, whereas the average SNR for each branch is set as 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                                 1
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         = 0 dB, 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                                 2
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         = 1 dB, and 
                           
                              
                                 γ
                                 3
                              
                              ¯
                           
                         = 2 dB.

To study the influence of cooperative detection, the system performance is analyzed for up to ten cooperating SUs as illustrated in Fig. 9
                        . Note that, similar fading scenarios as in the previous case are assumed herein, whereas the average SNR 
                           
                              γ
                              ¯
                           
                         is set to 0 dB. As expected, the detection capability improves when the SUs share their information in a cooperative manner. It is clear that as the number of the cooperating SUs increases, the detection capability substantially improves. For example, the value of

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

The performance of an energy detector that operates over the EGK fading channels is analyzed and discussed. The analysis derives accurate expressions for the average detection probability

                      for non-diversity, diversity reception, and cooperative sensing. It is shown that the detection probability increases when the fading parameters, the shadowing parameters, or the average SNR 
                        
                           γ

                      increase(s), or when the time-bandwidth product u decreases. Also, the impact of multichannel SLS reception and cooperative sensing on the detection performance are discussed. The results can be used to analyze the performance of different well-known fading models as special cases of the EGK fading model.
