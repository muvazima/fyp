                  Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is caused by accumulation of extracellular fluid from hyperpermeable capillaries within the macula. DME is one of the leading causes of blindness among Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients. Early detection followed by laser photocoagulation can save the visual loss. This review discusses various imaging modalities viz. biomicroscopy, Fluorescein Angiography (FA), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and colour fundus photographs used for diagnosis of DME. Various automated DME grading systems using retinal fundus images, associated retinal image processing techniques for fovea, exudate detection and segmentation are presented. We have also compared various imaging modalities and automated screening methods used for DME grading. The reviewed literature indicates that FA and OCT identify DME related changes accurately. FA is an invasive method, which uses fluorescein dye, and OCT is an expensive imaging method compared to fundus photographs. Moreover, using fundus images DME can be identified and automated. DME grading algorithms can be implemented for telescreening. Hence, fundus imaging based DME grading is more suitable and affordable method compared to biomicroscopy, FA, and OCT modalities.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic medical condition characterized by impaired glucose metabolism caused due to destruction of pancreatic β-cell. It is mainly classified into type-I (insulin deficiency) and type-II (insulin resistance) diabetes [1–3]. In 2008, global prevalence of diabetes is estimated to be 2.8% and it may elevate to 4.4% by 2030 [4]. Globally, 171 million people are affected with diabetes and it is estimated to rise to 366 million by 2030 [4–6]. Primarily, diabetes affects the important organs viz. heart, kidneys, feet and eyes [2,5]. The cross section of retina is shown in Fig. 1
                     . It has various layers and different types of neurons viz. receptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells and ganglion cells [7]. The optic nerve contains axons of ganglion cells which is connected to the brain. Moreover, the blood vessels are entered through Optic Disk (OD) to vascularize different layers of retina and neurons [7]. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a damage of the retinal blood vessels due to diabetes and is classified into Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) [8]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) may appear in patients with Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR) or Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) [2,5] (Fig. 2
                     ).

DME is one of the major causes of central vision loss in diabetes patients [9]. Worldwide 93 and 17 million people are affected by DR and PDR respectively. Moreover, 21 million people are affected by DME [10]. Globally, the prevalence of DR, PDR and DME are 6.96%, 6.81% and 10.2% respectively [10]. As per Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) [11] DME is characterized by retinal thickening, Hard Exudates (HE), Haemorrhages with or without microaneurysms (HMA) and blot Haemorrhages (HA) in the macula region. It is classified into Non-Clinically Significant Macular Edema (NCSME) and Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME) [12,13]. A brief description on the characteristics of DME severity is presented in Table 1
                     .

The patients with CSME will be affected with moderate vision loss, if untreated within 3years [12]. Moreover, patients with DME cannot recover spontaneously [12]. However, early detection and following treatment may reduce the DME progression [12]. Usually, DME is clinically diagnosed using fundus ophthalmoscopy. Various imaging techniques viz. biomicroscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and colour fundus photographs are used to diagnose DME accurately [19]. Also,the Retinal Thickness Analyser (RTA) is used to diagnose various macular diseases [12]. The depth precision of RTA is 
                        5
                        –

                        m
                      and depth resolution is

                        m
                     . However, Retinal Thickness Analyser (RTA) fails to provide ocular information due to ocular media abnormalities, scarring and excessive intraretinal fluid [20]. Moreover, the usage of RTA is limited due to its sensitivity to media opacities [20]. The principle of these imaging modalities (except RTA) are briefly explained below. RTA is not widely used in clinical practice [20].


                        
                           
                              (i)
                              
                                 Biomicroscopy: The slit lamp biomicroscopy is a routine clinical examination tool and used to view all ocular structures of eye [21]. It consists of two major systems such as illumination and observation. Illumination system delivers bright, sharp and thin light to the focal plane to view ocular structures [21,22]. Nowadays, LED slit lamps are used in illumination system. Observation system consists of several optical lenses (5× to 40×) to provide magnified view of ocular structures [21,22]. Moreover, it has 10–15° convergence angle to reduce the convergence need of clinicians during eye examination [21,22].


                                 Fluorescein Angiography: FA imaging is performed by injecting fluorescein into the circulatory system and the images are captured using fundus camera, where the image intensities represents the amount of emitted photons from fluorescein [6,23].


                                 Optical Coherence Tomography: The basic principle of OCT is to measure the time-of-flight of backscattered light rays from the tissue layers. Backscatter are caused due to difference in the refractive index of the tissue layers. It can be measured through interferometry due to thin retinal layer (
                                    300
                                    –
                                    500
                                    
                                    μ
                                    m
                                 ) and very small differences in time of flight of tissue layers [23]. Therefore, OCT uses coherent radiation in the near infra-red (820nm) region to scan the eye in x, y and z direction. The radiation from the eye is compared with a reference beam. The resulting interference pattern is detected and displayed as a pseudo colour image depicting the normal and abnormal ocular anatomy [23,24].


                                 Colour fundus photographs: Fundus photography records the three dimensional retinal structures into the two dimensional imaging plane using fundus camera, where the image intensities constitute the amount of reflected quantity of light [23]. The fundus camera having low power microscope is attached on the top of that camera. The optics of the microscope provides vertical and magnified view of inner surface of the eye. The colour retinal image is captured using reflected Red Green Blue (RGB) spectrum and light sensor [6].

                         shows the typical fundus images and cross sectional optical coherence tomograms of normal, NCSME and CSME. Fig. 4c and d shows the left and right eye cross sectional optical coherence tomogram and its thickness profile for NCSME class. Fig. 5b shows the diffuse cystoid CSME. In these images green horizontal lines denotes OCT B-scans.

Typical colour fundus images (
                        Fig. 6a) shows the normal retinal anatomy and lesions of NCSME and CSME. The corresponding Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) shown in Fig. 6b reveals FA of normal fundus and FA leakage in NCSME and CSME subjects.

This paper reviews the merits and limitations of various methods used to diagnose DME. This paper is organized as follows: The diagnosis of diabetic maculopathy using biomicroscopy, FA and OCT is described in Section 2. The automated detection of anatomical structures (macula and fovea) and segmentation of morphological feature such as HE and automated DME grading using geometrical location of exudates, texture and image mining based methods are explained in Section 3. The advantages and limitations of different imaging modalities for DME detection are summarized and discussed in Section 4.

Biomicroscopy and OCT are two commercially available instruments used to examine macular edema [25]. Biomicroscopy is classified into contact and non-contact lens types [22]. Generally, non-contact fundus biomicroscopy is used for clinical examination [26]. However, it is less sensitive as compared to contact lens biomicroscopy [26]. Fig. 7
                      shows the of functional block diagram of biomicroscopy. The contact lens biomicroscopy is used to inspect the ocular fundus namely scleral indentation [27]. The peripheral fundus view can be enhanced using 3-mirror contact lens [27]. The disadvantages of contact lens type are lens need to touch the cornea and pupils dilation is necessary [22]. The quality of image seen through non-contact lens type is almost same as contact lens examination [27]. It provides more flexibility than contact lens type and able to visualize retinal elevation and dehiscence [27]. However, OCT (refer to Fig. 8
                     ) is widely used to measure the extent and amount of retinal thickening [10]. OCT provides detailed RTM [25]. Table 2
                      summarizes the studies conducted to diagnose the DME using retinal thickness using biomicroscopy, OCT and FA (refer to Fig. 9
                     ). OCT is used to perform high resolution and precise measurement of macular thickness [12,28]. Several authors have used OCT to measure Retinal Thickness (RT) in DME patients [12]. Massin et al. [29] analysed reproducibility of RT measurement software used in OCT. Initially, visual acuity and fundus biomicroscopy is performed to confirm the fundus condition. Their results showed that RT mapping software is able to provide reproducible measurement for both normal and CSME patients.

Sánchez-Tocino et al. [30] used OCT to measure retinal thickness between diabetic eyes, with and without Macular Edema (ME). The patients are examined with indirect ophthalmoscopy, posterior segment biomicroscopy and fundus lens. RT or HE observed in biomicroscopy correlated with increased thickness on OCT evaluation. However, in some patients OCT detects the retinal thickening when biomicroscopy shows no abnormalities. Further, the presence of CSME is quantified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Their results reveal that CSME eye is thicker than normal eye. Strøm et al. [31] have compared the subjective and objective evaluation of RT location in DME patients using fundus photographs and OCT respectively. Initially, all the patients are examined through slit lamp biomicroscopy and found that all are having CSME [31]. However, obtained result shows that OCT evaluation is more sensitive for small change in RT as compared to biomicroscopy. Moreover, their results show 89.4% agreement on RT location between fundus and OCT images. The quantitative assessment of DME using OCT is performed in [32]. Before, OCT imaging macula is examined using biomicroscopy, Visual Acuity (VA), indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus photography. The biomicroscopy results reveal that 19 patients have NCSME and 14 patients have CSME. Further, RT is computed at fovea and 36 locations around the macula. The OCT result reveals that foveal thickness is higher for CSME

                     . Soliman et al. [33] studied the association between intraretinal OCT and FA findings in DME patients. Different patterns of intraretinal changes are correlated to FA. Early DME changes are seen in FA as compared to OCT. OCT showed Serous Retinal Detachment (SRD) which is not seen in FA. The pathological findings of diabetic foveal edema using contact lens biomicroscopy and OCT are compared in [34]. Their study showed an excellent agreement between OCT and contact lens examination for patients with foveal edema. However, biomicroscopy fails to detect mild foveal thickening as compared to OCT evaluation. FA and OCT are used to analyse association between RT, perifoveal capillary blood flow velocity, capillary occlusion in patients with NCSME and CSME [35]. Initially, all the study subjects underwent VA test and contact lens biomicroscopy examination before FA. Their result shows that significant correlation between FA and VA for all three DME pathology such as RT, perifoveal capillary blood flow velocity, capillary occlusion [35]. Retinal Thickness (RT) is measured in diabetic patients with and without ME using OCT[36]. Significant changes in RT are observed between NCSME, CSME and normal [36].

Sadda et al. [37] compared the results of CSME detection using OCT grid scanning method and biomicroscopic examination. The patients underwent OCT imaging using macular grid 5 scanning method and fast macular thickness map. Also, the clinical examination is performed using stereoscopic fundus images. The macular grid 5 obtained a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 86% in detecting CSME [37]. Their results indicate that, automated grading of CSME improves objectivity, reproducibility, sensitivity and precision in diagnosing CSME [37]. The DME screening protocol using OCT is proposed in [38]. RT is computed over 600 locations of the macula. The results are compared with biomicroscopy and FA. The foveal thickness (mean±Standard Deviation (SD)) of normal eye is

                     . Their results show that OCT and biomicroscopy evaluation have significant correlation to CSME grade. However, OCT provides objective evaluation as compared to biomicroscopy. The fast macular thickness mapping protocol of Stratus OCT is used to calculate the repeatability and reproducibility of RT in [39]. The study subjects are selected using VA score and media clarity of the fundus visualized through contact lens biomicroscopy [39]. The coefficients of repeatability and reproducibility are 8% and 10% for healthy subjects and 9% and 11% for patients with CSME. This shows that RT measurements for healthy and CSME subjects are repeatable and reproducible [39].

Catier et al. [40] used OCT to analyse intra-retinal changes in ME patients. Initially, all the study subjects are examined using biomicroscopy and identified for macular thickening. Further, OCT is used to measure the macular thickness [40]. The measured mean macular thickness is 
                        373
                        –

                        m
                     . Their results reveal that macular thickening is correlated to the visual loss. Moreover, OCT shows the foveal SRD, but it is not identified on biomicroscopy [40]. Soliman et al. [41] used FA, biomicroscopy, fundus photography and OCT to analyse various patterns of DME. Different OCT patterns are correlated with VA and thickness of central macula. Their results show that OCT is able to visualize various morphological patterns of DME. The quantitative examination of macular retinal thickness using OCT is performed in [42] to diagnose DR. Moreover, the relationship between RT and standard examination such as biomicroscopy, FA and VA are also explored. The RT at fovea is

                      for DME patients which shows that OCT is able to detect DME with great reliability. Alkuraya et al. [43] investigated correlation between OCT features, concurrent retinopathy severity, Central Macular Thickness (CMT) and VA in patients with CSME. The CMT is significantly

                      higher compared to normal and CSME subjects.

Browning et al. [44] compared OCT based RT and VA in eyes with DME before and after laser photo-coagulation. RT is measured using OCT. They observed significant correlation between RT and VA. Massin et al. [45] used VA, contact lens biomicroscopy, FA, fundus photography and OCT to evaluate DME before and after vitrectomy surgery. The vitreomacular traction is detected on OCT and is not seen using biomicroscopy. RT is significantly reduced from

                      showing that OCT imaging is a suitable for DME diagnosis. The treatment efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone is evaluated in patients with DME using OCT. The OCT findings demonstrated greater VA in inner retinal layers with decreased macular thickness. Ghazi et al. [46] studied persistent CSME after laser treatment using contact lens biomicroscopy, fundus photography, FA and OCT on vitreomacular interface. Their results revealed high prevalence vitreomacular interface abnormalities after the treatment [46]. Moreover, vitreoretinal adhesions is seen only in OCT as compared to aforementioned diagnostic techniques [46].

Kim et al. [47] used OCT to demonstrate different morphological patterns of DME. Initially, DME patients are identified using contact lens biomicroscopy. Further, OCT is used to identify five different morphological patterns of DME namely diffuse retinal thickening, Cystoid Macular Edema (CME), posterior hyaloidal traction, SRD and traction retinal detachment. They observed that retinal thickening is higher for all the five patterns which are significantly correlated to VA. The correlation between tomographic features of DME and VA are analysed in [48] using OCT. It captured three patterns of structural changes in DME namely retinal swelling, CME and SRD. Also, it revealed that RT is highly correlated to VA. Gaucher et al. [49] studied vitreoretinal relationship in patients with diabetes with and without DME using biomicroscopy and OCT. Further, OCT is performed on vitreoretinal interface of macula to obtain cross sectional images [49]. Their results show that posterior vitreous detachment is significantly higher for DME subjects. Moreover, they showed that combination of OCT and biomicroscopy are suitable diagnostic modalities for posterior vitreous detachment [49]. Characterization of SRD and DME is performed in [50] using OCT. Foveolar neuro RT and height of SRD measured using OCT show that RT

                      is highly correlated to DME [50]. Moreover, standard examinations such as FA and contact lens biomicroscopy are performed to identify SRD. However, no specific pattern is observed in FA and biomicroscopy [50]. Yamamoto et al. [51] established the correlation between OCT features and visual functions of eyes with DME. Initially, OCT and multi-focal electroretinograms are performed on both eyes. They observed that fovea is significantly thicker in eyes with CME as compared to normal. Also multi-focal electroretinograms׳ results are directly correlated with foveal thickness. DME patients with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) is analysed in [52] using contact lens biomicroscopy, OCT and FA. The pathological changes are visible in biomicroscopy [52]. However, increased foveal thickness is noticed in ischemic CRVO based on OCT and FA findings. Also, VA is inversely correlated to foveal thickness. OCT and FA findings of ischemic DME is discussed in [53] and correlated to VA. The findings show that retina is thicker for ischemic DME cases and has lower VA.

Koleva-Georgieva et al. [54] used SD-OCT to evaluate serous macular detachment in patients with DME. Initially, all the patients are subjected to VA test, non-contact biomicroscopy, FA and OCT [54]. FA findings show that diffuse leakage, cystoid appearance and macular ischemia [54] in patients with DME. SD-OCT are able to measure RT, volume, diameter of cystoid lesion, height of serous macular detachment. Hence, SD-OCT findings are useful to diagnose DME with serous macular detachment [54].

Nunes et al. [55] investigated correlation between High-Definition (HD)-OCT and VA for the measurement of RT. Sixty-two eyes with CSME are subjected to RT analysis using OCT. The results show 48% correlation between RT and VA. Dmuchowska et al. (2014) [56] studied the relationship between RT and capillary loss at Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ). Patients are examined using VA test, tonometry and slit lamp biomicroscopy to confirm CSME. Their results showed no significant relation between RT, outer and inner retina, Ganglion Cell Complex (GCC) thickness and FAZ outline. Cystic changes of DME patients are evaluated in [57] using SD-OCT and leakage patterns of FA. There is a significant correlation between pathological changes on SD-OCT and FA findings. Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) thickness is evaluated in ischemic DME using (FD)-OCT and FA [58]. Results revealed that GCL thickness is highly correlated with VA and macular light sensitivity [58]. Moreover, capillary loss found in FA is correlated with loss of GCL identified using FD-OCT [58]. GCL damage is analysed in [59] using FD-OCT and FA. The FAZ damage in FA is significantly correlated with GCL damage in OCT. SD-OCT is used to analyse macular pathology in patients with DME [26]. SD-OCT findings are useful to screen referable DME. HD-OCT is used to identify the vitreofoveal interface features in patients with chronic CME [60]. Their finding show that cystoid fluid leakage may lead to vitreo-macular traction and posterior vitreous detachment. HD-OCT used in [61] is able to measure the choroidal thickness of DME patients. There is significant reduction of choroidal thickness in DME patients as compared to normal subjects. However, thickening is noticed in subfoveal region [61]. Polarization Sensitive (PS)-OCT is used to analyse the presence of HE in DME patients [62]. All the patients underwent standard clinical examinations such as VA test, slit lamp biomicroscopy and fundoscopy to confirm DME. Higher HE detection rate is reported using linear regression analysis 
                        (
                        r
                        =
                        0.81
                        )
                     . Choroidal thickness is analysed in patients having NPDR with NCSME and CSME using enhanced depth imaging OCT [63]. Before OCT evaluation the retina is examined using biomicroscopy in pupil dilated eyes. Results show that choroidal thickness is reduced and may lead to tissue hypoxia and blood retinal barrier breakdown [63]. Bolz et al. [64] analysed leakage pattern and morphological features of the retina using FA and HD-OCT in DME patients. Diffuse leakage pattern is found in FA is highly correlated with morphological changes of retina in HD-OCT. HD-OCT is used for automated diagnosis of DME [65]. Features are extracted using logarithmic space, linear space and exponential distribution from the OCT images and SVM classifier and reported an accuracy of 84.2%. Correia et al. [66] used HD-OCT to analyse normal, Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) thickness changes in patients with DME. Initially, manual segmentation of ONL is performed. Further, segmented ONL is modelled using Monte Carlo method to generate A-scan data which showed pathological changes of ONL due to changes in the cellular characteristics [66]. Kang et al. [67] used OCT to assess correlation between OCT features and FA in patients with CSME. The FA features such as focal leakage, diffuse leakage, diffuse cystoid leakage and OCT features namely thickening, foveolar detachment with and without vitreofoveal traction are analysed. The results showed a strong correlation 
                        (
                        p
                        <
                        0.0001
                        )
                      between OCT and FA features in case of CSME.

FA leakage pattern of DME is segmented in [68] using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Initially, matched filer and k-means clustering are used to eliminate the blood vessels. Further, macular intensity is modelled using Gaussian function to enhance the macular region and finally GMM is used to segment the DME lesions in FA. Magdy et al. [69] performed quantitative analysis of FA leakage maps in DME patients. Matched filter is used to identify and eliminate the blood vessels. Second order polynomial function is used to model the macula region. Finally, OCT thickness map is superimposed on FA leakage pattern using linear transformation. Roychowdhury et al. [70] proposed automated detection of cyst in DME using OCT. Different layers of OCT are segmented using iterative high pass filtering and cyst is detected using shape and area constraints. Their method obtained a correlation rate of 90%. Sugmk et al. [71] proposed automated detection of DME using OCT. Gaussian filtering and thresholding are used to enhance the noise and segment the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL). Binary classification is performed to classify Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and DME classes.

Browning et al. [72] compared the performance of non-contact lens biomicroscopy and OCT for the diagnosis of DME. They obtained a correlation agreement of 0.63 (k statistic) for two methods. Their results show that biomicroscopy examination is less sensitive as compared to OCT. Hirakawa et al. [73] studied cross sectional structures and leakage patterns of CME using OCT and FA. Before performing the study, the macular area is examined using indirect ophthalmoscopy and contact lens biomicroscopy. The area of the cystoid lesion in OCT is positively correlated with FA. Weisz et al. [74] evaluated the treatment effect of ketorolac ophthalmic drops on CME using VA test, FA and biomicroscopy. Their result revealed that 70% of eyes improved due to ketorolac drops treatment. Do et al. [75] studied the correlation between persistent DME and hemoglobin A1c. The study subjects are examined using biomicroscopy and FA to detect CSME. Their results show that hemoglobin A1c values are higher in the case of persistent DME. Rudnisky et al. [76] compared the performance of high resolution stereoscopic digital fundus photography (refer to Fig. 9) and contact lens biomicroscopy for the diagnosis of CSME. Their results revealed that exact agreement between the fundus photography and biomicroscopy to diagnose CSME is 83.6%. Kisilevsky et al. [77] compared the performance of Heidelberg retina tomograph and contact lens biomicroscopy to detect diabetic maculopathy. FA leakage is documented in patients with DME. Heidelberg retina tomograph generated macular edema maps which showed a good agreement with fundus biomicroscopy in the diagnosis of diabetic maculopathy [77].

The identification of anatomical structures namely macula and fovea is important for automated DME detection system [79]. The macula is an oval-shaped avascular region around the fovea which is responsible for central vision. The visual cells in the fovea are responsible for sharp vision [6,80]. The automated macula and fovea detection methods are briefly described in Table 3
                           .

Matching correlation and characteristics of fovea used in [81,96] help to identify fovea. The selection of correlation template is manual which decides the fovea localization performance. Most of the literatures [82,84,86–89,93,95,97,98] towards fovea detection have used position of fovea from OD (2DD) to locate fovea. Hence, the accuracy of fovea detection mainly depends on the OD localization. Optic nerve localization and horizontal vascular arcade detection is performed in [87] using geometrical modelling of the fundus image. Finally, macula location is identified from the optic nerve co-ordinates. Their method evaluated on two private and STARE datasets 
                              (
                              n
                              =
                              345
                              )
                            with different retinal pathology and reported an localization accuracy of 92.5%. Niemeijer et al. proposed point distribution model [85] and k-NN regressor [91] to identify the location of macula. Their method evaluated on private dataset with 500 images and reported an accuracy of 94.40% and 93.40% respectively. Fleming et al. developed temporal vasular arcade detection using ellipse fitting for the detection of macula [84]. Their method evaluated on private dataset with 1056 images and obtained an accuracy of 96.50%. Li and Chutatape used active shape model to locate the main vessels and followed by parabola fitting to identify the macula [82]. However, their method experimented using only 35 images and reported an accuracy of 100% [82]. Active shape model and iterative thresholding used in [83] to detect fovea. Their method experimented with 61 images and reported an accuracy of 97%. However, their method may fail when dark pathology appears near the fovea [83]. Singh et al. [90] proposed appearance based fovea detection using mathematical morphology and geometrical relation. Their method evaluated on two public dataset with 502 images and reported an accuracy of 96%. However, fixed global threshold needs to be selected manually to isolate the lesions. Hence, among various fovea detection methods (refer to Table 3) geometrical modelling, point distribution model [85], k-NN regressor [91] and ellipse fitting [84] provided promising results to locate macula and fovea.

One of the important feature of DME is thickening of retina due to HE, formed due to leakage of plasma from capillaries may appear as waxy, yellow, shiny structures with clear boundary [1]. ME can be detected by the presence of HE within 
                              500
                              
                              μ
                              m
                            from the centre of the fovea [38,99,100]. Hence, segmentation of HE is important for an automated DME detection [100]. Table 4
                            presents various techniques used to segment HE in the retinal fundus images.

Gardner et al. [101] used back propagation NN to differentiate exudates from blood vessels and HA. Their method detected exudates with a sensitivity of 93.10%. However, detection sensitivity depends on preprocessing and number of training samples used [101]. Sinthanayothin et al. used Moat operator and recursive region growing method to differentiate exudate and non-exudate regions [103] and reported a sensitivity of 88.50%. Their method used background mean intensity to select the threshold which discriminates the exudate and non-exudate regions [103]. Morphological image processing and thresholding methods are used in [104] to identify the exudates in the fundus images. Their method used 30 images and reported a sensitivity of 92.80% [104].

Dynamic clustering method is used in [102] to segment exudates and reported a sensitivity of 100%. However, blood vessel removal is a prerequisite to differentiate artefacts and exudates [102]. Osareh et al. proposed exudate segmentation method using FCM and colour information. Their method used various colour spaces and Luv colour space to provide maximum discrimination between exudate and non-exudate region [105,114]. Final segmentation is performed using morphological features of segmented regions and reported a sensitivity of 93% [105,114]. Sánchez et al. used Kirsch׳s operator, mixture modelling and dynamic thresholding to segment exudates from colour fundus photographs. Their method reported an accuracy of 79.62% [106] and 100% [110,116]. However, trade-off parameter 
                              α
                            controls the sensitivity and false positives. Giancardo et al. [119] used wavelet, Kirsch׳s operator and thresholding to discriminate exudate and non-exudate regions. Their method obtained a sensitivity of 81%. However, thresholding is to be selected manually [119]. Kirsch׳s operator and Riesz transform used in [123] segment the exudates and reported an AUC of 0.826.

Contextual clustering and fuzzy art classifier are used in [108] to detect exudates. However, their method is evaluated using 25 images and reported a sensitivity of 93.40% [108]. Sopharak et al. used FCM, mathematical morphology, morphological features and naive Bayes classier to segment the exudates. Their method reported a sensitivity of 80% [111], 93.38% [112] and 92.18% [117]. However, FCM parameters need to be optimized to obtain high sensitivity [111,112,117]. Level sets and shape features of exudates are used to discriminate exudate and non-exudate regions and reported a sensitivity of 96.53%. Their method used shape entropy information to stop the level set evaluation. K-means clustering and colour space evaluation are used in [115] to segment exudates and reported a segmentation accuracy of 89.70%. The centroid of the K-means clustering need to be chosen to obtain high segmentation accuracy [115]. Yazid et al. [122] proposed exudate segmentation using FCM, edge detection and thresholding and obtained a sensitivity of 98.20%. However, FCM parameters should be optimized.

Welfer et al. [118] used mathematical morphology, coarse and fine segmentation approach to isolate the exudates. However, their method obtained a sensitivity of 70.48% [118]. Mathematical morphology used in [121] segments the exudates and reported a sensitivity of 78.28%. Mathematical morphology and Gabor filtering used in [120,124] isolates the exudates and other yellow lesions. Finally, shape features are used to perform fine exudate segmentation and yielded a sensitivity of more than 96% [120,124].

Fleming et al. [107] used morphological image processing using various linear structuring elements and dynamic thresholding to classify the exudate and non-exudate regions. Their method yielded a sensitivity of 95% and able to discriminate exudates and drusen. Niemeijer et al. [109] proposed machine learning algorithms to segment exudates and obtained a sensitivity of 95%. Their method is able to discriminate drusen, CWS and other bright lesions from DR fundus images [109]. AM–FM, colour, texture and shape features are used in [125] to segment exudates. Their method yielded an AUC of more than 0.97. The Instantaneous Amplitude (IA) and Instantaneous Frequency (IF) features detected exudates accurately. Among various exudate segmentation methods (shown in Table 4) Gabor filtering [120,124], dynamic thresholding [107], multi-scale filter bank & k-NN [109] and AM–FM methods [125] out performed the other methods (Figs. 8 and 9).

Automated detection of DME by exudate localization and image mining techniques (refer to Fig. 10
                        ) are briefly summarized in Table 5
                        . Generally, fundus images are preprocessed to enhance the image contrast and blood vessels are removed either using mathematical morphology or matched filtering [126]. Further, macula detection and exudates segmentation are performed. Morphological, texture and image based features are extracted from the segmented exudates. Finally, DME grading is performed either by identifying location of exudates from macula or using classification algorithms. The flow diagram of the automated DME grading system is shown in Fig. 10.

Tariq et al. [79] proposed Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to grade maculopathy. Initially, macula is detected using geometrical relation between OD and macula.

They obtained an accuracy of 97.30% (MESSIDOR) and 97.89% (STARE).

Punnolil [97] proposed an automated diabetic maculopathy severity grading using morphology, texture features of exudates and multi class SVM.

Siddalingaswamy and Prabhu [93] proposed an automated grading of DME using retinal fundus images. The OD and macula is detected using histogram thresholding and positional constrains. Further, HE is segmented using clustering. Their method obtained a sensitivity of 95.60% and specificity of 96.15%.

Ang et al. [129] proposed an automated DME grading system using NN. OD localized using morphological technique and fovea is located using the geometrical relation between OD and fovea. The exudates are segmented using morphological image processing methods. Their method yielded a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 96.67%.

Nayak et al. [130] developed DME grading system using NN. OD is localized using variance of intensity and fovea is identified using matched correlation and geometrical relation to the OD. The exudates are segmented using morphological image processing. Their method obtained a sensitivity of 95.40% and specificity of 100%.

Fleming et al. [14] proposed a DME detection system using image processing algorithms. Morphological filtering is used to detect the candidate lesions. Their system is able to recognize NCSME and CSME with an accuracy of 99.2% and 97.3% respectively.

Giancardo et al. [99] used exudate probability map and wavelet decomposition for automated grading of diabetic maculopathy.

Lim et al. [131] proposed an automated DME classification system using retinal fundus images. Initially, OD is eliminated using extended minima transformation and thresholding. Exudates are segmented using watershed transformation and Sobel linear filter. Finally, DME grading is performed by computing the distance between fovea and exudates. Their method yielded a sensitivity of 80.9%, specificity of 90.20% and accuracy of 85.20%.

Medhi et al. [132] developed an automated DME detection system using location of exudates in the macula region. Image contrast enhancement and blood vessel removal are performed using histogram equalization, inpainting and mathematical morphology respectively. Image subtraction, mathematical morphology and canny edge detection are used to segment exudates and reported DME detection sensitivity of 96%.

Sreejini and Govindan [133] used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to segment exudates for automated detection of DME. Median filtering and PSO are used to remove the noise and segment the exudates respectively. Mathematical morphology and geometrical relation are used to locate the OD and grade the DME. Their method obtained an accuracy of 93%.

Zaidi et al. [134] used mathematical morphology, Gabor filtering and Otsu segmentation for automated detection of DME. Bayesian classifier is used to classify exudates, non-exudates pixels and positional constrains to discriminate normal and DME classes. Their method yielded an accuracy of 94.1%.

Medhi and Dandapat [135] used top hat transform and histogram segmentation for automated detection of DME in retinal fundus images. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and top hat transform are used to enhance the image and remove the blood vessels. Exudates are segmented using histogram thresholding and its location is used to classify normal and DME classes with a sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 98.7%.

The aforementioned methods used position of exudates in and around the macula to perform automated DME grading. Hence, exudate segmentation and macula detection are important steps in DME grading. Most of the DME grading methods [14,93,97,99,129,130,132,135] used mathematical morphology, thresholding and geometrical relation to identify exudates and macula. Gabor filtering, morphological and texture features used in [79,124,127,134] segment exudates. Curvelet transform is applied in localized FAR to perform DME grading [128]. However, their method used only geometrical relation to locate fovea [128]. Watershed segmentation and PSO are used in [131,133] to segment exudates. Among these methods Gabor filtering [79,124,127], Kirsch operator [99] and morphological filtering [14] based methods obtained highest classification performance compared to other methods reported in Table 5. Hence, these methods are suitable to grade DME using exudate location.

Hunter et al. [136] used exudates and NN to perform automated diagnosis of referable maculopathy. Initially, fovea is localized using matched correlation. The exudates are identified by computing maximum contrast and peak point on the candidate lesions. Further, these segregated lesions are subjected to morphological, colour and texture feature extraction methods to discriminate exudates and drusen. Their approach obtained a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 80%.

Deepak and Sivaswamy [100] proposed an automated DME detection using motion pattern analysis. Initially, the macula is located using standard distance from OD. Further, motion pattern generated forms a bright smear pattern. This method spatially enhances the characteristics of HE. Then Radon transform is applied to extract features from the smear patterns. Finally Gaussian Data Description (GDD) and Principal Component Analysis Data Description (PCADD) are used to classify normal and DME classes. Their method evaluated on five dataset namely HEI-MED, MESSIDOR, MESSIDOR (IR), DIARETDB0 and DIARETDB1 yielded an AUC of 0.98, 0.96, 0.99, 0.96 and 0.92 respectively.

Chowriappa et al. [137] used region specific and global texture features for automated DME grading. Various texture quantification methods namely FD, Laws Mask Energy (LME), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Fourier Spectrum (FS) and Gabor Wavelet (GW) are used to extract features from the retinal images. Further, different feature ranking methods coupled with ensemble learning methods reported an average accuracy of 96.7%.

Baby and Chandy et al. [138] used Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and GDD for automated detection of DME. Initially, image contrast enhanced using CLAHE and DT-CWT are used to obtain the wavelet sub-bands. Further, GDD is used to extract features from the wavelet coefficients. Their method yielded a precision rate of 78.23%.

Naguib et al. [139] proposed content based image retrieval system for DME. Blood vessels and OD are segmented using mathematical morphology and feature projection methods respectively.

Mookiah et al. [18] proposed Higher Order Spectra (HOS) bispectrum and cumulants features for automated detection of DME. Radon transform is used to convert 2D fundus image into 1D signal and bispectrum and cumulants features are extracted to discriminate normal and DME classes. Their method obtained the classification accuracy of 95.56% and 95.93% for private and MESSIDOR dataset respectively.

Recently, Ibrahim et al. [140] used Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), various entropies with neuro-fuzzy inference system for automated DME grading. Further, features are normalized and selected using Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Finally, their system is able to discriminate normal, NCSME and CSME with an accuracy of 98.55%. However, motion pattern analysis [100] and DWT entropy based methods [140] obtained highest AUC and classification accuracy of 0.99 and 98.55% respectively. Hence, these methods [100,140] are suitable to perform automated DME grading using texture and image features.

Diabetes patients with prolonged DR may lead to DME [17] causing vision loss. Early detection may save the vision of DME subjects [6,12]. This review discusses various imaging techniques viz. biomicroscopy, FA, OCT and colour fundus photographs used for diagnosis of DME. Also various imaging modalities used for automated grading of DME are compared.

Standard clinical diagnosis of DME is performed using slit-lamp biomicroscopy [141]. Stereoscopic slit-lamp biomicroscopy and stereo colour fundus imaging are standard screening modalities recommended by ETDRS for DME [28]. But results obtained by these modalities are qualitative and may not be able to identify small changes in RT and localize ME. Also, morphology of the retina and blood flow in the retinal vessels cannot be identified [28]. Usually, biomicroscopy is used to examine the condition of fundus and confirm the DME [22]. Hee et al. [38] showed that biomicroscopy and OCT are significantly correlated for the diagnosis of CSME. However, OCT findings are objective where as biomicroscopy provides qualitative information. The vitreomacular traction is detected in [45] using OCT, but it is not seen on biomicroscopy evaluation. The detection of posterior vitreous detachment is performed in [49] using OCT and biomicroscopy. Their results show that both modalities are suitable to detect posterior vitreous detachment [49]. SRD is not visible in biomicroscopy [50]. Browning et al. [72] showed that biomicroscopy examination is less sensitive than OCT for the diagnosis of DME. Biomicroscopy fails to detect mild retinal thickening [30,34] but OCT detects the same accurately [30,34]. Biomicroscopy only reveals the presence of CSME. It is not able to show the thickening in different retinal layers [33]. Hence, FA and OCT are required to analyse the leakage patterns of DME and RT [40].

FA is mainly used to plan the treatment of DME patients [17]. Sodium fluorescein is injected into intravenous to see the retinal blood circulation in the fundus photography [17]. Hence, FA is able to provide macular perfusion and leakage pattern. Various FA leakage in DME viz. diffuse leakage, focal leakage and diffuse cystoid leakage can be identified using FA [67]. Capillary blood flow velocity and perifoveal capillary occlusion can be identified in NCSME subjects using FA. Their study shows the movement of hyperfluorescent dots in perifoveal capillaries due to leukocytes which confirms the rheological disturbances caused due to diabetes [35]. FA findings are significant to identify early intraretinal morphology changes in DME subjects during leakage as compared to other imaging modalities [33]. Foveal perfusion can be identified using FA and may not be able to detect using OCT [56]. Moreover, FA is the only imaging modality where neovascularization and Microaneuurysms (MA) can be imaged accurately [64]. But it does not provide macular thickness and retinal morphology [28]. However, several studies [25,33,35,52,56−58,64,67,69] show that leakage pattern of FA is highly correlated with morphological changes in OCT [141]. The main advantage of FA compared to OCT, biomicroscopy and colour fundus photographs is that FA can identify ischemic DME [17]. However, FA is an invasive method and sodium fluorescein dye is allergic to few patients [17]. Moreover, FA does not give actual Retinal Thickness (RT) in DME subjects [17]. SRD is evaluated in [33] using OCT and FA. However, FA fails to show SRD leakage patterns [33].

Very few studies used RTA to diagnose DME patients with CMT and CME [142–146]. RTA is sensitive to slight changes in RT which can measure macular thickness in DME patients [12]. Neubauer et al. [143] used enhanced RTA to measure macular thickening in diabetic patients. It can detect RT with an accuracy of 100%. RTA used in [142] is able to perform quantitative characterization of DME and investigate the relationship between CMT and other clinical findings. The measured CMT is correlated with VA, biomicroscopy and FA measurement techniques. RT of vitreoretinal and chorioretinal interfaces of normal and maculopathy subjects are evaluated using RTA. Their results show increased RT [145] in maculopathy subjects. Eyes with CME, CSME without retinal cysts and normal eyes are examined using RTA [146]. Their results show an increase in foveal thickness from normal

                     [146]. Neubauer et al. [25] compared fluorescein leakage in DME classes with RTM obtained using RTA and OCT. The amount of leakage is significantly correlated to the topography of RT. Hence, they proved RTA and OCT thickness measurements can be used to diagnose DME. Polito et al. [20] used RTA and OCT imaging for objective measurement of RT in DME eyes. RT of foveal and foveolar are obtained using RTA and OCT. Their results show that OCT and RTA measurement of foveal thickness are strongly correlated with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89. However, image resolution of RTA is affected with media opacities [12,144,146]. Moreover, intra- and inter-session reproducibility of RTA need be evaluated before measuring macular thickness [142]. Hence, it is not used for routine clinical examination to diagnose DME.

OCT is used to diagnose and treat the eye with macular hole, vitreomacular traction, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and ME [147]. It is very sensitive to RT changes, hence used to measure macular thickness in DME patients [148]. OCT is a non-invasive imaging modality which provides high resolution cross sectional images of retina [149] and hence can measure RT in vivo [150]. Serous detachment of fovea can be diagnosed using OCT [33]. Fast macular thickness mapping feature of OCT is able to measure the repeatability and reproducibility of RT [39]. Vitreomacular traction is one of the sight threatening pathology of DME. Identification and surgical treatment may ensure the improved vision [49,50]. These lesions can be clearly captured in OCT imaging [49,50]. However significant leakages cannot be seen using FA. DME is the ischemic changes affect the visual functions [59]. OCT evaluation reveal the inner retinal layer loss and reduction in retinal sensitivity [57,59]. However, further research is required to understand and characterize OCT findings of ischemic DME for its prognostic significance [151]. Presence of HE in the outer-retina is seen as foci in OCT. It is not seen in biomicroscopy, colour fundus images and infrared imaging. It is an important lesion present in DME subjects [152]. Many studies conducted suggests that the quantitative analysis of OCT features are correlated with VA [30,32,40,41,45]. Results show that the increased RT is highly correlated with visual loss [30,32,40,41,45]. Intravitreal triamcinolone and laser treatment efficacy of DME patients are analysed using OCT [44–46]. Their findings show high prevalence of pathology in vitreomacular interface after laser treatment [44–46]. Recently HD, FD, SD and PS-OCT are developed to enhance the sensitivity and speed of the imaging device [55,57,58]. These devices are used to analyse GCL thickness, CME and choroidal thickness in DME patients to improve the visual outcome [55,57,58]. Studies [65,70] conducted on the detection of DME using OCT features have reported an accuracy of 84.2% using SVM classifier [65]. OCT is a costly imaging modality as compared to colour fundus photographs [6], image quality can be easily affected with media opacities and reliability depends on operator skill [12]. Moreover, OCT images are inherently noisy, thus often require 3-D contextual information [23].

Nowadays colour fundus photographs are widely used in ophthalmology to diagnose various eye diseases viz. glaucoma, AMD, DR and DME [6,153]. It can be used to visualize various clinical features (MA, HA, HE, Cup-to-Disk Ratio (CDR), CNV, drusen) of different eye diseases [6]. Various algorithms are available to segment anatomical structures and lesions of different eye diseases [6] from digital fundus images. The fundus imaging methods use morphological features and location of exudates on the fovea (refer to Tables 3 and 4) for automated grading of diabetic maculopathy (refer to Table 5). Numerous studies shown in Table 5 used morphological image processing and geometrical location of exudates to perform DME grading. Highest classification accuracy of 97.89% is reported using morphology, Gabor filter and texture based method [124]. However, extraction of exudates mainly depends on the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm [154]. Also, fovea localization is very important step in DME grading. Several authors have developed generalized texture imaging and data mining techniques for automated DME grading [18,100,137] (refer to Table 5) without segmentation of various lesions from retinal fundus images [18,100,137,154,155]. These texture and image mining methods have obtained highest AUC of 0.99 using MESSIDOR dataset [100]. However, the combination of exudates location based and texture or non-segmentation based method may provide significant improvement in the detection of DME [6]. Moreover, such systems need to be tested with large image datasets, robust features and classifiers to validate the performance of DME detection [6].

Advancement in imaging technology and digital camera may help to capture fundus images without pupil dilation [156]. Recent digital technologies help to transmit fundus images from remote location to centralized grading centre to diagnose various eye diseases [157] including DME. Several open source databases (DRIVE, DIARETDB1, HEI-MED, STARE and HRF) are available to test the performance of the CAD based DME detection methods. Numerous feature extraction and machine learning techniques [6,158] are available for automated eye disease classification using fundus images. The performance of the automated DME grading system can be improved by selecting best feature extraction methods, images with diverse lesions, suitable feature selection algorithms and classifiers [6,158]. Hence, automated detection of DME using fundus images may reduce the screening time and workload of the clinicians significantly.
