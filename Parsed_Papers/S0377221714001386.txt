@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Distribution planning (DP) in supply chains (SC) is a referenced research problem in the domain of distribution networks (DN) to successfully meet customer needs while improving operations performance efficiency. DP decides on directing commodity flows in the DN to balance supply and demand at the aggregate level in the middle-range period of time (Amiri, 2006; Chopra & Meindl, 2012; Hinojosa, Kalcsics, Nickel, Puerto, & Velten, 2008; Mula, Peidro, Díaz-Madroñero, & Vicens, 2010; Tayur, Ganeshan, & Magazine, 1999). For DP, the following data are typically needed: a facility location structure and warehouse capacities from DN design; customer demand from forecasting; inventory control policies and order quantities from inventory management and procurement planning; and transportation channel capacities from transportation network design. The DP problem is typically constrained by limited capacity of nodes and arcs in the network, given service level, reverse flows, product quality, etc. (Akkermann, Farahani, & Grunow, 2010; Chen, 2010; Costantino, Dotoli, Falagario, Fanti, & Mangini, 2012; Liang, 2008; Mula et al., 2010). The constraints may be formulated as soft (i.e., allowing capacity overrun at over cost) or hard (without allowing an overrun) conditions.

Objectives of optimization are typically oriented at costs minimization (Manzini & Bindi, 2009). In some cases, service-oriented objectives are included (Chen, 2010; Das, 2011). Episodically, multi-objective formulations can be encountered (Chen & Lee, 2004). Most of the cost-oriented contributions have been based on demand and capacity-constrained (integer) linear programming (LP), mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) or heuristics (Mula et al., 2010). Multi-objective formulations also include fuzzy-based solutions (Costantino et al., 2011; Liang, 2008; Selim, Am, & Ozkarahan, 2008).

Application of optimization models for DP is a practical need in at least two cases. First, through optimization, a significant increase in revenue and market shares can be achieved. Second, in the case of unsatisfied demand (i.e., no feasible LP solution), the bottlenecks can be identified and strengthened by investment in new facilities or capacity expansion. Similarly, such models can be applied by analysing the planning of future investments in new facilities/capacities. The basis of this analysis is balancing demand and capacities at aggregate level.

The optimization object may be the whole DN (upstream the strategic inventory holding point and downstream to the customers) or only the up- or downstream DN part. In this paper we will restrict ourselves to the upstream part consideration. Finally, considerable advancements have been achieved in the integrated formulations for distribution and transportation planning. Such models take into account different planning horizons and transfer aggregate product flows into determination of daily vehicle requirements, assignments, and routing (Bilgen & Günther, 2010; Chen, 2010; Zanoni & Zavanella, 2007). However, for real data complexity, it is frequently very difficult to implement the models where data and decision-variables of different time horizons and detailing level are considered within only one large-scale model. This frequently leads to heuristic solution procedures (Bevilacqua et al., 2012; Manzini & Bindi, 2009). Another possibility is to formulate dynamic programmes and solve them by decomposition according to some practical reality considerations (Kunnumkal & Topaloglu, 2011).

Structural and functional complexity of modern DNs, the multi-stage, multi-period, and multi-commodity DP is one challenge of decision-making on optimal DP. Another challenge is the uncertainty of inventory and demand. In this case, integration of DN design and planning typically involves robust (Baghalian, Rezapour, & Farahani, 2013), stochastic (Santoso, Ahmed, Goetschalckx, & Shapiro, 2005), and fuzzy (Costantino et al., 2011; Liang, 2008) optimization models (see also the state-of-the art review in Mula et al., 2010). However, practical application of these approaches frequently leads either to too complex and weakly implementable models or to scenario-based deterministic models without a clear articulation of how to create these scenarios.

Along with “traditional” uncertainty of inventory and demand, (i.e., random uncertainty), severe disruptions (i.e., deep uncertainty and structure dynamics subject to unavailability of some nodes or arcs in the network) have attracted much attention both in the theory and practice in recent years (Hishamuddin, Sarker, & Essam, 2013; Hu, Gurnani, & Wang, 2013; Klibi, Martel, & Guitouni, 2010; Lim, Bassamboo, Chopra, & Daskin, 2013; Peng, Snyder, Lim, & Liu, 2011; Qi, 2013; Snyder & Daskin, 2005). These studies consider how changes to some variables are rippling through the rest of the SC and impacting on performance. The scope of the rippling and its impact on economic performance depends both on robustness reserves (such as inventory and capacity buffers) and speed and scale of recovery measures. Although the term “ripple effect” has been episodically used in the supply chain management (SCM) domain (Deloitte Consulting, 2013), it has not so far received proper attention in the scientific community so far, although many of its elements have been considered implicitly in numerous empirical and quantitative studies. We suggest introducing the ripple-effect in the SCM as a scientific topic in the area of supply chain disruption management, in an analogy to computer science where ripple effect determines the disruption-based scope of changes in the system (Black, 2006). In the supply chain setting, ripple effect describes the impact of a disruption on supply chain performance and disruption-based scope of changes in the supply structures and flows.

If no stochastic or simulation models are applied, existing LP-based software for supply chain optimization in the presence of the ripple effect does not provide sufficient support for such uncertainties and companies merely to empirically build up ‘rational excessiveness’ in the form of inventories and reserve transportation capacities, or to use additional distribution centers as alternative distribution channels. In reality, companies need simple methods and decision making techniques in assisting them to make a fast decision without having difficulty in understanding complex mathematical models.

Although industrial solvers extensively use LP models solved by the simplex method, their usage can also create some problems. First, if no feasible solution can be calculated (e.g., due to uncovered demand because of insufficient capacity in the case of hard constraints), the programme merely informs the user about this problem but does not calculate a possible solution for such a situation. Second, the software indicates problematic nodes or arcs, but without calculating a proposal of how to redesign the DN structure or its parameters to meet demand. Third, no recommendations are calculated on how, in the multi-period mode, to replan product flows in the case of non-stationary capacity fluctuations or partial/full unavailability of some nodes and arcs. That is why it is important, along with the optimization approaches to DP, to be able to analyse distribution plans subject to (1) the impact of different disturbances on distribution execution; and (2) actual usage of the created structural robustness. Such an analysis has great practical importance, since companies are very interested in the results of such studies. These would help them to estimate the investment needed in different redundancies to mitigate or reduce uncertainty and the impact of these investments/reductions on the changes in operations performance.

In putting these questions into a research focus, the aim of this paper is to take into account practical issues of decision-making on optimal DP and to develop a model for multi-objective, multi-period, and multi-commodity DP for a multi-stage centralized network with structure dynamics considerations. The proposed method has been developed in a practical project on the basis of an existing industrial solver for optimal DP in a production–distribution network. The company was interested in extending the existing cost-oriented LP-based model into two directions: (i) creating flexibility for planner by including the service level objective (trade-off “service level vs. costs”) and (ii) including supply chain disruptions into the model (trade-off “efficiency vs. robustness”). The requirement on the new model was that it should be LP-based, easy understandable, and trigger minimal changes in the existing software.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyses recent literature. Section 3 presents case-study, proposed methodology and mathematical model. Section 4 is devoted to the experimental calculation of optimal distribution plans. The paper concludes in Section 5 by summarizing the most important findings and outlining future research needs.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

Previous quantitative studies considered DP under disruptions from three perspectives:
                        
                           •
                           how to synthesize SC configurations, master plans and schedules in order to maximize/ensure the planned performance (both efficiency and effectiveness);

how to remain stable and robust even in the case of disturbances;

how to adapt/recover in the case of disturbances/disruptions.

Two basic approaches to hedging DN against the negative impacts of different disruptions – proactive and reactive have been developed to coping with uncertainty in recent years (Klibi et al., 2010). However, the literature the proactive approaches dominate (Bevilacqua et al., 2012; Dotoli, Fanti, Meloni, & Zhou, 2006; Lim et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2011; Schütz, Tomasgard, & Ahmed, 2009; Tomlin, 2006). Episodically, agility and structure dynamics have been included into consideration (Braun, Rivera, Flores, Carlyle, & Kempf, 2003; Costantino et al., 2012; Ivanov, Sokolov, & Käschel, 2010). Reactive approach aims at adjusting processes and structure in the presence of unexpected events. Proactive approach creates certain protection and takes into account possible perturbations while generating DN structures and execution plans.


                     First, the literature on DP with execution considerations differ regarding the perturbation data. They may be expressed mainly in the stochastic and scenario forms. Recent literature has identified different methods to strengthen supply chains in order to mitigate the impact of uncertainty at the planning stage. These methods are mainly based on mathematical programming and simulation (Klibi et al., 2010; Mula et al., 2010). For example, the work by Liang (2008) develops a fuzzy model to solve integrated multi-product and multi-time period problems, simultaneously minimizing total costs and total delivery time in relation to inventory levels, available labor levels, machine capacity, forecast demand, warehouse capacity at each destination, total budget, and the time value of money for each of the cost categories.

In addition, stochastic maximal flow models or minimal cost flow models (Chou, Chua, Teo, & Zheng, 2011; Lin, 2001) and fuzzy models (Costantino et al., 2011; Selim et al., 2008) have been applied. Chou et al. (2011) propose an algorithm for determining the system reliability with respect to the maximum flow of a network achieving a given demand. The nodes can fail randomly and the demand is assumed deterministic; no cost/profit functions are considered. In the study by Lin (2001), the goal is to determine the production quantity of a particular product for a given random demand. The authors use a simplified supply chain that consists of plants and retailers and represent it as a deterministic bipartite graph. For solution, a heuristic scheme for determining the assignment policy is proposed. The resulting expander graphs are interesting due to the spectral properties, that is, they do not degrade by increasing the number of nodes.

Supply chain processes are subject to a number of variability sources which are frequently non-stationary and cannot always be described by stochastic models. Frequently there is no a priori information about many parameters. In other words, disruptions are possible but not predictable. As the resilience/robustness reflect the dynamic changes in the system, the ripple effect analysis should also be approached from the dynamic perspectives (Ivanov & Sokolov, 2013; Riddalls, Bennett, & Tipi, 2000).


                     Costantino et al. (2012) presented a hierarchical approach to the strategic supply chain design addressing supply planning and allowing the improvement of the manufacturing supply chain agility in terms of ability in reconfiguration to meet performance, and considering the supplier capacity constraints. The approach employs digraph modeling and integer LP to optimal supply chain design. The authors avoid stochastic models by aggregating deterministic product flows within the integer LP model.

The very extensive area of research on SC adaptation is model predictive control (MPC) Applications of MPC to multi-echelon production–inventory problems and SCs have been examined previously in the literature. Perea, Grossmann, Ydstie, and Tahmassebi (2000) modeled multi-plant, multi-product polymer processes through difference equations, and schedule optimization in an MPC framework. Braun et al. (2003) developed a decentralized MPC implementation for a six-node, two-product, and three-echelon demand network problem.


                     Second, the multi-objective issue has been addressed. Decision makers may want to judge on the trade-off between resilience/robustness and such performance measures as service level and transportation costs. Frequently, it is desired to have a number of Pareto-optimal solutions for supply chain in order to take decisions based on individual risk perceptions (Bevilacqua et al., 2012). Decision maker may invest in two measures to enhance SC resilience and performance —namely, disruption prevention and recovery. The study by Kim and Tomlin (2013) indicates that if recovery capacity investment is the only option, the firms in a decentralized setting overinvest in capacity, resulting in higher system availability but at a higher cost. If both investments can be made, the firms typically underinvest in failure prevention and overinvest in recovery capacity. That is, firms in a decentralized setting shift their focus from preventing failures to responding to failures.


                     Third, the recent studies show that efficiency paradigms of lean processes, single sourcing, etc. have failed in disruption situations (Lu, Huang, & Shen, 2011; Wang, Gilland, & Tomlin, 2010). As a consequence, SC became more vulnerable even to minor perturbations. Any disruption in a global SC, especially in its supply base, does immediately affect the entire SC. With the increased specialization and geographical concentration of manufacturing, disruptions in one or several nodes affect almost all the nodes and links in the SC (Kim & Tomlin, 2013). Finally, recent empirical literature on SC disruptions that indicates significantly more efforts into pre-disruption stage as compared with recovery activities (Blackhurst, Dunn, & Craighead, 2011; Bode, Wagner, Petersen, & Ellram, 2011). The rationale behind this situation may be that investments in protection are tangible and directly decrease net profits while recovery costs are anticipated. This very interesting trade-off has not found proper attention in literature so far.

The preliminary analysis of the multi-stage DP problem with uncertainty in structure dynamics has shown that it could be modeled as a stochastic maximal flow model, i.e., as maximal flow models or minimal cost flow models (Chou et al., 2011; Lin, 2001) and fuzzy models (Liang, 2008; Selim et al., 2008). However, in some aspects these methods are rather restrictive. First, existing studies in this research area have not explicitly considered possible structure dynamics and its impact on the flows and cost. Second, deviations or failures in the network structures and operations are possible, but not unrealistic or describable with some probabilistic assumptions. In addition, the DN structural states do not change permanently, but rather at some intervals. Besides, the execution characteristics of flows (e.g., cross-docking processing) should be considered. The next peculiarity is the necessity to take decisions on operative replanning in case of emergency. A significant practical challenge is partial information unavailability at the zero point of time, as well as information updates during execution. Finally, some other peculiarities such as return flows, many varying parameters, and multi-objective problem formulation may represent barriers to applying graph-theoretical methods.

Another possible way to model the considered problem could be the mathematical programming (MP)-based implementation (Mula et al., 2010) and the so-called inventory transportation (Qu, Bookbinder, & Iyogun, 1999) or inventory-routing problems (Andersson, Hoff, Christiansen, Hasle, & Løkketangen, 2010). For example, Li, Chu, and Chen (2011) considered multi-stage, one-period inventory-routing problems with deterministic demand. However, structural changes and inventory dynamics in different periods do not allow direct application of one-period transportation models. The applications of MILP are frequently reduced to a heuristic procedure because of the high complexity in implementing all the interrelations within only one large-scale model (Bevilacqua et al., 2012; Manzini & Bindi, 2009). Some studies provide evidence of successful MILP applications to selected DP problems (Das, 2011). Other possibilities for modeling real flows are system dynamics (Villegas & Smith, 2006) and control theory (Ivanov & Sokolov, 2013).

The existing models consider the uncertainty to different extents. Most of the industrial software (e.g., Oracle SNO) implements LP models. Unfortunately, many of the LP models are static and deterministic, giving an optimal solution for a fixed set of data. Even in the multi-period formulations, non-stationary changes in DN parameters are not reflected due to discrete time representation. Besides, although LP models are the most practicable solutions in industry they do not succeed in multi-objective dynamic planning in unbalanced demand/capacity cases, considering the evolution of demand through time and topological changes in the DNs (capacity/inventory dynamics and node/arc availability or blocking). The one objective (i.e., cost minimization) formulations may result in solutions that are illogical from an economic point of view. For example, if supply flow exceeds the demand flow and transportation costs are higher than inventory holding costs, the solution will suggest stocking the excessive products in the intermediate nodes rather than at the strategic inventory holding point, as would seem sensible from the service level point of view. The factors considered above favor the option for multi-objective methods and algorithms giving, as an answer, a set of possible solutions.

Although considerable contributions to the DP in terms of uncertainty have been made in operations research in the last decades, some practical questions still require further elaboration. First, uncertainty of execution is typically modeled as isolated from the recommendations of how to proceed with the execution after a disturbance. Second, the execution scenarios or stochastic models are not always applicable to a practice that frequently seeks for more simple, but at the same time adaptive, methods for the representation of execution dynamics. Third, the existing models assume a more or less stable DN structure and stationary parameters (in practice, structures are dynamic and parameters non-stationary). Fourth, the distribution plan analysis has been frequently reduced to sensitivity analysis without interconnection to other planning decisions, e.g., DN design or procurement and transportation planning.

The desired contribution of this study is to develop a DP model for a centralized upstream DN on the basis of LP that will allow:
                        
                           •
                           multi-objective problem formulation and analysis (trade-off “service level vs. costs”);

finding a feasible solution for unbalanced supply and demand;

considering dynamic execution scenarios and developing suggestions on replanning in the case of structure dynamics (trade-off “efficiency vs. robustness”).

First original idea of this study is description of the supply chain as a non-stationary dynamic system along with a LP model. This allows distribute design and control variables between dynamic and static models. Second original idea is to transit from the classical LP model to maximal flow problem by excluding demand constraint from the LP model. The first contribution of this study is multi-objective problem formulation. Second, the maximal flow LP model allows the finding of a feasible solution even for unbalanced supply and demand cases without relaxing hard capacity constraints. Third, this allows improve service level at the strategic inventory holding point. Fourth, structure dynamics can be taken into account. From a practical point of view, these contributions are especially important regarding multi-objective decision-making. In addition, in many companies decisions are still taken without clear delineation of aggregate and detailed levels. That is why it is a research duty now to popularize the aggregate decision-making level and showing interdependencies by strategic, tactical, and operative decisions.

We investigate a multi-stage DN that displays the following characteristics: (i) system performance depends on its ability to execute despite of perturbations; (ii) some system elements may become unavailable due to disruptions in the DN, and (iii) the system experiences performance degradation if some of its elements fail.

The transportation volumes are constrained by maximal transportation intensity. The inventory volume is constrained by maximal warehouse capacities. The processing at terminals and hubs is constrained subject to maximal in- and outbound processing intensities. Suppliers deliver certain order quantities at the beginning of each period, and many periods are involved in the planning horizon. It is assumed, that:
                              
                                 •
                                 capacities and order quantities are variable and represented as time functions;

the demands of the regional distribution center may change in each period;

any node or arc in the network may be temporarily unavailable;

an inventory from previous periods may be used in the following periods;

if the processing and warehouse capacity is exceeded by the delivered quantity, unprocessed and non-stored goods are sent back to an additional warehouse (not in the main network) subject to additional return costs;

delivered and received product flows may be different (e.g., due to debts/damage during the transportation);

sourcing, transportation, processing, return, fixed, and inventory costs are assumed to be a linear function from the quantities.

The primary problem is to find the aggregate product flows to be moved from suppliers through the intermediate stages to the strategic inventory holding point subject to maximizing the service level and minimizing the total cost under (i) constrained capacities and processing rates and (ii) varying demand, supply, and DN structure, for a multi-period case. In addition, the calculated plans should suggest ways for reconfiguration of product flows in the case of structure dynamics and severe disruptions.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

The particular features of the proposed approach are as follows. First, possible execution scenarios based on the graph-theoretical analysis of structural genes are calculated (Cohen & Havlin, 2010). Here. The design variables are defined. Then a dynamic optimal control model is formulated in order to show the problem statement in the non-stationary continuous-time mode. This model is interconnected with the execution scenario identification and is necessary in order to describe the structure dynamics scenarios. However, the dynamic control model contains piecewise functions in the right parts differential equations in order to describe the structure dynamics. This makes the calculation procedure complicated both theoretically and practically. Subsequently, it is assumed that although DN structure and parameters may change the non-stationary mode, these changes are not constant, and there are intervals of structural constancy.

It is assumed that each network element within the subintervals (structure constancy intervals) is indicated by these characteristics which do not change within this interval. For these intervals, a multi-objective LP model with transit nodes and two side constraints is formulated. In order to achieve the desired contributions, the practical logic of decision-making in companies is taken into account. Economic order quantities are calculated based on predicted demand. That is why there is no need to include again demand constraint into the model formulation. Exclusion of demand constraint allows transit from the classical LP to maximal flow problem, formulated as an LP model. The graph of structural reliability allows identify the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. These scenarios are used for computational experiments with the developed model and the industrial models as available in Oracle SNO.

                         be an execution scenario with intervals of structural constancy. The SC is considered as a dynamic non-stationary system. Changes in SC structure (e.g., because of changes in transportation costs, contracts with suppliers, unplanned transportation resource unavailability) are subject to SC structure dynamics (Ivanov et al., 2010). With SC structure dynamics, scenarios of SC execution are set up.

A distinguishing feature of the proposed approach is that the execution scenarios are neither generated nor random, but are on the basis of an original approach to network structure reliability assessment developed by authors (Kopytov, Pavlov, & Zelentsov, 2010). This approach is based on the graph theory and uses graph genes identification in order to determine critical elements in the graph and possible scenarios of failure (Cohen & Havlin, 2010). Based on this method, the nodes 1, 4, and 7 (see Fig. 2 in the next Section) have been revealed as critical operations in the considered DN. In Fig. 1
                        , corresponding execution scenarios are presented.

In Fig. 1, structure dynamics scenarios are depicted.

Eqs. (2)–(4) describe dynamics of transportation, delivery, stocking and return operations. Note that ψχiρ

                        φχiρ
                        (t) are known for any l-interval, and eχij
                        (t) reflects the DN structure dynamics according to the scenario Scχ

                        (t),

                        ϑχiρ
                        (t) uniquely define zχiρ
                        (t) and yχiρ
                        (t). Therefore, the pairs yχiρ

                        zχiρ

Eq. (5) constraints inventory amount subject to maximal warehouse capacity. Eq. (6) ensures that control variables take integer values. Eq. (7) constraints the return flows to only positive values. Eq. (8) shows that at the beginning of the planning interval, no inventory and return flows exist; at the end of the planning interval, the return flows and inventory may take only positive values.Control variables uχijρ

                         as the objective with highest priority, the model will calculate the solution for maximal flow and push inventory to node 5 (as requested by service level strategy), even if this may result in higher transportation costs. As a comparison, a demand constrained and cost-oriented LP model calculates a solution with the stocking of the product in the intermediate terminals in the case of already satisfied demand. In the worst case, it may result in a solution

With the suggested convolution, the Pareto set points can be gained with the help of varying the coefficients α (one possible solution is presented in Eg. (21)). A shortcoming of this approach is of the psychological nature and refers to the selecting such α so that the Pareto set is investigated uniformly. After the inclusion of weights into the goal function, the LP with transit nodes and two-side constraints may be solved on the basis of simplex method with consecutive plan improvements technique.

The coordination of the planning results of static and dynamic models is carried out through the variables xijk
                        , yjl
                        , and gjl
                         (aggregate amount of products) of the static models and the corresponding variables xijk
                        (t), yjk
                        (t), and gjk
                        (t) from the dynamic model, where vector u is OPC vector, i.e., the optimal transportation plan. Besides, by considering different commodities and time intervals in the dynamic model, the dimensionality of the LP model can be reduced. By distributing elements between the static and the dynamic model, the dimensionality of the LP model for the k-subintervals can be reduced and non-stationarity of distribution processes and DN structure dynamics can be reflected. In addition, continuous representation may be useful for processing industry with continuous product flows.

Analysis of the static problem (13)–(19) showed that in spite of its high dimensionality it could be efficiently solved via special decomposition procedures and the method of successive improvement of plans for LP problems with two-sided constraints. For experiments with only the static model, computations can be performed in commercial optimization software that supports simplex method. In particular, the model (13)–(15) can be calculated as a special case of transportation problem with two-sided constraints and transit nodes.

For experiments with the dynamic model, after setting up DN structures, planning goals, and execution scenarios, the OPC algorithm is then run along with LP calculation for each period by simplex method. The algorithm of dynamic control is programmed by us. The building of the planning model within the proved theorems and axioms of the operations research (simplex method) and control theory (Lee & Markus, 1967, Ivanov & Sokolov, 2012) allows us to consider the solutions as optimal. The same problem instances have also been investigated for isolated periods with Oracle SNO. Under elimination of the demand constraint in SNO, the same distribution plans have been obtained. This confirms optimality of the developed models along with their extensions described in Sections 1 and 2 as compared to current industrial standards.

Let us consider the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios defined in Fig. 1 (see Fig. 2
                        ).

The DN is composed of two mega-hubs (nodes 1 and 6), a central distribution hub (node 4), two intermediate terminals (nodes 2 and 3), an outsourcing terminal (node 7), and a regional distribution center as the strategic inventory holding point (node 5). The execution in each of the nodes and transportation arcs is limited by maximal warehouse capacity, processing intensity, and transportation intensity respectively.

The triangles refer to the warehouse capacity, and numbers on the arcs refer to maximal transportation intensity. The suppliers first deliver goods to the mega-hubs 1 and 6. Then, the goods will be processed in the central distribution hub 4. The goods from hub 1 are additionally processed at intermediate terminals 2 and 3. From hub 4, the goods are moved to the regional distribution center 5, which has a certain demand in each of the periods (i.e., 100 units). In practice, a number of the regional distribution centers are in the DN. Without loss of generality, we are reducing this formulation in this particular paper to only one center. This is the centralized DN structure. As known from previous studies (Tayur et al., 1999), the service level in such DN is measured (i) as the rate of the covered demand and (ii) by closeness of the inventory to the customer, i.e., pushing the inventory to the strategic inventory holding point. In order to take into account possible problems with the channel 4→5, an outsourcing terminal is used as an alternative way for deliveries to reach the distribution center 5. Besides, it is possible to move small quantities (maximal 30 units) directly from terminal 2 to center 5. Three intervals of the structural constancy are considered. The problem is to maximize the service level under the assumption of the demand of 300 units for the planned period of three months (i.e., 100 units each month) while minimizing the costs as composed of the storage, transportation, return, sourcing, and fixed costs. For simplification, processing costs and capacities are not considered in this example.

In the optimistic trajectory, the events for transition to the second interval are the changes in sourcing volumes at nodes 1 and 6 as well as a failure in the operation of the terminal 7. Analogously, transition to the third interval of the structural constancy is launched by the failure in the operation of the mega-hub 1 and terminal 7 along with the change in the sourcing volume in node 6.

In the pessimistic trajectory, the events for transition to the second interval are the changes in sourcing volumes at nodes 1 and 6 as well as unavailability of the link from the central distribution hub 4 to the regional distribution center 5. Analogously, transition to the third interval of the structural constancy is launched by failure in the operation of the mega-hub 1 and further unavailability of the link from the central distribution hub 4 to the regional distribution center 5 along with the change in the sourcing volume in node 6.

In Tables 1 and 2
                        
                        , results of optimal planning subject to the data from Fig. 2, highest priority of the service level component in the goal function (Eqs. (9)–(11), (17)–(19)) for the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios are presented.

The same example has been calculated with Oracle SNO subject only to cost minimization. The corresponding plan is presented in Fig. 3
                        .

The yellow triangles show the warehouse capacities and their actual utilization. The blue rectangles represent transportation channel capacities and the actual transportation quantities. In Table 3
                        , planning results subject to key performance indicators are presented.

Through the running of the developed planning model on the assumption of the highest priority of the service level component in the goal function, the optimal solution for the optimistic scenario allows delivery of 300 units which is equal to a service level of 100%, subject to the planned demand of 300 units.

The SNO LP model calculates the solution for the first period where 20 units of excessive inventory are stocked on node 4 rather than forwarded to the strategic inventory holding point 5. Similarly, in the second period, SNO suggests stocking 20 units at node 2 rather than forwarding them to strategic inventory holding point 5 (see Fig. 4
                        ).

This is quite obvious, since the SNO LP minimizes costs and therefore suggests avoiding additional transportations if demand is already covered. The cost-oriented optimization results in a reduction of transportation costs from US$28.6 to US$27.8. However, the service level requirement, i.e., to hold inventory at node 5, is not taken into account as compared with the proposed model where 60 units are available at node 5 during the planning horizon.

For the pessimistic scenario, optimal solution allows delivering 250 units which is equal to a service level of 83.3%. As a comparison, an LP model for such an example in Oracle SNO does not allow calculation of a feasible solution with hard constraints because of unbalanced supply and demand. Only if soft constraints are considered, i.e., the capacities may be arbitrarily increased at over costs, a feasible solution is possible.

Further analysis may include two basic decision groups: (1) analysis of distribution plans in different scenarios of the DN structure dynamics subject to different disturbances; and (2) analysis of DN design excessiveness and flexibility subject to capacity and sourcing planning decisions. Let us concentrate in this paper on the analysis of the first group since the analysis of the second group requires the use of the inverse model that is not represented in this paper.

Let us analyse the plans (δoptimistic
                     ,
                     δpessimistic
                     ) subject to the following disturbances:
                        
                           •
                           
                              variant 1 – decrease in transportation intensity on the way 4→7→5,


                              variant 2 – decrease in warehouse capacity at the node 4,


                              variant 3 – decrease in transportation intensity on the way 4→5, and


                              variant 4 – influence of the variants (1)–(3) simultaneously.

Plan δoptimistic
                         was proved to be stable subject to the disturbances of variants 1 and 2. It can be observed from Table 1 that the node 7 has not been selected for transportation and can actually be removed from the supply chain. The warehouse at the node 4 has also not been used at all and its capacity can be reduced significantly or eliminated (however, in the pessimistic scenario, this capacity can be used to adaptation in the case of a disruption in the channel 4→5). In Fig. 5
                         the analysis of the optimistic plan sensitivity to the disturbance of the variant 3 is presented.

From Fig. 5 it can be observed that the positive profits may be achieved by the transportation capacity decrease to up to the 40 units. After this point, the revenue falls significantly. Similar sensitivity analysis can be also performed for the pessimistic scenario subject to the disturbance No. 4.

Based on the sensitivity analysis for optimistic and pessimistic scenarios it can be observed that:
                           
                              •
                              Decrease in transportation intensity on the way 4→5 (disturbance No. 3) does not significantly influence the cost, but considerably impacts the volume of delivered goods in optimistic plan. On the contrary, the volume of delivered goods in pessimistic plan is influenced by the disturbance No. 3 only to a small extent.

Disturbance No. 1 influences the volume of the delivered goods only in the pessimistic scenario.

Decrease in warehouse capacity at the node 4 (disturbance No. 2) does not influence the volume of the delivered goods neither in the pessimistic not in the optimistic scenario. This is due to reserve warehouse capacities at other nodes in the DN.

In Fig. 6
                        , results of sensitivity analysis for the pessimistic scenario plan subject to the disturbances 1–4 are presented.

Corresponding cost- and revenue-based analysis can be performed analogously to the optimistic scenario as shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed that:
                           
                              •
                              Decrease in transportation intensity on the way 4→5 (disturbance No. 3) does not significantly influence the cost, but considerably impact the volume of delivered goods in optimistic plan. On the contrary, the volume of delivered goods in pessimistic plan is influenced by the disturbance No. 3 only to a small extent.

Disturbance No. 1 influences the volume of the delivered goods only in the pessimistic scenario.

Decrease in warehouse capacity at the node 4 (disturbance No. 2) does not influence the volume of the delivered goods neither in the pessimistic not in the optimistic scenario. This is due to reserve warehouse capacities at the other nodes in the DN,

Disturbances of the variants 1 and 2 increase the volume of return flows to 15 and 20 units correspondingly. But their mutual impact (disturbance No.4) increases the volume of return flows to 60 units (see Fig. 6).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Multi-stage, multi-period, and multi-commodity problem settings challenge multi-objective decision-making on optimal DP. An original approach to optimal DP for an upstream centralized network with uncertainty and structure dynamics considerations has been developed in this paper. Optimal distribution plans have been calculated for optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Subsequently, these plans have been analysed subject to different disturbances and regarding DN design and sourcing planning decisions.

The developed DP model on the basis of LP has two particular features. First, this study uses the real logic of decision-making in companies and excludes demand constraint from the LP model. This allows transit from the classical LP problem to maximal flow problem, formulated as an LP model, in order to improve service level at strategic inventory holding points. Second, an original idea is the use of intervals of structural constancy.

The first contribution offered by this paper is a multi-objective problem formulation that opens additional perspectives for decision-making beyond cost-oriented optimization. Second, by taking into account the reality of decision-making in companies, the proposed model is represented as a maximal flow problem. This developed approach allows the finding of a feasible solution even for unbalanced supply and demand cases without relaxing hard capacity constraints. More importantly, this model makes it possible to formulate the inverse problem to perform analysis regarding interconnected decisions on DN design, transportation design, and procurement planning. Another contribution is the consideration of different execution scenarios and the development of suggestions on replanning in the case of structure dynamics. Finally, some extensions of this model in future can be considered. First, it is possible to extend the developed model to operative detailed decisions on transportation planning. The possibility of addressing decision components of different time horizons and levels of detail arises from a combination of a static LP and dynamic OPC models. This combination can result in a hybrid multi-period distribution–transportation model that can be investigated in detail in future research.

Second, in comparing the presented approach with the literature, dimensions of agility and flexibility as well as environmental performance can be integrated subject to the trade-off “efficiency-flexibility-resilience”. Different data, e.g., fuzzy representation, can be considered. Additional restrictions, e.g., total budget with time value or other optimization objectives, e.g., minimizing delivery times, can be included in future analysis. On-line adaptation can be the next possible future research direction. Here different adaptation options (e.g., flow re-direction, capacity adjustment, and structure adjustment) and their costs can be compared. In addition, a comparison between investments in robustness vs. costs of adaptation can be made.

Some limitations of the proposed approach belong to its centralized planning focus and limitation on the upstream part of a DN. However, for the considered case-study the proposed model has been successfully validated and practically tested on different examples and been compared with existing industrial solutions. In future, an extrapolation of other case-studies with different numbers of intervals of structural constancy and other DN structures may reveal some additional insights in the application of the proposed model and the approach in general. Additional research into dynamic and inverse models is needed. The disturbances can be considered as unpredicted and handled in a reactive mode. Also the strategies of information sharing in the DN (as suggested in this study by the deterministic demand) and partially unknown demand information (e.g., stochastic demand or adaptive planning) can be compared in future.
