                  This paper formulates the global route planning problem for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a constrained optimization problem in the three-dimensional environment and proposes an improved constrained differential evolution (DE) algorithm to generate an optimal feasible route. The flight route is designed to have a short length and a low flight altitude. The multiple constraints based on the realistic scenarios are taken into account, including maximum turning angle, maximum climbing/gliding slope, terrain, forbidden flying areas, map and threat area constraints. The proposed DE-based route planning algorithm combines the standard DE with the level comparison method and an improved strategy is proposed to control the satisfactory level. To show the high performance of the proposed method, we compare the proposed algorithm with six existing constrained optimization algorithms and five penalty function based methods. Numerical experiments in two test cases are carried out. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates a good performance in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the constraint-handling ability.
