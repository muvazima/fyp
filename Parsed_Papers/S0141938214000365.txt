                  This study investigates impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layer with a radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated thin-film transistors (TFTs). Results indicate that as the film was deposited with a higher oxygen flow, the transfer curves are positively shifted while the field-effect mobility (μ
                     FE) is significantly decreased. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (R
                     CH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (R
                     SD) of the fabricated devices are extracted using the total resistance method. The extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (r
                     ch) and RSD are found to increase while the extracted effective mobility (μE
                     ) is decreased with increasing oxygen flow during sputtering. These observations are postulated to be related the decrease in the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio and the increase in the Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the a-IGZO films with increasing the oxygen flow rate which lead to higher resistivity and lower carrier concentration. The extracted RSD can be comparable with R
                     CH for the devices prepared with high oxygen flow, resulting in the roll-off of μ
                     FE as the channel length is shorter than 20μm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (TAOSs) are promising for channel materials of thin-film transistors [1] (TFTs) and are feasible for driving TFTs in organic light-emitting diode displays due to large carrier mobility (>10cm2
                     V−1
                     s−
                     1| and low process temperatures. Amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) channel layers are usually deposited by sputters because of the low deposition temperature and thus the feasibility for manufacturing of devices on flexible substrates. It is well known that the properties of amorphous metal oxide semiconductor materials are strongly dependent on the processing conditions [2,3]. In this regard, there had been several reports exploring the effects of deposition power [2], oxygen flow [2,3] and working pressure [3,4], on the basic electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Both direct current (d.c.) [5,6] and radio frequency (r.f.) sputters [3,7,8] have been adopted to deposit a-IGZO films and used as the channel in the fabrication of a-IGZO TFTs. In essence, to optimize the quality of a-IGZO film is important to achieve excellent device characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs. Recently, Kwon et al. [9] reported that the proposed oxygen incorporation calculation method and elucidates quantitative calculation of oxygen incorporation in sputtered IGZO films and the impact on a-IGZO transistor properties, the resistivity curve with O2/IGZO incorporation ratio can be used for the tool to estimate the IGZO sputtering conditions for optimum TFT performance was confirmed. Shimura et al. [10] reported that the TFT performance varies with the source/drain materials since the source-to-drain current was found to be dependent on the contact resistance between the a-IGZO channel and source/drain (S/D) metals. In addition, the passivation layer which directly contact with the channel film region, such as hydrogenated silicon nitride (SiNx), would highly reduce the channel resistivity by enhancing carrier concentration and forming nearly ohmic contacts to reduce the parasitic source to drain resistance [11]. Furthermore, argon (Ar) plasma treatment at source and drain metal contact regions in a-IGZO channel film also improve the contact resistance [12]. As a common understanding, the a-IGZO TFT is in general sensitive to the oxygen vacancy, however there is fewer reports demonstrating effects of a-IGZO channel resistance and S/D contact resistance with the channels deposited at various oxygen flows on electrical characteristics of a-IGZO devices.

This paper reports the impacts of oxygen flow during the deposition of a-IGZO channel layer with an r.f. magnetron sputter on the electrical characteristics of the fabricated TFTs with various channel lengths. Optimum electrical properties were indicated as the film was deposited with a lower oxygen flow from transfer and output characteristics. To get more insight about the effects, channel resistance (R
                     CH) and the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (R
                     SD) of the fabricated devices with various oxygen flows are extracted using the total resistance method [10,11]. Finally, the relationship between the metallic atomic ratio in a-IGZO films by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) compositional analyses and the extracted a-IGZO channel resistance per unit length (r
                     ch), the parasitic source-to-drain resistance (R
                     SD), and effective mobility (μE
                     ) were explained.

@&#EXPERIMENTS@&#

The composition of the IGZO powder used in the experiment was mixed by an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1. The target powder (In2O3, Ga2O3, ZnO) with high purity were more than 99.99%. After the IGZO target was formed and sintered, we mounted it in the sputter chamber for the deposition of IGZO thin films on glass substrates. The film thicknesses of the a-IGZO thin film were determined in the wavelength range of 200–900nm using an n&k analyzer 1200 (n&k Technology). The atom ratio of the deposited a-IGZO films with the various oxygen flows was investigated by XPS. Fig. 1
                      shows the cross-sectional schematic structure of the a-IGZO TFTs device. A 200nm Al–Si–Cu was first deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) on a 4″ silicon substrate capped with 500nm-thick thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) film. The metal layer was patterned by photolithographic and subsequent wet etching steps to form the gate electrode. Then, a 100nm TEOS oxide was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as the gate dielectric. Before depositing the a-IGZO active layer, we had to pre-sputter the target for 15min to prevent the contamination of IGZO target surface. Subsequently, a 50nm a-IGZO film was deposited as the channel layer by the r.f. sputter with varied oxygen partial pressure at room temperature under a fixed deposition power of 100W. The system’s base and working pressures were 3×10−6
                     Torr and 5mTorr, respectively. During sputtering, the flow rate of Ar was fixed at 50 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm), while the oxygen flow rate was set at 1sccm, 3sccm, or 5sccm, with oxygen partial pressure of 9.8×10−5, 2.83×10−4, and 4.54×10−4
                     Torr, respectively. A 300nm Al–1.5wt% Ti S/D metal was then formed with a lift-off process. Afterwards, a lithographic step to define the active device region was performed. A diluted HCl solution (HCl:H2O=1:200) was used instead to avoid damage and severe lateral etching of the a-IGZO channel film. In order to contact the gate electrode, contact etching was performed by wet etching using buffer oxide etcher (B.O.E.).

The channel width (W) was fixed at 400μm and the designed channel length (L), which is defined as the distance between the source and drain metal pads, was varied from 10μm to 100μm. Electrical measurements of all devices were executed by an Agilent 4156A precision semiconductor parameter analyzer, and the measurement temperature was maintained at 25°C. Prior to the measurements, all a-IGZO TFTs samples used in this study were annealed at 200°C in air for 40min on the hot plate aiming to remove the excess moisture on TFTs. For a low VD
                      (at 0.1V), the total resistance (R
                     total) as a function of the designed channel length can be evaluated by using the total resistance method conducted in the linear region of the output characteristic of the devices [11,13]:

                     Fig. 2
                     (a) shows the typical transfer curves of a-IGZO TFTs samples with various oxygen flows at W/L
                     =400/100μm. Oxygen vacancies are the main source to release free electrons to transport in the metal-oxide semiconductors. This is clearly confirmed in the figure that the transfer curves are positively shifted with increasing the oxygen flow. Therefore, a higher gate voltage is necessary to accumulate free electrons to form a conductive layer between the source and drain. The carrier concentration induced by the gate voltage at the interface of the a-IGZO semiconductor film and the insulator (in cm−3) can be estimated by the followings [13,14]:

                     where e is the elementary charge, n is an estimated carrier concentration of the a-IGZO channel, and t is the channel thickness. Fig. 2(b) shows the estimated carrier concentration (n) of the a-IGZO channel as a function of gate voltage for each oxygen flow at W/L
                     =400/100μm. The estimated carrier concentration increased with increasing the gate voltage, and the a-IGZO channel layer deposited with a lower oxygen flow tends to enhance the carrier concentration in the channel ascribed to a smaller V
                     th. The extracted V
                     th, sub-threshold swing (SS), on-current, and field-effect mobility (μ
                     FE) of a-IGZO devices deposited with various oxygen flows are shown as a function of L in Fig. 3
                     (a–d) respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows that the V
                     th has a weak dependence on the channel length. This is because the channel length is more than 30 times larger than the gate oxide thickness, thus the short channel effects are expected to be small. In addition, it is seen that the variation of V
                     th is increased with increasing oxygen flow. In Fig. 3(b), the SS increases with increasing oxygen flow. It is known that the SS can be affected by the bulk defects in the a-IGZO channel film in addition to the interface traps, thus the reduction in SS might result from the greater densification and lower amount of the bulk defects as deposited at a lower oxygen partial pressure [2–4]. Fig. 3(c) shows the on-current measured under the same gate overdrive voltage of 8V. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the on-current reduces with increasing oxygen flow owing to deficiency in the estimated carrier concentration, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 3(d) shows that μ
                     FE is dependent on the channel length. The μ
                     FE for the devices processed at a higher oxygen flow rate is obviously reduced as the channel length is shorter than 20μm. It is postulated to be related to the effect of the S/D parasitic resistance in these devices with a shorter channel length. Next, this issue is clarified by measuring the resistance components in the devices.

                     =3.4kΩ and ΔL
                     =1.0μm are determined, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The shrinkage of the channel length, ΔL
                     =1.0μm would be attributed to the critical-dimension loss of the S/D metal spacing resulted during the corresponding lithographic and following lift-off process steps. In addition, the respective R
                     SD values extracted using the above procedure are 3.4, 3.9, and 14kΩ for splits with oxygen flow rate of 1, 3, and 5sccm, respectively. Results of the extracted channel resistance per channel length (r
                     ch) and the effective mobility (μE
                     ) of a-IGZO devices with various oxygen flows as a function of gate overdrive are shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), respectively. It is obvious that a higher gate overdrive voltage induces more free electrons to transport in the channel, which is the main reason for the lowering in channel resistance. Because the a-IGZO channel layer deposited with a higher oxygen flow tends to reduce the carrier concentration in the channel, a higher potential barrier height and longer transport paths are expected from the percolation model [15]. This well explains the findings shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c) that r
                     ch is higher while μE
                      is lower in the films deposited with a higher oxygen flow at the same gate overdrive voltage. Extracted R

                     =100μm and 10μm for the a-IGZO TFT devices with oxygen flow rates of either 1 or 5sccm are shown in Fig. 5
                     . As can be seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b), for the low oxygen flow rate of 1sccm, the R
                     SD contribution to R
                     total is negligible regardless of the channel length and studied gate overdrive. On the other hand, for the devices prepared with the oxygen flow of 5sccm, the R
                     SD contribution to R
                     total is still mild as with a long channel (L
                     =100μm), as shown in Fig. 5(c). However, as the channel length is shortened to 10μm, the impact of the R
                     SD on device characteristics is no longer negligible, as shown in Fig. 5(d). Actually R
                     SD is comparable with R
                     ch, as shown in the figure. This observation also reasonably explains the trend shown in Fig. 3(d) that noticeable decline in μ
                     FE as the channel length is shorter than 20μm for the devices with oxygen flow of 5sccm. Similar finding was also reported by Barquinha et al. [16]. Fig. 6

                     =400/100μm. The saturation current at the same gate overdrive obviously decreases with the higher oxygen flow. Despite the higher resistivity, the ohmic S/D contacts are still formed for the split with high oxygen flow as shown in the output characteristics, attributed to the S/D parasitic contact resistance is negligible for a-IGZO TFT devices with W/L

                      shows the measured In, Ga, and Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) atomic ratios for the deposited a-IGZO films with various oxygen flows. The results were obtained with the XPS technique. By increasing oxygen flow rate from 1 to 10sccm, the value of In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the deposited films decreases from 51.8% to 47.9%, but the values of Ga/(In+Ga+Zn) and Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratios of them increase from 27.3% to 29.0% and from 20.9% to 23.1%, respectively. The dependence of the In/(In+Ga+Zn) and Ga/(In+Ga+Zn) ratios on the oxygen flow rate is postulated to have strong influences on device characteristics including V

Previous studies [18,19] have also shown that the resistivity of a-IGZO films was higher with a higher zinc atomic ratio. Moreover, it has been reported that an increase in Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio with the oxygen flow rate tends to cause an increase in V

They are postulated to be related the decrease in the carrier concentration in the channel, owing to the reduction of the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratios and the increase of Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the a-IGZO films with the oxygen flow rate. In addition, the parasitic source-to-drain resistance, RSD obviously increases with increasing the oxygen flow rate from 3.4kΩ to 14kΩ, however R
                     SD would not depend on the carrier concentration in the channel because it is not changed by a different gate overdrive voltage.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Effects of various oxygen flows on the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO TFTs prepared by r.f. magnetron sputtering are explored in this work. With an increased oxygen flow rate, the transfer curves are positively shifted while μ
                     FE and on current (at a fixed gate overdrive) decrease owing to a reduction in the estimated carrier concentration of the channel. The estimated carrier concentration increased with decreasing oxygen flow tends to enhance μ
                     FE, and on-current, while reduced V
                     th of a-IGZO devices. This is confirmed by the results of the resistance measurements that r
                     ch is higher while μE
                      is lower in the films prepared with a higher oxygen flow. These outcomes are postulated to be related the decrease of the In/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio and the increase of Zn/(In+Ga+Zn) ratio of the deposited a-IGZO films with increasing oxygen flow rate. Meanwhile, RSD obviously increases from 3.4kΩ to 14kΩ when the oxygen flow rate increases from 1 to 5sccm, however RSD would not depend on the carrier concentration in the channel because it is not changed by a different gate overdrive voltage.
