                  We develop a model for a one-time special purchasing opportunity where there is uncertainty with respect to the materialization of the discounted purchasing offer. Our model captures the phenomenon of an anticipated future event that may or may not lead to a discounted offer. We analyze the model and show that the optimal solution results from a tradeoff between preparing for the special offer and staying with the regular ordering policy. We quantify the tradeoff and find that the optimal solution is one of four intuitive policies. We present numerical illustrations that provide additional insights on the relationship between the different ordering policies.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A basic premise in most inventory management models is that the unit-price is constant. Suppliers, however, are often under pressure to increase sales or reduce inventory levels. As a result, they tend to offer discounts so that retailers will be inclined to order larger quantities than usual. From a retailer’s point-of-view, this may constitute an opportunity to benefit from higher sales margins.

For example, consider a retail chain selling a commodity, the behavior of which is relatively static. As the Olympics approach, the retailer identifies a special purchasing opportunity caused by potential overstocking of the commodity at suppliers operating in the vicinity of the hosting city. Such opportunity entails uncertainty, and its materialization is not guaranteed. The retailer faces a tradeoff between reducing stocks prior to the event to benefit from the discounted offer and risking higher inventory costs if the offer does not materialize. It is this tradeoff that we wish to resolve in our work.

The supplier also may not know for sure if the discount will be possible. Moreover, she may be reluctant to share information as it will obligate her. Thus, from the retailer’s perspective, quantifying the potential savings that might be gained from preparing for a special purchasing opportunity can shed light on the effort and cost that it is worthwhile to invest in obtaining this information. In Lee, So, and Tang (2000), the authors show the impact the variability of demand has on the value of information. In our paper, we show that even in an otherwise deterministic setting, the possible occurrence of a one-time unit-price discount is influential.

We use the economic order quantity (EOQ) model as our modeling framework. Even though the model relies on a set of simple and restrictive assumptions, its simplicity and robustness (in the sense that a relatively large deviation in the estimation of the model’s parameters results in a relatively small deviation in the objective function value) makes it a widely used tool.

We develop a model that depicts a system in the EOQ setting in which the retailer predicts that at a known point of time, a one-time special purchasing opportunity may occur with a certain probability. We analyze the optimal replenishment policy in such a setting, and characterize its structure. We then show that the optimal replenishment policy is one of four intuitive policies, which can be found and evaluated using closed-form expressions. Finally, we provide additional insights on the relation between the different policies through numerical illustrations.

The unit-price discount is extensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., Goyal, Srinivasan, & Arcelus, 1991 and Ramasesh, 2010). The setting we study in this research is unique in the sense that we tackle a one-time probabilistic discount, which can happen at a known time in the future. The next section provides a comprehensive review of this topic.

The rest of this work is organized as follows: After reviewing the literature in Section 2, we formulate our problem in Section 3. In Section 4 we analyze the model and derive an optimal solution. In Section 5 the results are visualized and studied using numerical illustrations. In Section 6 we discuss several extensions to our work. Finally, in Section 7, we highlight the main findings and suggest further research directions. To aid readability, the technical proofs are presented in Appendix A.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The EOQ model is introduced by Harris (1913) and further developed by Wilson (1934). An elaborate review of the model and its well-known extensions can be found in Nahmias (2008). One of the first works on inventory models with discounts is that of Friend (1960) who study random purchasing opportunities with reduced fixed ordering costs. In their model, demand and discounted offers arrive as a Poisson processes, and the system is modeled as a Markov chain. Naddor (1966) introduce multiple discount models based on the EOQ model, including an immediate price increase. The author assumes that an immediate price increase occurs when the inventory level is zero, which prompts a one-time opportunity to purchase inventory at a discounted unit price. While the body of literature on unit-price discounts in inventory models is quite broad, Friend (1960) and Naddor (1966) exemplify the two main lines of work. The first, on recurrent discounts, usually operates in an infinite horizon setting, and the second, on one-time purchasing opportunity, often occurs in the EOQ environment. We begin with the latter, which is the focus of our work, and for completeness, we also note some of the salient studies on recurrent discounts.

One-time discounts appear in the literature mainly in one of three forms: (1) instantaneous discounts in the present or at a future time, (2) discounts over an interval of time, and (3) discounts in the form of an extended credit period. Ardalan (1988) studies a model that is similar to that of Naddor (1966) but allows an arbitrary level of inventory when the special opportunity takes place. Taylor and Bradley (1985) extend the model proposed by Naddor (1966) to account for an announced price increase at a future moment in time. Lev and Weiss (1990) consider the case of a finite horizon EOQ model with a single price change. They base their results on the work of Schwartz (1972), who investigate the EOQ model in a finite horizon setting. They use the total cost as the objective function. Tersine and Schwarzkopf (1989) study a model with an announced special purchasing opportunity for a nonrestrictive time duration in an infinite time horizon setting. Aull-Hyde (1996), Cardenas-Barron, Smith, and Goyal (2010), Al Kindi and Sarker (2011), and Taleizadeh, Pentico, Aryanezhad, and Ghoreyshi (2012) investigate a one-time discount when shortages are allowed. Several authors study similar problems assuming that costs are discounted (for example, see Aucamp & Kuzdrall, 1989; Grubbstrom & Kingsman, 2004).

Other types of unit-price discount models include the work of Davis and Gaither (1985) who study an EOQ model with a one-time offer of delayed payments. Ardalan (1994) looks at a one-time discount where the demand is sensitive to the discounted price. Arcelus, Shah, and Srinivasan (2003) look at different one-time price incentives for a model for perishable items. Other work on deteriorating or imperfect inventory include those by Chang, Lin, and Ho (2011), Allah Taleizadeh, Mohammadi, Eduardo Cardenas-Barron, and Samimi (2013), and Kevin Hsu and Yu (2009). An alternative discount model is introduced in Sari, Rusdiansyah, and Huang (2012), where there are several discount offers, with different discounts at different times that can be utilized at most once. Yang, Ouyang, Wu, and Yen (2012) study a one-time discount model where there is capacity constraint, while Peter Chu, Chen, and Thomas Niu (2003) look at a model where the discounted purchased quantity can be selected from a restricted set of values. Sarker and Al Kindi (2006) study multiple types of one-time discounts, including one that is both a one-time and quantity discounts. For an excellent review of one-time discount models, the reader is referred to Ramasesh (2010) and Goyal et al. (1991).

One challenge when measuring the performance of policies in an infinite horizon is that one-time disturbances in inventory behavior do not affect the long-run average cost. This means that the standard EOQ model objective function does not capture these disturbances. The most common approach to overcoming this difficulty is by optimizing the savings comparing to the EOQ model. This can be done in several ways, the most common being to consider the costs in a finite time interval until the system reverts to the EOQ settings, and approximating the EOQ costs during this interval. The conventional method of approximating the EOQ costs is to multiply the duration of the finite interval by the average cost the EOQ model. We denote this method as the Differential Costs approach (also known as the Average Cost Approach in Ramasesh, 2010). The need to approximate the EOQ costs comes from the fact that after the system reverts to the EOQ model, the difference in costs is not constant but rather cyclic and depends on the time when costs are compared. Approximating the EOQ costs, and looking at a finite interval resolves this problem. Two other methods for approximating the costs are offered by Yanasse (1990), who use the worst-case value of the cyclic difference, and Huang, Kulkarni, and Swaminathan (2003) and Lim and Rodrigues (2005), who consider the average difference over the cycle. An alternative approach is to consider discounted costs, a method that is known as the Discounted Cash Flow approach. This method results in a finite cost expression that can then be minimized; see also the discussion in Baker and Hanna (1987).

For recurrent discounts, Hurter and Kaminsky (1968b) extend the model presented by Friend (1960) to incorporate discounts on the unit price. Hurter and Kaminsky (1968a) study a different discount model where the system randomly transitions between two states, with high and low costs. They consider a policy that is a mixture of a base-stock policy, and an (s, S) policy for the high and low intervals, respectively. Kalymon (1971) study a periodic review inventory model in which the unit price changes according to a Markov chain, whereas in Golabi (1985), a periodic review model with random costs and fixed demand is analyzed. Silver, Robb, and Rahnama (1993) develop effective heuristics for the model presented by Hurter and Kaminsky (1968b). Zheng (1994) prove the optimality of a threshold-based policy for a continuous review inventory system with Poisson process demand, while Moinzadeh (1997) investigate an EOQ model with random deal offerings. Finally, we note the work by Chaouch (2007) that generalizes Hurter and Kaminsky (1968a) to allow for demand that is affected by cost, and also low- and high-price intervals of different lengths.

In this study, we generalize existing work by incorporating a probabilistic one-time discount offer. This generalization is usually overlooked by assuming that the discount offer occurs without notice. Our model captures an ubiquitous phenomenon with considerable economical impact that has not received much attention in the literature, where traditionally it is assumed that one-time discounts materialize with certainty. Moreover, our analysis offers a unified closed-form solution to the problem that is both insightful and intuitive, and can be easily implemented in practice.

Our model is best thought of as the classical EOQ model with an additional assumption of a one-time special purchasing opportunity. The EOQ parameters are the demand rate D, fixed order cost K, unit cost c, and holding cost rate h. Shortages are not allowed. We add to the classical EOQ model a one-time special purchasing opportunity at a future time ts
                      that may materialize with a known probability p. Without loss of generality, we assume that inventory is zero at the beginning of the planning horizon. The case in which the initial inventory is greater than zero is discussed in Section 6.1. Table 1
                      summarizes our notation. We use * to denote optimal values.

The classical EOQ objective function is the long-run average cost. Thus, any deviation from an ordering policy over a finite-time horizon will not affect the objective function value. This means that a one-time special purchasing opportunity is ‘invisible’ to the classical EOQ objective function. Intuitively, however, it seems that a discount, even if it is one-time, improves performance. No supply chain manager with near zero inventory would pass up a discount. Clearly, there is a discrepancy between what we intuitively feel is important and the mathematical objective function.

A few methods for overcoming this difficulty exist. We refer the reader to Section 2 for more details. Here we take the differential cost approach, which is the most common approach, and the one that we found most appropriate for our analysis. We define our objective function to be the difference between all of the incurred costs and the standard EOQ average cost until inventory runs out for the first time after the time of the special purchasing opportunity ts
                     . At that time the model reverts to the standard EOQ model (see, e.g., Naddor, 1966 and Gallego, 1994).

In a deterministic environment, an ordering policy specifies all of the planned orders—sizes and timings. Without loss of generality, these decisions are determined at the beginning of the planning horizon. With a futuristic probabilistic one-time special purchasing opportunity, since there are two possible outcomes for the event, there are also two scenarios that completely describe the ordering policy. We will denote by S the scenario in which the special purchasing opportunity materializes, and by N the scenario in which it does not. Each scenario yields different order sequences—sizes and timings. We refer to the description of all orders under both scenarios as the ordering policy or simply policy. The costs of this ordering policy will be compared to the cost of the standard EOQ policy.

We have two possible streams of expenses, each associated with a different scenario. We will denote by

                      is known at the beginning of the planning horizon. We denote Ts
                      as the stochastic time duration from ts
                      until the moment of the next inventory depletion. Ts
                      is a random variable since its value depends on a probabilistic event.

We use qs
                      to refer to the on-hand inventory at ts
                      before an order is placed. An example of an arbitrary ordering policy is illustrated in Fig. 1
                     .

Our differential cost approach compares ordering policies according to two criteria (in the following order):

                        
                           1.

Intuitively, we have an EOQ model with a single event that affects costs for a limited period of time. Consequently, we would first like to achieve a long-run average cost as in the EOQ model—we can do no better. Second, we would like to order based on short term savings due to the special purchasing opportunity, i.e., maximize the savings over the EOQ policy. At time

                      the system reverts to a simple EOQ problem in which the EOQ policy is optimal.

                     In the next section, we analyze our model and show that the optimal solution can be found by comparing the easily calculated expected total savings of four easily computed policies. Thus, we show that the optimal solution for any problem instance can be found in negligible time.

In this section we analyze the model presented in Section 3 and derive the optimal policy. We begin by narrowing down the search space for an optimal solution by investigating properties of the optimal solution. Using these properties, we present the structure of the optimal policy and the control variables that define it. Finally, we find the optimal values of the control variables.

We begin with some general observations, which are related to the long-run characteristics of the optimal ordering policy.

Our investigation begins with the observations related to the planning horizon.

                           Observation 1
                           
                              The long-run average cost of any policy under any scenario is equal to the long-run average cost of the same policy under the same scenario starting at any time T. Moreover, the expected long-run average cost of any policy is equal to the expected long-run average cost of the same policy starting at any time T.

Indeed, the occurrences until time T have no effect on the long-run average cost. We thus denote the long-run average cost of policy π under scenario x ∈ N, S by

From Observation 1 we learned that the special purchasing opportunity cannot reduce the long-run average cost. This combined with the optimality (in terms of long-run average cost) of the EOQ policy yields Observation 2.

We now proceed to investigate properties related to the ordering policy, when there is no discount at the time of order.

                           Proposition 1
                           
                              [Zero ordering] In the optimal ordering policy, when purchasing cost is regular, orders are placed only upon stock depletion.
                           

The proof is based on the proof of zero-ordering for the standard EOQ model. This proof along with the proof of most of the subsequent properties can be found in Appendix A. Note that the regular purchasing cost relates to any moment of time other than ts
                         and to time ts
                         under scenario N.

                           Corollary 1
                           
                              Any ordering policy in which the inventory does not deplete after ts is sub-optimal.
                           

Based on Corollary 1, we will only consider policies with finite values of 
                           
                              T

                         and thereafter.

                           Proposition 2
                           
                              [Equal-ordering] Under the optimal ordering policy, all orders made before ts are of equal size.
                           

An example of an ordering policy complying with the properties discussed thus far is presented in Fig. 2
                        . Note that at time ts
                         an order is placed under scenario S, but not under scenario N. Now only two questions remain:

                           
                              1.
                              What is the size of orders, denoted by Q
                                 0 [units], before time ts
                                 ?

For a given Q
                                 0, what should the order size be at time ts
                                  under scenario S? Let this quantity be denoted as Qs
                                 .

Thus, we have a tradeoff between preparing for scenario N, where we keep costs down by keeping Q
                        0 close to 
                           
                              
                                 Q

                              ,
                           
                         and preparing for scenario S, potentially benefiting from the special purchasing opportunity by keeping qs
                         low so Qs
                         can be large.

                        Proposition 3 characterizes the ordering decision at time ts
                         for any qs
                        . While there may be several ways to arrive at time ts
                         for a given qs
                        , the ordering decision at time ts
                         is independent of how one arrives at time ts
                         with qs
                        .

                         is greater than zero.

                           Definition 1
                           An admissible ordering policy is an ordering policy that cannot be dismissed as non-optimal based on previously proved propositions.

Currently, Definition 1 refers to Propositions 1–3, and will progressively include Propositions 4–6.

                              and that is not the EOQ ordering policy, is not optimal.
                           

We now explore the structure of the optimal ordering policy, building on the characterization discussed thus far. Recall that an ordering policy is characterized by all the orders made at all points of time for each scenario. Before continuing with our analysis we review what we already know about the optimal ordering policy. We note that the orders can be separated into three ranges:

                           
                              
                                 Orders before 
                                 ts
                                 
                                 : All orders made before ts
                                  are made when the inventory is zero (Proposition 1) and are of equal size (Proposition 2). Therefore, the entire ordering policy until ts
                                  can be described by Q
                                 0.


                                 Orders at 
                                 ts
                                 
                                 : If the special purchasing opportunity does not materialize (scenario N) and we have on-hand inventory, then we do not order (Proposition 1). If it does materialize, we order as specified in Proposition 3.


                                 Orders after 
                                 ts
                                 
                                 : It is optimal not to make any order until inventory runs out (Proposition 1) and use the EOQ policy thereafter (Corollary 3).

We thus see that the entire optimal ordering policy can now be described by two decision variables: Q
                        0 and Qs
                        . However, since Q
                        0 uniquely determines qs
                         (see Eq. (4)), and qs
                         uniquely determines Qs
                         
                        (Proposition 3), Q
                        0 alone can be used to describe the entire optimal ordering policy. Defining m to be the number of orders before ts
                        , we have:

                           
                              (3)
                              
                                 
                                    m
                                    =

                        To maximize our objective function (Eq. (2)), which includes the costs that are due to orders made before ts
                        , we quantify how the order size before ts
                         affects the costs. Consequently, we introduce a measure of the distance of an ordering quantity from the EOQ ordering quantity. This measure is used by Roundy (1985).

                           The distance of a zero and equal-ordering policy with order size Q from the EOQ policy is defined as the ratio of their long-run average costs excluding the purchasing costs, and is equal to:

However, if it does not materialize any change from the EOQ policy can only result in a loss (negative

This is because if one deviates from the EOQ policy in such a way that when the special purchasing opportunity materializes no order is placed, then no benefit is reaped from the special purchasing opportunity. This would not be a wise policy which is reflected in the value of the savings.

Let us now look at the solution set graphically. In Fig. 3, qs
                            is plotted as a function of Q
                           0; any point on the graph corresponds to an ordering policy. Horizontal lines represent: the critical inventory level (
                              
                                 q
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 c
                              
                           ), and the inventory level at ts
                            under the EOQ policy (
                              
                                 q
                                 
                                    s
                                 
                                 EOQ
                              
                           ). Vertical lines (except the one that passes through point C) represent values of Q
                           0, for which 
                              
                                 
                                    q
                                    s
                                 
                                 =
                                 0
                              
                           . Note that between two such vertical lines, the number of orders made before ts
                            is the same and equal to that of the policy associated with the vertical line to the left. Moreover, the vertical line that passes through point C is associated with the EOQ ordering policy 
                              
                                 π
                                 EOQ
                              
                           . As we increase the order size before ts
                            (i.e., move right on the Q
                           0 axis), the inventory at ts
                            increases, until a point is reached where the number of orders before ts
                            decreases by one, and the inventory at ts
                            drops to zero.


                           Proposition 5 can be interpreted graphically in Fig. 3 as follows: Given two points (i.e., two policies), if the second is higher than the first and geometrically further from the EOQ policy on the horizontal axis, then the first point is better.

                           0). Using this graphical representation it is easy to “graphically prove” Proposition 6. Point A dominates all points to its left. Point D dominates all points to its right and point C dominates all points that are located strictly between points C and D. The optimal solution thus lies between points A and C (inclusive), or at point D.


                           Proposition 4 shows that if

                            is lower than 
                              
                                 q

                            (as the case in Fig. 3), then all policies associated with points between points B and C (exclusive) cannot be optimal.

                            we can derive conditions that allow us to reduce the number of admissible solutions from the current four possible solutions. These conditions are simple to check, and so is the evaluation of the points. We discuss them briefly in Section 6.2.

We now present some insights about the dynamics of the problem that were obtained by performing a numerical study. We begin by describing the scope of the study, and then summarize our main findings.

We first devise and analyze a ‘base case’ instance (Table 2
                     ). We will then vary each model parameter separately in order to learn how they affect each admissible policy

                      presents the admissible solutions for the base case. We see that the optimal ordering policy is

                      is not feasible. We also see that the order-up-to level, if the special opportunity materializes, is 175 units, i.e., 75percent higher than the EOQ order quantity.

We will now vary each problem parameter over a wide range. The associated admissible policies for select parameters is found in Fig. 5. Note that policy

                              . Fig. 5a shows how the time of the special purchasing opportunity affects the performance of the admissible policies. As ts
                               increases, we observe that the optimal policy goes back-and-forth between policies

                              . This indicates that the optimal solution is sensitive to changes in ts
                              . On the other hand, the relative difference between the expected total savings of the two policies decreases as ts
                               grows, so it is not as critical to choose the best between the two. Also note that the expected total savings is bounded and that this bound is quickly approached as ts
                               grows. That is, the additional savings enabled by knowing that the event would take place far in the future is small.

                              . Another consequence of increasing ts
                               is that the number of orders before ts
                               increases. We see in Fig. 5a, that as ts
                               grows, policies

                               are the only candidates for optimality. This can be explained by the fact that as the number of cycles before ts

                               which reduces the penalty from deviating from the EOQ policy. Hence, these two policies, which maximally benefit from the special purchasing opportunity, are being minimally penalized for deviating from the EOQ policy.

                               can also be caused by other parameters, i.e., large demand, small fixed order cost, etc.

                              Sensitivity analysis. Finally, we note that the sensitivity analysis has a practical value for making decisions when parameters are difficult to estimate. For example, instead of expending excessive resources to estimate p, we can use sensitivity analysis to find a threshold value of p that would cause us to deviate from the EOQ policy. We can then use it to guide our efforts in estimating p.

We now discuss some simple extensions of our work.

In the model, we assumed that the inventory level at the beginning of the planning horizon is zero. If we relax this assumption, we can see that all the properties of the optimal solution (Section 4) hold; specifically, due to zero-ordering (Proposition 1), we find that if inventory runs out before time ts
                        , this case is equivalent to starting the planning horizon after the initial inventory runs out. Otherwise it is optimal to wait until ts
                         and then respond according to Propositions 1 and 3.

In Corollary 8, we see that the optimal policy is one of four possibilities. However, this number can be reduced even further.

                        . This fact is used in Corollary 7 and can be used to dismiss the policy with the larger value of

One of our assumptions is a fixed inventory holding cost rate. While we feel that this assumption is the most reasonable one, other related research assumes cost dependent inventory holding costs, that is, 
                           
                              h

                              c
                           
                         (where I is the interest rate). For example, Ardalan (1988) consider a special purchasing opportunity at the current time, i.e.,

                                 s

                        ). The difference between the two assumptions comes into play when calculating the holding cost of units purchased under the special purchasing opportunity.

Incorporating this lower holding cost in our work we find that Propositions 1, 2, and 5 still hold. For the other propositions, we get slightly different expressions, but the overall structure remains. For example, we obtain that the optimal order-up-to level at time ts

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this work, we investigate the impact of information about a probabilistic one-time unit-price discount on the optimal inventory replenishment policy. We quantify this information by calculating the savings due to adapting the inventory policy at the current moment.

We prove the following properties of the optimal solution. The replenishment policy at the time of the possible special purchasing opportunity, if it materializes, is an (s, S) policy. We calculate the values for both thresholds. In addition, some EOQ properties are preserved: (1) zero-ordering, except possibly when the special purchasing opportunity materializes, and (2) equal-ordering both before and after the possible special purchasing opportunity. After the time of the possible special purchasing opportunity, this replenishment quantity will be the standard EOQ replenishment quantity.

Based on these properties, we characterize the ordering policy as a function of the replenishment quantity at the beginning of the horizon. Combining these properties with the symmetry of the basic EOQ cost function, we are able to use dominance criteria to reduce the number of initial order quantities to four possible values, each with its own intuitive meaning. Closed-form expressions for these values and their corresponding expected total savings are presented. In addition to an algorithm to identify the optimal ordering policy, we present a numerical study that provides additional insights into the model dynamics. Finally, we discuss some simple extensions to the model.

While exploring the influence of the probabilistic special purchasing opportunity, we assume a momentary drop in price at a known-in-advance time in the future. Natural questions to ask are: What if there was more than one purchasing opportunity? What if the exact time of the discount is not known with certainty? Or, what if we are informed earlier about the materialization of the special opportunity? How would the optimal policy adapt to these changes?

                           Proof
                           We prove the proposition by contradiction. Let us assume that the proposition is incorrect. Therefore, there is an optimal policy π and at least one scenario (denoted as scenario x), in which an order is placed at the regular purchasing price at a moment of time (denoted by t) at which the inventory level is positive. We denote as q and Q the inventory level at time t before an order is placed and the order size at time t, respectively. We construct an alternative policy π′ and show that it is preferable.

Policy π′ is identical to policy π except that under scenario x, the order that is made at time t is postponed to time

                               the total costs are lower for policy π′, the cumulative costs for time beyond

                               are lower for policy π′.

For the proof to be complete we show that a feasible value of δ exists. Clearly, δ < q/D. Moreover, for the postponement not to interfere with the next order (at time denoted by t
                              2), we add the constraint:

                           Proof
                           We prove by contradiction. Let us assume that the statement is incorrect. Consequently, there is an optimal ordering policy π in which two consecutive orders of different size are made in [0, ts
                              ). Let us denote the two order sizes and timings as Q
                              1, Q
                              2, t
                              1, t
                              2. Note that the inventory level before the orders arrive at times t
                              1 and t
                              2 is zero (according to Proposition 1). There are two cases.


                              Case 1: Q
                              1 > Q
                              2
                           

We construct a policy π′ and show that it results in a higher expected total savings. Policy π′ is identical to policy π except that the order at time t
                              1 is of size

                               and the next order will be made at

Clearly, policy π′ has slightly lower holding costs than policy π, in particular,

                           Using Proposition 3, we know that an order is not made at ts
                               under scenario S, and therefore, the EOQ policy is strictly better.□
