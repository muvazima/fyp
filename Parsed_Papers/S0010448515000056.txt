                  Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes adopt a layering approach for building parts in continuous slices and use the Standard Tessellation Language (STL) file format as an input to generate the slices during part manufacturing. However, the current STL format uses planar triangular facets to approximate the surfaces of the parts. This approximation introduces errors in the part representation which leads to additional errors downstream in the parts produced by AM processes. Recently, another file format called Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) was introduced by ASTM which seeks to use curved triangles based on second degree Hermite curves. However, while generating the slices for manufacturing the part, the curved triangles are recursively sub-divided back to planar triangles which may lead to the same approximation error present in the STL file. This paper introduces a new file format which uses curved Steiner patches instead of planar triangles for not only approximating the part surfaces but also for generating the slices. Steiner patches are bounded Roman surfaces and can be parametrically represented by rational Bezier equations. Since Steiner surfaces are of higher order, this new Steiner file format will have a better accuracy than the traditional STL and AMF formats and will lead to lower Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) errors in parts manufactured by AM processes. Since the intersection of a plane and the Steiner patch is a closed form mathematical solution, the slicing of the Steiner format can be accomplished with very little computational complexity. The Steiner representation has been used to approximate the surfaces of two test parts and the chordal errors in the surfaces are calculated. The chordal errors in the Steiner format are compared with the STL and AMF formats of the test surfaces and the results have been presented. Further, an error based adaptive tessellation algorithm is developed for generating the Steiner representation which reduces the number of curved facets while still improving the accuracy of the Steiner format. The test parts are virtually manufactured using the adaptive Steiner, STL and AMF format representations and the GD&T errors of the manufactured parts are calculated and compared. The results demonstrate that the modified Steiner format is able to significantly reduce the chordal and profile errors as compared to the STL and AMF formats.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes have evolved from the Rapid Prototyping (RP) technique and manufacture parts by creating successive layers. The Stereolithography (STL) file is the standard format used by AM machines to generate the slices for manufacturing the part. The STL format uses planar triangles to approximate the part surfaces as shown in Fig. 1
                     . This piecewise planar approximation introduces errors in the part representation, particularly in highly curved surfaces  [1–6]. This approximation in turn leads to errors in parts manufactured by AM machines using the STL file representation  [7]. The approximation can be reduced by increasing the tessellation in the STL file and using smaller triangles. However, this exponentially increases the number of triangles in the file which results in large file sizes. Selective modification of the STL file based on the error threshold of different surfaces using a Vertex Translation Algorithm (VTA) has been proposed by Navangul et al.  [8]. Although this algorithm has proved to be successful in controlling the increase in the number of facets while minimizing the approximation error, the modified file still uses planar facets. Therefore, there is a limit to the improvement in the tessellation that can be achieved using this approach. Recently, a new Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) format has been proposed by ASTM  [9]. This AMF format uses second degree Hermite curves to represent curved triangles. However, during the reading of the AMF file by the AM machines for creating the slices, the curved triangles are recursively sub-divided back into planar triangles. This division of the curved triangles into planar facets reintroduces the planar approximation error in the manufactured part which may potentially increase the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T)  [10] errors in the parts manufactured using the AMF format.

Recently, a curved format for AM machines has been proposed by Santosh et al.  [11] which uses modified rectangular bi-quadratic Bezier surfaces for piecewise approximation the CAD surfaces. Although the Bezier format is able to minimize the errors significantly, the slicing of the Bezier patches for generating the contours cannot be performed analytically and therefore, numerical or optimization methods have to be used which leads to errors in the solution. This paper, therefore, presents a new curved file format for AM machines based on Steiner patches [12–15] for which slicing can be performed analytically to obtain a closed form solution. Steiner patches, named after the 19th century mathematician Jakob Steiner who first formalized them in 1844, are bounded Steiner or Roman surfaces [12,13,16] which are degree four surfaces in Cartesian space with a triple point. They were investigated by Sederberg and Anderson  [12,13] and Breen  [14] as potential candidates for approximate piecewise rendering of freeform surfaces with smooth tangent continuity. The intersection of a Steiner patch with a plane results in a quadratic curve in the parametric space  [12]. This property of the Steiner surface makes it attractive for the AM domain since numerically stable slicing algorithms can be developed for the Steiner format. The paper adopts the methods presented by Sederberg and Anderson  [12,13,17] and Breen  [14] and extends them to develop a new Steiner file format for AM machines. This new format is compared with the existing STL and AMF formats for some test surfaces and the approximation errors in all the formats are calculated. The approximation or tessellation accuracy is characterized as chordal error  [1–4] and is calculated as the normal distance between the tessellated facets and the actual CAD surface, as shown in Fig. 2
                     . Mathematically, chordal error can be defined as:

                      is a point on the tessellated surface which can be either the STL, AMF or Steiner representation and

                      is the corresponding point on the CAD surface. The chordal errors for the different file formats are compared and the results obtained in this paper demonstrate that the average chordal error in Steiner patch representation is significantly lower than those of the STL and AMF file representations.

One drawback of using a higher degree surface patch is that the file size increases significantly compared to a first degree planar surface. Therefore, an error based non-uniform tessellation algorithm has also been developed for generating an adaptive Steiner patch format in order to minimize the number of facets and the file size of the representation. This algorithm calculates the errors at different areas on the surface and adapts the number of facets for the different regions such that the areas with larger errors will have more number of facets while regions with smaller errors will have less number of facets. A comparative study of the number of facets between the uniform and adaptive Steiner file formats has also been performed for two test surfaces. The results of this analysis show that the adaptive Steiner file is able to achieve the same level of accuracy as that of uniform Steiner format while using fewer patches which would lead to reduction in the file size.

A slicing algorithm has been developed for the Steiner file which is used for creating the slice contours at different heights. The slice contours are then used for virtually manufacturing AM parts with different slice thicknesses and part orientation  [18,19]. The simulated surfaces of the virtually manufactured AM parts are inspected and the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) errors of the surface  [10] are calculated. The GD&T errors studied in this paper are cylindricity  [10] and profile errors  [10] which are the most widely used GD&T errors specified on curved surfaces and parts. The GD&T errors of the test surfaces generated from the modified Steiner representation are compared with those of the surfaces manufactured from the STL and AMF formats and the results are presented. The results illustrate that the modified Steiner format is able to significantly reduce the GD&T errors while still utilizing fewer number of facets.

The rest of the paper is divided into six sections. The next section, Section  2 presents a brief overview of the research in the areas of STL file format and alternative formats for AM processes. Section  3 presents the methodology for developing the Steiner patch format from the CAD surface of a part. Section  4 compares the chordal errors in the uniform and adaptive Steiner formats to those in the STL and AMF formats while Section  5 presents a slicing algorithm and a virtual manufacturing model for the Steiner format. Section  6 calculates and presents the GD&T errors for the different test surfaces using Steiner, STL and AMF formats. Finally, Section  7 presents the conclusions and future scope of the current research.

@&#LITERATURE REVIEW@&#

The modification of the STL file and development of alternate file formats for AM machines in order to minimize part errors are relatively unexplored areas with only a few papers having being published in these fields. Fadel and Kirschman  [20] studied the issues with STL file accuracy, investigated the source of errors in the STL format and developed methods to minimize these errors. Another paper by van Niekerk and Ehlers  [21] divided the STL errors into two groups: structural and geometric errors, and presented a prototype software which corrects these errors. Stroud and Xirouchakis  [22] presented an extended STL format which was able to create smaller part models by eliminating internal edges and facets and allows faster creation of slices for part manufacturing. Leong et al.  [23] identified and listed the errors most commonly associated with the STL file representation and developed algorithms and techniques to eliminate or minimize these errors. Lee et al.  [24] presented a concept where several STL files were generated from a base file using non-uniform deformations. Several researchers have also proposed the use of the native CAD model of the parts in AM machines  [1,4,6,25] which would eliminate the errors introduced in AM parts due to the use of the STL format. However, the slicing of the CAD files is a computationally expensive process and therefore, the use of native part file in AM machines has not been accepted yet by the AM industry.

Navangul  [7] and Navangul et al.  [8] developed a new Vertex Translation Algorithm (VTA) for selectively modifying the STL facets based on the chordal errors present in the STL file. The modified STL file was able to minimize the chordal errors while utilizing less number of facets. The VTA modified STL file was also able to achieve less GD&T errors for virtually manufactured parts as compared to the unmodified STL file. Recently, Santosh et al.  [11] presented a curved format which uses bi-quadratic Bezier surfaces with linear and curved edges for piecewise approximating the CAD surfaces of parts. ASTM has also released a new standard file format for AM machines called Additive Manufacturing File Format  [9] which is slated to replace the existing STL file format currently used in the industry. The new AMF format has many new features when compared to the STL format such as the ability to use curved triangles, storage of non-geometric information such as color and texture and support for material information, constellations and lattices. The AMF format uses second degree Hermite curves to store information about curved triangles and recursively subdivides the curved triangles into planar triangles for generating the slices. Since planar triangles are still used in the AMF format for manufacturing the part, there is a possibility that the approximation error present in STL format is introduced in the manufactured part.

@&#METHODOLOGY@&#

This section presents the methodology to convert a CAD file of a part to a tessellated Steiner representation. However, before the methodology is explained in detail, a brief introduction to Steiner surface is provided in the following section.

The Steiner surface or Roman surface [12,13,16,17,26] is a degree four self intersecting surface in 
                           x
                           ,

                         coordinates and a Steiner surface is shown in Fig. 3
                        . The surface intersects itself at a point defined as the triple point and the equation of a Steiner surface with its triple point at the origin is given as:

The Steiner patch is defined as a bounded triangular patch on the Steiner surface  [15,27] and was introduced by Sederberg and Anderson  [12,13], Sederberg  [17] and Breen  [14] as a method of piecewise rendering of a freeform surface. There are many different ways of representing a Steiner patch but the most useful representation for the purpose of this study is the one introduced by Sederberg and Anderson  [13]. A Steiner patch can be represented in

The inclusion of the rational coefficients in the equation allows the Steiner patch to accurately represent not only freeform surfaces but also conics such as cylinders, spheres, cones, etc. by suitably varying the weights. This equation can also be used to represent planar features by changing the weights to infinity. The control points

                         lie on the surface while the interior control points do not. However, each corner control point and its two neighboring interior points define the tangent plane to the surface at the corner point  [12–14,17]. This property is useful in the tessellation of the CAD part surface into piecewise Steiner patches which is explained in the following section. Expanding Eq. (3) and writing the equation in power basis representation, the individual coordinates of a point on the surface can be written as  [13,14]:

                        . The Steiner patch representation provided in Eq. (4) will be used to convert the surface information from the CAD model of a part to its equivalent Steiner approximation. The following section describes the methodology for developing a Steiner patch based AM file format.

In traditional CAD software packages, part surfaces are represented and stored in the form of Non-uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS). A NURBS surface of order

First, the part is modeled in any CAD software and then exported to the IGES format. IGES is a CAD neutral file format and is widely used in the industry. The IGES format has been used in this research since the NURBS data of a surface can be easily extracted from the IGES representation. In addition, use of IGES ensures that the algorithm developed in this paper can be used for parts modeled in any CAD platform.

The NURBS surface data is extracted from the IGES representation and the

                         parameter space are the corner control points of the polygon net for the Steiner patch. Mathematically, if

The remaining three interior control points are calculated using the methodology described by Breen  [14] and is explained below. One of the properties of the Steiner surface is that the plane defined by each corner control point and its two neighboring interior points is tangent to the surface at the corner point  [12–14,17]. In other words, each interior control point lies on two tangent planes. To calculate one interior point, let us say

                        , the tangent planes are first calculated at its two neighboring corner points,

                                 P

                         and the line of intersection between these two planes is calculated. The interior control point can lie anywhere on this line of intersection as shown in Fig. 6. However, to calculate the exact location of the control point, a third plane is required. This third plane is calculated from the two corner points and the point in the Euclidean space corresponding to the midpoint

                        . Once the control points are calculated, the next step is to calculate the weights of the control points. For a degenerate case when the two tangent planes at the corner points are parallel, then the interior control point is calculated as the midpoint of the two corner points.

The weights corresponding to the corner points are arbitrarily assigned 1 i.e.

                         can also be calculated from Eqs. (8) and (9). After the weights are calculated, the Steiner patch can be defined fully and the entire NURBS surface can be piecewise approximated by Steiner patches. The comparison of the approximation errors between the Steiner representation and the STL format is studied with the help of two test surfaces and the results are provided in Section  5. The next subsection presents a modified version of the Steiner representation using adaptive or non-uniform tessellations.

The Steiner patch requires six control points and six weights to be fully defined while to approximate the same surface patch, the STL format needs only the information of the three vertices and the normal to the triangle. Therefore, the Steiner patch format requires more information to represent a surface which increases the file size and leads to higher computational time and costs. In order to minimize the increase in the file size of the Steiner format, an error based adaptive tessellation algorithm has been developed for generating the Steiner format. In this modified Steiner format, only those sections of the NURBS surface which have higher curvatures or higher accuracy requirements will be divided into a finer mesh and those sections with lower curvatures or lower accuracy threshold will be divided into a coarser mesh, as shown schematically in Fig. 9.

First, the

                         space of the CAD surface is coarsely divided into triangular regions as shown in Fig. 5
                         and 
                        
                        
                         the uniform Steiner patch representation is calculated using the methodology described in the previous section. After that, the surface curvatures are calculated at multiple points within the different NURBS patches. For any curved surface, the curvature can be defined through different metrics such as Gaussian, mean, principal and normal curvatures  [30] but in this paper only mean curvature is used. Once the mean curvatures at multiple points within a NURBS patch are calculated, the maximum mean curvature 
                           
                              (

                              )
                           
                         within the NURBS patch is found out. Based on this maximum mean curvature, the NURBS patches are then grouped into two sets: high curvature(HC) and low curvature (LC) patches. A planar surface has a mean curvature of 0 i.e.

                           0
                        . Therefore, any NURBS patch with a

                         very close to zero is classified as a LC patch and the rest of the patches are classified as HC patches, as shown in Table 2. Mathematically, a NURBS patch is a LC surface if:

                         is an arbitrary small value and can be changed by the user according to the requirements. This HC/LC classification is performed to prevent unnecessary computations while developing the non-uniform mesh. The

For those triangles corresponding to HC patches, the chordal errors with respect to their corresponding Steiner patches are calculated using the formulation provided in Eq. (1). For calculating the chordal error between a NURBS patch and its corresponding Steiner patch, Eq. (1) is formulated as an optimization model with

This section compares the approximation errors in the uniform and adaptive Steiner format with the STL and AMF formats. Two test surfaces, as shown in Fig. 12
                     , are modeled in NX 8 3D CAD system  [33] and then exported as IGES and STL formats. The AMF files of the test parts are developed using the methodology described in  [9]. The chordal errors are calculated at multiple points on the tessellated surfaces (Steiner, STL or AMF) and the root mean square of the chordal errors is calculated by the following equation:

                        i
                     th point given by Eq. (1). This root mean square chordal error is used as the metric for comparing the different formats as explained in the following sections.

The STL file and Steiner formats for the two test surfaces are shown in Figs. 13 and 14
                        
                        . For Test Surface 1 in Fig. 13, both the formats have 72 facets while for Test Surface 2 in Fig. 14, the formats utilize 50 facets. It can be observed from the figures that in both the test cases, the Steiner format is able to represent the CAD surface better than the STL file while using the same number of cases. The chordal error of the Steiner format is also considerably less than the STL file as shown in Tables 1 and 2
                        
                        . These tables demonstrate that the Steiner format is able to reduce the chordal errors of Test Surface 1 and Test Surface 2 by an average of 90.62% and 70.69 % respectively when compared to the STL format. Also, for achieving the same chordal error as that of the Steiner format which uses 32 facets, the STL format has to use 98 facets for Test Surface 1 and 338 facets for Test Surface 2.

Each triangle in an STL representation needs 3 vertices and 1 normal to be fully represented i.e. it needs 12 floating point numbers (3 coordinates for each vertex and 3 direction cosines for the normal). Even though the normal can be calculated from the vertex information, the current STL format still carries that information, mainly to differentiate the interior of the part from the outside. Therefore, the total floating point numbers required to represent the STL file of a part is given as:

                           P

                        is the number of triangles in the STL file.

On the other hand, each Steiner facet needs 6 corner points and 3 weights to be fully represented. It needs only 3 weights for the interior control points since the weights for the 3 corner points are always assumed to be 1. Therefore, each Steiner patch needs 21 floating point numbers (3 coordinates for each vertex and 3 weights) and the total floating point numbers required for an Steiner representation would be:

                         is the number of patches in the Steiner file.

For Test Surface 1, in order to achieve a chordal error of 0.019819 mm, the Steiner format would need 32 facets i.e. 21×32=672 floating point numbers while for a chordal error of 0.020924 mm, the STL facet needs 98 facets i.e. 12×98=1176 floating point numbers. Therefore, the STL file would need 75% more floating point numbers to represent the same information. Similarly, for Test Surface 2, the STL format would need 503% more floating point numbers as compared to the Steiner format for comparable chordal error. Therefore, the total number of total STL facets needed to represent a CAD surface with the same level of accuracy as a Steiner is exponentially higher than the total number of Steiner facets. As such, the total file size of a STL facet will also be higher than that of a Steiner format with comparable errors. These results are summarized in Table 3
                        .

In addition to the above examples, two real-life examples have also been tested in this paper: a turbine blade, shown in Fig. 15
                        , and a helical gear, shown in Fig. 16
                        . Fig. 15(b) shows the non-planar surfaces of the turbine blade that have been converted into the Steiner representation while Fig. 16(a) and (b) show the isometric and front view of the helical gear. Fig. 16(c) shows the non-planar surfaces of the helical gear which have been used for comparing the Steiner representation with the STL format. The Steiner representations and the comparative STL formats of the turbine blade are shown in Fig. 17
                         and those of the helical gear are shown in Fig. 18
                        . From these figures, it can be observed that the Steiner representation is able to better represent the curved surface than the STL format using the same number of facets. The chordal errors are calculated for both the formats and the comparisons for the turbine blade and gear examples are tabulated in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                         respectively. From these tables, it can be observed that the Steiner representation has, on an average, 78.5% improvement over the STL format for the turbine blade part and a 77.82 % improvement in the case of the helical gear.

The two test surfaces shown in Fig. 12 are also converted to an AMF format and the chordal errors are compared with their Steiner formats. Fig. 19
                         shows the AMF surfaces for the test surfaces. Although the AMF format uses curved Hermite edges to represent the CAD surface, during the reading of the file by the AM machine, the curved triangles are subdivided into planar triangles. Therefore, in Fig. 19 the AMF format is represented by planar triangles in order to simulate the actual surface that will be used by the AM machine. Table 6
                         shows the comparison between the Steiner, STL and AMF formats for Test Surface 1 and Table 7
                         shows the comparison for Test Surface 2.

In AMF format, each facet approximating a curved surface, needs 3 vertex normals at the three vertices in addition to the 3 vertices and 1 triangle normal information, already provided in the STL format i.e. the AMF facet needs 21 floating point numbers. If

                                 M
                                 F
                              
                           
                         is the total number of facets in an AMF part file, then the total floating point numbers required for the file would be: 
                           F
                           P
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 A
                                 M
                                 F
                              
                           
                           =
                           21
                           ×
                           
                              
                                 N
                              
                              
                                 A
                                 M
                                 F
                              
                           
                        . Using these calculations, for Test Surface 1, the AMF format would need 525% more floating point numbers and for Test Surface 2, it would need 1125% more numbers as compared to the Steiner format for comparable chordal error. This is summarized in Table 8
                        .

From Tables 6 and 7, it can be observed that compared to the AMF format, the Steiner format consistently tessellates the CAD surface with minimal errors while using fewer facets. However, one interesting thing that is observed from the tables is that the AMF format actually needs more facets to achieve the same accuracy as that of the STL format. This may be due to the fact that while the STL format approximates the actual CAD surface, in the case of the AMF format, during subdivision the planar triangles are created from only a Hermite approximation of the CAD surface. It is also possible that during the recursive subdivision of the facets in the AMF format, even those triangles which have very small chordal errors and do not contribute to the overall error are divided into four planar triangles, thereby contributing to the total number of facets. However, this is only an initial comparison and further tests and validations need to be performed before any concrete conclusions can be drawn.

The chordal error comparison between uniform and adaptive Steiner formats is performed for two surfaces, Test Surface 1 as shown in Fig. 12(a) and another surface shown in Fig. 20
                        . Both these surfaces have distinct regions which have high and low curvatures. For generating the adaptive slices, a maximum chordal error threshold of 0.025 mm is used. A high curvature patch is only sub-divided if the maximum chordal error within that patch is less than the chordal error threshold. The uniform and adaptive Steiner files for Test Surface 3 are shown in Fig. 21
                         whereas the adaptive Steiner file for Test Surface 1 is shown in Fig. 22
                        . From the figures, it can be observed that the high curvature areas have a finer mesh whereas the low curvature areas have a coarser mesh. The comparison in the chordal errors between the two Steiner formats for the two surfaces is provided in Tables 9 and 10
                        
                        . These results clearly demonstrate that the adaptive Steiner formats is able to achieve the same level of approximation error as that of the uniform format while using fewer number of facets.

One of the advantages of STL file format is that the methodology for slicing the STL triangles to generate the slice contours is very simple. For any format utilizing any higher order curved surfaces the slicing algorithm becomes more complicated. For example, in the Bezier format developed by Santosh et al.  [11], the slicing of a Bezier patch with a plane cannot be solved analytically and requires numerical or optimization methods which can lead to round-off errors. However, compared to Bezier patches, Steiner patches are easier to slice and their intersection with planes can be calculated using analytical methods to provide closed form solutions. Once the intersection of the Steiner patches with the slicing planes are calculated, the complete slice contours can be generated for virtually manufacturing the parts.

In AM machines, the slicing plane is always parallel to the 
                        x
                        –
                        y
                      plane i.e.  
                        z
                        =

                              p
                           
                        
                     , where 
                        
                           
                              k
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                      is the height of the plane. If only the 
                        z
                     -coordinate is considered from Eq. (4) and equated with the slicing plane equation, then mathematically it can be written:

After the intersection curves for all Steiner patches are calculated, they are discretized to obtain points on the boundary of the slice contours. These discrete points are then extruded in the positive 
                        z
                     -direction by the slice thickness,

                     , to obtain additional points on the surface to simulate the staircase effect, similar to the virtual manufacturing method described by Paul and Anand  [19]. This process is repeated for all facets and slicing planes to simulate the manufacturing of the part in an AM process. Once the parts are manufactured, points are randomly sampled from the simulated surfaces and the GD&T errors are calculated. The next sub-sections compare the GD&T errors in the Steiner format with those in the STL and AMF formats.

Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) errors are specified on part designs to convey the nominal dimensions of the part features and their allowable tolerances  [10]. GD&T tolerances are used to determine whether the features and surfaces of the manufactured part are within the acceptable part quality. This section compares the reduction in GD&T errors in parts manufactured using the Steiner format with respect to errors in parts generated using the STL format. Two types of GD&T errors have been considered in this paper: profile error of a surface and cylindricity error. Flatness error has not been considered since any curved file format including AMF, Bezier or Steiner will not have an effect on the planar face of a part. Profile error of a manufactured surface is a Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) error defined by ANSI  [10] as a “uniform boundary along the true profile within which the elements of the profile must lie”. In other words, the profile error of a manufactured surface is defined as a tolerance zone between two surfaces offset in either direction from the nominal surface within which the discrete measured points of the manufactured surface must lie. Mathematically, the profile error of a surface can be written as:

Cylindricity error is defined for cylindrical features and measures their form error. Cylindricity error is defined as the minimum radial separation between two coaxial cylinders which contain all the sampled points lying on the surface of the manufactured cylinder  [10,36] as shown in Fig. 25
                     . Mathematically, the cylindricity error can be written as:

The profile error is calculated for a test part which has a freeform surface, as shown in Fig. 26
                     (a). Since the STL format is currently the industry standard and the AMF format has yet to be accepted by AM machine manufacturers, the profile error for the Steiner format is compared only with the STL format. Furthermore, since the non-uniform Steiner format is able to achieve the same levels of chordal error as compared to the uniform Steiner format while using fewer patches, only the non-uniform Steiner format is used for comparing the profile errors. The curved freeform surface of the part shown in Fig. 23(a) is initially considered for profile error comparison. The Steiner and STL formats for the freeform surface are shown in Fig. 26(b) and (c) respectively and they both use 98 facets. For virtually manufacturing the test surfaces, the slice thicknesses: 0.01 mm, 0.025 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.075 mm and 0.1 mm are used. The profile errors calculated for the freeform surfaces using the Steiner and STL files are shown in Table 12
                     . From the table, it can be observed the Steiner format is able to achieve 71%–86% lower profile errors across all slice thicknesses when compared to STL file with the same number of facets.

The profile errors are also calculated for two surfaces of both the turbine blade and the helical gear. Fig. 27
                     (b) and (c) show Turbine Surface 1 and Turbine Surface 2 while Fig. 28
                     (b) and (c) show Gear Surface 1 and Gear Surface 2 for which the profile errors have been calculated for both their Steiner and STL representations. The profile error results for the turbine blade surfaces are shown in Tables 13 and 14
                     
                      while those for the gear surfaces are shown in Tables 15 and 16
                     
                     . These tables show that the Steiner format leads to a reduction in the profile error of the surfaces across all slice thicknesses when compared to the STL format. The percent reduction of profile error is small at higher slice thicknesses for the turbine and helical gear surfaces. However, in most practical metal AM applications, the slice thicknesses used are in the range of 0.01–0.05 mm for which we see substantial reduction in profile errors and therefore, the Steiner format is able to improve the surface representation in manufactured parts as compared to the STL format.

The cylindricity error is calculated for a cylinder with radius 5 mm and height 5 mm. The cylinder is converted to the Steiner and STL formats with each of the formats using 100 facets. The cylinder axis is rotated by 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degrees about the 
                        x
                     -axis and the cylindricity error is calculated for the different orientations. Two slice thicknesses: 0.1 and 0.05 mm are used for the cylindricity error calculations at different orientations and the results are shown in Tables 17 and 18
                     
                     . The trend of cylindricity error with respect to orientation for the different slice thicknesses is also shown in Fig. 29
                     . From the tables it can be observed that the cylindricity errors in a cylinder manufactured using the Steiner format is on average 49%–60% lower than a cylinder manufactured using the STL format. For comparison, the cylindricity error manufactured from the CAD file of a cylinder  [19] is also shown in Fig. 29. From the figure, it can be seen that the errors in a Steiner format increases with part orientation, similar to the trend observed to the errors calculated from the STL and CAD file. The figure shows that the cylindricity error in the Steiner part is closer to the error in the CAD part as compared to the STL part error. This is expected since the Steiner format represents the CAD surface much more accurately than the STL file. If the file size is not a constraint, then by increasing the number of facets in the part, the error in a Steiner part can be made almost equal to the error in a CAD part.

A new AM file format using Steiner patches was developed and presented in this paper. A Steiner patch is a bounded area on a Roman or Steiner surface and can be represented with triangular rational Bezier parameters. The Steiner format is very effective in tessellating curved surfaces and improves the accuracy of the tessellated file. Two test surfaces were approximated by Steiner patches and the chordal errors of the Steiner format were compared with that of the corresponding STL files. Compared to the STL format, the Steiner format was able to reduce the chordal error by an average of 70%–90% while using the same number of facets. Similarly, the Steiner format was developed for two real life examples, a turbine blade and a helical gear and the Steiner format reduced the overall chordal errors of these parts by 75%–77%. The Steiner format was also compared with the AMF format and compared to the AMF format, the Steiner file was able to achieve the same level of accuracy by using less number of facets. An adaptive Steiner format was also developed which uses different mesh sizes based on the curvature of the CAD surface and a user defined error threshold. The adaptive Steiner considerably reduces the approximation error compared to the uniform Steiner and STL formats while still using considerably less number of facets. A slicing algorithm was developed for a Steiner format which calculates the curve of intersection between the Steiner patches and the slicing planes. The curves of intersection were estimated using analytical closed form methods instead of numerical or optimization techniques which leads to a more accurate solution. The slicing algorithm was used for virtually manufacturing AM parts using the Steiner format and GD&T errors were calculated for the virtually manufactured parts. The profile error of a freeform surface and cylindricity error of a cylinder manufactured using the Steiner patch were calculated and compared with the errors of the parts manufactured using the standard STL files. The comparative study showed that the Steiner format was able to reduce the profile errors by almost 70%–85% and the cylindricity errors by 49%–60%. Therefore, the Steiner format has the potential to replace the existing planar approximation formats which are currently used in AM machines and be accepted as an industry standard.

This paper is a first attempt in developing a new file format for AM machines using curved surfaces. However, further studies have to be conducted and several modifications have to be made to this format. The process of developing Steiner representation also needs to be extended for trimmed surfaces, solid parts and parts with holes. The Steiner formulation also has to be converted to a machine readable format in order for it to be accepted by existing AM machines. This paper calculates the chordal, profile and cylindricity errors of parts manufactured using the Steiner file format. The error calculations have to be expanded to analyze the effect of the Steiner approximation in reducing other GD&T errors such as runout and orientation errors on surfaces and features in AM parts. Another area where future research should be performed is to compare the file size and computational processing times between the new Steiner format and the AMF and STL formats and to optimize the Steiner format in order to reduce both time and file size.
