                        f
                      is a rational function and not a polynomial. The simplest method to calculate the coefficients of g is the least squares minimisation of an over-determined system of linear equations in which the coefficient matrix is Tœplitz, but the solution is a polynomial approximation of a rational function. It is shown in this paper that an improved result for g is obtained when the Tœplitz structure of the coefficient matrix is preserved, that is, a structure-preserving matrix method is used. In particular, this method guarantees that a polynomial solution to the deconvolution 
                        h
                        /
                        f
                      is obtained, and thus an essential property of the theoretically exact solution is retained in the computed solution. Computational examples that show the improvement in the solution obtained from the structure-preserving matrix method with respect to the least squares solution are presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Bernstein polynomial basis is used in computer aided geometric design because of its elegant geometric properties and superior numerical properties with respect to those of the power basis (Farouki and Goodman, 1996). Algorithms for the addition, multiplication, division and subdivision of Bernstein basis polynomials have been developed (Farouki and Rajan, 1988; Goldman, 2002), and this paper considers the deconvolution of two Bernstein basis polynomials h and f, that is, the computation of 
                        g
                        =
                        h
                        /
                        f
                     . If

                      and

                      are the exact forms of h and f respectively,

                     , and all computations are performed symbolically, then 
                        
                           
                              g
                           
                           
                              ˆ
                           
                        
                        =

                      is a polynomial. In practical problems, however, the polynomials h and f are inexact, in which case 
                        g
                        =
                        h
                        /
                        f
                      is a rational function and not a polynomial. It is shown in this paper that in this circumstance, a polynomial is returned when a structure-preserving matrix method is used to compute g. This solution must be compared with the simplest solution, that is, the least squares (LS) solution of an over-determined set of linear equations, in which case a polynomial approximation of a rational function is returned.

The approximation of a rational function by a polynomial may be adequate in some applications, but other applications may require that the algorithm for polynomial deconvolution return a polynomial, and not an approximation of a polynomial. The requirement that a polynomial be returned arises in the computation of multiple roots of a polynomial because the algorithm includes a series of deconvolutions in which the denominator polynomial is an exact divisor of the numerator polynomial (Uspensky, 1948). The discussion above shows that if the polynomials are subject to error and/or the computations are performed in finite precision arithmetic, it cannot be guaranteed that the result of each deconvolution is a polynomial. In this circumstance, the algorithm returns incorrect results or fails, and it is shown in this paper that a structure-preserving matrix method returns polynomial solutions to these deconvolutions, which is, as noted above, essential for the computation of multiple roots of a polynomial.

The deconvolution of two Bernstein basis polynomials is considered in Section 2. It is shown that the problem can be cast as the computation of the vector

The application of a structure-preserving matrix method to the deconvolution of two Bernstein basis polynomials is considered in Section 4. This method requires the iterative solution of a non-linear equation, and the condition for its convergence is discussed in Section 5. Section 6 contains two examples that compare the solutions obtained from the method of LS with the solutions obtained from a structure-preserving matrix method. The solutions are discussed in Section 7, and Section 8 contains a summary of the paper.

This section considers the deconvolution of two Bernstein polynomials and it is shown it can be considered in the matrix form (1).

                      denotes the condition number of X. It therefore follows that (7) is more stable than (6), and thus improved solutions are expected from (7).

The magnitudes of the entries in the coefficient matrix and right hand side vector of (7) may differ by several orders of magnitude, and it is therefore advantageous to normalise them. This issue is discussed in Winkler et al. (2012), Winkler and Yang (2013a), and it is shown that the normalisation of the entries in the coefficient matrix, and the normalisation of the entries in the right hand side vector, by their geometric means yield significantly improved results. The geometric mean of the terms that contain the coefficients of

                      and Q implies that the coefficient matrix in (12) is not Tœplitz, but it is still structured. It is appropriate to consider, therefore, a structure-preserving matrix method for the solution of (12), and this issue is addressed in the next section.

This section considers the application of a structure-preserving matrix method to the solution of (12), and the difference between the solution obtained using this method, and the solution obtained by solving a LS problem, is described.

If exact polynomials are considered and all computations are performed in infinite precision arithmetic, the coefficients of

                      It follows from (21) that a structure-preserving matrix method perturbs the given inexact polynomials the minimum amount, such that the perturbed polynomials satisfy the exact divisor condition. This is desirable because the computed solution satisfies a property of the theoretical solution, which is different from the LS solution, which does not satisfy this condition.

This section considers the application of the method of structured total least norm (STLN) (Ben Rosen et al., 1996) to the deconvolution 
                        h
                        /
                        f
                     , such that the result is a polynomial and not a rational function. This method is therefore used to obtain the solution of (21).

                      shows the application of the method of STLN to the deconvolution of two Bernstein polynomials.

Optimality conditions for the method of STLN, its formulation for the 1- and ∞-norms, and its relation to the Newton–Raphson iteration, are considered in Ben Rosen et al. (1996). The method can be extended to non-linear structures in the coefficient matrix and/or right hand side vector, which yields the method of structured non-linear total least norm (Ben Rosen et al., 1998). This method has been used for the computation of a structured low rank approximation of the Sylvester resultant matrix (Winkler and Hasan, 2013).

This section considers the convergence of Algorithm 1 for the iterative solution of the LSE problem, which is defined in (21). It follows from steps (3c)–(3f) of this algorithm, and (32), that the jth iteration of this LSE problem yields

                      and thus the convergence of (33) is dependent on the matrices and vectors at each iteration, and its a priori determination is therefore difficult. Computational experiments showed, however, that convergence is achieved in fewer than 5 iterations, even for high degree polynomials that are corrupted by noise and have multiple roots.

This section contains two examples that illustrate the application of the method of STLN to the computation of 
                        g

                        f
                     , and the solution of each example is compared with the LS solution of (16). Also, it was stated in Section 2 that it is numerically advantageous to include the diagonal matrix Q of combinatorial factors in the coefficient matrix, and this is confirmed numerically by including the solutions obtained when (16) is written as

The results are shown in Table 2
                            and they are similar to the results in Table 1 because better results are obtained when Q is included in the coefficient matrix.

                            and thus the condition number of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation in the LSE problem (33) is about one order of magnitude smaller than the condition number of the coefficient matrix of (16). Also, only one iteration is required for the solution of the LSE problem when Q is included in the coefficient matrix, but 54 iterations are required when Q is included in the solution vector.  □

                     Tables 1 and 2 show that 
                        κ
                        (
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              (
                              j
                              )
                           
                        
                        )
                     , the condition number of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation in the LSE problem, is significantly smaller when Q is included in the coefficient matrix than when it is included in the solution vector. This result, which confirms the remarks in Section 2, shows that large combinatorial factors in matrices associated with computations on Bernstein basis polynomials must be considered carefully, such that adverse numerical effects are minimised. Also, fewer iterations are required for the iterative solution of the LSE problem when Q is included in the coefficient matrix. The discussion in this section is therefore restricted to this situation, and the results obtained when Q is included in the solution vector are not considered.


                     Tables 1 and 2 show that the errors 
                        
                           
                              r

                      and 
                        
                           
                              r

                     , which are defined in (35) and (36) respectively, are equal for Example 6.1, and for Example 6.2. It therefore follows that the relative errors in the solutions of the LS and LSE problems are the same, but the advantage of the solution of the LSE problem can be seen from the error 
                        
                           
                              r

                      in the tables. Since it is approximately equal to 
                        
                           
                              10

                      for both examples, it follows that the solution of the LSE problem defines a polynomial, and not a polynomial approximation of a rational function.

A computed solution is acceptable if its backward error is less than or equal to the error in the given data, and it must therefore be checked that the solutions satisfy this condition. This calculation requires the data in Table 3
                     , which shows the norms of the vectors of the coefficients of

This paper has considered the method of STLN for the deconvolution of two Bernstein basis polynomials. This method preserves the Tœplitz structure of the coefficient matrix of the equation that defines the deconvolution of two polynomials, and it therefore returns a polynomial. This solution was compared with the solution of a LS problem, and it was shown that this solution defines a polynomial approximation of a rational function, and not a polynomial. It was shown that the method of STLN yields the LSE problem that is solved iteratively by the QR decomposition.

Improved answers were obtained when the coefficient matrix of the equation that defines the deconvolution operation includes the diagonal matrix Q of combinatorial factors. This improvement manifests itself in the requirement for fewer iterations for the solution of the LSE problem, and a smaller condition number of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation in the LSE problem.
