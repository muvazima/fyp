Carbonation is the process of dissolving CO2 in water to form carbonated water for soda drinks. This process involves simultaneous injection of CO2 and water through separate nozzles into a continuously operated carbonating tank. The effectiveness of this process depends on the improved CO2 dissolution in water with the minimum production of gas bubbles. The flow mixing of CO2 gas and water in the carbonating tank represents a gas–liquid bubbly flow problem. Gas bubbles accumulate in the carbonating tank under buoyancy force and generate a circulatory liquid motion. The improved flow circulation enhances the gas concentration level in the fluid, which in turn increases the carbonation process by dissolving a large amount of gas in the tank [1–3]. The carbonation process is effective when CO2 is highly soluble in water. Therefore, the mass transfer of CO2 in water must be estimated to enhance the carbonation process and to optimize the design of carbonating tanks. The mass transfer coefficient is a key parameter in analyzing the two-phase flow in industrial reactors because it helps estimate the gas transfer rate across the gas–liquid interface [4].

Several researchers have investigated the effects of various geometric parameters on the gas dissolution process in a two-phase flow. Gas holdup mainly depends on the inlet gas velocity, the physical properties of liquid, and the gas sparger type. The gas volume fraction, the interfacial area, and the mass transfer coefficient increase with high gas inlet velocities [5,6]. Apart from the mass transfer coefficient, the gas bubble size is also an important parameter in exploring two-phase flows because it directly affects the gas volume fraction and the interfacial area [5]. Deckwer et al. [7] measured the mass transfer coefficient in a two-phase flow column with different spargers and reported that such coefficient strongly depends on the type of sparger used for injection. Chisti and Jauregui-Haza [6] asserted that the mass transfer rate decreases when the gas and liquid are mixed by mechanical agitation. However, these experimental studies failed to include the effects of the hydrodynamic properties of the gas dissolved in liquid because of the complexity involved in these two-phase flows [8]. Large-scale experimental multiphase flow systems require a considerable amount of construction time and cost. Recent advances in analytical methods allow researchers to solve any nonlinear differential equations and their systems. The differential transform method (DTM) is a newly developed iterative analytical method for solving systems by using a linear or nonlinear differential equation to reduce the computational work [9–11]. Similarly, Adomian decomposition method (ADM) is used to resolve linear and nonlinear problems. However, compared with DTM, ADM is more advantageous because of its better convergence, accuracy, and reliability in providing exact analytical solutions. ADM produces the exact analytical solution; therefore, it has vast applications in the field of chemical reaction systems [12,13], natural gas engineering [14,15], supercritical system [16], nonlinear resistor and capacitor [17], and conjugated molecules [18].

With the advances in the codes of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), complex multiphase flows involved in any system can now be modeled. These codes generally use the Euler–Euler two-fluid model to simulate the flow dynamic properties in gas–liquid systems. The time-dependent flow properties predicted with the CFD Euler–Euler method depict the actual two-phase flow phenomena and are considered in close agreement with the experimental results [19–21]. Huang et al. [22] compared the mass transfer coefficient from the Euler–Euler CFD model with previous experimental data. Consequently, the researchers discovered that the mass transfer coefficient linearly increases with the increase of the superficial gas velocity [22]. Numerous researchers have also investigated the gas dissolution in two-phase bubbly flow. These researchers reported that the gas bubble of large diameter increases the gas holdup. Other scholars stated that the gas volume fraction, the interfacial area, and the gas bubble diameter are several important parameters in modeling the two-phase turbulent bubbly flow [23,24]. By applying the same Euler–Euler methodology, we previously modeled the two-phase flow in an industrial odor removing system. Such an investigation primarily explored the mixing and gas dissolution phenomenon based on the gas volume fraction, interfacial area, and gas concentration [25]. However, these past numerical studies did not consider the effects of the geometrical design of spargers and the velocity of the inlet liquid on the gas dissolution process. Therefore, a detailed simulation study should be conducted to investigate the flow mixing phenomenon of CO2 in water considering the effects of the design of the injecting nozzle or the sparger as well as the velocity of the inlet liquid.

This study aimed to investigate the two-phase turbulent bubbly flow with mass transfer in a carbonating tank by applying the Euler–Euler methodology. The L-shaped water-injecting nozzle was placed in the middle section of the tank, which was initially filled with CO2 gas to examine the effect of water flow on gas absorption. The flow mixing phenomenon was improved by filling half of the carbonating tank with water and the remaining half with CO2. The shape of the water nozzle was further modified to enhance the gas dissolution and carbonation processes. Various injecting nozzle designs, gas bubble sizes, and liquid and gas velocities were employed to determine their effects on gas volume fraction, liquid velocity, gas concentration, interfacial area, and mass transfer coefficient.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the hydrodynamic and mass transfer modeling of the carbonating tank. Section 3 introduces the numerical method and its implementation to model the bubbly flow mixing in the carbonating tank. Section 4 presents the verification of proposed methodology and the obtained numerical results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

In actual physical situation, a 3D carbonating tank model is generally used to produce the carbonation process by dissolving CO2 gas in water. However, modeling a 3D carbonating tank with multiphase fluids (i.e., water and CO2) is computationally expensive and difficult. Therefore, this study only considered a 2D tank model to easily visualize the gas–liquid flow mixing with the mass transport through a cross-sectional view and to save computational time and cost. A 2D model of the carbonating tank (diameter = 0.19 m) with an aspect ratio (axial length to outer diameter) of 1.63 is presented in Fig. 1
                     . The L-shaped liquid nozzle (diameter = 0.008 m) was placed in the middle of the tank to induct water. The carbonating tank was initially filled with CO2 gas through a nozzle (diameter = 0.004 m), which was placed at the top right corner of the tank (model A). The half portion of the tank was filled with water, and the remaining half contained CO2 to improve the gas dissolution process (model B). Fig. 1 demonstrates that the shape of the water nozzle was further modified to enhance the flow mixing of CO2 gas in water with a minimum production of gas bubbles (model C).

Instead of treating every bubble individually, this study adopted the Euler–Euler method to model the two-phase flow mixing in the carbonating tank because it could resolve the averaged phase concentration [21,25]. The continuity and momentum transport governing equations for the liquid and gas phases are as follows:

                         are the gas, liquid, and slip velocities (m/s), respectivley.

The slip velocity (uslip
                        ) could be determined with the gas momentum transport equation (Eq. 3). Buoyancy causes the gas bubbles to move upward, and the pressure forces are assumed to approximately balance the viscous drag forces on the gas bubble. Therefore, the gas transport equation could be reduced into the below equation to form an equilibrium between the viscous drag force and the pressure gradient [26].

                         is the slip velocity (m/s). The bubble-induced turbulence parameter (Ck
                        ) was set as 0.505. The water nozzle and the CO2 gas were assigned with inlet water and gas velocities of 0.0001 (ul
                        ) and 0.001 m/s (ug
                        ), respectively.

The flow mixing of CO2 with water during the carbonation process involves mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases. In this study, two-film theory was used to model this mass transfer across the gas and liquid interfaces during the gas absorption process in the carbonating tank [25,28,29]. The mass transfer rate (mgl
                        ) was modeled with two-film theory and Henry's law because of the CO2 absorption in water in Eq. 3.

This study used the commercial code COMSOL-Multiphysics (V 4.3) to model the bubbly flow mixing in the carbonating tank. Three carbonating tank models (i.e., models A, B, and C) were concurrently simulated using the k–ε turbulence model with additional source terms (i.e., turbulent bubbly flow module) and transport equations for dissolved gas (i.e., transport of diluted species module). A time-dependent solver was employed to simulate the two-phase flow with a mass transfer for 500 s and at a time step of 0.01 s. Models A and B were discretized using a free triangular mesh type with 78714 elements. By contrast, model C was discretized with 74270 mesh elements. All computations were performed on an Intel Core i7-3370 3.90 GHz processor with a 16 GB RAM operating system.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

The carbonating tank models were investigated, and their gas volume fraction, liquid velocity, gas concentration, and interfacial area per volume were compared with one another. The two-phase flow mixing with mass transfer in the carbonating tank was examined with the parameters cited in the preceding paragraph.

The applied Euler–Euler methodology was compared with the past experimental data of Rampure et al. [20] and Chaumat et al. [31]. These previous studies focused on the modeling of the flow mixing of air with water in a bubble column reactor. The experiments were conducted to observe the effects of superficial gas velocities that ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 m/s on the gas–liquid flow mixing by measuring the overall gas hold-up in the reactor. The present study used the experimental cylindrical column reactor model (diameter = 0.2 m and height = 2 m) of Rampure et al. [20] and Chaumat et al. [31]. The gas sparger was placed at the bottom of the reactor to uniformly supply the gas with a velocity of 0.1 m/s and a constant bubble size of 0.005 m. The overall gas volume fraction in the reactor was measured under different gas sparger velocities (Fig. 2
                        
                        ). The present study closely matched the experimental gas volume fraction at different superficial gas velocities with that in the works of Rampure et al. [20] and Chaumat et al. [31]. The proposed model was also compared with the CFD results obtained by Rampure et al. [20]. The results of the present study were observed to be in reasonable agreement with the numerical results in the literature, thereby verifying the efficiency of the proposed Euler–Euler method.

The flow mixing of CO2 and water in the carbonating tank models with various nozzle arrangements is illustrated in Fig. 3. In this figure, the effect of the flow mixing is represented by the surface and arrow plots, which denote the gas volume fraction and the liquid velocity, respectively. These results were estimated using an inlet gas velocity of 0.001 m/s, a water velocity of 0.0001 m/s, and a bubble size of 0.002 m. The gas bubbles tended to move along a vertical direction under the influence of buoyancy force to induce liquid circulation and to help dissolve the CO2 in water. The gas holdup was significantly increased when the carbonating tank was partially filled with CO2 gas and water. The results also revealed that the water nozzle design of model C considerably improved the liquid circulation that resulted in a larger amount of gas holdup than in other tank models. Hence, the carbonation process in model C was increased because of the high volume of CO2 in water [1].

The gas volume fraction per area was also measured with the effect of variations in inlet gas and water velocities (Fig. 4
                        (a) and (b)). The gas volume fraction per area was reduced at high inlet gas and water velocities. Such a reduction was caused by the condition that the CO2 gas covered a large tank area with the increase of inlet gas and liquid velocities due to the improved liquid circulation. This condition implies that the carbonation process is effective at high gas and liquid velocities with improved water circulation [2,3]. Compared with the other carbonating tank models, model C displayed the least amount of gas volume fraction per area for both the inlet gas and liquid velocities cases. This circumstance signifies that the carbonation process would increase with the use of the water nozzle of model C.

Interfacial area helps predict the momentum, mass, and energy transfer between the gas–liquid interface. Therefore, this area is an important parameter for modeling two-phase flows, and it mainly depends on the gas volume fraction and bubble size [5,24]. An increase in the volume of gas in a carbonating tank also increases the interfacial area, and vice versa [32]. In this study, Eq. (15) was applied to calculate the interfacial area and the effects of the inlet gas velocities on such area (Fig. 5
                        ). In general, interfacial area increases with the increase of superficial gas velocities. Compared with other models, model C showed higher magnitudes for the interfacial area because the large area of the tank was covered with CO2 gas [25,32]. The interfacial area and the gas volume fraction per area displayed conflicting patterns with respect to the inlet gas velocity. The result demonstrated that the carbonation process is effective in model C because of its high interfacial area and low gas volume fraction per area. The interfacial area was also computed with the effect of various inlet water velocities. However, no significant difference was observed among all the carbonating tank models because of the dependency of the interfacial area on the gas holdup and bubble size [5,24,25].

The effect of superficial gas velocities with different nozzle arrangements on the gas concentration is presented in Fig. 6(
                        a). The results were evaluated with a constant gas bubble size of 0.002 m. Among all the carbonating tank models, model A showed the highest gas concentration magnitude because it was fully filled with CO2 at the onset of the carbonation process. The gas concentration displayed an increasing trend with respect to the inlet gas velocity caused by the effective liquid circulation (Fig. 6(a)). The maximum gas concentration in the water was observed at high gas inlet velocity, which indicates that the carbonation process increased with higher inlet gas velocities caused by the increasing CO2 gas concentration. The L-shaped nozzle design resulted in a high gas concentration in the tank and therefore, increased the carbonation process.

The effect of the various inlet water velocities on the gas concentration in the carbonating tank is depicted in Fig. 6(b). The findings confirmed that increasing the water flow rates could decrease the liquid circulation, thereby reducing the gas concentration magnitudes. In model C, the gas concentration slope significantly decreased because of the less effective flow mixing caused by the increasing water flow rates. These results suggest that the efficiency of the carbonation process was decreased because of the less flow mixing of two fluids due to the high inlet water velocities. Therefore, a suitable water velocity must be maintained in the tank to make the carbonation process effective. The flow mixing of CO2 and water could also be increased by introducing CO2 gas in the tank at high flow rates [5,6].

The mass transfer coefficient is an important parameter for describing and analyzing the transfer of mass from gas to liquid in the design of gas–liquid flow systems. In this study, the effect of the nozzle design on the mass transfer coefficient with gas and water velocities of 0.001 and 0.0001 m/s, respectively, is shown in Fig. 7
                        . The mass transfer coefficients were evaluated using a constant gas bubble size of 0.002 m. The rate of the mass transfer was higher in model A than that in models B and C because the former was completely filled with CO2 at the onset of the carbonation process (Fig. 7(a)). By contrast, the mass transfer coefficient for models B and C was reduced. This observation implies that the carbonation process increases with the L-shaped nozzle and when the tank is completely filled with CO2 gas.

The dependence of the mass transfer coefficient on the gas velocity with an inlet water velocity of 0.0001 m/s is shown in Fig. 8
                        . The mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases occurred in the tank area only, particularly on the right side of the water nozzle at low gas velocities (Fig. 8(a)). The maximum value of the mass transfer coefficient at an inlet gas velocity of 0.001 m/s was 0.5 m/s. A 4% increase in the mass transfer coefficient magnitude was observed for the case of 0.002 m/s gas velocity (Fig. 8(b)). Moreover, the mass transfer mechanism was observed in both sections of the carbonating tank located around the water nozzle at high gas velocities (Fig. 8(c)). For all the carbonating tank models, the mass transfer coefficient almost linearly increased with the increase of the inlet gas velocities. The dissolution of CO2 gas in the water was high in the middle region of the carbonating tank because of the higher mass transfer coefficient magnitude in this area. This result suggests that carbonation is intense in the central part, but is less intense near the wall of the tank [4,5,22].

The gas bubble size is an important parameter for modeling the gas dispersion mechanism in the carbonating tank because it directly affects the gas volume fraction and the interfacial area [5]. Therefore, this study considered various sizes of gas bubbles to evaluate their effects on the two-phase flow at the inlet water and gas velocities of 0.0001 and 0.001 m/s, respectively (Fig. 9
                        ). The gas volume fraction per area linearly increased with an increase in the gas bubble size. Few areas of the carbonating tank were covered with gas at high gas bubble sizes. This case suggests that a large gas bubble is unsuitable for the carbonation process because of the reduced gas holdup in the tank. The interfacial area slightly increased with the gas bubbles size (Fig. 9(b)). In model C, the carbonation process increased because of the high interfacial area and gas volume fraction in this model. The gas concentration significantly reduced with bubble sizes of larger diameters (Fig. 9(c)). The flow mixing of the CO2 gas in the water was significantly reduced because large gas bubbles could not be easily dissolved in water. Therefore, CO2 concentration in the water was reduced because of the less effective flow mixing caused by the large gas bubbles. This condition implies that a suitable gas bubble size must be selected to make the carbonation process effective with the increase of the gas volume fraction and concentration in the tank [25].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This study applied the Euler–Euler methodology to numerically investigate the gas–liquid flow mixing feature with mass transfer inside a continuously operated carbonating tank. Various injecting nozzle designs, gas bubble sizes, and liquid and gas velocities were adopted to explore their effects on gas volume fraction, liquid velocity, interfacial area, gas concentration, and mass transfer coefficient. The present Euler–Euler methodology was also compared with past experimental and numerical results, and a reasonable agreement was observed between the results. This finding verifies the effectiveness of this method in designing two-phase flow systems.

The water nozzle of the third carbonating tank helped improve the liquid circulation with high gas holdup. The carbonation process increased at high gas and water velocities because of the satisfactory gas dissolution process. The interfacial area also increased with an increase of superficial gas velocities, and model C produced high values of interfacial area. The L-shaped nozzle design produced higher CO2 gas concentration and increased the carbonation process. By contrast, the gas concentration was reduced with the increase of the water velocities. The rate of the mass transfer was higher in model A than in model B and C because it contained more CO2 gas at the onset of the carbonation process. Nonetheless, in all the carbonating tank models, the mass transfer coefficient increased with the increase of the inlet gas velocities. Large gas bubbles reduced the gas holdup and the concentration level in the water because of their less efficient gas dissolution. The carbonation process was improved with the use of small gas bubbles because of their high gas volume fraction and concentration. Future studies should likewise consider bubble coalescence and break-up effects to observe their effects on carbonation.
