                  Motivated by Markowitz portfolio optimization problems under uncertainty in the problem data, we consider general convex parametric multiobjective optimization problems under data uncertainty. For the first time, this uncertainty is treated by a robust multiobjective formulation in the gist of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski. For this novel formulation, we investigate its relationship to the original multiobjective formulation as well as to its scalarizations. Further, we provide a characterization of the location of the robust Pareto frontier with respect to the corresponding original Pareto frontier and show that standard techniques from multiobjective optimization can be employed to characterize this robust efficient frontier. We illustrate our results based on a standard mean–variance problem.
               
            

Prompted by the well-known strong data dependency of mean–variance optimization, we investigate how to treat multiobjective optimization problems with uncertain parameters. The framework of multiobjective optimization, in which several conflicting objectives have to be minimized simultaneously, can be seen as the natural setting for portfolio optimization problems, as such problems invariably have to deal with the conflicting notions of revenue and risk. However, and equally naturally, these problems also have to deal with uncertainty: problem data (like expected future return and covariances of random variables) are not known precisely, and only estimates are available. We are thus facing multiobjective optimization problems with uncertain parameters.

In this paper, we want to follow the idea of the robust counterpart approach where an entire set of possible parameter realizations – called uncertainty set – is used for the optimization, but no assumptions about the distribution of the unknown parameters is needed, in contrast to many other robustification approaches. In the context of portfolio optimization, several authors have considered instances varying from theoretical to practical settings, amongst others Goldfarb and Iyengar (2003), Tütüncü and Koenig (2004), Ceria and Stubbs (2006), Meucci (2005), Lutgens (2004) or Schöttle and Werner (2006). Most of these approaches have in common that the uncertainty sets are chosen based on statistical reasoning, but other approaches are followed as well. All these approaches are based on just one specific choice of the risk-aversion parameter, i.e. only robustification of a particular instance of risk-return trade-off is considered.

In contrast to these approaches, we propose a different and completely novel approach. Instead of following Markowitz (1952) and refering to some scalar portfolio optimization problem, we start with the multiobjective formulation of the mean–variance portfolio problem in the gist of Kuhn and Tucker (1951). Our main aim is then to robustify the complete efficient frontier to obtain a robust efficient frontier. In this context, our main contributions are as follows:
                        
                           •
                           We introduce for the first time a robust counterpart to a multiobjective programming problem in the style of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998, 1999).

We investigate the relationship between the robust Pareto frontier and the original Pareto frontier and show that the robust frontier lies between the original nominal efficient frontier and some corresponding easy-to-determine upper bound.

We demonstrate that robust efficient frontiers can be found by standard methods of robust and multiobjective programming under commonly made assumptions on the uncertainty.

We pay particular attention to the case of portfolio optimization and show that the resulting robust multiobjective counterpart of the mean–variance portfolio optimization problem can be treated in a numerically efficient manner.

We want to emphasize that, although motivated by portfolio optimization, our methodology is general enough to be applied to any convex parametric multiobjective optimization problem under data uncertainty. As such, it might be especially useful for optimization problems arising in engineering.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the necessary machinery from multiobjective optimization (Section 2.2), robust optimization (Section 2.3) and (robust) portfolio optimization (Section 2.4) that we need further on. Readers already familiar with these topics can easily skip this part of the presentation. Section 3 then contains the main results of this paper: we provide a proper notion of a robustified multiobjective problem and show that it leads, via scalarization, to families of robust single-objective problems that can also be derived in a different way. We also provide an alternative motivation for the robust counterpart and characterize the location of the robust efficient frontier with respect to the original frontier. Section 4 considers an illustrative numerical example from portfolio optimization that provides further insight into the proposed robust counterpart. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.

                              .

The reason for the formulation given here is that there is no standard total order for the image space 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                        . In contrast to this situation, in the classical single-objective case one always uses the standard total order defined by 
                           
                              x

                              ↔
                              y
                              -
                              x

                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    +
                                    +

                              x
                              ,
                              y
                              ∈
                              R
                              )
                           
                        . Nevertheless, the idea of specifying an order by using a specific set defining it can be conveniently employed in multiobjective optimization, as the following discussion will show.

To summarize the discussion above: we need to choose a convex cone 
                        
                           
                              K

                        in order to define an order 
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    <
                                 
                                 
                                    K
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                        . Other attributes of K that can be used to our advantage are closedness, pointedness, and 
                        
                           
                              K
                              ∪
                              -
                              K
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    R

                        but, as pointed out before, we cannot have all of these at the same time.
                     

Often, K is chosen to be the positive orthant, 
                           
                              K
                              =
                              
                                 
                                    R
                                 
                                 
                                    +
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                 
                              
                           
                        , which gives exactly the standard definition of order in multicriteria optimization and especially in the specific setting of mean–variance optimization.

We will now consider linear forms from

                        . It turns out that in the case of convex cones and sets, these linear forms can be used to characterize almost all efficient points of a multiobjective optimization problem, as we will see below. More precisely, we need the linear forms from the quasi-interior of

Different proofs can be found in various textbooks and original articles, see e.g. Göpfert and Nehse (1990, Section 2.22), Sawaragi, Nakayama, and Tanino (1985, p. 74), or Durier (1988). The first proof of part 2 is due to Arrow, Barankin, and Blackwell (1953). The set

                         is often called the set of properly efficient points and also allows for a different characterization, see Geoffrion (1968). Also, note that other, nonlinear K-monotone functions have only recently attracted some attention, mainly for numerical reasons. See Fliege (2004) for more details.

                        Some boundary points (more precisely, a subset of measure zero) are left out in the convex case, but, as mentioned above, this is a detail rarely of importance in applications. Such a methodology, in which a multiobjective problem is replaced by several standard single-objective problems is called scalarization, and the scalarization technique described above is the classical weighted-sum scalarization henceforth denoted by WSS. Alternative numerical methods for treating multiobjective problems have only recently gained some attention, see Fliege and Svaiter (2000) and Fliege, Grana Drummond, and Svaiter (2009).

We thus call the multiobjective problem 
                           
                              (
                              M
                              )
                           
                         
                        equivalent to the family of parameterized single-objective problems 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              λ
                              )
                           
                         if and only if (2.3) holds. Theorem 2.3 gives sufficient conditions for this equivalence.

Applying these results to the case

                           Considering the case of portfolio optimization in the Markowitz formulation, we see that we have, as mentioned before in Remark 2.1,

It is now also clear which boundary points we are missing from the set of efficient points when employing this strategy: the minimum-variance portfolio as well as the maximum return portfolios. But these can readily be generated by considering (2.5) also for the cases

A proof can be found, e.g., in Eichfelder (2008, Corollaries 2.28 and 2.29).

In a similar vein to the above, we can thus call the multiobjective problem 
                           
                              (
                              M
                              )
                           
                         
                        equivalent to the family of parameterized single-objective problems 
                           
                              P
                              (
                              k
                              ,
                              ε
                              )
                           
                        , if and only if (2.6) holds. This is clearly the case for the considered problem of Markowitz portfolio optimization.

Over the last decade the idea to deal with uncertainty in optimization by robust optimization has gained more and more interest among both academics and practitioners. An extensive and very recent introduction to the topic can be found in the book by Ben-Tal, El Ghaoui, and Nemirovski (2009) or in the review by Bertsimas, Brown, and Caramanis (2011), which contain large lists with references demonstrating the popularity and broadness of this approach. The robust optimization approach, especially the concept of the robust counterpart, was introduced by Ben-Tal, El Ghaoui and Nemirovski.
                           1
                           More precisely, the robust counterpart approach was independently introduced by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998, 1999, 2002) and by El Ghaoui and Lebret (1997, 1998).
                        
                        
                           1
                         The robust counterpart takes into account uncertainty by replacing uncertain functions, i.e. functions depending on some uncertain parameter, by a conservative over-estimator, the worst-case value of the function on the whole uncertainty set. Thus, if applied to uncertain constraints, it guarantees feasibility under all (reasonable) realizations of the parameters, and if applied to the objective function, it guarantees a worst-case performance in all circumstances.

To proceed, let us consider the following convex parametric optimization problem

                           Remark 2.6
                           In general, it is reasonable to assume that uncertainty enters in a convex way, as it is expected that the worst uncertain parameter for a given point x lies on the boundary of U, which is the case for convex uncertainty. Taking into account a different notation for the constraints, convex uncertainty was assumed in Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (1998). Actually, in most practical applications, and especially in the situation of portfolio optimization described below, uncertainty even enters in a linear way. Nevertheless, we do not impose any assumption on the structure of uncertainty in the following.

The robust counterpart approach as such represents a worst-case approach by considering the worst-case value of the objective over the whole set U of possible parameter realizations. Further, the solution has to be feasible for all realizations of the uncertain parameter within the uncertainty set U. Thus, the feasibility of the solution is immunized against perturbations of the parameter – which is the obvious benefit of robustification.

                           Under the given assumptions, the robust counterpart remains a convex problem, which is especially important for its numerical solution. However, due to the max operator, the once smooth problem now might become non-smooth, but still sub-differentiable. Depending on the specific choice of the uncertainty set U and the structure how uncertainty enters the functions f and g, analytical expressions for the robustified versions are available for a large class of functions. This means that under suitable assumptions, the robust counterpart can be solved with similarly efficient methods as the original nominal problem, which is for instance the case for most practical examples of robust mean–variance optimization. If no analytical reformulation is available the robust counterpart can still be solved rather efficiently based on numerical methods from semi-infinite programming, cf. Werner (2008).

                           The robust counterpart is a rather elegant approach as it allows to express both design and (obviously) parameter uncertainties in a unified manner. For instance, design uncertainty, i.e. small deviations in the implementation of the optimal solution, can be considered via the uncertainty

                              . This then guarantees that the optimal solution remains feasible after slight perturbations.

Our main motivation for the consideration of multiobjective problems under data uncertainty stems from mean–variance portfolio optimization as laid out by Markowitz (1952, 1959). The basic idea is that a portfolio is solely characterized by the two quantities risk (mostly measured in terms of the variance or volatility) and expected return. Since an investor is seeking for an allocation with low risk and high expected return, a trade-off between these two conflicting aims has to be made.

Although the mean–variance framework is probably still the most popular approach for asset allocation, there is a large inherent risk in this framework, evolving from using possibly incorrect parameter values in the computation of the portfolio allocation. Markowitz (1952) already acknowledged that it is an open question how to derive the proper input parameters for the mean–variance model. Nowadays, this is often referred to as estimation risk in the academic literature, as usually the value that is finally used for the solution of the portfolio allocation problem is just an estimate (mostly based on a data sample) for the unknown true parameter. Due to this estimation risk, it is by now well-known that the concept of mean–variance efficient frontier has two major weaknesses, namely:
                           
                              •
                              It has been demonstrated (see e.g. Barry, 1974; Jorion, 1992 or Best & Grauer, 1991) that the optimal solution of the mean–variance problem strongly depends on the particular values of the expected returns and their covariances and that especially the expected returns have a significant influence
                                    2
                                    This rather general statement is true in most practical situations, see e.g. Chopra and Ziemba (1993), but of course it depends – among others factors – on the particular choice of the risk aversion parameter. It further depends on the ratio of the number of assets to the size of the historical data sample, as shown recently by Kan and Zhou (2007).
                                 
                                 
                                    2
                                  on the optimal asset allocation.

In addition, Michaud (1998) pointed out that especially the right end of the efficient frontier (the maximum return portfolio) promises unreliable high expected returns for somewhat too low volatilities. This is typically due to over-optimistic optimization based on error-prone estimates, resulting in large deviations between ex-ante and ex-post returns and volatilities.

As estimation risk represents a popular and heavily researched topic, there are various approaches to account for estimation risk, especially in the context of portfolio optimization, see for example the early considerations by Jobson and Korkie (1981) or Best and Grauer (1991). To improve the allocation, many authors propose to use parameter estimators other than the classical maximum likelihood as these seem to be more robust and thus reduce the influence of estimation risk on the optimal portfolios. Bawa, Brown, and Klein (1979), Jobson and Korkie (1981) and also Efron and Morris (1975) use shrinkage or Stein-type estimators, while others (e.g., Jorion (1986)) suggest Bayesian estimators which combine a traditional parameter estimate with external prior information. More recently, robust estimators in more general terms are considered in Perret-Gentil and Victoria-Feser (2004), by Kempf and Memmel (2006) in the context of minimum variance portfolios and most recently by DeMiguel and Nogales (2009). A detailed comparison of the Bayesian approach to the popular Black–Litterman approach together with its robustification can be found in Schöttle, Werner, and Zagst (2010).

Alternative types of optimization models that address the problem of estimation risk are stochastic programming and chance-constrained optimization which incorporate distributional assumptions and uncertainty about parameters into the optimization problem in terms of probabilistic constraint formulations, cf. Dupacova (1999) or Erdogan and Iyengar (2006) and the references therein, or sample-average multiobjective optimization, see Fliege and Xu (2011). Other approaches formulate the problem over a discrete set of alternatives (portfolios) and use tools from multicriteria decision aid (MCDA), see, e. g., Zopounidis and Doumpos (1999) and their review (Zopounidis & Doumpos, 1999).

To formalize the approach, let us consider a financial market with n risky assets defined on a suitable probability space in a single period setting. Since it is well-known that the mean–variance approach is consistent with utility theory under the assumption of multivariate elliptical distributions, see e.g. Ingersoll (1987), we assume that the linear one period return

                         is not known exactly but subject to uncertainty. Hence some appropriate method to deal with the uncertainty in problem (MV) is critical. However, so far, uncertainty has not been considered directly in the formulation (MV), but only in its scalarized version (MVμT
                           ) and (MVλ). For this purpose we have to choose a joint uncertainty set U for the uncertain data

                        Of course, more sophisticated uncertainty sets can be chosen which lead to other robust counterparts. For a more detailed discussion on the choice of the uncertainty set let us refer to Schöttle and Werner (2006, 2009).

                        The problem family (RMVλ) has been considered in great detail in Schöttle and Werner (2009). There, it has been shown that the resulting robust frontier (i.e. the efficient portfolios) is actually a ‘shortened’ version of the original efficient frontier if the joint uncertainty set U is chosen in a statistically meaningful way. However, the family of robust problems (RMVμT
                           ) has not yet been investigated in this manner. Therefore, let us consider (RMVμT
                           ) more closely: First, it can be observed that now the required expected return level

                        As the families of optimization problems (GRMVλ) and (RMVλ) do not have the same objective function, it cannot be expected that they possess the same solutions nor that they yield the same efficient frontier. Further, it is not clear yet if one formulation is advantageous over the other, and for what reasons.

As we have already motivated, alongside the single-objective problem with uncertainty (

                     ) we also need to consider a more general setting, where now the objective f becomes multi-dimensional, i.e. 
                        
                           f

                                 -constraint scalarization method (ECS), and

the weighted-sum scalarization (WSS).

As we have demonstrated in Theorems 2.3 and 2.5, both scalarization methods yield the same efficient frontier (modulo closure) as (MOPu) under reasonably mild assumptions. Unfortunately, this is no longer true in the robust multiobjective case:

                                        are actually optimal.

Thus, both approaches lead, as proposed, to completely different solution sets, even in a very simple linear setting.

In the previous section we have encountered a similar situation, where the transformation of the multiobjective portfolio optimization problem to a family of scalarized problems is not consistent with robustification, i.e. the operations robustification and scalarization do not commute.

To understand the reason for this surprising behavior let us consider robustification and scalarization for (MOPu) in its general form. The ECS method allows to equivalently rewrite (MOPu) as

We note that for 
                           
                              p
                              =

                         the definition of the multiobjective robust counterpart coincides with the definition of the usual robust counterpart and hence provides a proper generalization of this concept to multiobjective optimization. Further, the robustification of the p-dimensional objective is now the very same as the robustification of the m-dimensional constraint.

where arrows labeled with “R” denote a robustification operation and arrows labeled with “S” denote a scalarization. Of course, the actual type of scalar problems depends on the scalarization strategy in use.

                           The above proposition is the key observation to the numerical solution of (RMOPU). It states that (RMOPU) can be solved via the numerical solution of a family of ordinary scalar robust optimization problems. Therefore, it is open to a large variety of methods designed to solve robust counterpart problems, see e.g. Ben-Tal et al. (2009).

On first sight it might seem that the construction of the generalized robust counterpart is quite artificial and based on the very specific 
                           
                              ε
                           
                        -constraint method. However, in the following we will provide an alternative motivation for the generalized robust counterpart by considerations which are independent to the 
                           
                              ε
                           
                        -constraint method and motivated by a pure multiobjective programming point of view. For this purpose, let us rewrite the original problem

                        This immediately yields that the multiobjective robust counterpart of (MOQu) is identical to (RMOPU). Thus, the multiobjective robust counterpart seems to be the canonical generalization of the concept of a robust counterpart to multiobjective optimization. In the following theorem we summarize the insights gained from the above.

This bracketing of the robust efficient frontier between the nominal efficient frontier and its robust image is illustrated in Fig. 3. We note that the robust efficient frontier and the robust image of the original nominal frontier might shrink and move to the top right significantly. Further, as we have seen from the proof of Part 1 of Theorem 3.9, the statement will remain true even if the feasible set is also subject to uncertainty. However, in case of uncertain feasibility set, Part 2 of Theorem 3.9 will no longer hold true for all

For an illustration of the above concepts, we have chosen a simple example from mean–variance optimization. Although the following results can also be obtained with a more realistic example and sophisticated choices of uncertainty sets, the basic idea can be similarly well illustrated in such a simplified way. If not mentioned otherwise, it is easy to show that all conclusions remain valid in more general cases as well.

                     see Schöttle and Werner (2009) for more details on the corresponding calculations. Hence, scalarizations of the robust counterpart can be solved in a numerically efficient manner by standard optimization software.
                        Remark 4.1
                        As already mentioned before, this is one of the cases where the robustified versions can be obtained in analytical form due to the specific interplay of the choice of the uncertainty set and the linear dependence on the uncertain parameters. In the given special situation it can be observed that robustification acts as a penalty for missing diversification as the norm of a portfolio can be interpreted as a measure of its diversification. The better the diversification, the lower the penalty due to robustification. Therefore, the penalty term is directly linked to the sensitivity of the functions with respect to the uncertain parameters, the less sensitive, the less the penalty.

Although both observations are very specific to the example at hand, similar interpretations of robustification still hold true, see e.g. Schöttle and Werner (2006) for a practical discussion.

                     . Additionally, the three corresponding elements in the robust image, i.e. the images of the portfolios under the robustified objective are illustrated (as small circles). According to Theorem 3.9 these are always located to the top right of the image of the uncertainty set and to the top right of the original element of the efficient frontier.

The location of the robust efficient frontier (in red) in comparison to the original nominal frontier (in black) is illustrated in Fig. 3
                     .
                        Remark 4.2
                        Interestingly, the robust efficient frontier passes through the corresponding robust images of the average and the maximum return portfolio, but not through the robust image of the minimum variance portfolio. This immediately implies that the minimum variance portfolio cannot be robust efficient. This example shows that in general a nominal efficient solution does not necessarily need to be robust efficient as well.

However, this observation depends on the specific problem data. Setting the correlation

                                       ˆ

                                 ,

                           , a different picture can be obtained, cf. Fig. 4
                           . Now the minimum variance portfolio itself is already robust. However, more risky portfolios further down the efficient frontier are no longer robust; the robust efficient frontier gets significantly shortened compared to the original frontier. Due to the specific parameter choice, this example falls into the framework of Schöttle and Werner (2009) where this result has been obtained analytically.

For practical purposes, it is helpful to link the robust efficient frontier to the nominal performance and to visualize this in comparison to the nominal efficient frontier. Figures like Fig. 5
                      help the decision maker in finding an appropriate solution, as the trade-off between optimality and robustness is easily obtainable from the figure. In this representation, each element of the robust frontier is linked to its corresponding nominal element by a line segment, which gives an idea about the efficiency lost due to uncertainty. The length of the line segment represents the loss of efficiency due to optimizing a robustified objective instead of the true objective. Such an illustration, interpretation and decomposition of the efficiency loss due to uncertainty and due to optimizing a robustified objective is easily obtained in our multiobjective framework. We have thus extended the scalar case by taking into account additional information that would not have been available beforehand.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Motivated by the well-known strong data dependency of mean–variance optimization, we have investigated how to treat convex multiobjective optimization problems with uncertain parameters. We have adopted the robust counterpart concept of Ben-Tal and Nemirovski and generalized it to the multiobjective setting. It has been demonstrated that this generalization seems to be the most natural concept in this context. It has further been emphasized that scalarization and robustification only commute if generalized instances are considered – which nevertheless lead to the same (multiobjective) robust counterpart. This is also the key observation to the numerical solution of the robust multiobjective problem which boils down to the solution of a family of ordinary scalar robust problems. It remains an open question for future research how to characterize the differences which arise if one would start with traditional problem instances instead. In addition we have demonstrated that the robust efficient frontier can be easily bracketed by the original nominal frontier and its robust image. Based on an example from portfolio theory it was shown that this allows for a better interpretation of the efficiency loss due to robustification.
