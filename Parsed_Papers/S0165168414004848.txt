                  Multimodulus algorithms (MMA) based adaptive blind equalizers mitigate inter-symbol interference in a digital communication system by minimizing dispersion in the quadrature components of the equalized sequence in a decoupled manner, i.e., the in-phase and quadrature components of the equalized sequence are used to minimize dispersion in the respective components of the received signal. These unsupervised equalizers are mostly incorporated in bandwidth-efficient digital receivers (wired, wireless or optical) which rely on quadrature amplitude modulation based signaling. These equalizers are equipped with nonlinear error-functions in their update expressions which makes it a challenging task to evaluate analytically their steady-state performance. However, exploiting variance relation theorem, researchers have recently been able to report approximate expressions for steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE) of such equalizers for noiseless but interfering environment.
                  In this work, in contrast to existing results, we present exact steady-state tracking analysis of two multimodulus equalizers in a non-stationary environment. Specifically, we evaluate expressions for steady-state EMSE of two equalizers, namely the MMA2-2 and the βMMA. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is validated using different set experiments and found in close agreement.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Transmission of signals between a transmitter and a receiver in a communication system encounters different types of dispersive channels. Such channels perform certain non-ideal transformations resulting in different types of interferences like inter-symbol interference (ISI) and frequency selective fading, which are considered to be the biggest limiting factors in a communication system. One of the approaches to combat ISI is to use blind equalizer. An adaptive blind equalizer attempts to compensate for the distortions of the channel by processing the received signals and reconstructing the transmitted signal up to some indeterminacies by the use of linear or nonlinear filters. Specifically, a blind equalizer does not require any training mode and tries to mitigate the effects of the channel solely on the basis of probabilistic and statistical properties of the transmitted data sequence. The basic idea behind an adaptive blind equalizer is to minimize or maximize some admissible blind objective or cost function through the choice of filter coefficients based on the equalizer output [1–3].

When an adaptive equalizer is used to combat a time-varying channel, the optimum Wiener solution takes time-varying form which results in variation of saddle point in error performance surface. If the underlying signal statistics happen to change with time, then these statistical variations will be reflected in the data, the filter has access to, which in turn will be reflected in the performance of filters. So, tracking variations in signal statistics or signal moments is considered to be a useful property for adaptive filters. For adaptive filters, the variation in underlying signal statistics and the saddle point can be tracked by using tracking performance analysis; and consequently, the filter parameters can be adjusted accordingly to maintain the saddle points of error performance surface and to calculate the variations in underlying signal statistics in time-varying systems. One metric to evaluate tracking performance of an adaptive filter is to measure the steady-state excess mean square error (EMSE). EMSE can be defined as the difference between the mean square error (MSE) of the filter in steady-state and the minimum cost. The smaller the EMSE of an adaptive filter, the better it is [4]. If filter parameters (like step-size) are chosen correctly, the filter can track variations in signal statistics provided variations are not fast. However, tracking fast variations in signal statistics might be a challenging task or at times impossible to perform [4].

In the context of adaptive blind equalization, the widely adopted algorithm is Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA2-2) [2,5–7]. For quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signaling, however, a tailored version of CMA2-2, commonly known as Multimodulus Algorithm (MMA2-2), is considered to be more suitable. The MMA2-2 is capable of jointly achieving blind equalization and carrier phase recovery [8–13], whereas the CMA2-2 requires a separate phase-lock loop for carrier phase recovery.

The nonlinearity of most of the adaptive equalizers, including both CMA2-2 and MMA2-2, makes the steady-state analysis and tracking performance a difficult task to perform. As a result, only a small number of analyses are available in the literature concerning the steady-state analysis performance of adaptive equalizers. However, a few results are available on EMSE analysis of CMA2-2, where some researchers employed Lyapunov stability and averaging analysis [14], and some exploited the variance relation theorem [15,16] to evaluate the same. The steady-state analysis of adaptive filters has gained interest due to ease in analysis owing to variance relation theorem. Abrar et al. [17] performed the EMSE analysis of CMA2-2 and βCMA [18] by assuming that the modulus of equalized signals is Rician distributed in the steady-state. Moreover, this theorem has been employed to study the steady-state analysis of a number of adaptive blind equalization algorithms like in the analyses of the so-called hybrid algorithm [19], the square contour algorithm [20], the improved square contour algorithm [21] and the varying-modulus algorithms [22].

In this paper, we perform tracking performance analysis of two well-known multimodulus equalizers. In particular, using the variance relation arguments, we derive expressions for steady-state EMSE of MMA2-2 and recently proposed βMMA [23] under the assumption that the quadrature components of the successfully equalized signal are Gaussian distributed when conditioned on true signal alphabets. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the mathematical model for the system. Section 3 introduces the non-stationary environment and the framework for EMSE analyses. Section 3.1 provides the steady-state tracking performance analysis for MMA2-2 equalizer. Section 3.2 presents the analytical expression evaluated for steady-state tracking performance analysis for βMMA equalizer. Section 4 provides simulation results for steady-state performances of MMA2-2 and βMMA for equalized zero-forcing scenario, equalization of fixed and time-varying channels, and equalization under different values of filter-length. Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.

                        Notably, due to its decoupled error-function, MMA2-2 is capable of compensating residual phase-offset and moderate frequency-offset mismatches without requiring additional hardware. Interested readers may refer to [26,27] for discussions on phase recovery capability of MMA2-2. As far as ISI cancellation capability is concerned, the stationary points of MMA2-2 are closely related to those of CMA2-2 [8,11]. For the sake of comparison, the CMA2-2 update is

Recently, Abrar and Nandi [23] have proposed a new multimodulus algorithm, the βMMA, for joint blind equalization and carrier phase recovery in square-QAM signaling. The algorithm is derived by solving a constrained maximization problem. Results have indicated a superior performance to be exhibited by βMMA, for higher-order QAM signaling on both symbol and fractionally spaced channels, as compared to established methods including MMA2-2 and CMA2-2. The cost function of βMMA is given as [23]

In order to evaluate the analytical expression for the steady-state EMSE of MMA2-2, we need to evaluate the energy of error-function as well as its correlation with a priori estimation error. Implementing these steps, we have the following theorem for the tracking performance of MMA2-2 equalizer:

                                 Here, we emphasize that no approximations were involved in the derivation of (21). Also, it is experimentally observed that EMSE is the smallest positive root of (21).

In this section, we verify the tracking performance analyses for MMA2-2 and βMMA. The experiments have been performed considering (i) an equalized zero-forcing situation perturbed with random noise vector, (ii) a time-invariant channel, (iii) a time-varying channel (with a constant mean part and an autoregressive random part), and (iv) the effect of filter length on equalization performance.

In this experiment, the elements of perturbation vector

Note that, due to assuming an already equalized scenario, we do not have to worry about the iterations required for successful convergence of the equalizer; thus the EMSE is computed for all iterations. The equalizer was initialized such that the first tap was unity and all taps were zero. The Monte-Carlo simulation requires to add the perturbation

                         contribute to acquisition and tracking errors [4], respectively. The rule (37) has been adopted in [4,15–17,31].

Since this experimental setup aims to evaluate both acquisition and tracking errors, the resulting EMSE is a convex downward function of step-size μ. Refer to Figs. 3 and 4

It is evident from this result that, for both QAM with smaller filter length (i.e., N=7), the numerical, the closed-form and the simulated traces conform each other for all values of step-sizes. However, for larger filter length (i.e., N=21), traces start deviating from each other for higher values of EMSE. Noticeably, for all four simulation cases, the analytically obtained minimum EMSE

To appreciate the lower EMSE exhibited by βMMA as compared to MMA2-2, we summarize the findings of above experiments for 16-QAM depicting the values of minimum EMSE achieved by both algorithms in Table 1
                        . Note that (as expected) the numerical results are closer to those obtained by simulation.

Next we compare the abilities of MMA2-2 and βMMA to track the variations in non-stationary environments by obtaining the ratio of the minimum achievable steady-state EMSE as exhibited by MMA2-2 to that of βMMA. Mathematically, we compute the following ratio:

                         which indicates that the value of the minimum steady-state EMSE of βMMA is always less than that of MMA2-2 which reflects the superiority of βMMA over MMA2-2 for tracking variations in non-stationary environments.

In contrast to experiment I where we considered a zero-forcing scenario subject to random perturbation, here in this experiment, we consider an interfering T/2-spaced time-invariant channel whose impulse response is given by

                           =
                           [

                           0.2
                           ]
                         as used in [15,31]. In the sequel, we refer to this channel as channel-1. Since we are not considering the random perturbation 
                           (
                           
                              
                                 σ

                           =
                           0
                           )
                        , the estimated EMSE comprises acquisition error only and is supposed to be a monotonic increasing function of step-size μ.

In this experiment, we consider a T/2-spaced equalizer and 16-QAM signaling for both MMA2-2 and βMMA. The equalizer is initialized such that the central tap is set to unity and the rest are set to zero. Refer to Fig. 7
                        (a) for the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE obtained for MMA2-2. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (21) and (T2.1), respectively. Similarly, Fig. 7(b) depicts the comparison of analytical and simulated EMSE of βMMA equalizer in the presence of similar channel. The legends ‘Numerical’ and ‘Closed-from’ refer to the solutions (31) and (T3.1), respectively. It is evident from these results that the analytical and simulated traces conform closely with each other.

Note that the result in Fig. 7 also reveals that the steady-state EMSE (subject to successful convergence) of the larger filter will be higher than that of the smaller filter for the given value of step-size. Refer to Fig. 8
                         where the convergence traces of EMSE are depicted for two different filter lengths (N=7 and 21) for 
                           μ
                           =
                           1
                           ×
                           
                              
                                 10
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 4
                              
                           
                        . The average values of the converged steady-state EMSE (for N=7 and 21) match closely with analytically estimated values obtained from Theorems 2 and 3.

In contrast to experiments I and II, here we evaluate the performance analysis of the addressed equalizers in the presence of time-varying (TV) channel. A TV channel is usually modeled such that its autocorrelation properties correspond to wide-sense stationary and uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) (as suggested by [36]). However, as reported in [37], a first-order (Gauss–Markov) autoregressive model is sufficient enough to model a slow-varying channel as given by

Refer to Fig. 9
                         for the comparison of theoretical and simulated EMSE of MMA2-2 and βMMA equalizers. The legend ‘Analysis’ refers to the solutions (T2.1) and (T3.1) for MMA2-2 and βMMA equalizers, respectively. It is evident from the results that the theoretical and simulated EMSE traces conform each other. Note that the factor

In all previous experiments, we have considered different channel conditions where the effect of filter-length on equalization capability has not been taken in consideration. It is quite obvious that a reasonable filter-length is required to equalize successfully a propagation channel. An insufficient filter-length, therefore, introduces an additional distortion which have not been considered in Theorems 2 and 3. However, as mentioned in [3], the distortive effect of insufficient filter-length may easily be incorporated (in the EMSE expressions) as an additive term; the total EMSE, which we denote as TEMSE, is thus given as follows:

All simulation points were obtained by executing the program 10 times (or runs) with random and independent generation of transmitted data. Each run was executed for as many iterations as required for the convergence. Once convergence is acquired, the equalizer is run for further 5000 iterations for the computation of steady-state value of EMSE. In Fig. 10
                        , we depict analytical and simulated TEMSE obtained as a function of filter-length for the given step-sizes for both MMA2-2 and βMMA. Both analytical and simulated TEMSE are found to be in close agreement.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we studied the steady-state mean square tracking performance of two popular equalizers, MMA2-2 and βMMA, by exploiting the fundamental variance relation. Analytical expressions for the steady-state EMSE were evaluated and validated by computer simulations. For this study, we conclude the following:
                        
                           1.
                           The fundamental variance relation described in Section 3 is useful for the analysis of steady-state performance of (gradient-based) adaptive equalizers. By using this relation, we have been able to obtain the EMSE of MMA2-2 and βMMA in closed-form. We have validated our analytical findings under zero-forcing situation, stationary and non-stationary channel environments.


                              βMMA is superior to MMA2-2 equalizer in equalizing channel with square-QAM signaling. Under similar environmental conditions, the minimum EMSE of MMA2-2 is found to be in excess of 6–12dB as compared to that of βMMA.

The so-called total EMSE (TEMSE) has been found to be useful in determining the optimum lengths of the addressed equalizers for underlying channels and given values of step-sizes. Our experiments have indicated that the optimum lengths for MMA2-2 equalizer and βMMA equalizers for a typical (7-tap) voice-band are between 7 and 15 depending upon the step-size.
