@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

With the advancement in the field of information technology and medicine, there is an increasing demand for transmitting medical images over the public network [1,2]. Digital medical records provide efficient tool for diagnosis, surgery and treatment than any other mechanisms. For example, for critical diagnosis taking the organs or tissues outside the body and imaging them is really impossible. Medical imaging is the special technique of creating images of the human's interior organs. Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) provide the digitized storage and transmission of medical images [3,4]. DICOM is the widely preferred communication standard to support the standard interface between almost all the developed medical imaging modalities. Yet, it offers only limited security and the level of security is up to the modality manufacturers.

The conventional security mechanisms deployed in current medical systems are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA). Due to several intrinsic behaviours of DICOM, these traditional techniques are less efficient or take huge computational time to secure them. The intrinsic behaviours of medical image include (i) bulk pixel capacity, (ii) large data size, (iii) high correlation among pixels, (iv) high redundancy and (v) low resolution. To meet these security challenges various conventional security algorithms have been proposed by many researchers [5–9]. The fascinating relationships between chaos and cryptography have attracted many researchers to develop various encryption schemes based on 1-D and 2-D chaotic maps in the past two decades [10]. The interesting features like strong ergodicity, elevated randomness and high sensitivity to initial conditions have made the chao-cryptic system to be well suited for performing stronger image encryption [11–17]. The fusion of chaotic system and cryptography has evolved as the supreme solution for establishing secured medical image storage and transmission. Extensive research has been available for digital image encryption with chaotic cryptography but only few works have been reported with chaos based cryptosystem for securing medical images. Some of the major contributions are briefly reported below.

The first chaos based image encryption system was proposed by Fridrich et al. [18]. This work comprises two important modules namely, the confusion–diffusion or permutation–substitution units. According to the chaotic sequences generated, the pixel values are shuffled and modified in the confusion and diffusion units respectively. In [19], Shun Zhang et al. proposed a novel medical image encryption system based on hyperchaotic system. The generated chaotic sequences are iterated by Runge–Kutta algorithm to get the complete sequence necessary for encrypting the medical image. The cipher image is obtained by XORing the image pixels with the iterated hyperchaotic sequences. In [20], Sathish Kumar et al. suggested the dual chaos based medical image encryption algorithm, where the shuffling and scrambling are done through chaotic circular shifting. In [21], a tri layer cryptic system based on Latin square image cipher, Rubik's cube and discrete Gould transform has been designed to shuffle, scramble and authenticate the DICOM. This tri layer cryptic solution the resistance towards tamper proofing and brute force attack. In [22], true random numbers generated from the chaotic sequence are used to scramble the image pixels. This work is 100 times faster than the standard AES for scrambling medical images. In [23,24], chaotic cat maps are employed to scramble the image pixels. In [24], the Arnold cat map is utilized to strongly eliminate the correlation among adjacent pixels and logistic map plays a key role in confusing the pixels between plain and cipher image. In [23], the block based shuffling and masking are done to make the system immune against differential and brute force attacks. Though these schemes achieve better security compared with traditional encryption system, they are still inefficient to perform effective encryption. This is because of their non-uniform key distribution and limited erratic range of chaotic sequences [25–28]. In order to overcome these difficulties, many researchers have adapted higher dimensional chaotic maps [29–32]. In [29], the 3D chaotic map is employed to permute and diffuse the DICOM image pixels. In this work it can be seen that three or four variables are used for shuffling the image pixels in the plain image. This enhances the security against known/ chosen plain-text attack. Along with the increased security, the higher dimensional chaotic map increases the computational overhead. On the other side, the 1-D chaotic maps are easy and simple to implement [12,27,33–36].

By considering the pros and cons of 1D chaotic maps, some researchers have started their research on combining multiple 1D chaotic maps in single platform for generating effective random sequences. The combined chaotic system tends to overcome the disadvantages of 1D and higher order chaotic maps [37–45]. In [44], three 1D combined chaotic maps are proposed to achieve the tradeoff between computational cost and security. This system achieved better encryption results with reduced computational cost compared with higher order chaotic maps. In [38], the larger key space is achieved by combining complex Chen and complex Lorentz maps. In permutation phase, the combined maps shuffle the red, green and blue image pixels individually. Simple XOR operation alters the three plane pixels to make the system to achieve multilayer security. In [46], the two coupled logistic map scrambles the medical image. The scrambled DICOM is split into two components to generate the cipher image with noise distribution. In [45], the Combined Two dimensional Piecewise Nonlinear Chaotic map (CTPCM) is designed to scramble and mask the plain image.

Majority of the medical image encryption schemes have employed only single chaotic map for shuffling and diffusing the image pixels. The major advantages of combining multiple chaotic maps are (i) enlarged key space, (ii) elevated randomness, (iii) uniform key distribution, (iv) increased chaotic range. Hence, this work aims to propose a novel bio-inspired chao-cryptic encryption scheme based on combining two 1-D chaotic maps in single mechanism for encrypting the medical images. The proposed medical image encryption scheme comprises two phases namely, crossover and mutation. The crossover and mutation operations are performed based on the random sequences generated from combined chaotic maps.

The proposed scheme has used three 1D chaotic maps namely, logistic, tent and sine maps to perform crossover and mutation processes. The combination has made between logistic–tent and logistic–sine maps. This section provides the brief overview of three chaotic maps and their combinations. The mathematical representation of logistic map is,

The two control parameters make the system to behave chaotic in the entire region of (0,4]. 
                           Fig. 1(a–f) portrays the chaotic range achieved with logistic, sine and CLS maps for several iterations

From Fig. 1, it can be concluded that the combined map achieves elevated non-uniform distribution and enlarged chaotic range than individual maps for any number of iterations.

The implementation of bio-inspired chao-cryptic encryption algorithm is framed into two phases namely, crossover and mutation phases. The chaotic sequences generated from the new maps are quantified to shuffle and diffuse the DICOM image pixels. The system architecture of the proposed algorithm is shown in 
                        Fig. 2.

The choice of random seed plays the most crucial part in the field of chaos based security applications. The security of the encryption algorithm is directly proportional to the strength of key. In order to enhance the security, the proposed algorithm generates the random key sequences from the logistic map. The initial feed generator in Fig. 2 is the logistic map, whose initial value and control parameter are predefined by the user in the restricted range as given in Eq. (1). Let K1 and K2 and K3 and K4 be the random key sequences generated from the initial feed generator (logistic map). These random key streams are fed to the CLT and CLS system to generate the pseudo random chaotic sequences S1 and S2 and S3 and S4 respectively. The random key sequences S
                        1={S
                        11, S

                        1n
                        } and S
                        2={S
                        21, S
                        22,..S
                        2n} are quantized to Q
                        1={Q
                        11, Q
                        12,..Q
                        1n
                        } and Q

                        22,..Q
                        2n
                        } to accomplish the row and column crossover respectively. The quantized sequences Q
                        3={Q
                        31, Q

                        42,..Q
                        4n
                        } obtained from S
                        3={S
                        31, S
                        32,..S
                        3n

                        4={S

                        4n
                        } are used to mutate the pixels of binary decomposed crossover image.

In this process, the chaotic sequences generated from the CLT map are mapped to their corresponding positions in the sorted sequence. Consider a chaotic sequence generated from CLT system be S
                        1={S
                        11, S
                        12,..S
                        1n
                        } with initial seed K
                        1. The sequence S1 is sorted in ascending order to get the sorted sequence S
                        1’. This is followed by assigning weights to the elements in the sequence S
                        1’ based on their positions in sequence S
                        1 to complete the quantization. The weighted sequence represents the quantized result Q
                        1, which is the final keystream for crossing over the image pixels. The lengths of S
                        1 and S
                        2 are fixed to the size of image. For M×N image, the length of S
                        1 and S
                        2 are M and N respectively. The following example provides the clear explanation of the proposed quantization.
                           Example 1
                           Let the chaotic sequence generated by CLT be S
                              1={0.345, 0.987, 0.128, 0.867, 0.546, 0.21, 0.68, 0.378, 0.598, 0.437}. The sorted sequence in ascending order is S
                              1’={ 0.128, 0.21, 0.345, 0.378, 0.437, 0.546, 0.598, 0.68, 0.867, 0.987}. The mapped weight / corresponding quantized keystream is Q
                              1={ 3, 6, 1, 8, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 2}.

In general, crossover is a biological term which means the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes to generate the recombinant chromosomes. The proposed scheme has inherited the concept of crossover for image encryption. In image encryption, the terms chromosome, genetic materials, recombinant chromosome are replaced with plain image, image pixels and crossover/permuted image respectively. Similar to the exchange of genetic material (biological crossover), the pixels of image are exchanged to accomplish the image crossover.

The two quantized key streams Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 are responsible for interchanging the image pixels between row and column respectively. The successive elements in Q
                        1 and Q
                        2 indicate the corresponding row/column of the DICOM image. The pixel interchange is influenced by another parameter named cutoff point. In this work, the pixels are interchanged between any two cutoff points. Hence, irrespective of the size of image the minimum number of cutoff points chosen should be at least 2. The maximum number of cutoff points is determined by the following equation,

                        where L represents M for row crossover and N for column crossover. (Qij, Qi(j+1)) are the two successive elements in the key stream Qi={ Qij, Qi(j+1),….Qin}, where i={1 for row crossover; 2 for column crossover} and j={1,2,….n}. The cutoff points obtained from Eqs. (8)–(10) are sorted in ascending order and then paired. The pixels are interchanged between the two cutoff points in the pair within the two corresponding rows/columns. If both the elements in the pair are same, then that particular pair is rejected. For example: Let the sorted cutoff point sequence be CS ={3, 9, 9, 12, 13, 13, 13, 15}. Pairing has made between two successive elements in CS={(3,9) (9, 12) (13,13) (13 15)}. The pair (13,13) is rejected and the shuffling happens between (3,9), (9,12), (13,15). On the other hand, in the above example 9 appears twice in the sequence, but both the 9's are not rejected and the pixel interchange happens between 3 and 12 (which means (3,9),(9,12)). This is considered to avoid the problem of handling odd number of cutoff points. The following numerical example clearly depicts the above explanation of row crossover process.
                           Example 2
                           This example considers the keystream Q
                              1 from Example 1, where Q
                              1={3, 6, 1, 8, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 2} with size of image M=N=10 and let the number of cutoff points predefined by the user be Z=4. Here L=10 (size of row); i=j=1; Qij
                              =Q
                              11=3; Q
                              
                                 i(j+1)=Q
                              1(1+1)=6. From Eq. (8), the first cutoff point is C
                              1=max {1, (|3-6|) mod 10)} =3. Similarly, the remaining cutoff points can be derived from the Eq. (10) (C
                              2=6; C
                              3=9 and C
                              4=2). The sorted cutoff point sequence is C
                              S={2, 3, 6 and 9}. Now, the pixels in 3rd and 6th row are interchanged between the cutoff points 2 and 3 and 6 and 9. The pictorial representation of Example 2 is presented in 
                              
                              Figs. 3 and 4.


                        Figs. 3 and 4 depicts the simple crossover process with Examples 1 and 2. Once the pixel interchange is completed between the pair (Qij, Qi(j+1)) (i.e., (3,6) of Q1 from Example 1), the next pair (Qi(j+1), Qi(j+2)) (i.e., (6,1) from Q1) will be selected for the next process. This will be continued till the pointer reaches the end of Qi. In similar fashion, once the row crossover is completed with Q1, column crossover starts shuffling the pixels with key stream Q2.

The image is scrambled with different cutoff points and the Peak to Signal Ratio (PSNR) is calculated between the original and the scrambled image at each stage of crossover (row and column). 
                        Fig. 5 shows the PSNR plot against various cutoff points at the two stages of crossover. From Fig. 5, one can observe that the PSNR value is decreased with increasing the number of cutoff points. Increasing the number of cutoff points improves the scrambling effect and hence increases the visual difference between the original and crossed over image.


                        
                        
                        Figs. 6(a–g) and 7(a–g) display the crossover effect of test image by varying the cutoff points at row and column crossover stages respectively.

In general, mutation refers to the permanent damage or change occurring at the genomic level of any organism. In image encryption mutation refers to the sudden and permanent change occurring at the pixel level of an image. This unit utilizes two quantized key streams generated from CLT map Q
                        3 and Q
                        4. The size of Q
                        3 and Q
                        4 are restricted to the size of image M×N. The process starts with the binary decomposition of DICOM image. The proposed work has used six 16bit depth DICOM images to study the performance of developed algorithm. Initially the 16bit image I is decomposed into two 8bit depth images I1 and I2 of same size as shown in 
                        Fig. 8.

The chaotic sequences (S
                        3 and S
                        4) generated from the CLS system are reshaped to the size same as images I1 and I2. The reshaped sequences are then quantized to mutate the permuted image. The individual element value of Q
                        3 are restricted to 0 to 255 by following the equation,

The overall encryption process is described as follows:


                        Step 1: Iterate Eqs. (5) and (6) to generate the chaotic sequences S
                        1, S
                        2 and S3, S
                        4 respectively. For M×N image, length of S
                        1 and S
                        2 are M and N respectively and the size of S
                        3 and S
                        4=M×N.


                        Step 2: Use quantization method to quantize the chaotic sequences S
                        1, S
                        2, S
                        3 and S
                        4 to key streams Q
                        1, Q
                        2, Q
                        3 and Q
                        4 as shown in Example 1.


                        Step 3: Set the number of cutoff points and perform row and column cross over operation with key streams Q
                        1 and Q
                        2. Iterate this step three times with different cutoff points to get the crossover image.


                        Step 4: Perform bit level binary decomposition to each and every pixel of 16bit depth image I from step 3 to generate two 8bit depth images I1 and I2 of same size as I.


                        Step 5: Perform mutation process by XORing the matrices Q
                        3, Q
                        4 with I1, I2 respectively. Finally concatenate the mutated images to complete the encryption process.


                        Step 6: Iterate the processes from step 3 to step 5 for 3 times to get the completely encrypted image.


                        Step 7: Decryption is done in the reverse fashion of encryption. 
                        Fig. 10(a–c) shows the result of encryption and decryption.

In order to analyze and validate the performance of proposed algorithm various analyses such as statistical, differential, key space, key sensitivity, cropping attack, chosen plaintext attack and complexity analysis are extensively carried out in this section.

Statistical analysis is the most important analysis technique to prove the robustness of the proposed algorithm against numerous statistical attacks. This analysis can be validated by estimating the histogram of cipher image and correlation coefficient among adjacent pixels of cipher image in various directions.

Image histogram is the graphical representation of pixel distribution of an image by plotting the number of pixels at each grayscale level. The randomness of the proposed algorithm can be validated through flat and uniformly distributed histogram. From the obtained histograms, one can observe that the histogram of the cipher image is uniformly distributed and totally different from the plain image (
                           Fig. 12).

The uniformity of histogram is assessed with the help of chi-square (χ2) test. 
                           Table 1 summarizes the result of χ2 test for various cipher images. From Table 1, it is clear that the proposed algorithm accepts the null hypothesis and the p-values are greater than 0.05 (5% significance) for the cipher images and proves the uniformity of histogram. Hence it is evident that the redundancy of plain images is completely concealed which confirmed the failure of statistical attack.

It is well known fact that the correlation between the adjacent pixels of an informative image is high in any direction. Due to the contradictory nature of cipher image, its correlation coefficient should be very low or nearer to zero to withstand various statistical attacks. The graphical representation of correlation analysis is done by plotting pixel gray values between adjacent pixels in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. The correlation analysis of plain image, cross over image and mutated/ cipher image in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions are shown in 
                           Fig. 13(a–i).

The correlation values between a pixel and its neighbouring pixel can be estimated using the formula,

                           Table 2. From Table 2, it is clear that the correlation coefficient of cipher image is little or very closer to zero. This proves that the proposed algorithm has successfully broken the correlation between adjacent pixels in all directions.

For a random image with 2N symbols, the maximum entropy is N. If this entropy value turns less than N then there exists some amount of predictability which threatens the security of proposed system. However, this global entropy measure fails to predict the true randomness of the cipher image [50]. In order to capture the true randomness, Wu et al. have proposed the modified Shannon entropy measure named ‘local Shannon entropy’ [50]. This new entropy measure overcomes the weaknesses of global entropy by computing the local entropy of randomly selected non-overlapping blocks. The global as well as local entropy of the four test images and their corresponding cipher images are listed in 
                           Table 3. From Table 3, the entropy of all the cipher images is very close to the theoretical value 8 (7.9993≈8). This means that the proposed algorithm has no predictability or the cipher information source generated is highly random.

Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Change in Intensity (UACI) are the two most important parameters to measure the resistance of developed algorithm against differential attacks. This analysis can be made by observing the relationship between two cipher images, one obtained from the normal image and another from single pixel changed plain image. NPCR measures the minimum number of pixels altered and UACI measures the average difference between the two cipher images C1 and C2. NPCR and UACI are calculated using the following Eqs.

The mean values of NPCR and UACI for 16bit depth DICOM images are estimated as 99.9984% and 33.3338% respectively. Similarly the variances of NPCR and UACI for 256×256 and 512×512 medical images are estimated as 0.00152, 0.00076 and 0.09206, 0.04603 respectively [51]. The values of NPCR and UACI for various test DICOM images are listed in 
                        
                        Tables 4 and 5 respectively.

From Tables 4 and 5, the observational values of NPCR and UACI are very close to the optimal values, which proves the capability of proposed algorithm to withstand differential attacks.

A good encryption algorithm should have larger key space to make the brute force attack infeasible. Since the proposed algorithm has fused three chaotic maps in two combinations, parameters for generating secret key are ultimately increased. The proposed chao-cryptic scheme has utilized four different key sets to perform entire crossover and mutation. The initial key sets K

                        1,

                        2, 
                        ρ
                        2, µ
                        2} for crossover and K

                        3,

                        1, µ

                        2} for mutation are set to the precision of 14 decimal points, then the key space of the developed algorithm will be 10168 which is huger than 2128. This proves the key space of the proposed scheme is large enough to resist brute force attack than existing schemes [47].

Keys are the most significant building elements of any cryptosystem. This analysis is the most important to estimate the sensitivity of the keys which in turn measures the strength of developed algorithm. For an effectively encrypted system, the slight change in any one of the key sets should result in completely undesired output.

                        Fig. 14(b–d) represents the images obtained from decrypting the encrypted image (Fig. 14(a)) with key sets Kw1, Kw2, Kw3. From Fig. 14, it can be seen that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive to slight changes in encryption and decryption keys.

In real time applications, the hackers may intentionally crop the part of encrypted image when they are transmitted through the public channel. In this section some part of the encrypted image is intentionally cropped and the decryption algorithm is applied to the cropped cipher image to study the immune power of developed algorithm against intentional cropping. The intentional cropping on the encrypted image and the corresponding decrypted images are shown in 
                        Fig. 15(a–d) and (e–h). From Fig. 15, it is evident that the proposed algorithm has the ability to recover the meaningful image even after the intentional cropping.

It is well known fact that once the system has immunity to withstand chosen plaintext attack it can also withstand known plaintext/cipher text attack. Once the cryptanalyst gains access to the existing encryption algorithm, he can choose the plain image and may duplicate the encrypted image. This weakness may provide the chance for the attackers to break the encryption system through chosen plaintext attack. The immunity of the developed encryption system against this attack can be explained with 
                        Fig. 16(a–f). With the same set of key and plain image the developed algorithm tend to generate different cipher images when repeated with different rounds. Two cipher images obtained by varying the number of rounds using the same set of key, plain image and algorithm are shown in Fig. 16(a and b). The difference image (Fig. 16(c)) proves that the two cipher images obtained by varying the round operation are completely different. This ensures the ability of the proposed algorithm to withstand chosen plaintext attack and known plaintext/cipher text attack.

The computational cost of encryption algorithm depends on both the crossover and mutation operations. The analysis is performed in comparison with Xu et al. and Zhou et al. works [48,49]. The time consuming part of the proposed algorithm is the pixel shuffling part in the crossover unit. The number of floating point operations required by the crossover unit for the construction of chaotic sequences in the CLT system are approximately M×N. The total number of pixel shuffling operations required to complete the row and column crossover are O{ Z×[(M−1)+(N−1)]}. More accurately, the mutation unit consumes 2×M×N floating point operations for the construction of chaotic sequences in the CLS system. The number of XOR operations required for mutating the image pixels are 2×M×N.

Comparing with the number of floating point operations in Xu et al. and Zhou et al. works, the proposed algorithm is faster since the number of floating point operation used in the permutation process is reduced in 8 times. The number of swapping operation in the proposed algorithm (O{ Z×[(M−1)+(N−1)]}) is better than Xu et al. (8×M×N) and Zhou et al. (8(8×M×N)) works. The algorithm can be made more complex with increasing the O and Z. At the same time, if the algorithm needed to be executed in short span of time with sufficient security, it can be achieved by reducing O and Z. Hence, the proposed algorithm is well suited for all real time security applications.

Experiments are carried out in MATLAB R2012a in a system with Intel Core i3 2.40GHz and 4GB RAM. The throughput of the proposed encryption scheme is 2.51Mb/s, which means the proposed scheme has taken 0.416612s for encrypting a 16bit depth 256×256 DICOM image. The encryption speed of the developed algorithm is far greater than Pareek et al., Kanso et al., Zhou et al., and Xu et al., works [8,23,48,49]. The comparison of the proposed work in terms of encryption speed with the available methods is portrayed in 
                        Fig. 17.

This section covers the performance comparison of the proposed algorithm on the presented results (under Section 3) with the available methods [8,19,21,23,24,47–49]. 
                     Table 6 provides the comparison analysis in terms of correlation coefficients, NPCR, UACI and entropy.

                           From Table 6, it can be concluded that the proposed chaotic based cryptosystem achieves desirable level of security with highly optimal values than the available methods in the literature [19,21,24,47]. Thus, this work owns comparatively elusive capability of defying statistical and differential attacks.

From Section 3.7, it can be concluded that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is far better than those developed by Xu et al. and Zhou et al. [48,49]. Also the presented encryption algorithm faster than Pareek et al., Kanso et al., Zhou et al., and Xu et al., works [8,23,48,49].

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A novel medical image encryption scheme has proposed based on Fridrich's structure of combined chaotic map system. This chao-cryptic system has successfully employed a bio-inspired crossover and mutation process to confuse and diffuse the DICOM image pixels. Various techniques have been used in the paper to analyze and validate the security and complexity of the developed scheme, including statistical, differential, key space, key sensitivity, intentional cropping attack and chosen plaintext attack analysis. Further the validated results are compared with the available methods in the literature. The experimental results have proved the proposed DICOM cryptosystem achieved a desirable amount of protection for real time medical image security applications. In future, the proposed algorithm will be implemented on reconfigurable hardware to achieve high degree of parallelism with tamper resistant image encryption platform.
