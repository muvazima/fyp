                  Copulas offer a useful tool in modelling the dependence among random variables. In the literature, most of the existing copulas are symmetric while data collected from the real world may exhibit asymmetric nature. This necessitates developing asymmetric copulas that can model such data. In the meantime, existing methods of modelling two-dimensional reliability data are not able to capture the tail dependence that exists between the pair of age and usage, which are the two dimensions designated to describe product life. This paper proposes a new method of constructing asymmetric copulas, discusses the properties of the new copulas, and applies the method to fit two-dimensional reliability data that are collected from the real world.

@&#MOTIVATION@&#

Copulas are a tool for constructing multivariate distributions and formalising the dependence structures between random variables. The notion of copula was first introduced by Abe Sklar in 1959 when he responded to a question with respect to the relationship between a multidimensional probability function and its lower dimensional margins (Sklar, 1959). It has attracted considerable attention in recent years in both theoretical and application aspects.

Sklar’s Theorem states that any cumulative distribution function of a random vector can be written in terms of marginal distribution functions and a copula that describes the dependence structure between the variables (Sklar, 1959). That is, given a vector of random variables

                         as a copula (Sklar, 1959). Copulas are useful in statistical applications because they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of a random vector through estimating the marginals and the copula separately.

In the literature, many parametric copula families have been proposed (Joe, 1996; Nelsen, 1999). Most of them are symmetric in the sense that the variables in a copula are exchangeable,

                        ) for the bivariate copula case, for example. However, there are many natural processes that possess asymmetric dependence structures. Using symmetric copulas to model such processes may not be able to capture the nature of the data. This necessitates developing asymmetric copulas. This paper serves this necessity by developing a method of constructing asymmetric copulas.

There are many copula families. The reader is referred to the monographs by Joe (1996) and Nelsen (1999) for detailed accounts of the theory and surveys of commonly used copulas and to the review papers (Embrechts, 2009; Genest, Remillard, & Beaudoin, 2009; Kolev, Dos Anjos, & Mendes, 2006), work on tail dependence (Hua & Joe, 2011; Zhang, 2008), and papers on applications (Grundke & Polle, 2012; Ye, Liu, & Miao, 2012).

Some work has been done for constructing asymmetric copulas ((Alfonsi & Brigo, 2005; Liebscher, 2008), for example). Alfonsi and Brigo (2005) described a method based on periodic functions. Liebscher (2008) introduced two methods to construct asymmetric multivariate copulas: the first is connected with products of copulas and the second generalises the Archimedean copulas, and the resulting copulas are asymmetric. However, their research did not show how those methods can be used to construct asymmetric copulas with tail dependence in a given direction.

Estimating reliability functions is important for both product manufacturers and asset managers. System reliability is usually estimated based on one dimension, either usage (for example, the number of door openings of an elevator, the number of pages copied by a copy machine) or age. In reality, however, failures or other adverse events in systems may depend on both the age and the usage history of the systems. Such examples can be found in warranty claim data analysis, in which the warranty policy for certain types of products specifies the limits of coverage in terms of both age and usage. For example, a sold car may be covered by a 3year and 30,000 mile warranty, which implies that the warranty supplier—which is usually the manufacturer—will repair the car if it fails within the warranty coverage. It is important for the manufacturer to estimate the reliability of their products for the purpose of product improvement and fiscal planning. There is considerable research on warranty data analysis. For more detailed discussion, the reader is referred to recently published review papers (Wu, 2012, 2013) and papers on reliability data analysis (see (Anastasiadis, Anderson, & Chukova, 2013; Wu & Akbarov, 2011, 2012), for example).

There are three methods that have been developed for analysing two-dimensional reliability data. Those methods are briefed below.

In addition to the above two methods, Gertsbakh and Kordonsky (1998) proposed a method that integrates the two scales (age and usage) to create a single composite scale and failures are modelled as a counting process.

However, the above methods have the following drawbacks.
                              
                                 •
                                 Both the univariate and the time scale methods assume a relationship, for example, a linear relationship, between the usage and the age, and then derive a bivariate joint lifetime distribution. A drawback of those two methods is apparent because such an assumption may be violated.

Compared with the univariate method and the time scale method, the bivariate method is simpler and more straightforward, in the sense that the former two methods need two steps: first to estimate the relationship between age and usage and then estimate a joint distribution, but the bivariate method needs only one step that directly estimates a joint distribution. When the bivariate method is utilised, however, one needs to select a bivariate distribution in which the two variables are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the usage is measured as a discrete random variable (the number of pages copied by a copy machine, for example) and the age is described as a continuous random variable, to find a bivariate distribution that combines a discrete marginal with a continuous marginal may be difficult.

In addition to the above two drawbacks, an important fact has never been addressed in the existing literature so far. This fact is the existence of the tail dependence between age and usage, as explained below.
                                       
                                          (a)
                                          If the age of the product is small, its usage should be small. This is because the age is the calendar time and it is not possible to develop large cumulative usage within a short period of the calendar time. Another reason is due to the operating limit, for example, a car usually cannot be driven faster than 100 miles per hour, hence the usage within a time interval is limited.

If the age is large, on the other hand, the usage can be small. For example, some cars are not frequently used. Hence, although they are very old, their mileage can be very small.

Those two points (a) and (b) can also be observed from Fig. 1
                           , which is a scatterplot with the age on the X-axis and the usage on the Y-axis of the warranty claims of a particular model of car. The data are collected from a car manufacturer. As can be seen, there is no observation in the left-upper region in the figure (marked with the ellipse), which agrees with point (a). But there are some observations in the right-lower region in the figure (marked with the star), which agrees with point (b).

The above two points (a) and (b) can also be observed in those warranty data illustrated in Fig. 2 of Alam and Suzuki (2009) and in Fig. 2 of Rai and Singh (2004).

This paper proposes a new method to construct asymmetric copulas and then applies the method to model two-dimensional reliability data. Its contribution is summarised in the following.

                              It proposes a new method of constructing asymmetric copulas and a convex-combination of asymmetric copulas that can exhibit different tail dependence along different directions.

It is the first paper to use asymmetric copulas to model the lifetime distribution on two-dimensional reliability data.

The proposed method has the following merits.
                           
                              
                                 Ability to handle tail dependence. The proposed method of construction of asymmetric copulas differs from other existing methods in the sense that it can directly construct a copula with tail dependence in a given direction.


                                 No limitation on the form of the marginal distributions. With copulas, one can select whichever two distributions to combine with in modelling reliability data, which can overcome the difficulty of selection of bivariate distributions, this is especially true for the case when the variables (age and usage, for example) come from different parametric families (one of a discrete random variables and one of a continuous random variable, for example).

The paper has important managerial implications. Derivation of the lifetime distribution for systems is important for both product manufacturers and users (Wu, 2012, 2013).
                           
                              •
                              For the product manufacturers, product warranty has become increasingly more important in consumer and commercial transactions and is widely used to serve many different purposes as the US Congress has enacted several acts (UCC, Magnusson Moss Act, Tread Act, etc.) over the last 100years and the European Union (EU) passed legislation requiring a two-year warranty for all products sold in Europe. The proposed method to estimate the lifetime distribution for the products under two-dimensional warranty can be beneficial to the manufacturers in estimating product reliability and forecasting future warranty claims needed for preparing warranty reserves plans.

For product users, the proposed method can be used in their life cycle performance analysis or asset management.

Although this paper is developed using examples borrowed from reliability theory, its results and discussion can also be applied to any situations when random variables exhibit an asymmetric relationship. Such applications can be found in other disciplines. For example, the proposed method can be used to model the flow velocity and the wind speed (Vijverberg, Winterwerp, Aarninkhof, & Drost, 2011).

@&#OVERVIEW@&#

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of copulas, dependence measures, and asymmetric copulas. More importantly, it introduces a method of constructing asymmetric copulas, studies the properties of the constructed copulas, and then applies the method of constructing asymmetric copulas to the bivariate copula case. Section 3 discusses the existing methods of modelling two-dimensional reliability data, proposes two required conditions for modelling two-dimensional warranty data, and then compares the performance of the proposed method to two existing methods based on warranty data collected from a car manufacturer. Section 4 concludes the findings of this work and suggests our future work.

In this section, we introduce the concept of the copula and tail dependence coefficient, and study the properties of the proposed copulas.

Tail dependence coefficients provide useful information of the properties of the conditional probabilities of extreme values. Loosely speaking, the tail dependence coefficients describes the limiting property that one margin exceeds a certain threshold given that the other margin has already exceeded that threshold. For example, the lower tail dependence coefficient is the conditional probability that random vector

                        , then the tail dependence coefficient in the (k-lower, i-upper) direction and that in the (k-upper, i-lower) direction are equal. This poses a problem that such a copula cannot fit data exhibiting unequal tail dependence in the two directions (see the end of Section 1.2.2 for a data example). To overcome this drawback, we introduce a method of constructing asymmetric copulas in the following section.

                         is its capability of capturing the tail dependence. As such, we can conclude that the method of construction of asymmetric copulas introduced in Theorem 1 differs from the Liebscher’s method in Liebscher (2008) from the following aspects. The single-dimensional asymmetry method constructs copulas that present the asymmetric property in one variable (variable k in Theorem 1, for example), whereas the Liebscher’s method constructs copulas that may have the asymmetric property in all of the variables. Of course, when 
                           
                              d

                        , such difference does not exist.

As above-mentioned, the bivariate method used in modelling reliability data needs to select a bivariate distribution in which the two variables are positively correlated. Copulas provide a natural way to study and measure dependence between random variables. Linear correlation (or Pearsons correlation) is most frequently used in practice as a measure of dependence. The Kendall’s tau and the Spearmans rho provide the perhaps best alternatives to the linear correlation coefficient as a measure of dependence for nonelliptical distributions (Nelsen, 1999), for which the linear correlation coefficient is inappropriate and often misleading (Embrechts, Lindskog, & McNeil, 2003). For example, the Kendall’s tau of the Clayton copula in (1) and that of the Gumbel copula defined in (2) are

Many bivariate distribution models have been proposed to model two-dimensional reliability data (see (Gertsbakh & Kordonsky, 1998; Jung & Bai, 2007; Lawless et al., 2009), for example). It can be easily checked that some bivariate distributions cannot capture the existence of the upper-lower or the lower–upper tail dependence. Below we analyse the one proposed in reference (Jung & Bai, 2007) as an example.

                        Jung and Bai (2007) claimed that some bivariate distributions may not be appropriate for modelling the two-dimensional failure data; the two variables should be positively correlated. One may interpret the positive correlation as the Kendall’s tau or the Spearman’s rho being positive.

                        , which implies that this copula can capture the unequal tail dependence along the lower-lower tail and the upper-upper tail, but it is unable capture the unequal tail dependence along the lower–upper tail or the upper-lower tail.

Compared with the marginal method proposed in Lawless, Hu, and Cao (1995) and the time-scale method (Gertsbakh & Kordonsky, 1998), Jung and Bai’s method (Jung & Bai, 2007) has its merits as it is simple to use and directly fits a bivariate distribution. Their method, however, has the following drawbacks:
                           
                              •
                              The selection of the age distribution and the usage distribution to form a bivariate distribution may be hard. For example, it is not easy to find a bivariate distribution with a discrete marginal and a continuous marginal.

As shown from the above analysis, their method cannot capture the asymmetric along the upper-lower tail dependency or the lower–upper tail dependency.

With copulas, the above drawbacks can be overcome. In the next section, we fit two-dimensional reliability data with such a copula.

In this section, we fit three copulas to a two-dimensional warranty claim data.

In warranty management, product manufacturers can only collect warranty claim data on those products whose warranty is claimed. Product performance is not known on those sold products whose warranty is not claimed, or those data are censored.

3466 car warranty claims were collected from a car manufacturer. In those observations, the warranty of 2289 cars were claimed within 36months or 30,000 miles and the rest 1177 cars were not claimed.

In the literature, there are some models, including the generalised Pareto distribution, the lognormal distribution, and the Weibull distribution, that were proposed as the marginal distributions for two-dimensional reliability modelling. We have tried to fit those distributions on the data and found that using the Weibull distribution as the marginals yields the smallest AIC (Akaike information criterion). As such, the Weibull distribution is adopted as the marginals. Denote

We estimate the parameters of the above three models based on the original dataset (with 3466 observations), and obtain the following parameters. From Table 1
                           , it can be seen that Model 1 outperforms Model 2 and Model 3 as the AIC value of Model 1 (i.e., 30945.30) is smaller than those of Models 2 and 3.

Furthermore, in order to compare model performance on datasets with different samples, we build models on the following three cases of datasets. We randomly sample 500, 1500, and 3000 observations from the original dataset, which creates three datasets, denoted as

                           . To reduce the uncertainty caused by the random sampling, we further sample with replacement for 20 times from each of the three datasets. This creates 20 datasets with sample size

                                 (a)
                                 As can be seen from the last two columns, Model 1, which is the model proposed in this paper, always outperforms the other two models as it has the smallest AIC. Model 2 is the second best model, and Model 3 performs the worst.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper introduced a new method to construct asymmetric copulas. This method has the merit that it can construct asymmetric copulas with tail dependence of given directions. Using the proposed copula, the paper proposed a novel method to model two dimensional reliability data. It then tested the proposed method based on a warranty dataset collected from a car manufacturer. It was shown that the proposed method outperformed two existing modelling methods.

Our future work aims to construct asymmetric copulas that possess other types of dependence, for example, to reflect the probability of the extreme values of a subset of random variables. Another possible research focus is to investigate the use of nonparametric or semiparametric copulas in reliability data modelling.
