                  In a new approach based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), field heart rate (HR) measurements were used to classify work rate into four categories: very light, light, moderate, and heavy. Inter-participant variability (physiological and physical differences) was considered. Twenty-eight participants performed Meyer and Flenghi's step-test and a maximal treadmill test, during which heart rate and oxygen consumption (

The ANFIS classifier showed superior sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared to current practice using established work rate categories based on percent heart rate reserve (%HRR). The ANFIS classifier showed an overall 29.6% difference in classification accuracy and a good balance between sensitivity (90.7%) and specificity (95.2%) on average. With its ease of implementation and variable measurement, the ANFIS classifier shows potential for widespread use by practitioners for work rate assessment.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Despite the global trend towards mechanization, many industries, such as forestry, construction, and mining, still entail physically demanding labor. Excessive physical work demands are the main cause of undue fatigue, which affects workers and leads to lower work performance and quality (Abdelhamid, 1999). Studies have suggested that understanding the physical demands of work is key to protecting safety and health in the workplace and enhancing productivity (Brouha, 1967; Chengalur et al., 2004). Work physiology researchers have underscored the importance of assessing the physiological demands of physical activity, and have fostered the use of categorical scales to measure work rate (e.g., light, moderate, and heavy), with several applications, such as thermal stress assessment (ACGIH, 2009; ISO, 20089, 2008).

There are three main methods for classifying work rate (Table 1
                     ). The first one is based on energy expenditure, which can be assessed indirectly by measuring oxygen consumption (

This method is costly, invasive, and time-consuming, and it requires sophisticated equipment (Smolander et al., 2008). In the second method, work rate is classified based on variables that can be linearly related to

                     , such as heart rate (HR) (Grandjean, 1980). Although this method is considered one of the most practical and useful methods, HR monitoring alone lacks accuracy due to high inter-participant variability (Melanson and Freedson, 1996; Valanou et al., 2006). A third method recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1996) uses the relative oxygen consumption or percentage of maximal oxygen consumption (%

                     ) to classify work rate. This method has been demonstrated accurate and is considered the gold standard for classifying work rate (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1996); Haskell and Pollock, 1996; Pollock et al., 1998). For practical applications, several studies have recommended using the percent heart rate reserve (%HRR = 100 × (HR – HRrest) ÷ (HRmax – HRrest)) to estimate %

                      (Haskell and Pollock, 1996; Pollock et al., 1998; American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), 2014). The %HRR is calculated by estimating the maximal heart rate (HRmax), widely computed as 220 – age (Fox et al., 1971; Londeree and Moeschberger, 1982; McArdle et al., 1996; Tanaka et al., 2001; Robergs and Landwehr, 2002).

Today, there is a need for practical and reliable field methods for assessing and classifying work rate. They should use easily measured physical and physiological variables, such as HR, and they should account for inter-participant variability. They should also allow dealing with the uncertainty and vagueness inherent in the human physiological system and in various work environments. In recent years, a number of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been proposed as alternatives to conventional statistical methods (Kaya et al., 2003; Yildirim and Bayramoglu, 2006). One of the most effective AI techniques, particularly for nonlinear function approximation and pattern recognition (classification), is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It combines the unique ability of fuzzy logic to make decisions in uncertain conditions with the learning and adaptive capabilities of artificial neural networks. The strength of ANFIS in real life applications is that it works well with small datasets (Montiel et al., 2009; Siow-Wee et al., 2010; Dom et al., 2012) and it does not depend on the assumptions required by conventional statistical methods, such as data normality and independence (Hillenbrand, 2004; Schoemaker, 2006; Shrestha et al., 2007). ANFIS has consistently been demonstrated effective in solving classification problems, particularly in biomedical engineering (Güler and Übeyli, 2004, 2005; Übeyli and Güler, 2005a, 2005b). In addition, ANFIS has been considered a powerful tool in handling the uncertainty that characterizes human physiological and nervous systems (Shimizu and Jindo, 1995; Park and Han, 2004; Petkovic and Cojbasic, 2012; Petkovic et al., 2013).

Since use of ANFIS does not require individual calibration, this approach proved to be very cost effective and time efficient from a practitioner's point of view.

The main objective of the present study is to develop a practical approach to classifying work rate using variables that account for inter-participant variability and can be measured easily in actual workplaces. This study presents a new ANFIS-based classifier that uses HR and physical characteristics to classifying work rate. The developed classifier is composed of four ANFIS models, each of which was trained to classify work rate in to one of the four categories: very light (VL), light (L), moderate (M), and heavy (H). The individual models were then combined into an integrated ANFIS classifier (hereinafter, the classifier) that classifies work rate into the four categories.

@&#METHODS@&#

This research was based on a laboratory study in which participants performed a submaximal step-test and a maximal treadmill test. All participants' data was used to identify potential variables associated with work rate. Then, part of the data (approximately 70%) was used to develop the ANFIS classifier and the remaining data was used to test it and compare its performance to the %HRR classification method.

A total of 28 healthy men aged from 20 to 45 years participated in the study (Table 2
                        ). Participants had to pass the pre-activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) before being accepted for the study (Chisholm et al., 1975; Shephard, 1988). No participants were competitive athletes, and none regularly used medication. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Polytechnique Montréal. All participants signed a written informed consent form prior to partaking in the study.

All participants performed the Meyer and Flenghi (1995) step-test, which has the following advantages: simple, cost-effective, and practical, it can be implemented safely without imposing high cardiac strain, particularly for older and less active individuals. Imbeau et al. (2010) demonstrated that the highest exertion level on this test reached by a group of forest workers corresponded well to the exertion generally measured during typical regeneration release work. This step-test has been validated against other graded submaximal exertion tests (Meyer and Flenghi, 1995) and against a maximal treadmill test (Imbeau et al., 2009). An additional advantage is that step frequency (15 steps per min paced with a metronome) is sufficiently low for any worker to be able to keep pace at all four step heights, for superior overall test precision and robustness. The equipment consists of a lightweight portable bench with a height-adjustable step (11.5, 21.5, 31.5, and 41.5 cm). After a 5-min sitting rest to obtain the resting heart rate (HRrest), participants were asked to stand in front of the bench for 2 min. The test started with the participant stepping onto and off the lowest step height for 3 min, followed by a short, 30-s standing rest in front of the bench while the experimenter increased the step height by sliding the step out of the lowest set of tracks and into the second-height tracks. This 3.5-min cycle was then repeated for the three remaining step heights.

Participants also performed a maximal multistage treadmill test (Model Q45S90, Quinton Instruments, Bothell, WA, USA) to determine maximal cardiorespiratory fitness (

The test began with a 5-min warming up period followed by a brief rest.

                         and breath rate (BR) were continuously measured and monitored during all tests using an automated metabolic cart (MOXUS Metabolic System, AEI Technologies, Napierville, IL, USA) and a Polar transmitter belt (T-61 coded, Polar Electro, Finland), and were averaged at 30-s intervals by the metabolic cart. Prior to each test, the flowmeter and the gas sensors of the Moxus metabolic cart were calibrated by a qualified technician according to manufacturer's specifications. During the step-tests, HR was monitored to ensure it remained below 85% of the participant's age-predicted HRmax (Fox et al., 1971). Whenever this point was reached, the test was terminated. The complete Meyer and Flenghi (1995) test lasted 21 min, after which participants took a sitting rest until heart rate returned to resting before conducting the maximal treadmill test. Imbeau et al. (2009) showed that the Meyer and Flenghi (1995) step-test administrated prior to the treadmill test does not affect the results on the latter when conducted in this sequence. This is coherent with the aim of Meyer and Flenghi (1995), who designed the test so as not to induce undue fatigue, which could place a worker at risk if the test were administrated at the beginning of a physical work shift.

In general, to develop a classifier, data are clustered using a subtractive clustering algorithm, the clusters are converted to initial fuzzy rules, and the fuzzy rules are then optimized using ANFIS (Chiu, 1994, 1997). In this study, for the subtractive clustering, the data on all participants were first separated into groups according to their respective category (based on %

                        max) such that each group was associated with a work rate category (VL, L, M, or H). A data sample was represented by a vector in the input space (e.g., HR during activity, HRmax, HRrest, and body weight). A clustering algorithm was then applied separately to all data samples belonging to each group to identify cluster centers, each of which was converted to a fuzzy rule for identifying the associated category. Each set of fuzzy rules forms an initial fuzzy inference system (FIS) associated with that category. In order to increase the classification accuracy of each FIS, the initial parameters of that FIS must be optimized. The need to automatically fine-tune the FIS parameters is the main motivation for incorporating artificial neural networks, and hence the development of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for identifying each category. More details about ANFIS can be found in Güler and Übeyli (2004, 2005) and Yildiz et al. (2009).

In this study, a three-step approach was used to develop the classifier (Fig. 1
                        ). First, significant input variables were selected using the whole dataset (including the 28 participants). Next, an ANFIS classifier was developed (with the selected input variables) using a training dataset of 20 randomly selected participants. This classifier was then tested using a test dataset for the remaining eight participants. Initially, 42 data samples were collected from each participant. However, since data quality (i.e., precisely belonging to a specific work rate category) is extremely important in classifier development, the raw data were refined by removing noise and redundancy. For instance, because the rest period at the beginning of the step-test (step 0) was considered well representative of the VL category, data collected in rest periods between steps and at the end of the step-test were removed. In addition, because they did not well represent the associated work rate, data collected just after rest periods (at the beginning and between steps of the step-test) were removed. Although participants were given specific instructions on how to perform the step-test, they sometimes found it difficult to remain calm in rest periods and maintain the correct pace during the step-test, resulting in irrelevant data. Furthermore, some technical problems resulted in inaccurate measurements of HR or

The refined dataset comprised 304 data samples in the VL category, 277 in the L category, 122 in the M category, and 43 in the H category. The classifier was developed using the fuzzy logic toolbox provided in MATLAB (version 7.5.0).

The first step in developing the ANFIS classifier was to identify the set of input variables that play a significant role in work rate classification. A set of all possible (potential) physical and physiological variables that affect the human physiological system was identified through a review of the scientific literature. Of these, significant variables were then determined by analyzing the participants' data using the backward selection procedure proposed by Chiu (1997).

From the literature review, eight potential input variables were identified: HR during activity (Christensen, 1964; AIHA, 1971; Astrand and Rodahl, 1977), HRmax (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1996); ACSM, 2014), %HRmax (Panton et al., 1996; Dalleck and Kravitz, 2006; Binder et al., 2012), BR (Pulkkinen et al., 2004; Firstbeat Technologies Ltd., 2007), physical fitness (Skinner and Jankowski, 1974; Londeree and Ames, 1976; Rotstein and Meckel, 2000), which may be partly determined by HRrest (Davis and Convertino, 1975; Panton et al., 1996), body weight, and BMI (Greenberg et al., 1995; Health Reviser, 2010; Hoeger and Hoeger, 2012). However, the results in the literature are contradictory on whether age has a significant (Panton et al., 1996) or negligible (Hellerstein, 1973; Franklin et al., 1980) impact on work rate assessment.

                           max variability within each step was then investigated in order to determine its relative importance. This was achieved by dividing the data into two groups based on age (older vs. young). Participants aged from 40 to 45 years were considered older, and those from 20 to 30 years were considered young (Heyward, 1998). An independent-sample t-test was performed to detect significant differences in step mean %

                           max between step heights. The next step was to determine the significant physical and physiological variables using backward selection (Chiu, 1996). An initial fuzzy classifier incorporating all potential input variables (HR during activity, HRmax (estimated as 220-age), HRrest, BR, BMI, and body weight) was generated, and each input variable and its associated antecedent clauses were then systematically removed from the rule base in the initial fuzzy classifier. The performance measure associated with each resultant fuzzy classifier (after removing each input variable) was determined as overall classification accuracy (based on %

                           max) in all steps of the step-test according to the test dataset. The highest classification accuracy was attained using the set %HRmax (i.e., HR during activity and HRmax), HRrest, and body weight, which was therefore considered the set of significant input variables.

Four ANFIS models corresponding to the four work rate categories of the step-test were trained using the back-propagation gradient descent method, and combined with the least squares method when the selected significant physiological and physical variables (%HRmax, HRrest, and body weight) were used as inputs. Each ANFIS model was trained to be more accurate for one work rate category over the others.

The training dataset was separated into four groups according to work rate category (198 data samples in the VL category, 178 in L, 85 in M, and 35 in H), each of which was used to develop a corresponding ANFIS model. Table 3
                            presents a description of the four ANFIS models. These models were then combined to form the ANFIS classifier, with eight fuzzy rules, eight membership functions assigned to each input variable, and a total of 80 modifiable parameters (48 premise parameters and 32 consequent parameters) (Appendix A). The ANFIS classifier was trained using the combined data group samples (496 samples) for 1000 training epochs.

To determine the significance of the selected input variables (%HRmax, HRrest, and body weight) for classifying work rate, changes in the shape of the Gaussian membership function of the input variables before and after training were plotted. Changes in the membership function of inputs after training indicate the impact of inputs on output detection (Yildiz et al., 2009). Results indicated considerable changes in the membership function associated with %HRmax and HRrest before and after training. However, membership function changes associated with body weight were less significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that %HRmax and HRrest have greater impact than body weight on work rate classification. Figs. 2 and 3
                           
                            show the initial and final membership function associated with %HRmax and HRrest, respectively.

The overall and relative (i.e., separately in each stage) performance of the developed ANFIS classifier was assessed using the test dataset for the remaining eight participants that had not been used to develop the classifier. The test dataset comprised 106 data samples in the VL category, 99 in the L category, 37 in the M category, and eight in the H category. Of these eight participants, three were unfit and four were older. A young participant was considered unfit if his

                           max was less than 33.6 ml/kg min (Heyward, 1998). In addition, the classifier's performance was compared with the current practice (i.e., based on %HRR) for estimating work rate, as recommended in many studies (Haskell and Pollock, 1996; Pollock et al., 1998; ACSM, 2014). This method uses %HRR to classify physical activities lasting up to 60 min according to the following predetermined limits: If %HRR <30 then work rate is VL, if 30 < %HRR <40 then work rate is L, if 40 < %HRR <60 then work rate is M, and if 60 < %HRR <90 then work rate is H (ACSM, 2014).

Student's two-tailed t-test for independent samples was used to determine the impact of age on relative workload (%

                        max on all 28 participants. A threshold of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A confusion matrix was used to assess the classification accuracy of the classifier. This matrix contains information about desired and actual (predicted) classifications, allowing detection of confused categories. Desired classifications were assigned to rows and actual outputs to columns. Performance in identifying each work rate category was assessed using three statistical parameters: sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (Yildiz et al., 2009; Leondes, 2007), generally defined as follows:

                        Table 4
                         presents the work rate category distribution associated with each step of the step-test (exertion level). On average, step 0 represents very light rate, steps 1 and 2 light rate, step 3 moderate rate, and step 4 heavy rate. Results indicate that the step-test can yield exertion levels ranging from very light to heavy, and that inter-participant variability has an impact on work rate classification. For example, all participants experienced a light work rate in step 1, compared with 73% of participants who experienced light work rate and 27% moderate work rate in step 2. The two-tailed independent samples t-test showed no significant differences in %

                        Table 6
                         presents the overall and relative classification accuracy of the most significant classifiers developed using different combinations of potential input variables for backward selection. Results show an average overall work rate classification accuracy of 78.25% using only the HR monitoring variables (HR, HRmax, and HRrest). Overall accuracy improved by 7% when breath rate was included. In addition, greater overall classification accuracy was obtained when physical fitness indicators were included than when BR was included (8% with BMI and 12.5% with body weight). Of the developed classifiers, the classifier including body weight and HR monitoring variables yielded the highest overall classification accuracy (Table 6), with higher accuracy than the other classifiers for VL, M, and H work rates, but average accuracy for light work rate (85%). Therefore, %HRmax, HRrest, and body weight were selected as the significant physiological variables.

The classification results associated with the two methods (ANFIS classifier and %HRR method) are presented as confusion matrices in Table 7(a)
                        . Results for the ANFIS classifier show decreasing classification error with increasing work rate (from light to heavy). For example, 19.19% of the light work categories were wrongly classified as very light (17.17%) and moderate (2.02%). The percent misclassified was lower for moderate (13.5% misclassified as light) and heavy (0% misclassified) categories. In contrast, results for the %HRR classification method show increasing classification error with increasing work rate. For example, the percent misclassified in the light, moderate, and heavy work categories was 56.57%, 73%, and 100%, respectively. On the other hand, results show that %HRR classification yielded fewer misclassifications than the ANFIS classifier for very light work rate.


                        Table 7(b) compares the classification performance of the two methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results indicate that the ANFIS classifier provides superior overall accuracy at 93% (sensitivity, 90.7%; specificity, 95.2%) compared to 63.4% (sensitivity, 42.3%; specificity, 84.5%) for %HRR, and that the relative classification performance of the ANFIS classifier was also superior for the different rates. The highest relative classification accuracy for the ANFIS classifier was obtained with heavy work rates (100%) and the lowest for light work rates (87.1%). In contrast, the highest relative classification accuracy for %HRR was obtained for very light work rates (78.5%) and the lowest for heavy work rates (49.8%).

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The analysis of the step-test data indicated that the test involves different work rates ranging from very light to heavy, according to the U.S. department of Health and Human Services (1996). However, the determination of the work rate was considerably affected by inter-participant variability, indicated by the high classification variability associated with steps 2, 3, and 4 (Table 4). The results show that age has no significant impact on work rate assessment under different workloads. This finding is supported by Hellerstein (1973) and Franklin et al. (1980). A possible explanation for this observation is the fact that the majority of the older participants were active, which slows the rate of decline in

                     max (which is influenced by training) (Ragbag, 2003). Plotting of the membership functions associated with these input variables before and after classifier training revealed the significant role of HR monitoring variables in determining work rate over the fitness level indicator.

The confusion matrix showed that the ANFIS classifier perfectly classified all heavy (H) work rate, slightly overestimated very light (VL) (4.7%) and part of light (L) (2%) work rates, and underestimated moderate (M) (13.5%) and the remaining part of light (17%) work rates. The fact that these misclassifications occurred between two adjacent work rate categories only (i.e., between VL and L or L and M) indicates the superiority of the proposed ANFIS classifier in preventing or significantly reducing the potential for undue fatigue over the usual %HRR classification. The results show that the ANFIS classifier provides higher accuracy (as well as sensitivity and specificity) than %HRR classification, with the highest accuracy difference obtained for H work rates and the lowest accuracy difference for VL work rates. In addition, the ANFIS classifier provides a better balance between sensitivity and specificity for the different rates, such that most work rate categories were classified correctly (90.7% of the time, on average) and only a few were misclassified (4.8% of the time, on average). In particular, this classifier can positively identify all heavy work rates (sensitivity = 100%) with no underestimations (specificity = 100%). This could make a significant contribution to maintaining workers' safety through optimal work design and job assignment, particularly in heavy industries.

In practice, the proposed ANFIS classifier provides a simple and practical method for work rate classification in any work environment. Although adequate knowledge of MATLAB is required to develop the classifier and adapt its rule base to new data, it can then be implemented in Excel, which researchers and practitioners can easily apply as a decision-making tool. (A complete Excel file implementing the proposed ANFIS model developed with this study's dataset can be obtained by contacting the first author of the paper). HR can be monitored during different activities in a work day, and a HR value corresponding to a certain task—in addition to the age-based HRmax, HRrest, and body weight—can be entered into the classifier rule base to obtain the corresponding work rate category: VL, L, M, or H. Usually, the HR value deemed representative of a task is the average HR during a time period the task is performed. Determination of task HR therefore requires a work observation study. This simple method has the potential to support a wide range of applications in industry. For instance, worker safety and accident prevention could be improved by continuously monitoring HR online and feeding the measured inputs into the classifier rule base, which could then trigger visual and/or audible warning signals for predefined potential risks (e.g., performing heavy activity for long periods or in hot temperatures). However, just as is the case with other models, practitioners should be aware that the classifier developed in this study will overestimate %

Hence, the HR thermal component (thermal pulse) must be removed at the data preparation stage prior to use (Vogt et al., 1970, 1973). Thanks to recent technological developments, core temperature can now be measured easily and noninvasively during actual work (e.g., telemetric pill), and could be included as an input variable in the classifier. Despite the promising results of this study, however, the ANFIS classifier has not been tested extensively or with actual field data. Further studies could include a larger number and variety of participants and a variety of actual work activities with different rates for classifier training and validation. Moreover, investigating the influence of different membership functions (i.e., triangular) could further improve classifier performance.

The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and practical approach to categorizing physiological work demand in order to help prevent excessive physical fatigue that could impact performance and safety. Our results show that intelligent systems can make optimal use of basic data that is easily measured in the field and does not require sophisticated equipment. Applying recent mathematical methods and software, the proposed ANFIS classifier improves on the work rate classification methods currently used by practitioners and researchers.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents a new and practical approach for classifying work rate into four categories (VL, L, M, and H) based on easily measured variables (%HRmax, HRrest, and body weight). Unlike the current classification method, our proposed modeling approach considers individual physical fitness, which plays a significant role in reducing the effect of inter-participant variability. The motivation for using fuzzy logic was the presence of uncertainty in work rate classification due to imprecise boundaries between work rate categories and high inter-participant variability. The proposed ANFIS classifier demonstrated superior performance in terms of both overall and relative accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to current practice (%HRR classification). Moreover, it strikes a balance between sensitivity and specificity for different work rates (particularly for heavy work rates), which can make a substantial contribution to improve workers' safety and prevent accidents. The proposed classifier represents not only a new application of fuzzy logic for work rate classification, it also provides a practical, easy-to-implement, and noninvasive classification system that combines advanced technology with simple, low-cost HR measurement.
