                  Minmax regret optimization aims at finding robust solutions that perform best in the worst-case, compared to the respective optimum objective value in each scenario. Even for simple uncertainty sets like boxes, most polynomially solvable optimization problems have strongly NP-complete minmax regret counterparts. Thus, heuristics with performance guarantees can potentially be of great value, but only few such guarantees exist.
                  A popular heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems is to compute the midpoint solution of the original problem. It is a well-known result that the regret of the midpoint solution is at most 2 times the optimal regret. Besides some academic instances showing that this bound is tight, most instances reveal a way better approximation ratio.
                  We introduce a new lower bound for the optimal value of the minmax regret problem. Using this lower bound we state an algorithm that gives an instance-dependent performance guarantee for the midpoint solution that is at most 2. The computational complexity of the algorithm depends on the minmax regret problem under consideration; we show that our sharpened guarantee can be computed in strongly polynomial time for several classes of combinatorial optimization problems.
                  To illustrate the quality of the proposed bound, we use it within a branch and bound framework for the robust shortest path problem. In an experimental study comparing this approach with a bound from the literature, we find a considerable improvement in computation times.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Robust optimization is a paradigm for optimization under uncertainty, that has been receiving increasing attention over the last two decades. While many variants of robust optimization exist, most aim at optimizing the worst-case performance of a solution without knowledge of a probability distribution over the uncertain input data. For general surveys on robust optimization, see Ben-Tal, Ghaoui, and Nemirovski (2009), Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (2002), Goerigk and Schöbel (2013).

One of the best-known approaches in robust optimization is to minimize the maximum difference in the objective value of the robust solution over all scenarios, compared to the best possible objective value achievable in each scenario. This approach is usually known as minmax regret, see Kouvelis and Yu (1997), Aissi, Bazgan, and Vanderpooten (2009).

However, due to its min-max-min structure, these problems are typically very hard to solve, both from a theoretical and from a practical point of view (for theoretical complexity, we refer to Aissi, Bazgan, and Vanderpooten (2007); 2009); Averbakh and Lebedev (2005), while practical complexity is demonstrated, e.g., for the minmax regret spanning tree problem (Kasperski, Makuchowski, and Zieliński, 2012; Montemanni, 2006; Yaman, Karaşan, and Pınar, 2001)).

Thus, heuristic algorithms with performance guarantees are highly desirable; however, only few such heuristics for minmax regret versions of general combinatorial problems exist. To the best of our knowledge, the heuristic with the current best approximation ratio of 2 for interval data is the midpoint algorithm (Conde, 2012; Kasperski and Zieliński, 2006).

While there exist academic instances that show the tightness of this approximation ratio, the midpoint solution shows a considerably better performance in practice. In this paper we present an instance-dependent approach to determine an upper bound on the approximation ratio that is always at most 2. While this approach can be applied to any combinatorial optimization problem, we discuss problem types where this bound can be computed in strongly polynomial time.

Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed bound within a branch and bound (BB) framework for the robust shortest path problem. Comparing the bound with the one proposed in Montemanni, Gambardella, and Donati (2004), we find considerable improvements in computation times.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly recapitulate the formal definition of the minmax regret problem, and introduce necessary notation. The main part of this paper is the lower bound on minmax regret problems introduced in Section 3, which is then used to derive stronger upper bounds on the approximation ratio of the midpoint solution. To this end, an auxiliary problem needs to be solved, which is described in detail in Section 4. We proceed to discuss how this bound can be computed for the shortest path problem, the minimum spanning tree problem, the assignment problem, and the minimum

In Section 6 we present computational data to compare our bound to other approaches. Finally, we conclude this work and point out further research questions in Section 7.

In contrast to classic optimization where one assumes to know the set of feasible solutions and the cost function exactly, in robust optimization it is assumed to have uncertainty in the set of feasible solutions and/or the cost function. In this paper, as usual for minmax regret optimization, we consider the case where the set of feasible solutions is known and only the cost function is uncertain. That is, instead of considering only one specific cost vector c we assume to have an uncertainty set

                      of different possible cost vectors c.

There are several ways to reformulate such an uncertain optimization problem to a well-defined problem formulation, which is also known as the robust counterpart (Goerigk and Schöbel, 2013). Here we consider the approach of minmax regret optimization. The regret is defined as the difference between the realized objective value and the best possible objective value over all scenarios. Formally, the regret problem can be formulated as

                      which are the Cartesian product of intervals, i.e.,

Unfortunately, the minmax regret problem has a higher computational complexity than the original optimization problem in most cases. For example, the minmax regret problem of the shortest path problem, which is a polynomially solvable problem for a positive cost vector c, is strongly NP-complete for interval uncertainty (Averbakh and Lebedev, 2004).

A frequently used scenario for the interval uncertainty is the midpoint scenario, where every entry of the cost vector ci
                      is just the average of the lower bound 
                        c
                      
                     
                        i
                      and the upper bound 
                        
                           
                              c

                           i
                        
                     . This average is denoted as

As NP-complete problems are often hard to solve exactly, one can try to find approximate optimal solutions in polynomial time. One such approach is to use the midpoint solution

                     which can be computed by solving the midpoint scenario of the classic optimization problem of type 
                        
                           (
                           P
                           )
                        
                     . The midpoint solution is always a 
                        
                           2
                           −
                        
                     approximation (Kasperski and Zieliński, 2006). In other words, the regret of the midpoint solution xmid
                      is always not more than twice the regret of the optimal solution of 
                        
                           (
                           R
                           )
                        
                     .

There are problem instances where this approximation guarantee is tight. But for a lot of instances the midpoint solution has smaller regret than twice the optimum regret, and is often even an optimal solution to 
                        
                           (
                           R
                           )
                        
                     . As the

                           −
                        
                     approximation result is tight we can of course not improve this result for all instances, but we can improve the approximation guarantee for specific instances with only small computational effort. To do so, we first show an easy technique to find a lower bound for the optimal value of the minmax regret problem, and then use the lower bound obtained this way to improve the

                     approximation guarantee depending on the instance. Furthermore, one consequence of our new analysis method is the already proven

Note that we do not use any probability distribution in the above definition of the minmax regret problem. Still, we make use of probability distributions in the following analysis. To this end, denote by P a probability distribution over the set

                      the expected value with respect to P. We follow the convention to denote random variables with capital letters (e.g., we write C instead of c to denote random cost vectors).

We specify the elements that are chosen in a solution

                           The first inequality follows from the fact that the left hand side is the minimum of a set valued function over all possible sets S, and the right hand side is just the same function evaluated for one specific set (the set x

                            the midpoint solution is already the optimal solution and we are done, as 0 is a lower bound for all regret problems. If Reg(xmid

                        The partition of the set 
                           N
                         is modeled via the variables zi
                        , which determine if an element is in S or in

                         respectively. Additionally to the z variables, we compute two feasible solutions 
                           
                              x

                         such that the total sum of objective values is minimized.

Note that the formulation (8)–(10) is nonlinear. As only binary variables are involved, it can easily be linearized using the following problem formulation, where z′ indicates which elements are used in both solutions x and y.

                         as well as two nodes s, t ∈ V. The goal is to find the shortest path from s to t, where the length of a path is the sum of the costs ce
                         over every edge e of the path. We can describe the shortest path problem as a combinatorial optimization problem over the ground set E with feasible set

Problem

                              S

                         reduces to finding two edge-disjoint

                         paths in G′, as can be seen by the following relationship between two paths in G with the cost function f as defined in Section 4.1, and two edge-disjoint 
                           
                              s

                         paths in G′. If an edge e and the copied version e* is used on both paths, this edge pair contributes costs of size

                                    c

                         to the objective function, which are exactly the same costs as paid in problem 
                           
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         for using an edge twice. If only one edge of the edge pair e and e* is used, it will always be edge e in an optimal solution due to its lower costs, and hence the contribution in the objective function is 
                           c
                         
                        
                           e
                        , which are again the same costs as paid in problem 
                           
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                         for using an edge once. If no edge of an edge pair is used, no costs accrue in both model formulations.

The problem of finding two edge-disjoint paths in G′ can be represented as a minimum cost flow problem or can be solved directly using, e.g., Suurballe’s algorithm (Suurballe and Tarjan, 1984).

                           Theorem 4.1
                           
                              LB* can be computed in strongly polynomial time for the shortest path problem.

                        . The goal is to find a spanning tree with minimal costs where the cost of a tree are just the sum over the costs ce
                         over every edge e in the tree. We can describe the minimum spanning tree problem as a combinatorial optimization problem over the ground set E with feasible set

We can reutilize the idea used for the shortest path problem (see Section 4.2) and create the same auxiliary multigraph

                                 (
                                 V
                                 ,
                                 
                                    E
                                    ′

                                 )
                              
                           
                        . But instead of searching for two edge-disjoint 
                           
                              s

                         paths, we search for two edge-disjoint minimum spanning trees in G′. This problem can be solved efficiently as shown in Roskind and Tarjan (1985).

                              LB* can be computed in strongly polynomial time for the minimum spanning tree problem.

In the assignment problem we are given a complete bipartite graph 
                           
                              G

                              ,
                              E
                              ,
                              c
                              )
                           
                         with a bipartition of the node set in equally sized sets

                              V
                           
                         and a cost function 
                           
                              c
                              :
                              E
                              →
                              
                                 R
                                 +
                              
                           
                        . The goal is to find a perfect matching of minimum total cost.

It is a well known result that the assignment problem can be transformed to a min cost flow problem on an auxiliary graph 
                           
                              
                                 G
                                 ′
                              
                              =
                              
                                 (

                                 ,
                                 
                                    E
                                    ′
                                 
                                 ,
                                 
                                    c
                                    ′
                                 
                                 ,
                                 
                                    u
                                    ′
                                 
                                 )
                              
                           
                         
                        (Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin, 1993). The idea is to enlarge the graph by introducing one new source node s and one new sink node t to the graph and to connect s with all vertices of V
                        1 and t with all vertices of V
                        2. The capacity of all edges is set to 1 and the cost of all edges incident to s or t is set to 0.

We define an auxiliary graph

                         similar to G′ by using the same methodology as well as the idea used for the shortest path or minimum spanning tree problem. As before, we introduce one new source node s and one new sink node t to the graph and connect them with the vertices of V
                        1 and V
                        2. Further, we create for every edge e ∈ E a parallel copy e*. The costs of all connector edges are set to 0 and to 
                           c
                         
                        
                           e
                         for all edges e ∈ E and to 
                           
                              
                                 c
                                 ¯
                              
                              e
                           
                         for all copies e*. The capacity of every connector edge is set to 2 and the capacity of every edge e ∈ E and their corresponding copy e* is set to 1. We can translate a flow with flow value 2|V
                        1| in G′′ to two assignments. Note that due to the capacity constraints of the connecting edges and the required flow value, two units of flow leave every node of V
                        1 and enter every node of V
                        2. We call two nodes v and u connected if flow is sent from v to u or from u to v. If both units of flow leaving a node of v
                        1 ∈ V
                        1 are sent through an edge

                                 )
                              
                              ,
                           
                         
                        v
                        1 is assigned to v
                        2 in both assignments. After removing all nodes assigned in that way, we have that every node of V
                        1 is connected to two different nodes of V
                        2 and vice versa. We now pick an arbitrary not yet assigned node v
                        1 ∈ V
                        1 that is connected to v
                        2 and 
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 2
                                 ′
                              
                              ∈
                              
                                 V
                                 2
                              
                           
                        . We assign v
                        1 to v
                        2 in the first assignment and delete the flow sent from v
                        1 to v
                        2. By doing this we reduce the number of nodes that are connected to v
                        2 from 2 to 1. Let 
                           
                              v
                              1
                              ′
                           
                         be the node that is still connected to node v
                        2. We assign 
                           
                              v
                              1
                              ′
                           
                         to v
                        2 in the second assignment and delete the flow sent from 
                           
                              v
                              1
                              ′
                           
                         to v
                        2. By doing this we reduce the number of nodes that are connected to 
                           
                              v
                              1
                              ′
                           
                         from 2 to 1. Hence, we know again which assignment pair we have to pick for the first assignment.

By repeating this argumentation we generate a cycle, see Fig. 1
                        . Every edge picked with his original orientation in this cycle represents a part for the first assignment. All other edges picked represent a part of the second assignment. If there are still not yet assigned nodes left, we can just start the process again by picking a new not yet assigned node 
                           
                              
                                 v
                                 1
                                 *
                              
                              ∈
                              
                                 V
                                 1
                              
                           
                        . The argumentation about the costs is the same as in the shortest path or minimum spanning tree problem. If a specific assignment is made twice, two units of flow must be sent through edge e and their corresponding copy e* contributing

                                 e

                                    c
                                    ¯
                                 
                                 e
                              
                           
                         to the costs. If a specific assignment is made only once, in an optimal solution the unit of flow will always be sent over the cheaper edge e contributing 
                           c
                         
                        
                           e
                         to the costs.

                              LB* can be computed in strongly polynomial time for the assignment problem.

                        Furthermore, as the coefficient matrix for the above problem is totally unimodular, we may solve the LP relaxation instead. As the dual of the LP relaxation is a min-cost flow problem, we have shown the next theorem.

To find the optimal solution of NP-complete minmax regret problems one might resort on branch and bound algorithms. An important ingredient of a successful branch and bound algorithm is an effective and easy to compute lower bound for every node in the branch and bound tree. As every node in a branch and bound tree defines a restriction for the set of feasible solutions, we have to show how the lower bound introduced in this paper can be computed, if parts of the solutions are already fixed, to make it usable in this context.

Assume a branch and bound node defines a restricted feasible set

                        . Hence the minmax regret problem in this node reduces to

                         reduces to a set with only one element. In this case the probability distribution P has only one outcome – the vector c′ – and, hence, the lower bound is equal to Reg(x′), which is an upper bound of the optimal regret value. Therefore, the gap between lower and upper bound vanishes for this branch and bound node.

As before, we assume we are given a graph 
                           
                              G
                              =
                              (
                              V
                              ,
                              E
                              ,
                              c
                              )
                           
                         with node set V, edge set E, a cost function 
                           
                              c
                              :
                              E
                              →
                              
                                 R
                                 +
                              
                           
                         as well as two nodes s, t ∈ V. In Montemanni et al. (2004) a branch and bound algorithm for the minmax regret shortest path problem is presented. We refer to Montemanni et al. (2004) for a detailed description of the branching scheme. Let a node in the branching tree be given, and let this node be characterized by the set 
                           
                              X

                         of feasible solutions. Then they use the following lower bound on the regret of this node:

We illustrate the strength of the proposed lower bound using the shortest path problem as an example.

In Montemanni et al. (2004) two different types of randomly generated graph classes are considered. We consider the same graph classes but decided to modify the cost structure of the first graph type to gain more flexibility for the experiments.

The graph family R-n-c-d-δ consists of randomly generated graphs such that each graph has n nodes and an approximate arc density of δ. The start vertex s is the first node of the graph and the end vertex t is the last node of the graph.

The second graph family K-n-c-d-w are layered graphs. Every layer is completely connected to the next layer. The start node s is connected to the first layer and the last layer is connected to the end node t. The complete graph consists of n nodes and every layer of w nodes.

To generate the costs, a random number m is sampled from the interval [1, c]. The lower bound cost 
                           c
                         
                        
                           e
                         is sampled uniformly from 
                           
                              [
                              (

                         and the upper bound cost 
                           
                              
                                 c

                         is chosen uniformly from the interval 
                           
                              [
                              
                                 c
                                 ̲
                              
                              ,
                              
                                 (
                                 1
                                 +
                                 d
                                 )
                              
                              m
                              ]
                           
                        . Thus, we can control the cost variability using the parameter d.

All experiments were conducted on an Intel Core i5-3470 processor, running at 3.20 GHz, 8 GB RAM under Windows 7. We used CPLEX version 12.6. for comparisons. Algorithms were implemented with Visual Studio 2010 Express using C# 5.0 in the .NET framework v. 4.5. Only one core was used for all computations.

In this experiment we compute the improved lower bound for the approximation ratio of the midpoint solution. We implemented Suurballe’s algorithm to solve the lower bound problem 
                           
                              (
                              S
                              )
                           
                        . The results are given by Table 1
                        . The first column λ gives the improved approximation guarantee, while column Tabs
                         gives the absolute time in seconds needed to solve Suurballe’s algorithm. The last column Trel
                         gives the ratio of times needed to compute the lower and the upper bound. Every experiment is done on 100 graphs randomly generated from the corresponding graph class, and presented values are averaged.

The average approximation guarantees are always below 2, showing the potential of the new lower bound. It is also interesting to observe that the improved approximation guarantee does not decrease with an increasing instance size. But we have to mention that the new approximation guarantee is weaker for K-graphs than for R-graphs. Nevertheless, good improvements can be achieved for K-graphs if the edge costs have high variability.

To compute the lower bound we have to do one shortest path computation (to find the value of the midpoint path) as well as one run of Suurballe’s algorithm. The computation of the upper bound needs two shortest path computations, one to find the worst case value of the midpoint path and one to compute the value of the regret path. As expected, the computational effort of Suurballe’s algorithm is comparable to two shortest path computations, which results in a time ratio of circa 1.5.

We compare the performance of five different algorithms. The first three algorithms use the branching scheme suggested in Montemanni et al. (2004). The only difference of these algorithms is the method to compute the lower bound. In the first algorithm BBold
                         we implemented the lower bound LBold
                         and in the second algorithm BBnew
                         we use our lower bound LBnew
                         (see Section 5.2). The third algorithm BBboth
                         computes both bounds in every branching node and chooses the best one. In this branching scheme a branch and bound node represents a path from node s to some other node v. To enlarge this path the authors of Montemanni et al. (2004) choose the shortest path P′ from v to t with respect to the worst case cost. This makes sense as they have to compute the path P′ for calculating their lower bound LBnew
                         anyways. The fourth algorithm 
                           
                              B
                              
                                 B
                                 
                                    n
                                    e
                                    w
                                 
                                 *
                              
                           
                         is again a branch and bound algorithm using lower bound LBnew
                         but instead of computing the worst case path P′ in every branch and bound node to complete the path we compute the shortest path with respect to the midpoint costs. In this way we save one shortest path computation to compute LBnew
                        .

For the fifth algorithm CPX we use the mixed-integer programming formulation of the minmax regret problem (see Appendix A) and solve it using CPLEX.

We consider two different experiments. For smaller instances we compare the time needed for each algorithm to solve the problem to optimality, while for larger instances we compare the gaps between the best lower bound and the best upper bound after a time limit of 30 seconds. Every experiment is done on 100 graphs randomly generated from the corresponding graph class.

The results of the first experiment are presented in Fig. 2
                        . The computation times on the y-axis are given in milliseconds.

For general R-graphs we see that all three branch and bound algorithms have almost the same performance except for BBold
                         that shows a bad performance for instances with very high cost variability. Further we observe that CPX is clearly outperformed by BBnew
                         on R-graphs. It is also worth mentioning that BBold
                         is a bit faster than BBnew
                         on these instances where the quality of the lower bound seems to be less important than the time needed to compute the bound. (See Appendix B for a direct comparison of the quality of LBold
                         and LBnew
                        .) This seems to be different for K-graphs, as, except for some small instances, BBold
                         is clearly outperformed by BBnew
                        . In general the branch and bound algorithms show a weaker performance on K-graphs than on R-graphs as they are outperformed by CPX. One exception is Fig. 2(f). The increasing layer width reduces on the one hand the problem difficulty for the branch and bound algorithms, as the branching depth is reduced with increasing layer size, and on the other hand increases the number of arcs in the graph which explains the worse performance of CPX, as an increasing number of arcs increases the size of the IP formulation. It is also interesting to note that the algorithm BBboth
                         is outperformed on all instances by BBnew
                        . Hence, we see that in general it is not worth computing LBold
                         if one has already computed LBnew
                         for a branch and bound algorithm. The performances of BBnew
                         and 
                           
                              B
                              
                                 B
                                 
                                    n
                                    e
                                    w
                                 
                                 *
                              
                           
                         are very similar. Therefore, we cannot state clearly which is the better one.


                        Fig. 3
                         shows the results of the second experiment. These results confirm the statements that are made for the first experiment. On K-graphs the use of branch and bound algorithms is questionable, as they are clearly outperformed by CPX. Nevertheless, the more difficult computation of LBnew
                         pays off especially for complicated instances of both graph classes. For R-graphs the use of branch and bound algorithms seems to be reasonable particularly for instances that are too big to be handled by CPLEX.

In this work we further refined the analysis of the most widely researched general approximation algorithm to minmax regret optimization: the midpoint solution. By underestimating the worst-case over all scenarios using a purpose-constructed probability distribution, we find a new proof for the well-known result that the midpoint solution is a 2-approximation. However, the proof technique yields further insight, as it can be used to construct approximation guarantees that are dependent on the given instance.

To this end, an optimization problem over probability distributions needs to be solved to gain the strongest possible estimate. We show that this problem can easily be solved for many well-known combinatorial optimization problems.

Finally, the analysis was further complemented using experimental data for randomly created uncertain shortest path problems. Our results suggest that the new performance guarantee improves the already known guarantee of 2 for most instances and can be computed very fast. The knowledge about the better performance guarantee and the lower bound can be used to considerably improve existing branch and bound algorithms.

We showed that any probability distribution over 
                        U
                      can be used to compute a lower bound for the minmax regret problem. The solution space of the lower bound problem 
                        
                           (
                           S
                           )
                        
                      is a strongly restricted space of probability distributions. For further research it would be interesting to investigate lower bound problems that are built on wider spaces of probability distributions. Additional research should be made to find an algorithm that has an approximation guarantee that is strictly less than 2 or to show some inapproximability results for minmax regret problems.

We did the following experiment to compare the quality of LBold
                      and LBnew
                      directly. We generated 1000 graphs of type K-202-1000-0.25-5 and solved each instance using algorithm BBboth
                     . In each branching node we compute the gap 
                        
                           
                              U
                              B
                              −
                              L
                              B
                           
                           
                              U
                              B
                           
                        
                      where UB is the upper bound of the corresponding branching node and LB is either LBold
                      or LBnew
                     . To visualize how the gap evolves during the branching algorithm we assign to every gap value the length of the path that is fixed in the corresponding branch and bound node. The plotted value in Fig. 5 shows the average value of all gaps corresponding to the same path length. Fig. 4
                      shows the average number of branch and bound nodes per fixed path length. Fig. 5
                      clearly indicates that LBnew
                      dominates LBold
                      for every fixed path length. But note that LBnew
                      is not better than LBold
                      for all branch and bound nodes of the branching tree.
