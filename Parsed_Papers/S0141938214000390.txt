                  This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3-D) display that can display 3-D images at long distances of tens or hundreds of meters in the depth direction and that can control their 3-D positions to meet new requirements for outdoor use. The proposed display uses changing size as a cue to depth perception, i.e., the smoothly expanding motion of virtual images formed with optical systems according to the forward movements of the users to display 3-D images at more distant positions in the depth direction than positions where virtual images are formed with optical systems because conventional 3-D displays that use binocular disparity are only able to display 3-D images at short distances in the depth direction. The feasibility of the proposed display was evaluated by subjective tests using a moving minivan in which observers viewed a test pattern that overlapped the real view ahead of the automobile observed through the windshield. The results obtained from the subjective tests revealed that the test pattern was observed at long distances over tens and hundreds of meters in the depth direction and that the position in the depth direction of the test pattern could be controlled by changing the rate at which the motion of the test pattern smoothly expanded. These results demonstrated that the proposed display was feasible.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Three-dimensional displays have recently become widely distributed among consumers, and they are mostly used indoors. For example, consumers watch 3-D TV programs and play 3-D games in their homes and watch 3-D films in movie theaters. In addition to these indoor applications, outdoor applications have been increasing [1–5]; one of the most attractive of these applications is in automobile navigation systems, in which navigation information is displayed in the space in front of the windshield that overlaps the real scene [6–9]. Such navigation systems help drivers to intuitively and intelligibly obtain navigation information, whereas conventional systems, which use small displays and voice guidance, often confuse them. The most intuitive and intelligible way of displaying navigation information is to display 3-D images at the same positions in real space, such as intersections that are tens or hundreds of meters ahead. Therefore, 3-D displays for automobile navigation systems are required to display 3-D images in such wide spaces and to control their 3-D positions to avoid displaying them at different positions from the positions that are targets of navigation information.

There are two possibilities toward displaying 3-D images in wide spaces and controlling their 3-D positions. The first possibility is to use lenses with long focal distances to form virtual images at long distances in the depth direction. However, optical systems containing lenses with long focal distances are too large and are not suitable as on-vehicle navigation systems because large areas are necessary to accommodate them. The second possibility is to use 3-D displays because they can display 3-D images by controlling their positions in the depth direction. However, the conventional 3-D displays developed thus far cannot control the position at long distances over tens or hundreds of meters because those in practical use currently utilize binocular disparity as a cue for depth perception (see Appendix A). Therefore, the displays do not meet the requirements for automobile navigation systems.

This paper presents a new 3-D display that can display 3-D images at long distances in the depth direction and that can control their 3-D positions. First, we describe the principles underlying the proposed display that utilizes the smooth expanding motion of virtual images formed with optical systems according to the forward movements of users to display 3-D images at the farther position in the depth direction than the position where the virtual images are formed with optical systems. We then describe the results of experiments performed to evaluate whether the proposed display was feasible.

Changing size, which is in the basis of this study, is the smooth motion of retinal images caused by observer motion. For example, when observers move toward real objects, the retinal images of real objects are smoothly expanded. According to previous studies on human visual perception, changing size strongly affects the perception of distances in the depth direction [10,11].


                     Fig. 1
                      outlines the basic concept behind the proposed display. The automobile is moving toward an intersection. The distance in the depth direction from the user to the image that is formed with the optical system, which is denoted “D” in Panels A and B, is constant, i.e., “D” at Time 1 and “D” at Time 2 are equal. When the image that is formed with the optical system is smoothly expanded according to the forward movement by the automobile, i.e., when the image that is formed with the optical system at Time 2 becomes smoothly larger than that at Time 1, this smooth expansion produces the same smooth motion in the retinal image of the image that is formed with an optical system as the changing size of a real object at the intersection. We assumed that this smooth motion in the retinal image of the image that was formed with an optical system had the same effect as the changing size of the real object on the perception of the distance in the depth direction. That is, when the size of the retinal image of the image that was formed with the optical system was smoothly expanded at the same rate as the size of the image on the moving user’s retina for the real object at the intersection, the image that the user observed was at the intersection (see Panel C).

                     where W is the width of objects, D is the distance to objects from observers, and V is the velocity of observers. Here, T is the time for motion, and CS is the changing size. We defined the width as 2m in our calculations, the velocity as 60km/h, and the time as 1s. The reason for using the width of 2m and the velocity of 60km/h is that the main application of the proposed display is in an automobile navigation system. The width of 2m is almost the same as the width of an automobile traffic lane, and the velocity of 60km/h is common in actual traffic scenarios. Changing size is not saturated, even when the distance to objects from observers is 200m, which indicates that changing size has effectual information for the perception of such long distances in the depth direction.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows a schematic of the proposed display and its basic components are a display that is the source of the virtual images, a lens, and a beam splitter. The distance between the display that is the source of virtual images and the lens is shorter than the focal distance of the lens, and a virtual image is formed behind the display. The beam splitter reflects the virtual images and merges them into an actual traffic scene that is outside the automobile. The interference between the virtual images and an actual traffic scene decreases by using a beam splitter whose reflectance/transmittance ratio is suitable or by using optical filters.

The feasibility of the proposed display was evaluated by conducting an experiment in which the perception of the distances in the depth direction that occurred in the proposed display was examined. This experiment was conducted under the conditions of binocular vision. These conditions in which the proposed display was used as binocular vision are generally used by observers. This experiment represented a practical evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed display.

@&#METHOD@&#

The positions in the depth direction where observers saw 3-D images were measured. The observers of the 3-D images were in automobiles that were moving forward in each trial of the measurements. The observers also compared 3-D images with reference markers (see Figs. 4 and 6
                        ), and described the positions in the depth direction of the 3-D images. The details of the method are as follows.

This experiment was conducted during daylight hours on the Drift Course at Fuji International Speedway (Oyama-cho, Shunto-gun, Shizuoka, Japan). A schematic and a photograph of the Drift Course are shown in Fig. 4, where seven small banners and twelve large banners were placed along the left side of the back straight. The twelve large banners were actually two sets of six large banners, and each set of six large banners were assigned numbers from zero to five. One small banner was placed at the starting point, and the other six small banners were placed at 10-m intervals from the starting point. The first large banner (i.e., the first “0”) was placed 10m from the last small banner, and the other eleven large banners were sequentially placed at 10-m intervals from the first large banner. Nineteen small banners were placed along the right side of the back straight. One small banner was placed at the starting point, and the other 18 small banners were placed at 10-m intervals from the starting point. The small banners were 0.6-m wide and 1.8-m high, and the large banners were 0.9-m wide and 1.8-m high.

The automobile that was used for the experiment was a minivan (Estima, Toyota Motor, Aichi, Japan). The drivers were seated in the driver seat, the experimenters were in the back seats behind the driver seat, and the observers were seated in the back seats behind the passenger seat. The minivan was driven at a velocity of 60km/h. The velocity was determined by watching the speedometer on the dashboard.

A laptop computer (Precision M65, Dell, Round Rock, TX) and a heads-up display were used to generate the 3-D images. The heads-up display was set up in front of the observers in the minivan, i.e., it was fixed behind the backrest of the passenger seat whose headrest had been removed (Fig. 5
                        ). The heads-up display contained a seven-inch thin film transistor (TFT) display (QT-701AV-S, Quixun, Tokyo, Japan) that was the source of the virtual images, a plano-convex lens (SLB-100-400P, Sigma Koki, Tokyo, Japan), and a mirror beam splitter (code 0382 0617, Koyo, Tokyo, Japan). The positions in the depth direction where virtual images were formed with the optical system were 2, 6, or 10m from an observer. Information from the minivan (e.g., velocity) was not input into the computer. Programs corresponding to velocity conditions were executed under given conditions.

The 3-D images were arrows pointing left (Fig. 6
                        ). The changing size of the virtual arrows was the same as the changing size of actual arrows that were located at 70, 125, or 180m from the starting point and that were 2-m wide and 1-m high. The virtual arrows were magenta in color.

The observers were eight students of the Kanagawa Institute of Technology. All of the observers were unaware of the purpose of the experiment and had normal or corrective-to-normal visual acuity.

The driver accelerated the minivan to a velocity of 60km/h from the starting point in each trial and then maintained this velocity during the trial. An experimenter pressed a key on the computer to present a virtual arrow when he or she determined that an observer was immediately at the starting point. The duration of exposure to the virtual arrow was 2s. An observer orally reported the position in the depth direction of the virtual arrow by comparing it with the large banners. We asked observers to identify the banner that was closest to the virtual arrow. When the virtual arrow was observed to be between two banners, the observers identified two banners (e.g., between the first “5” and the second “0”). When the virtual arrow was observed to be closer than the first “0” or farther than the second “5,” observers identified this. When the virtual arrow was observed to be moving in the depth direction, observers identified the range of movements (e.g., moved from the second “1” to the first “4”). Each observer completed three trials under each of these conditions.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The positions in the depth direction of the 3-D images were quantified as follows. The origin of every position was the starting point. When observers reported the closest banner, its position in the depth direction was the position in the depth direction of a 3-D image (e.g., when the closest banner was the first “4,” 100m was the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image). When observers reported two banners, the middle position in the depth direction between them was the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image (e.g., when the virtual arrow was between the first “5” and the second “0,” 115m was the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image). When observers reported that the virtual arrow was closer than the first “0” or farther than the second “5,” the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image was defined to be 65m for the former or 185m for the latter. When observers reported that the virtual arrow moved in the depth direction, the middle position in the depth direction of the range of motion was the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image (e.g., when the virtual arrow moved from the second “1” to the first “4”, 115m was the position in the depth direction of the 3-D image). Although these quantifications did not warrant a ratio scale, we statistically analyzed the positions in the depth direction of 3-D images for the sake of convenience.

The mean positions indicated by each of the observers in the depth direction of a 3-D image was calculated based on three trials under each condition, and then the mean position of the eight observers in the depth direction of the 3-D image was calculated based on the eight means of the observers under each condition. The standard error was also calculated based on the means of the eight observers for each condition to determine the difference between observers, viz., individual differences. Fig. 7
                         plots the mean position of the eight observers in the depth direction of a 3-D image plus/minus one standard error as a function of the position in the depth direction, in which the changing size was defined, and Fig. 8
                         shows the plot of the location where the virtual images were formed with the optical system as a function of the position in the depth direction. The circles, triangles, and squares in Fig. 7 correspond to the mean position in the depth direction of a 3-D image under 2-, 6-, and 10-m conditions, respectively, of image formation with optical system. The circles, triangles, and squares in Fig. 8 correspond to the mean position in the depth direction of a 3-D image under 70-, 125-, and 180-m conditions, respectively, of the changing size. The error bars in both figures represent the standard error, and the dotted lines represent values equal to the positions in the depth direction where the changing size was defined.

                        =371, and n.s.). These results indicate that the positions in the depth direction of 3-D images depended on the changing size but not on the image formation with an optical system. The proposed display was able to display 3-D images at long distances in the depth direction, and their positions in the depth direction were controlled by changing the rate of smooth expansion of the virtual images that were formed with an optical system. These effects were not disrupted by the image formation with an optical system.


                        Table 1
                         summarizes the number of trials in which 3-D images moved in the depth direction. Although Observers 3 and 6 reported motion in almost all trials, three observers did not report motion. Moreover, Observer 8 only reported motion in five trials, and Observers 1 and 4 only reported motion in one trial. The 3-D images remained at one position in the depth direction in most trials. Such results support the feasibility of the proposed display.

Thus, the feasibility of the proposed display was demonstrated under conditions of binocular vision. This demonstration was crucial not only for practical use but also for the design of the proposed display. Because the positions in the depth direction where the virtual images were formed with optical systems did not matter, one can use small lenses whose focal distances are short and that enable the proposed display to be miniaturized. Such miniaturization is vital not only in automobile navigation systems but also in many other applications.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The practical evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed display. We concluded that the proposed display was able to display 3-D images at long distances in the depth direction and that their positions in this direction could be controlled by changing the rate of smooth expansion of the virtual images that were formed with an optical system. However, this study was only the first step toward reaching our goals, and some problems remain. We will discuss these problems in the following sub-section.

The positions in the depth direction of the 3-D images in the experiment depended on the changing size. However, the differences between the positions in the depth direction of the 3-D images and the positions in the depth direction where the changing size was defined were not zero. The individual differences in the positions in the depth direction of 3-D images were also not zero. Although it is very difficult to reduce these differences to zero, it is necessary to reduce them into a suitable range for practical use. Automobile navigation systems require higher spatial resolution than the width of roads, i.e., several meters, to display 3-D images at the intended intersections. When the spatial resolution of the proposed display is lower than the width of roads, 3-D images are often displayed at erroneous intersections.

There were two factors in lowering the spatial resolution of the proposed display in the experiments. The first was incomplete synchronization between the changing size and the velocity of the minivan. As described in Section 3, the velocity of the minivan was not input into the computer and was not precisely controlled. As a result, the actual velocity was expected to differ slightly from our intended velocity. In such cases, the positions in the depth direction where changing size was actually defined were different from our intended positions in the depth direction, and observers found it difficult to observe the 3-D images at the intended positions in the depth direction. We assumed that we could improve the spatial resolution of the proposed display by inputting the actual velocity into the computer because the changing size would then be completely synchronized with the velocity. We intend to examine this assumption in future work.

The second factor was the unfamiliar sizes of the objects. As described in Section 3, 3-D images were virtual arrows that were unfamiliar to observers, and any information on the sizes of the virtual arrows was not given to observers. As a result, the sizes that observers perceived differed from the sizes that the changing size as a cue of depth perception defined, i.e., 2-m wide and 1-m high. In such cases, the sizes that observers perceived disrupted the effect that the changing size had on depth perception. According to previous studies on human visual perception, size perception and depth perception are closely linked [12–15]. We assumed that we could improve the spatial resolution of the proposed display by allowing observers to interact with familiar sizes of objects. We intend to examine this assumption in the near future.

Rapid velocity is essential for the proposed display, as we stated in Section 2. However, the minivan repetitively stopped and started. Velocity was slow at the beginning and at the end of movement and was zero when the van stopped. We must determine a range in which the velocity can be applied to accurately use the proposed display. We intend to study this problem in future work.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This study determined that a new 3-D display was able to display 3-D images at long distances in the depth direction and was able to control their 3-D positions. We also evaluated the feasibility of the novel 3-D display. The primary principle behind the proposed display was to expand smoothly the virtual images formed with optical systems according to forward movement of the users and to display 3-D images at the farther positions in the depth direction than the positions where the virtual images were formed with optical systems. The depth perception that occurred in the proposed display was examined in the evaluations. The results obtained from the examination revealed that the 3-D images were observed at distances of tens or hundreds of meters in the depth direction, and their positions in the depth direction were controlled by changing the rate of smooth expansion of the virtual images that were formed with an optical system. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed display.

As previously described, conventional 3-D displays use binocular disparity to present 3-D images. Although binocular disparity strongly affects depth perception, the effect is limited to narrow depths of field [10,11]. This limitation is due to the threshold of binocular disparity, which is within a 30s arc for many observers [16]. We calculated the differences in depth corresponding to the 30s arc of binocular disparity with two equations.

                     where DCO is the depth to an object close to an observer, IOD is the interocular distance, and BD is the binocular disparity. Here, DD is the difference in depth between close and far objects (see Fig. A1
                     ). We defined the interocular distance as 6.5cm in the calculations, which is the standard value, and defined binocular disparity as a 30s arc.

The results we obtained from our calculations are plotted in Fig. A1. The differences in depth correspond to the threshold of binocular disparity. In other words, these values are the smallest differences in depth that can be perceived through binocular disparity; therefore, the differences in depth that are less than these values are difficult to perceive through binocular disparity. For example, a difference in depth of less than 30m is difficult to perceive 100m ahead. And a difference in depth of less than 160m is difficult to perceive 200m ahead. Thus, the smallest differences in depth are too large to display 3-D images at long distances of tens or hundreds of meters in the depth direction and to control their 3-D positions. Therefore, conventional 3-D displays do not meet the requirements for automobile navigation systems.
