                  A precursor question to increase the capacity of an airspace is to determine the minimum distance separation required to make this airspace safe. A methodology to answer this question is proposed in this paper. The methodology takes sector volume, number of crossings and crossing angles of routes, and the number of aircraft as input, and generate air traffic scenarios which satisfy the input values. A stochastic multi-objective optimization algorithm is then used to optimize separation values. The algorithm outputs the set of non-dominated solutions representing the trade-off between separation values and the best attainable target level of safety. The results show that the proposed methodology is successful in determining the minimum distance separation values required to make an air traffic scenario safe from a collision risk perspective, and in illustrating how minimum separation values are affected by different sector/traffic characteristics.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the key challenges facing air navigation service providers (ANSPs) is how to accommodate the continuing growth in air traffic demand while meeting safety targets. The rapid increase in air traffic compelled ANSPs to investigate ways to relax the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for separating aircraft in time and space to accommodate extra flights (Netjasov & Janic, 2008). Decreasing separation negatively impacts safety since separation is a fundamental milestone in maintaining low collision risk in an airspace. Although mid-air collision is a rare event, it is a significant event due to its consequences, which normally result in a large number of fatalities.

Separation is a vital factor considered in many air traffic management problems such as demand-capacity balancing (DCB), and conflict detection and resolution (CDR). In DCB problem, a safe, efficient and orderly air traffic flow needs to be achieved while considering – among other factors – the capacity of departure and arrival airports to meet a certain demand of flights. This is achieved by several means such as ground holding (i.e., delaying the departure time of aircraft), airborne holding, rerouting of aircraft, flight cancelation, and speed/level changes. For ground holding, a single destination airport was considered in  Richetta and Odoni (1993 1994) and Terrab and Odoni (1993), effect of delays over a network of destination airports was consider in Vranas, Bertsimas, and Odoni (1994), while dealing with airspace capacity in addition to airport capacity was considered in Lulli and Odoni (2007). Integer programming models (whether deterministic Agustin, Alonso-Ayuso, Escudero, and Pizarro, 2012a; Bertsimas and Patterson, 1998 or stochastic Agustin, Alonso-Ayuso, Escudero, and Pizarro, 2012b; Mukherjee and Hansen, 2005, 2009 in nature) using aircraft rerouting were introduced. In Bertsimas and Patterson (1998) and Mukherjee and Hansen (2005), aircraft rerouting was used in association with ground holding and airborne holding, and in addition to flight cancelation in Agustin et al. (2012a, 2012b). Speed (Bertsimas, Lulli, & Odoni, 2008, 2011) and level (Barnier & Brisset, 2004) changes solutions were used along with ground holding, airborne holding and flight cancelation. On the other hand, there are many studies addressing the CDR problem (see Kuchar and Yang, 2000; Martin-Campo, 2010 surveys on CDR models and algorithms), where the aim is to detect when two or more aircraft are in conflict and violate the horizontal and/or vertical separation (i.e., conflict detection) and resolve such conflict.

In all the previous studies on DCB and CDR problems, separation values were pre-defined according to the current standard values, and were mainly treated as constraints which must not be violated. This is reasonable since such studies aim for solutions within the current air traffic management (ATM) policies. However for new ATM policies, such as relaxing the ICAO standards for separating aircraft in time and space, separation should be treated as decision variables rather than pre-defined constraint values. Finding ways to determine the minimum separation in an airspace sector which does not compromise safety is crucial for a number of reasons:

                        
                           •
                           It can assist sector designers to design/re-design safe airspaces.

It can help researchers to design risk free synthetic scenarios to be used within their air traffic simulation environment.

It can be used as a Monitor/Alert Parameter in a real-time environment to trigger an alarm if the expected demand on a sector exceeds its capacity.

Collision risk assessment (EUROCONTROL, 2001) provides vital indicators for airspace safety in two stages. The first stage is risk estimation, where collision risk models (CRMs) are developed and used to estimate the collision probability of aircraft in a given airspace. The second stage is risk evaluation, which compares the estimated risk with either an estimated risk of a similar airspace that is considered safe historically or a level of risk that is deemed acceptable known as the target level of safety (TLS) (ICAO, 2001).

Collision risk in an air traffic scenario (ATS) is greatly influenced by the non-linear interactions between different factors, mainly sector characteristics, traffic characteristics and the separation among aircraft (Whittle, Kwan, & Saboo, 2005). Therefore, addressing the distance separation required for an airspace to be safe cannot be done in isolation from the sector and traffic characteristics of this airspace. Here a number of subproblems need to be solved. First, procedures to generate air traffic scenarios (ATSs) with different sector/traffic characteristics need to be designed. Second, generic and flexible procedures which can separate aircraft in an ATS given any values of distance separation. Third, an optimization procedure needs to be designed to discover the minimum distance separation values which make an ATS safe.

To this end, we contribute a multiobjective distance separation methodology which investigates the relationship between different airspace sector/traffic characteristics and the minimum separation required for safety (as compared by the TLS). We present procedures to design air traffic scenarios (ATSs) with different sector characteristics (i.e., number and angles of crossings) and traffic characteristics (i.e., number of aircraft and their speeds). Second, we present a procedure which can apply any given values of distance separation in an ATS. Finally and similar to other studies which rely on stochastic optimization techniques in air traffic management (ATM) (Alam, Shafi, Abbass, & Barlow, 2009; Delahaye, Alliot, Schoenauer, & Farges, 1995; Delahaye & Puechmorel, 2006; Gianazza, Durand, & Archambault, 2004), a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to minimize the distance separation among aircraft while minimizing the number of aircraft pairs which violate the TLS.

The methodology outputs the set of non-dominated solutions representing the trade-off between separation values and the best attainable target level of safety. The results show that the proposed methodology is successful in determining the minimum distance separation values required to make an ATS safe from a collision risk perspective, and how minimum separation values are affected by different sector/traffic characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address these research questions.

In the next section, the problem is formally defined including discussions on collision risk, safety, distance separation and how these concepts are used in this paper in the proposed methodology. In Section 3 procedures for sector design are introduced, and in Section 4 the traffic generation procedure is discussed. Section 5 illustrates the proposed distance separation procedure. Sections 6 and 7 illustrate the experimental design and results of the study, and Section 8 concludes the study.


                     Collision risk: The collision risk estimate expresses the probability of an aircraft having a collision in an airspace. It is considered a crucial numeric metric and analytic method to guide decision making in regard to airspace safety. Collision risk is computed for a pair of aircraft aci
                      and acj
                      at a certain time step t for a time interval tcr
                      according to a collision risk function CR(aci, acj
                     ), i.e., the probability that aci
                      and acj
                      will collide in the next tcr
                      minutes.

The tcr
                      is usually a time interval which allows screen update time in normal automatic dependent surveillance (ADS) operations or downlink in non-ADS operations, controller conflict recognition, controller message composition, uplink, pilot reaction and aircraft manoeuver. This may take from 4 minutes in ADS operations to 6 minutes in non-ADS operations (Anderson, 2005). This study uses the average of these two numbers and set tcr
                      to be 5 minutes.

The collision risk function CR(aci, acj
                     ) implements a collision risk model (CRM), which expresses the risk of a mid-air collision in an airspace in terms of a number of quantifiable parameters. In this study, the Hsu CRM (Hsu, 1981; ICAO, 2001) is used. The Hsu CRM is commonly used by ANSPs and by the ICAO Separation and Airspace Safety Panel (Anderson, 2005) because of its low computational cost.

For completeness, we will briefly discuss here the Hsu CRM (see Anderson, 2005 for a detailed treatment for the Hsu CRM). In the Hsu CRM, the collision risk of a pair of aircraft is computed based on the closest point of approach (CPA). Fig. 1
                     (A) shows two aircraft on two tracks T
                     1 and T
                     2, with headings indicated by the tracks’ arrows and nominal speeds S
                     1 and S
                     2. Given their current positions, headings and speeds, the two points CPA
                     1 and CPA
                     2 will be computed. Both aircraft will reach CPA
                     1 and CPA
                     2 after a time period known as the time to CPA (T2CPA). When both aircraft are at CPA
                     1 and CPA
                     2, the distance between them is minimum. The collision risk is computed based on the distances d
                     1 and d
                     2 from the current positions of the aircraft to the CPA
                     1 and CPA
                     2 points. Collision risk can be only computed if the T2CPA is non-negative (Fig. 1(A)). Fig. 1(B) shows a case where the T2CPA is negative since the CPA already passed and aircraft are flying away from each other.

The Hsu CRM assumes that aircraft are represented by circular cylinders of diameter λxy
                      and height λz
                     . The collision risk is generally speaking the probability that the two cylinders (i.e., representing two aircraft) intersect. To compute collision risk for a pair of aircraft, the first aircraft is represented by a double-sized cylinder with diameter λxy
                      and height 2λz
                     , denoted by C, while the second aircraft by a point particle, denoted by P. For a collision to occur P must enter C through its vertical side or through its top or bottom. A horizontal overlap of the two aircraft occurs when P enters the infinite cylinder C
                     ∞ of radius λxy
                      obtained by extending upwards and downwards the cylinder representing the first aircraft.

In the Hsu CRM, the collision risk of a pair of aircraft is estimated for a time interval tcr
                     . As illustrated in Fig. 2
                     , the pair of aircraft are assumed to be at nominal distances d
                     1 and d
                     2 from an intersection. The collision risk for given values of S
                     1 and S
                     2 (the speeds of the two aircraft) is determined. The general formula is depicted by Eq. (1).

The Hsu CRM considers positional error of an aircraft when computing collision risk. Two probability distributions are used to represent the along-track (longitudinal) and the cross-track (lateral) errors, both shown in Fig. 2 by the red and green colors, respectively. Based on extreme value theorem (ICAO, 2008), collision risk models usually use the double exponential distribution to model aircraft positional error caused by its deviations along and cross its original track.


                     Safety: There are two basic approaches for determining whether an airspace is acceptably safe (ICAO, 2001). The first approach compares the ATS against a reference ATS that has the same safety related characteristics and has been judged to be safe. While the second approach (which is being adopted in this study) is by estimating the collision risk in an ATS and comparing it against a threshold value known as the TLS. TLS expresses the level of risk deemed tolerable in any given airspace. For an en-route airspace (the focus of this research) the TLS is 5.0 ×

                     ) in an ATS, the collision risk CR(aci, acj
                     ) is estimated every second for the time interval tcr
                     . To be more conservative, the maximum collision risk value is chosen and is computed by CRm
                     (aci, acj
                     ) to represent the collision risk between a pair of aircraft. The CRm
                     (aci, acj
                     ) is multiplied by two to convert it to fatal accident per hour (one collision counts as two fatal accidents). An ATS is said to be safe if for each pair of aircraft, their fatal accident per operation (computed based on their maximum collision risk) is less than or equal to the TLS; that is,

A TLS is used for each pair of aircraft instead of averaging over the aircraft within a sector to use a more risk averse strategy.


                     Sector and traffic design: Although there are several aspects that may be taken into consideration when it comes to sector design, the number of crossings and the crossings angles are more vital from a collision risk perspective. Thus, our main focus here is to design sectors with a fixed number of crossings and all crossing angles are within a certain angle interval. For traffic, we assign a certain number of aircraft to the tracks in a sector and choose aircraft speeds from a certain speed interval.


                     Distance separation variables: For a pair of aircraft aci
                      and acj
                     , the collision risk CR(aci, acj
                     ) is directly related to the separating distance between them at the CPA, i.e., the smaller the separating distance the higher the collision risk. Thus if an ATS is judged to be unsafe according to Inequality 4, then this can be rectified by increasing the separation distance between the pair.


                     Fig. 3
                      shows all possible relations between any pair of aircraft regardless of their flight level. A pair of aircraft can be on the same track (Fig. 3(A)) or on two different tracks. If the pair of aircraft are on two different tracks, then these two tracks may be either: (1) crossing (according to the direction of the traffic on the track) whether the crossing point is inside (Fig. 3(B)) or outside (Fig. 3(C)) the sector; (2) not crossing according to the traffic direction on the tracks (Fig. 3(D, E)); or (3) parallel whether the tracks have the same directions (Fig. 3(F)) or opposite directions (Fig. 3(G)).

Three variables are used to apply distance separation between pairs of aircraft as follows: longitudinal using the longSep variable as in Fig. 3(A), crossing using the crossSep variable as in Fig. 3(B, C), and lateral using the lateralSep variable as in Fig. 3(D–G).


                     Applying separation: A high-level illustration of how separation is applied between pairs of aircraft using the three separation variables is presented. Consider the following example (Fig. 4
                     (1)) where there are four aircrafts on two tracks T
                     1 and T
                     2 crossing at C
                     1, 2. Each aircraft has an activation time (i.e., the time it enters the sector) and a speed. The four aircraft get first arranged according to the time each aircraft will reach the crossing point C
                     1, 2. This arrangement will be ac
                     1 → ac
                     2 → ac
                     3 → ac
                     4. The basic idea to apply distance separation between aircraft is to fix the position of an aircraft and then adjust the activation time (and/or velocity in longitudinal relations) of the following aircraft in the arrangement.

Let us assume that ac
                     1 is at the crossing point as shown in Fig. 4(1). The distance d gets computed between ac
                     2 and the crossing point (or ac
                     1). If d < crossSep holds, then the activation time of ac
                     2 is increased so that 
                        
                           d
                           =
                           c
                           r
                           o
                           s
                           s
                           S
                           e
                           p
                        
                      holds. This has the effect of shifting ac
                     2 position backward away from the crossing point. According to the arrangement, the previous process gets repeated for ac
                     2 and ac
                     3 (Fig. 4(2)), i.e., assume ac
                     2 is at the crossing point and adjust the activation time of ac
                     3 if necessary. Finally, the previous process is repeated for ac
                     3 and ac
                     4 (Fig. 4(3)), with the exception that 1. d gets compared against longSep since the pair has a longitudinal relation; and 2. the speed of ac
                     4 must be less than or equal to the speed of ac
                     3, so that the separation between them holds or increases for their remaining flying time in the sector. For a pair of aircraft aci
                      and acj
                     , define dr
                     
                        i, j
                      as the ratio between the distance per second of aci
                      and the distance per second of acj
                     . The dr
                     1, 2, dr
                     2, 3 and dr
                     3, 4 are computed for each pair ac
                     1 → ac
                     2, ac
                     2 → ac
                     3, and ac
                     3 → ac
                     4.

The previous example can be extended by adding ac
                     5 on a third track T
                     3 which intersects with T
                     2 at C
                     2, 3 (Fig. 5
                     (1)). Again the aircraft are arranged according to the time each aircraft will reach C
                     2, 3, i.e., ac
                     5 → ac
                     1 → ac
                     3 → ac
                     4. The distance d between ac
                     1 and ac
                     5 gets computed when ac
                     5 is at C
                     2, 3 and d gets compared against crossSep. Assume that d < crossSep holds and the activation time of ac
                     1 is adjusted accordingly and increased by s seconds. To maintain the distance separation already applied at the crossing C
                     1, 2, dr
                     
                        i, j
                      is used to adjust the activation time of any aircraft that arrived after ac
                     1 in the C
                     1, 2 arrangement. For instance, if the activation time of ac
                     1 increased by 
                        
                           s
                           =
                           30
                        
                      seconds, then the activation time of ac
                     2 will increase by 30 × dr
                     1, 2, and the activation time of ac
                     3 will increase by (30 × dr
                     1, 2) × dr
                     2, 3, and so on.

As shown in Fig. 5(2), the tracks T
                     1 and T
                     3 are parallel, therefore, ac
                     2 and ac
                     5 have a lateral relation. The two aircraft will be arranged according to which of them will reach the crossing point on its track before the other, i.e., the arrangement will be ac
                     5 → ac
                     2. When ac
                     5 is at C
                     2, 3, the distance d gets computed between ac
                     2 and C
                     1, 2, gets compared to latSep, and the activation time of ac
                     2 gets adjusted if d < latSep. Again after adjusting ac
                     2, all its predecessor aircraft in previously considered arrangements will be re-adjusted using the dr
                     
                        i, j
                      term.

Each pair of tracks Ti
                      and Tj
                      can be either crossing or lateral, and an arrangement of the aircraft on both tracks will be used to apply separation. For the previously discussed separation procedure to work, the aircraft arrangements in an ATS should not have any cyclic relations between the aircrafts. For instance, if aci
                      appears before acj
                      in one arrangement and after acj
                      in another arrangement, then this will create a cycle when adjusting the activation time (i.e., acj
                      will be adjusted according to aci
                      then aci
                      according to acj
                     ). To prevent such cyclic relations, the aircraft arrangements are modeled as a directed graph, and the graph gets checked for cycles. If found, the cycles are eliminated during the design of the traffic for any given sector.


                     Minimum distance separation: It is trivial to say that using large values for the separation variable longSep, crossSep, and latSep will well separate the aircraft from each other. However, we are interested in the minimum values (minLongSep, minCrossSep, and minLatSep) for the three variables which make an ATS safe according to Inequality (4) and can contribute to the definition of sector capacity. The problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the following two objectives:

Minimize Objective 2: The number of aircraft pairs which violates Inequality (4).

For any given ATS, the resulting Pareto front gives us the relation between the separation values and the number of aircraft pairs which violates the TLS. The separation values corresponding to zero pairs of aircraft violating the TLS are the minimum separation values which makes the ATS safe. Furthermore, this helps us to investigate the relation between the minimum separation values required for an ATS to be safe and the sector and traffic characteristics of that ATS, and how the minimum separation values differ with different sector and traffic characteristics.

The proposed methodology is illustrated in Fig. 6
                     . We first design an ATS with certain sector characteristics (e.g., sector volume, number of crossings and crossings’ angles) and traffic characteristics (e.g., number of aircraft, speeds). We then use MOEA to find the minimum separation values, where the separation values in each chromosome will be used to produce an ATS with these separation values applied. The ATS will be simulated, collision risk will be evaluated and number of aircraft pairs violating the TLS will be determined. This information will be feedback to the MOEA to guide the stochastic search.

In spite of the current objectives considered and results presented in this study, we stress that other objectives can easily be incorporated in the proposed methodology. In case that a certain separation variable is more important than others due to special conditions in an airspace/sector (e.g., weather conditions), then this separation variable can be assigned a higher weight than others in Objective 1.

The minimum separation values which makes the ATS safe (i.e., the separation values corresponding to zero pairs of aircraft violating the TLS) can directly be used in estimating the maximum capacity of the sector (i.e., the maximum number of aircraft flying in the sector at a certain time period). Such capacity can easily be linked to the sector and traffic characteristics. Furthermore, other objectives such as certain capacity level, environmental impact/fuel emissions, or air traffic controller workload can replace the safety objective (Objective 2) or be added as additional objective(s). Here the methodology will investigate the relation of the separation values and the new objective(s) given certain sector and traffic characteristics.

Airspace sectors may take various shapes, however for consistency with other studies (e.g., Alam et al., 2013; Willemain, 2003), we adopt a circular shape. The sector size is captured by the circle radius (e.g., 100 nautical miles as in Willemain (2003)). When we allow aircraft to have different flight levels, then the sector will be cylinder. Let numCross be the number of crossings and [minCA°, maxCA°] be the interval for crossing angles, with minCA° is the minimum crossing angle (CA) and maxCA° is the maximum CA.

As an initial step to our sector design procedures, we choose a circle radius. Then we divide the circle circumference to a set circPoints of equidistant points, where each point is defined by its latitude (Lat) and longitude (Lon) coordinates. We will use the points in the circPoints set to be the entry and exit points of any track in the sector. We define track Ti
                      by the track ID (i) and three points, an entry point (enLat, enLon), a waypoint (wpLat, wpLon), and an exit point (exLat, exLon). Thus a track is defined by the tuple 〈i, (enLat, enLon), (wpLat, wpLon), (exLat, exLon)〉. The traffic flying on the track enters the sector from the entry point, then fly in a straight line to the waypoint and then to the exit point to exit the sector. We propose the following procedure to generate two crossing tracks Ti
                      and Tj
                      with a CA in the interval [minCA°, maxCA°]. We define the crossing C
                     
                        i, j
                      between the two tracks Ti
                      and Tj
                      by the tuple ⟨i, j, crossLat, crossLon⟩, where crossLat and crossLon are the crossing point latitude and longitude coordinates.


                     Designing two crossing tracks example: 
                     Fig. 7
                      illustrates an example for two crossing tracks generated by Algorithm 1
                     . A random point is chosen as the crossing point, which becomes as well the waypoints of T
                     1 and T
                     2 (Steps 3 and 7). The entry point of T
                     1 (the red dot) is chosen randomly from circPoints (Step 4), and the exit point (the red arrow) is determined as in Steps 5 and 6. The entry point of T
                     2 (the blue dot) creates a crossing angle A (Step 9), and the exit point of T
                     2 (the blue arrow) does not coincide with the exit point of T
                     1 (Step 11). □

As shown in Fig. 7, a track may not be a straight line from its entry to exit points. Algorithm 1 is similar to what was proposed in Alam et al. (2013), except for Step 11 and allowing traffic on different flight levels to fly on opposite directions on the same track (here the CA may not belong to [minCA°, maxCA°] due to the traffic directions). All the following procedures are novel compared to Alam et al. (2013).

We incorporate Algorithm 1 in the following procedure to generate a sector with numCross crossings. Let Tracks be the set of tracks in a sector, and Crossings be the set of size numCross which contain all (inside and outside) crossings of a sector. As we will show in the next procedure, we generate tracks in an iterative manner. Each time a new track Ti
                      is introduced, let crossTi
                      be the set of crossings between Ti
                      and already existing tracks in Tracks, and numCrossTi
                      be the size of crossTi
                     .


                     Sector Design Example. To illustrate how Algorithm 2
                      works, let us consider the following example where we design a sector with 
                        
                           n
                           u
                           m
                           C
                           r
                           o
                           s
                           s
                           =
                           4
                        
                      crossings and all crossing angles are within [0°, 45°]. According to Steps 5–8, we add the first two crossing tracks T
                     1 and T
                     2 (as shown in Fig. 7) generated by Algorithm 1. The set Tracks contains T
                     1 and T
                     2, the set Crossings contains C
                     1, 2, and the sector has one crossing (
                        
                           c
                           o
                           u
                           n
                           t
                           =
                           1
                        
                     ). For all the following pair of crossing tracks we generate by Algorithm 1, we apply the Steps 9–30. We generate another pair of crossing tracks T
                     3 and T
                     4 (Fig. 8(A)), and we apply Step 11 for each track. We find that T
                     3 and T
                     4 do not intersect with any of the existing tracks either inside or outside the sector. Thus we approve them and add them to Tracks and add the crossing C
                     3, 4 to Crossings. The sector has two crossings (
                        
                           c
                           o
                           u
                           n
                           t
                           =
                           2
                        
                     ).

We generate another pair of crossing tracks T
                     5 and T
                     6 (Fig. 8(B)), and apply Step 11 for both of them. We find that T
                     5 intersects with T
                     3 and the CA is more than 45°. As well, we find that T
                     6 intersects with the four already existing tracks, so adding T
                     6 to the sector will violate the 
                        
                           n
                           u
                           m
                           C
                           r
                           o
                           s
                           s
                           i
                           n
                           g
                           =
                           4
                        
                      requirement. Thus we discard the two tracks and generate two new crossing tracks T
                     5 and T
                     6 as shown in (Fig. 8(C)). Again T
                     6 intersects with the four already existing tracks, so it will be discarded. T
                     5 intersects with T
                     2 inside the sector and with T
                     1 outside the sector, adding two crossings with acceptable CA to the sector, so it will be approved. Fig. 8
                     (D) shows the sector with five tracks (T
                     1, T
                     2, T
                     3, T
                     4 and T
                     5) in Tracks, four crossings (C
                     1, 2, C
                     3, 4, C
                     1, 5 and C
                     2, 5) in Crossings, and all crossing angles are within [0°, 45°]. □

Once the sector is designed, we assume that each track has different flight levels from 29,000 feet to 41,000 feet inclusive with a vertical separation of 1000 feet between any two successive levels. However, we stress that traffic in all flight levels has the same direction of flow from the entry to the exit points.

After designing the sector, we start assigning aircraft to its tracks. Let N be the number of aircraft. For each aircraft, we choose a track ID, a flight level, a speed and an activation time. Recalling our previous discussion in Section 2 regarding how distance separation is applied, aircraft arrangements in an ATS should not have any cyclic relations between the aircraft. There are several ways to detect if cycles exist in the aircraft arrangements. We found it more convenient to model the aircraft arrangements as a fully connected directed graph (DG), where nodes are aircraft, and a directed edge go from aircraft aci
                      to another aircraft acj
                      if aci
                      appears before acj
                      in any arrangement. We then use the Tarjan cycle detection algorithm (Tarjan, 1972) to detect all cycles (strongly connected components). The Tarjan algorithm’s running time is linear in the number of nodes (ND) and edges (E) in DG, i.e., 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           N
                           D
                           +
                           E
                           )
                        
                     .

The following procedure describes how traffic is generated. Let Aircraft be the set of N aircraft, [minS, maxS] be an interval for aircraft speeds,

To illustrate Algorithm 3
                     , let us consider the following example.


                     ATS0 example. Consider the sector we designed in the previous section (Fig. 8(D)), which has 5 tracks and 4 crossings. Here we have four pairs of crossing tracks: (T
                     1, T
                     2) with crossing C
                     1, 2, (T
                     3, T
                     4) with crossing C
                     3, 4, (T
                     1, T
                     5) with crossing C
                     1, 5, and (T
                     2, T
                     5) with crossing C
                     2, 5. The rest of the pairs of tracks (T
                     1, T
                     3), (T
                     1, T
                     4), (T
                     2, T
                     3), (T
                     3, T
                     5), (T
                     2, T
                     4) and (T
                     4, T
                     5) are lateral tracks denoted by L
                     1, 3, L
                     1, 4, L
                     2, 3, L
                     3, 5, L
                     2, 4 and L
                     4, 5. Assume that we want to assign 
                        
                           N
                           =

                      aircraft, with different flight levels, speeds in the interval of [250, 350] knots, and activation times in 5 minutes window.

Each time we randomly generate a new aircraft, the aircraft arrangements are determined and converted to a DG. The new aircraft will be added to the existing aircraft if the corresponding DG is cycle free. Fig. 9
                      shows the directed graphs generated each time we add a new aircraft to Aircraft, and Table 1
                      shows the aircraft arrangements computed when adding ac
                     5 (corresponds to DG4 in Fig. 9). When assigning ac
                     6 to track ID: 5, speed 259 knots, FL 38,000 feet, and activation time 00:02:31, this created a cycle (ac
                     3 → ac
                     1 → ac
                     6 → ac
                     3) as shown in DG5 in Fig. 9. So ac
                     6 was re-generated as track ID: 5, speed 271 knots, FL 39,000 feet, and activation time 00:01:12, and again this created a cycle as shown in DG6 in Fig. 9. Another cycle appeared in DG12 in Fig. 9.

The aircraft in Table 2
                      are the 13 aircraft generated by Algorithm 3. The final aircraft arrangements are presented in Table 3
                      (corresponds to DG15 in Fig. 9), and the arrangements have no cycles. Table 3 shows the aircraft arrangements according to every pair of tracks, whether the pair is crossing or lateral tracks. For instance for crossing C
                     1, 2 (first row), ac
                     3 will be the first aircraft to reach the crossing point, followed by ac
                     9 then ac
                     11 then ac
                     13 and so on. For lateral tracks L
                     1, 3, ac
                     10 will reach the waypoint of T
                     3 followed by ac
                     2, then ac
                     11 will reach the waypoint of T
                     1 followed by ac
                     13, ac
                     1 and ac
                     6. □

In this section, we present a formal procedure to apply distance separation as we previously discussed in Section 2. This procedure processes separations based on the aircraft arrangements (for example, see Table 3). Let Arrangements be the set of all aircraft arrangements in an ATS, AR be a single arrangement, |AR| be the number of aircraft in arrangement AR, DR be the set of distance ratios dr
                     
                        i, j
                     .


                     Algorithm 4
                      takes as an input the aircraft arrangements, and the distance separation variables longSep, crossSep and latSep (Step 1), then separation will be applied for each aircraft arrangement (Steps 3–33). First (Steps 5–9), we check if the arrangement is for crossing tracks (crossAR will be true) or lateral tracks (latAR will be true). We then start iterating through each successive pair of aircraft in the arrangement (Steps 10–32). As per Step 11, let the pair of aircraft be aci
                      and acj
                     , which are assigned to tracks Ti
                      and Tj
                     , respectively. Based on whether crossAR is true or latAR is true, we will choose the points we use to apply separation (Steps 12–16). If the arrangement is for crossing tracks (i.e., crossAR is true), then the crossing point – as illustrated in Fig. 4 – will be used in the following computations for both aircraft (Step 13). Otherwise as illustrated in Fig. 5(2), the waypoint of Ti
                      will be considered for aci
                      and the waypoint of Tj
                      will be considered for acj
                     . After deciding which separation variable we will use (Steps 20–27), we compare the separation value Sep with the distance d computed in Steps 18 and 19. If d < Sep, then the activation time of acj
                      will be adjusted to make 
                        
                           d
                           =
                           S
                           e
                           p
                        
                      (Step 29). In Step 30, the activation time of any predecessor aircraft of acj
                      in any aircraft arrangement that was already processed for separation will be adjusted (as explained before in relation to Fig. 5(1)).

@&#EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN@&#

In this section, we illustrate all relevant details used to validate the proposed methodology and conduct experiments.


                     Air traffic scenarios:To demonstrate how the minimum distance separation values differ with different sector/traffic characteristics, we design different ATSs as follows. We use Algorithms 1 and 2 to design sectors of cylindrical shapes with randomly chosen radius in the range [100, 200] nautical miles, and have the following two characteristics:
                        
                           •
                           Number of crossings: Number of crossings may be low (Cl
                              ) in the range of 2–4 crossings or high (Ch
                              ) in the range of 8–10 crossings.

Crossing angles: Crossing angles can be narrow (Agn
                              ) in the range of [5°, 45°] or wide (Agw
                              ) in the range of [120°, 165°] (EUROCONTROL, 1997).

A sector is defined by a combination of characteristics of whether it has low or high number of crossings, and whether it has narrow or wide crossing angles. Then the sector will be initialized by randomly choosing a value for each characteristic from its associated range. Therefore, we have four types of sectors: Sector[0] (Ch, Agw
                     ), Sector[1] (Ch, Agn
                     ), Sector[2] (Cl, Agw
                     ) and Sector[3] (Cl, Agn
                     ).

As well, traffic has two characteristics as follows.

                        
                           •
                           Number of aircraft (traffic density): The number of aircraft N activated in an ATS is in the range of [21, 25] aircraft for high traffic density (Dh
                              ) or [8, 12] aircraft for low traffic density (Dl
                              ).

Aircraft speed: Aircraft speed is categorized as slow (Ss
                              ) in the range of [250, 300] knots or fast (Sf
                              ) in the range of [450, 500] knots.

The traffic is defined by a combination of characteristics of whether it has low or high density, and whether aircraft have slow or fast speeds. Then the traffic will be initialized by randomly choosing a value for each characteristic from its associated range. Therefore, we have four types of traffic: Traffic[0] (Dh, Sf
                     ), Traffic[1] (Dh, Ss
                     ), Traffic[2] (Dl, Sf
                     ), and Traffic[3] (Dl, Ss
                     ).

The matrix (Fig. 10
                     ) has four rows for sector types and four columns for traffic types, with a total of 16 combinations of sector and traffic features. This defines the air traffic scenarios space we consider to generate scenarios with different sector/traffic characteristics. The intersection of row Sector[i] and column Traffic[j] defines a class of scenarios CATS[i][j] according to the combined sector and traffic features.

For each cell, we sample 100 scenarios. Every time a scenario is generated for a given matrix cell, the values of traffic and sector features are chosen randomly from the respective intervals we previously mentioned.


                     MOEA. We use the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) presented in Zhang and Li (2007) to minimize the sum of the separation three variables (

                           n
                           g
                           S
                           e
                           p
                           +
                           c
                           r
                           o

                     ) while minimizing the number of aircraft pairs which violates the TLS (Inequality (4)). MOEA/D decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of different scalar optimization subproblems or similar multiobjective optimization subproblems, then optimize these subproblems simultaneously using a population-based method, where optimizing each subproblem only uses information from its neighboring subproblems. Several approaches may be used to decompose the multiobjective optimization problem including the weighted sum approach (the one we use here), Tchebycheff Approach, Boundary Intersection (BI) Approach. Using simple decomposition methods, MOEA/D outperforms or performs similarly to multiobjective genetic local search (Ishibuchi & Murata, 1998) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (Deb, Pratap, Agarwal, & Meyarivan, 2002) on continuous multiobjective optimization problems while having lower computational complexity at each generation.

A chromosome (i.e., a potential solution) holds the three separation variables. We set a lower bound value of 5 nautical miles and an upper bound value of 200 nautical miles for the three variables. We use a population and niche sizes of 52 and 20, respectively, and each run lasts for 1500 generations.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, we discuss results which validate the proposed methodology and procedures, while illustrating how the minimum separation values required for an ATS to be safe relate to the sector/traffic characteristics of the ATS. We will first re-visit the ATS0 example, and then present the results for different classes of ATSs.

In the ATS0 example, we have

                      nautical miles, there are 24 pairs violating the TLS. We recall that 5 nautical miles was the lower bound value we used for the three separation variables, thus applying 5 nautical miles for the three separation variables decreased the number of violating pairs from 30 pairs when no distance separation is applied to 24 pairs. Between the two ends, the Pareto front shows that as the summation of the three separation variables decreases the number of aircraft pairs violating the TLS increases.

Different ATSs will have different minimum separation values. Fig. 12
                      shows the Pareto front of four sample ATSs, each belong to a different class of scenarios.

We will move to investigate the relation between the minimum separation required for safety and the sector/traffic characteristics of ATSs. To satisfy the safe condition, we focus our attention only on the minimum separation solution (the top left solution of the Pareto front) where no aircraft pairs violate the TLS.

Given the different classes of ATSs shown in Fig. 10, we generate 100 scenarios for each class (each cell CATS[i][j]) in the matrix. For each scenario of each cell, we use a MOEA algorithm to determine the values minLongSep, minCrossSep and minLatSep. To determine the average minimum values of the three separation variables for each class, we compute the mean and standard deviation (Std) of minLongSep, minCrossSep and minLatSep across the scenarios of each class. Not all the 100 scenarios will be considered for each class. For some scenarios, the MOEA does not reach the solution (i.e., longSep, crossSep and latSep values) where no aircraft pairs violate the TLS before its stopping criteria is met (i.e., maximum number of generations), thus these scenarios are discarded. Furthermore, some scenarios do not contain lateral tracks, i.e., all tracks are crossing either inside or outside the sector. Tables 4
                     –6 show the mean and standard deviation (std) for minLongSep (Table 4), minCrossSep (Table 5), and minLatSep (Table 6) values over ATSs for each class.

To show how the required minimum separation values minLongSep, minCrossSep and minLatSep differ from one class of ATSs to another with different sector/traffic properties, we will compare the mean and standard deviation of each separation variable in one class of ATSs with other classes. For this comparison, we use a two-sample t-test to see if there are statistically significant differences between the mean and standard deviation computed based on the sample of ATSs for each class. The null hypothesis for the two-sample t-test is that means are not equal at 5% significant level. For each comparison, we present if the means are statistically different (“‘Yes”) or not (“ No”), the t-value and the degrees of freedom (df) of the t-test. We will show the results for each sector/traffic characteristic under consideration in this study.


                     Wide/narrow angles of crossings: The first row in Table 7
                      shows the two-sample t-test results between each class in Sector[0] row in Table 4 and the class below it in Sector[1] row, i.e., compares the pairs of classes (CATS[0][0], CATS[1][0]), (CATS[0][1],CATS[1][1]), (CATS[0][2], CATS[1][2]) and (CATS[0][3], CATS[1][3]) in Table 4. This shows if the mean of minLongSep statistically differs between ATSs with wide crossing angles and ATSs with narrow crossing angles when the number of crossings is high across different traffic characteristics. Similarly, the second row in Table 7 shows the results when comparing each class in Sector[2] row in Table 4 and the class below it in Sector[3] row. This shows if the mean of minLongSep statistically differs between ATSs with wide crossing angles and ATSs with narrow crossing angles when the number of crossings is low across different traffic characteristics.


                     Tables 4 and 7 show that the mean of minLongSep is statistically significant in all cases except for comparing the classes CATS[0][1] and CATS[1][1]. This shows that minimum longitudinal separations minLongSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles to be safe is greater than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles. Recalling that a track generated by Algorithm 1 may not be a straight line from its entry point to its exit point, the track’s heading will change at its waypoint. This heading change is affected by the crossing angle. Thus, the longitudinal separation between two aircraft on the same track, one passed the waypoint and the other did not, is affected by the crossing angle.


                     Table 8
                      repeats the previous analysis but for the means of the minCrossSep shown in Table 5. Tables 5 and 8 show that the mean of minCrossSep is statistically significant in all cases. This shows that minimum crossing separations minCrossSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles to be safe is smaller than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles.

As we may expect, values of lateral separation should not be affected by the crossings angles. However, the angles of the crossings we consider for designing an ATS will impact the type of lateral tracks which may exist in the ATS. Tables 6 and 9
                      show that minimum lateral separations minLatSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles and high number of crossings is higher than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles or with low number of crossings.


                     High/low number of crossings: The first row in Table 10
                      shows the two-sample t-test results when comparing each class in Sector[0] row in Table 4 and the class below it in Sector[3] row. While the second row in Table 10 shows the results when comparing Sector[1] row and Sector[4] row in Table 4. The results show that the minLongSep statistically differs between ATSs with high number of crossings and ATSs with low number of crossings only in few cases, mainly in low density ATSs with wide crossing angles.


                     Table 11
                      shows that the minCrossSep statistically differs between ATSs with high number of crossings and ATSs with low number of crossings almost in all the cases. According to Sector[1] and Sector[3] rows in Table 5 for ATSs with narrow crossing angles, crossing separations minCrossSep required in ATSs with high number of crossings to be safe is greater than those required in ATSs with low number of crossings. This is consistent with the results in in Table 8 where ATSs with narrow crossing angles require a greater minCrossSep to be safe than in ATSs with wide crossing angles.


                     Table 12
                      shows that for ATSs with wide crossing angles, high number of crossings requires a greater minLatSep than ATSs with number low crossings. This is not the case for ATSs with narrow crossing angles.


                     Traffic properties: 
                     Tables 13
                      and 14
                      show the significant results of the two-sample t-tests performed for the three separation variables regarding traffic properties (aircraft speed and density). The tables show that the statistical significant is there only between very few classes.

@&#DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presented a carefully designed methodology that guarantees the production of air traffic scenarios with pre-defined sector/traffic properties, and satisfy safe separation. The methodology relies on a stochastic multi-objective optimization algorithm to optimize separation values. The algorithm then outputs the set of non-dominated solutions representing the trade-off between separation values and the best attainable target level of safety.

The methodology was used to illustrate how the minimum separation values differ in ATSs with different sector/traffic properties. Although the proposed methodology is generic and flexible in generating ATSs with wide range of characteristics, our results and conclusions are directly related to the classes of ATSs we considered and the range of values we defined for each characteristic. For classes of ATSs considered in this study with the same sector size, we conclude that:

                        
                           1.
                           Minimum longitudinal separations minLongSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles to be safe is greater than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles.

Minimum crossing separations minCrossSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles to be safe is smaller than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles.

Minimum lateral separations minLatSep required in ATSs with wide crossing angles and high number of crossings is higher than those required in ATSs with narrow crossing angles or with low number of crossings.

Minimum lateral separations minLatSep statistically differs between ATSs with high number of crossings and ATSs with low number of crossings only in few cases, mainly in low density ATSs with wide crossing angles.

In ATSs with narrow crossing angles, crossing separations minCrossSep required in ATSs with high number of crossings to be safe is greater than those required in ATSs with low number of crossings.

In ATSs with wide crossing angles, high number of crossings requires a greater minLatSep than ATSs with number low crossings.

Traffic properties affect the minimum separation values only in very few cases.

From the previous discussion, we conclude that deciding on distance separation values cannot be done in isolation of the sector/traffic properties of the airspace, especially when minimum separation values are required. Furthermore, sector properties have significantly more effect on the minimum separation values than traffic properties. For future work, we will be using this methodology within different simulation environments to estimate air traffic capacity and to design real-time risk assessment tools.
