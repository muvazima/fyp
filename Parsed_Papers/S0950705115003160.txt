                  Decision trees have been widely used in data mining and machine learning as a comprehensible knowledge representation. Minimal cost decision tree construction plays a crucial role in cost sensitive learning. Recently, many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem. These algorithms choose an appropriate cut point of a numeric attribute by computing all possible cut points and assign a node through test all attributes. Therefore, the efficiency of these algorithms for large data sets is often unsatisfactory. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose a cost sensitive decision tree algorithm with two adaptive mechanisms to learn cost sensitive decision trees from training data sets based on C4.5 algorithm. The two adaptive mechanisms play an important role in cost sensitive decision tree construction. The first mechanism, adaptive selecting the cut point (ASCP) mechanism, selects the cut point adaptively to build a classifier rather than calculates each possible cut point of an attribute. It improves the efficiency of evaluating numeric attributes for cut point selection significantly. The second mechanism, adaptive removing attribute (ARA) mechanism, removes some redundant attributes in the process of selecting node. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on fourteen UCI data sets with representative test cost Normal distribution. Compared with the CS-C4.5 algorithm, the proposed algorithm significantly increases efficiency.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Data mining is one of the most actively researched areas in information science with important real world applications [42]. Classification is one of the most important tasks in the data mining domain [19,23,24]. There are several techniques for classification, such as k-nearest neighbor algorithms [3], support vector machines [5,14,35], artificial neural networks [16,20], decision trees [1,8,46], rough set theory [25,32,41,45,50], and so on. Decision tree is a useful choice when the tasks are to classify or predict outcomes and to generate easy-to-interpret rules [6,15,39].

The structure of decision tree is simple and easy to interpret. Typical algorithms on decision tree induction, such as ID3 [33], CART [21] and C4.5 [34], have been successfully applied to a broad range of tasks from learning to diagnose medical cases to learning to assess credit risk of loan applicants. Existing techniques aim at training classifiers to minimize the expected number of errors [4,17,26,43]. This implicitly assumes that all classification errors involve the same cost [22,38]. Actually, different misclassification errors often lead to different costs. This leads to a new and hot research topic, cost sensitive learning, which addresses classification problems with cost. It aims to reduce the average total cost involved in the learning process.

Cost sensitive learning [9,27,49] is an extension of traditional non-cost sensitive data mining and machine learning [38,40]. Test cost and misclassification cost are two most important types in real world applications [37]. The test cost is money, time, or other resources while we obtain attribute values of an object [18]. The misclassification cost is the cost of assigning an object to class j when it actually belongs in class i 
                     [10,11,48]. Several researches focus on the test cost, but fail to take into account misclassification cost. However, it is important to consider both test cost and misclassification cost together [28] in many applications.

Some algorithms such as IDX [31], 
                        
                           λ
                        
                     -ID3 [29], CSGain [7] and CS-C4.5 [13] have been developed to obtain appropriate cost sensitive decision trees. Existing cost sensitive learning techniques work well on small data sets. However, there are still a lot of redundant computations in the process of decision tree construction. On the one hand, the existing techniques choose an appropriate cut point of a numeric attribute by computing all possible cut points. On the other hand, all attributes are tested in the process of assigning node. Therefore, these algorithms have a low efficiency on medium or large data sets. For example, the run time of the CS-C4.5 algorithm is nearly 10,000ms on Magic data set. This motivates us to propose a new approach for this issue.

In this paper, based on C4.5, we put forward a cost sensitive decision tree algorithm with two adaptive mechanisms. It is an effective method for cost-sensitive decision tree construction. We simply refer to it as ACSDT algorithm. The major contributions of this method are twofold. On the one hand, an adaptive selecting cut point (ASCP) scheme for cut points selecting is assigned. It greatly reduces the amount of candidate cut points than the traditional mechanism of cut points selecting. On the other hand, we design an adaptive removing attribute (ARA) mechanism to remove some redundant attributes in nodes assigning procedure. This mechanism is adaptive to the data size involved rather than being fixed, so it is realistic. These two mechanisms are the key of the ACSDT algorithm. In a word, the new algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of cost sensitive decision tree construction.

The proposed algorithm is implemented with Java in our open resource software COSER (Cost sensitive rough sets) [30]. A representative distribution, namely Normal, is employed to generate test costs from a statistical viewpoint. We undertake experiments on fourteen data sets from the UCI (University of California-Irvine) library [2]. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ACSDT algorithm. The average total costs obtained by our algorithm are smaller than CS-C4.5 algorithm [13] on twelve data sets which are selected in this experiment. In addition, ACSDT algorithm is more efficient than the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm. In larger data sets, the improvement of efficiency tends to be quite significant. For example, it is more than 115,777ms improvement of the ACSDT algorithm on Clean data set.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews basic knowledge involved in this article, including the decision system with test costs and misclassification costs, and the calculation about average total cost of decision trees. In Section 3, we introduce the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm and give an analysis of the cut points selecting mechanism. Section 4 introduces the cost sensitive decision tree algorithm with two adaptive mechanisms. Section 5 adopts two examples to illustrate the cost sensitive decision tree construction and its average cost calculation procedure. Section 6 presents experiment schemes and provides a simple analysis of the results. Finally, Section 7 presents the conclusions and the future works.

In this section, we review the basic knowledge including the decision system with test costs and misclassification costs, and the calculation about average total cost of decision trees.

We adopt the test cost independent model [36] to define the cost of a test set. That is,

                        . The test cost function can be stored in a vector. An example of text cost vector is listed in Table 2
                        . That is, the test costs of Mcv, Alkphos, Sgpt, Sgot, Gammagt, and Drinks are $5, $5, $4, $8, $3, and $5 respectively.

A numeric attribute can be used to classify once more in classify process. After an attribute is measured, we have known the values of this attribute, and it is no necessary for us to test it again. Hence, when attribute a is used again, we let 
                           
                              tc

Cost sensitive learning is an extension of traditional inductive learning for minimizing classification total cost. Learning from data with both test cost and misclassification cost is especially interesting. Recently, the CS-C4.5 algorithm for cost sensitive decision trees, which works well in real applications, has been published. In this section, we introduce the CS-C4.5 algorithm [13] and give a simple analysis with an example.

Attribute selection is a fundamental process in decision tree induction. In each induction step (i.e., generating a node) of building the decision tree, it is necessary to choose one attribute to split the remaining data. A lot of strategies, such as the information gain ratio function [34] and GINI index criterion [21], have been proposed for choosing the splitting attribute at each node. CS-C4.5 algorithm considers both information gain and test cost. The heuristic function in the CS-C4.5 algorithm is

                              . Therefore, the selected cut point of attribute Mcv is 88.

On EEG Eve State (Eeg) data set, the cut points and information gain of each attribute obtained by the CS-C4.5 algorithm are recorded. For simply, we show the candidate cut points of eight attributes on Eeg data set in Fig. 1
                        . The horizontal coordinate represents candidate cut points of attribute and the vertical coordinate represents the information gain. From Fig. 1 we can observe the following. Each attribute is evaluated nearly 400 times when selecting the best cut point on Eeg data set.

From the above example and experiment analysis, we can observe that this scheme of selecting a cut point is dissatisfactory since there are usually many attributes and many objects on each data set. The huge number of candidate cut points makes the computation space too large to search. Therefore, we study an algorithm with a new scheme for cut point selections in Section 4.

In this section, we introduce a heuristic function for attribute selection. An adaptive selecting cut point (ASCP) scheme is designed for cut point selections. We propose a cost sensitive decision tree algorithm with two adaptive mechanisms which is designed for minimal cost decision tree construction. This algorithm is called as ACSDT algorithm.

Attribute selection is a fundamental process in decision tree induction. The C4.5 algorithm adopts the information gain ratio as heuristic function. The information gain ratio of attribute a is

                         is the split information entropy of the attribute a. Obviously, when gain ratio of an attribute is larger, it contains more information.

Compared with the heuristic function of the CS-C4.5 algorithm, our heuristic function adopts information gain ratio to express the attribute’s classified ability rather than information gain. It can reduce biased towards attributes that have more values [34]. In addition, our heuristic function degrades to the heuristic function of the C4.5 algorithm when attribute a is used again.

In this section, an adaptive selecting cut point (ASCP) scheme is introduced in Algorithm 1. It gives us a detailed description of ASCP scheme for cut point selections. And it contains two main steps.

We only need evaluate three times for attribute Mcv in Example 3 by ASCP scheme. It is evaluated eleven times in Example 2 by the traditional cut points selecting mechanism. The traditional cut points selecting mechanism must evaluate 
                           
                              N
                              -
                              1
                           
                         times for each attribute if the N examples have distinct values. As networks connecting computational resources get faster, an increasing number unprecedented amounts of data occur in our life. N is typically very large. The ASCP scheme adopts an adaptive method for searching the best cut point without being influenced by N.

Despite ASCP scheme looks simplicity, it has a good performance for selecting the cut point of attributes. A simple experiment illustrates it clearly. We compare the traditional scheme of selecting cut points with ASCP scheme on a number of data sets. The candidate cut points and information gain of each attribute are recorded. The candidate cut points and information gain of twelve attributes on Wdbc data set are shown in Fig. 2
                        . The horizontal coordinate represents different candidate cut points of attribute and the vertical coordinate represents the gain ratio. With Fig. 2, we have the following observations.
                           
                              (1)
                              The ASCP scheme is very effective. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the ASCP scheme can select the best cut point in most cases.

From Fig. 2 (b), we can find that only for attributes

                                  the ASCP scheme can not obtain the best cut point. For other ten attributes, the ASCP scheme can obtain the best cut point. Hence, the performance of ASCP scheme is acceptable.

In addition, the calculation of the ASCP scheme is much smaller than the traditional scheme. It is easily find from Fig. 2, there are only less than 10 candidate cut points are evaluated by new scheme of each attribute.

In this section, we provide a detailed description of the ACSDT algorithm which is listed in Algorithm 2. It contains six main steps. In the following, we detail each of the steps of the algorithm.

contains Lines 2–4. If the objects are all of the same class or there are no remaining attributes on which the objects may be further partitioned, then the node becomes a leaf.

corresponds to Lines 7–19 which contain the key code of Algorithm 2. In this step, we select the best attribute among these attributes as a node. First, the max value and the minimal value of attribute a are obtained in Line 8. Then, we compute the median value and set a step of the attribute a for obtaining the value of the heuristic function

That is, the bigger of the parameter the more attribute be removed in the process of nodes selections. To illustrate the ARA mechanism clearly, an example is presented in Example 4.

                              . Similarly, we examine each attribute, in turn, and judge whether it should be deleted. Finally, the attribute with the highest heuristic function value is taken as the first node.

Decision trees are built using a set of data referred to as the training data set. A different set, is used to check the model, called the test data set. When we obtain a new object of the test data set, we can make a prediction on the state of the class variable by following the path in the tree from the root to a leaf node. The following example helps explain this process.

To test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we compare the performance of the ACSDT algorithm with the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm on fourteen standard data sets [2]. These standard data sets obtained from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases [2]: Biodegradability (Biodeg), Breast, Clean, Credit, Diabetes (Diab), EEG Eve State (Eeg), German, Ionosphere (Iono), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope project (Magic), Promoters (Prom), Sonar, Spam, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (Wdbc), and Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer (Wpbc). The information about these data sets are summarized in Table 6
                     . 
                        
                           |
                           C

                      is the number of condition attributes, 
                        
                           |
                           U

                      is the number of objects, and D is the name of the decision attribute.

Since these data sets have no test cost settings, for statistical purposes, we apply Normal distribution to generate random test costs in [1,10]. All the selected data sets are randomly split into two subsets: 60% for training and 40% for testing.

The misclassification cost is represented by a matrix which is defined as 
                        
                           mc

                      be 1 since we suppose all tests are undertaken in parallel.

In this section, we try to answer the following questions by experimentation.
                        
                           (1)
                           Is the ACSDT algorithm appropriates for the minimal cost decision tree construction?

Is the ACSDT algorithm efficient?

For the purposes of evaluating effectiveness of the ACSDT algorithm, we perform the ACSDT algorithm and CS-C4.5 algorithm with 300 different test cost settings on fourteen data sets with Normal distribution.


                        Fig. 4
                         shows three average total costs obtained by CS-C4.5 algorithm and ACSDT algorithm. AMC represents the average misclassification costs and ATC represents the average test costs in Fig. 4. From the results we observe the following.
                           
                              (1)
                              The ACSDT algorithm performs better than CS-C4.5 algorithm. As can be seen from Fig. 4 (a), the average total costs obtained by ACSDT algorithm are significant less than CS-C4.5 on selected data sets, especially on Credit, Diab and German data sets.

It is easy to find that the average misclassification costs obtained by the ACSDT algorithm are smaller than the CS-C4.5 algorithm on most cases.

Only on Iono data set do the average total costs obtained by CS-C4.5 algorithm are smaller than the ACSDT algorithm. On Clean, Eeg, Wdbc, and Wpbc data sets, two algorithms have nearly the same performance while our algorithm has a better performance than the CS-C4.5 algorithm on other nine data sets. However, our algorithm performs better than the CS-C4.5 algorithm on selected data sets.

On Eeg data set, the average misclassification cost obtained by ACSDT algorithm is bigger than the average misclassification cost obtained by CS-C4.5 algorithm. However, the average total cost obtained by ACSDT algorithm is smaller than the results obtained by CS-C4.5 algorithm. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the test cost and the misclassification cost.


                        Fig. 4 gives us an intuitive understanding of the results. To sum up, the performance of the ACSDT algorithm is better than the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm. Generally, the results obtained by the ACSDT algorithm are acceptable. In next Section, we will address the efficiency of the ACSDT algorithm.

We study the efficiency of the ACSDT algorithm by comparing the run time of the ACSDT algorithm with the CS-C4.5 algorithm. The run time of the two algorithms is shown in Fig. 5
                         which gives an intuitive understanding of results on fourteen data sets. With Fig. 5, we have the following observations.
                           
                              (1)
                              The ACSDT algorithm is more efficiency than CS-C4.5 algorithm. It is easy to find that the run time of the ACSDT algorithm is less than CS-C4.5 algorithm on all fourteen data sets we selected in this experiment.

On larger data sets the advantage of the new algorithm tend to be more significant. For instance, the run time of the ACSDT algorithm is 115,777ms shorter than the CS-C4.5 algorithm on Clean data set.

The run time of two algorithms depends on the data set size significantly. For example, the Magic data set has the longest run time while it also has the most objects and a rational number of attributes among the data sets tested.

From the above experiments, we can observe the following. (1) The ACSDT algorithm is very effective. The average total costs obtained by the proposed algorithm are smaller than the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm in most cases. Fig. 4 shows this situation clearly. (2) The proposed algorithm is significantly efficient compared with the CS-C4.5 algorithm. It is clear from Fig. 5 that the run time of the ACSDT algorithm is much lower than the existing algorithm. In a word, the performance of the ACSDT algorithm is better than the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm.

Minimal cost decision tree construction is an important task in applications. It is necessary to consider the test cost and the misclassification cost in these tasks. Existing techniques work well on small data sets. However, these techniques choose an appropriate cut point of a numeric attribute by computing all possible cut points. In addition, all attributes are tested in the process of assigning node. As a result, there are a lot of redundant computations in the process of decision tree construction. In this paper, we propose a cost sensitive decision tree algorithm with two adaptive mechanisms for minimal cost decision tree construction. The two adaptive mechanisms are adaptive selecting the cut point mechanism and adaptive removing attribute mechanism. They are improve the efficiency of evaluating numeric attributes for cut point selection and nodes assigning. We performed a set of experimental evaluation and demonstrated that the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and efficient than the existing CS-C4.5 algorithm. With regard to future research, much work needs to be undertaken. On the one hand, the current implementation of the algorithm deals only with binary class problems that is the principal limitation. In the future, the extending algorithm needs to be proposed to cope with multivariate class problems. On the other hand, a new decision tree pruning technique needs to be designed for minimal cost decision tree construction problem.
