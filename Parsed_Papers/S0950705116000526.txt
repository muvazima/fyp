                  Dimensionality reduction is an important pre-processing procedure for multi-label classification to mitigate the possible effect of dimensionality curse, which is divided into feature extraction and selection. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependence maximization (MDDM) represent two mainstream feature extraction techniques for unsupervised and supervised paradigms. They produce many small and a few large positive eigenvalues respectively, which could deteriorate the classification performance due to an improper number of projection directions. It has been proved that PCA proposed primarily via maximizing feature variance is associated with a least-squares formulation. In this paper, we prove that MDDM with orthonormal projection directions also falls into the least-squares framework, which originally maximizes Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Then we propose a novel multi-label feature extraction method to integrate two least-squares formulae through a linear combination, which maximizes both feature variance and feature-label dependence simultaneously and thus results in a proper number of positive eigenvalues. Experimental results on eight data sets show that our proposed method can achieve a better performance, compared with other seven state-of-the-art multi-label feature extraction algorithms.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Traditional supervised classification solves problems in which one instance has one label only [1], which is regarded as single-label classification. However, in many real-world applications, one instance are possibly associated with multiple labels simultaneously. For example, a sunrise picture is annotated by sky, sun and sea at the same time [2]; a piece of news belongs to environment protection, haze, and weather [3]; a protein is located in different sub-cellular locations simultaneously [4]. Such a learning task is referred to as multi-label classification. Recently multi-label classification has been paid much attention to in machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining and statistics. Thus a variety of multi-label classification methods were proposed, such as, kNN-type methods [5,6], SVM-like techniques [7–10], ensemble classifiers [11–13], and collective learning techniques [14,15], most of which have been reviewed extensively in [16–20].

On the other hand, recent technological innovations allow us to collect massive amount of data with a large number of features. Bellman [21] coined a well-known term, curse of dimensionality. For classification issue, such a term implies that for a given instance size, there is a maximum number of features above which the performance of a classifier will degrade rather than improve [22]. Additionally, this cure also results in a high computational complexity in practice. To alleviate its possible effect, dimensionality reduction becomes an effective way to remove the irrelevant, redundant and noisy features, which generally covers feature extraction [22], and feature selection [23]. In this paper, we only focus on feature extraction for dimensionality reduction.

Regardless of single-label and multi-label classification, feature extraction techniques mainly could be grouped into two categories: unsupervised and supervised. What differentiates them is whether class label information is exploited or not.

Unsupervised methods extract a small number of features without using label information to retain as much discriminant information as possible. A representative linear method is principal component analysis (PCA), which could be described from two different viewpoints. One is to find an orthogonal low-dimensional sub-space via maximizing feature variance [1,24,25], and the other is via minimizing a squared reconstruction error [25–29]. In addition, some complicated methods, e.g., locally linear embedding(LLE) [30], Laplacian eigenmap [31], locality preserving projections(LPP) [32] and ISOMAP [33], aim at finding a nonlinear low-dimensional sub-space through preserving the data manifold structures. In principle, these unsupervised approaches primarily in single-label classification could be directly applied to multi-label classification.

Conversely, supervised methods sufficiently and elaborately exploit label information in feature extraction procedures. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [1,25,34] is a typical single-label technique which obtains an optimal low-dimensional sub-space by maximizing the between-class scatter measure and minimizing the within-class scatter one at the same time. However, LDA cannot be directly applied to multi-label classification, since a multi-label instance belongs to several different classes simultaneously, and how much it should contribute to two scatter measures remains ambiguous. Therefore three generalized versions have been proposed. In [35], a multi-label instance is duplicated into several single-label ones and then a multi-label data set is converted into a single-label one, to fit LDA directly. To correct the over-counting problem in [35], multi-label LDA (MLDA) [36] is proposed as a weighted form, where the weights of each instance to all labels are estimated by label correlation information. Since the dimensions of low-dimensional sub-space from the above two methods does not exceed the number of classes minus 1, the between-class scatter matrix is changed in direct multi-label LDA (DMLDA) [37], to distinguish training instances that do not have a specific label from the mean vector of the instances belonging to this label.

Latent semantic indexing (LSI) turns to be a successful linear single-label feature extraction approach in document analysis and information retrieval [38]. Multi-label informed latent semantic indexing (MLSI) [39] extends LSI to obtain a low-dimensional sub-space which maximizes feature variance and binary label variance via a linear combination way. Theoretically, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) could be directly used in multi-label situation [40]. Further a least-squares formulation and its several regularized variants are extended for CCA in [41], which means that CCA could be converted into slightly different least-squares problems. Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) [42] is a non-parametric dependence measure which considers all modes of dependencies between all variables. Multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependence maximization (MDDM) [43] attempts to search for a low-dimensional sub-space by maximizing feature-label dependence using HSIC with orthonormal projection directions and orthonormal projected features respectively (MDDMp and MDDMf in detail).

It is worth noting that most of the aforementioned feature extraction methods can fall in a least-squares framework, including PCA, LDA, CCA, LPP, LLE and Laplacian eigenmaps [28], MDDMf [44] and MLDA [45]. But whether MDDMp could be associated with a least-squares issue is still an open problem. Additionally, PCA is concerned with feature data structure only, MLSI deals with feature and label data structures at the same time, CCA and MDDM consider dependence from features to labels, and multi-label LDA forms implicitly express the relationship between features and labels. According to matrix theory [46], PCA, MLSI and DMLDA could produce many small positive eigenvalues, whereas CCA, MDDM and MLDA result in a few large positive eigenvalues, both of which could deteriorate the multi-label classification performance because of an improper number of projection directions.

In this study, we will take feature data structure and feature-label dependence simultaneously into consideration explicitly, and derive a proper number of positive eigenvalues or projection directions. We prove that MDDMp also falls in the least-squares framework and then propose a novel multi-label feature extraction method to integrate two least-squares formulations in PCA and MDDMp linearly, which both maximizes feature variance and maximizes feature-label dependence at the same time. Therefore our method is referred to as MVMD simply. Based on multi-output linear ridge regression [1,25] as our multi-label baseline classifier, our experimental results on eight benchmark data sets illustrate that, with a proper number of projected features, our MVMD is overall superior to the aforementioned multi-label feature extraction techniques including PCA, two MDDM versions, CCA, MLSI, and MLDA and DMLDA, according to six instance-based performance evaluation measures (Hamming loss, accuracy, F1, precision, recall and subset accuracy) and computational time.

Summarily, the main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows: (a) we propose a least squares formulation for multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependence maximization with orthonormal projection directions (MDDMp); (b) via combing such a formulation with that of PCA linearly, a novel multi-label feature extraction approach is presented, which maximizes both feature variance and feature-label dependence simultaneously; (c) the extensive experiments on eight data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Multi-label feature extraction setting is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, PCA and its least-squares form are briefly introduced. Two MDDM versions are reviewed firstly and then a least-squares formulation for MDDMp is derived in Section 4. In Section 5 we propose and analyze our novel feature extraction algorithm (MVMD). The related work is formally summarized in Section 6. Section 7 is devoted to experiments with eight benchmark data sets. Finally this paper ends with some conclusions in Section 8.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular linear feature extraction methods under unsupervised paradigm, which can be described from two different perspectives. One is to find an optimal projection matrix through maximizing feature variance [1,24,25], and the other is via minimizing a squared reconstruction error [25–29]. In this section, we review PCA according to the second perspective. PCA is formulated as the following least-squares problem,

                     To minimize J(P), we should choose the d(< D) largest eigenvalues and their eigenvectors to construct P, which also corresponds to the d largest variances according to (13). Therefore we also explain that PCA maximizes feature variance essentially.

Now, there are two widely-used ways to determine the reduced dimensions d after all eigenvalues are sorted in descending order. One is to detect the d directly, and the other is adaptively to choose a smallest d such that

According to matrix theory [46], the rank of the real symmetric matrix X
                     
                        T
                     
                     X is min(l, D) at most; therefore, PCA produces many small positive eiginvalues and needs many projection directions for a larger threshold t, e.g., 0.999.

In this section, we review multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependence maximization (MDDM) [43] and then derive a corresponding least-squares formulation for MDDM form with orthonormal projection directions (i.e., MDDMp).

The Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) [42] is a non-parametric dependence measure which considers all modes of dependencies between all variables. With the linear kernels for both feature space and label one, the empirical estimate of HSIC is described as,

Through the threshold t, the q projection directions at most are chosen. It is ambiguous and difficult to select more directions since the remaining

Now, we prove that the above MDDMp is also associated with a least-squares formulation, similarly in PCA. Our optimization problem is formulated as,

In [44], the generalized eigenvalue problem (20) for MDDMf is converted into an eigenvalue one, and then its least-squares formulation is derived. But this transformation means that orthonormal projection features

In this section, we propose a novel multi-label linear feature extraction technique which linearly combines the objective function (6) in PCA with that (21) in MDDMp, to both maximize feature variance and maximize feature-label dependence simultaneously. Therefore our proposed method is referred to as MVMD simply.

The optimization problem of MVMD with orthonormal projection directions is designed as,

Compared our MVMD with MDDMf, there are two main differences. One is that our MVMD produces the orthonormal projection directions, whereas MDDMf the orthonormal projection features. The other is that the covariance matrix X
                     
                        T
                     
                     X occurs at the left side in MVMD which depends on the pre-defined balance factor, and at the right side in MDDMf which is associated with both the different eigenvalues and fixed regularization constant.

Additionally, according to matrix theory [46], the number of positive eigenvalues from our MVMD is min(l, D) at most. But it will be observed experimentally that MVMD would produce a few large eigenvalues and many small ones, which benefits to choose the proper reduced dimensions through the threshold t. The pseudo-code of MVMD is listed in Algorithm 1

In the Sections 3 and 4, we described PCA, MDDMp and MDDMf [24,43] in detail. In this section, we formally review four additional related multi-label feature extraction techniques including MLSI [39], CCA [22,41], MLDA [35,36] and DMLDA [37], according to the same notions in the above sections.

The MLSI [39] extends single-label unsupervised latent semantic indexing (LSI) to deal with multi-label feature extraction problem, which could be formalized as the following generalized eigenvalue problem,

The CCA [22,41] finds the correlations between two sets of data X and Y in a low-dimensional projected sub-space. For the projection matrix for X only, the following generalized eigenvalue problem with two regularization terms is usually considered,

According to matrix theory [46], the aforementioned feature extraction methods could be summarized as eigenvalue problems for PCA, MDDMp and MVMD, and generalized ones for MDDMf, CCA, MLSI, MLDA and DMLDA formally. Their left matrices are real symmetric and positive semi-definite; therefore all eigenvalues are real and non-negative. The number of positive eigenvalues is determined by the rank of these matrices, whose size at most is listed in the last column of Table 1
                     , where we assume that q < D and q < l. It is shown theoretically that MDDMp, MDDMf, CCA and MLDA only produce a few positive eigenvalues, whereas our MVMD, PCA, MLSI and MLDA derive many ones. But, it will experimentally be found out that our MVMD will result in a proper number of positive eigenvalues.

As mentioned in Section 1, we group the useful information in training sets into three parts: feature–feature, label–label and feature–label. Table 1 also lists which information is investigated by the above eight methods. It is shown that only our MVMD considers both feature–feature and feature-label information.

In this section, we compare our MVMD with seven existing multi-label feature extraction techniques experimentally. Before presenting our experimental results, we briefly introduce eight multi-label data sets, parameter settings for eight feature extraction methods and performance evaluation measures.

                        , and constructed three new biological data sets: Gnegative, Human and Eukaryote, as shown in Table 2, according to the dimensions of features in ascending order in the fifth column. Table 2 also provides some useful statistics of these data sets, such as, the number of training instances, testing instances, features and labels, and label cardinality respectively. These data sets cover three main multi-label applications: biology, scene and text.

For five existing data sets, the Image and Slashdot are partitioned into training and testing sets randomly in terms of 60% versus 40% by us, whereas the other three training and testing data sets are downloaded directly. For more detailed information and description for these five data sets please refer to their corresponding web sites and references therein. These partitioned data sets are also available at our lab homepage

In bioinformatics, an important task is to develop a computational method to predict the sub-cellular locations of proteins according to their sequences. It has been observed experimentally that some multiplex proteins can simultaneously exist at two or move between two or more different locations. Such a problem is a typical application of multi-label classification. In this paper, we constructed three data sets: Gnegative, Human and Eukaryote, using the following steps:

                                  respectively.

For each protein sequence, use Blastp
                                    6

                                  to search its homologous proteins from the Swiss–Prot database, with the expect value E ≤ 0.001. Then those homologous proteins which have ≥ 60% pairwise sequence identity are collected into a set with their accession numbers.

Search each of these accession numbers collected in the above step against the GO database
                                    7
                                 
                                 
                                    7

                                  to find out the corresponding GO (Gene ontology) numbers.

Construct a binary feature vector whose element indicates some GO number is present or not. Since there are lots of GO numbers, we compress each binary GO presentation data set via deleting those numbers which do not occur at the corresponding species.

Finally, partition each data set into its training and testing subsets according to 60% versus 40%.

Although this binary GO representation has been used in [4,47] with web servers, the corresponding training and testing data sets are not open and available yet. Particularly, for such three data sets, their dimensions of features are significantly greater than the number of instances (
                           
                              D

                        ).

In this paper, we chose seven existing multi-label feature extraction methods: principal component analysis (PCA) [1,24,25], multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependency maximization (MDDMp and MDDMf) [43], canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [40,41], multi-label informed latent semantic indexing (MLSI) [39], and multi-label linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) [36] and its direct version (DMLDA) [37], which will be compared with our MVMD.

PCA, MDDMp and our MVMD are formulated as eigenvalue problems, and CCA, MDDMf, MLSI, MLDA and DMLDA are depicted as generalized eigenvalue problems. The reduced dimensions d in (15) is automatically determined using the same threshold

All eight feature extraction methods are coded in Matlab. Our computational platform is a HP workstation with two Intel Xeon5675 CPUs and 32G RAM, and Matlab2010a.

In this paper, we adopt a train-test mode in our experiments to evaluate different feature extraction techniques, given a baseline classifier. The training sets are used to execute feature extraction methods to estimate the optimal projection matrix P, via which the original D-dimensional training and testing vectors are converted into d-dimensional ones. Then we train a multi-label classifier using low-dimensional training sets and validate the classification performance using corresponding testing sets. Our baseline multi-label classifier is multi-output linear ridge regression method with the regularization constant 0.01 [25].

In order to evaluate and compare different feature extraction methods, we need to exploit the performance of some multi-label classifier. Currently, more than ten performance evaluation measures for multi-label classification have been collected and introduced [17–20], since it is more complicated to evaluate a multi-label technique than a single-label one. In this paper, we choose six popular and indicative instance-based measures: Hamming loss, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and subset accuracy.

The Hamming loss estimates the percentage of labels, whose relevance is predicted incorrectly. The accuracy evaluates the percentage of relevant labels which are predicted correctly, out of union between predicted and true labels. The precision calculates the percentage of predicted labels that are relevant, while the recall computes the percentage of relevant labels that are predicted. Since the precision and recall conflict with each other, the F1 expresses the harmonic mean between the two. The subset accuracy indicates the percentage of relevant label subsets that are predicted entirely correctly. These six instance-based measures are defined as follows,

                        where Δ denotes the symmetric difference between two sets. Note that the percentage representation for these measures is used in the next sub-sections. It is desirable that a multi-label algorithm should achieve a smaller value for Hamming loss measure, and larger values for the other five ones, as shown in (48)–(53) using up and down arrows (↓ and ↑).

To sort the performance of multiple feature extraction methods for some given measure, we rank all methods, in which the best performing method gets the rank of 1, the second best rank 2, and in the case of ties average ranks are assigned. Then the average rank of each method over all data sets are calculated. According to the average ranks, we execute the Friedman test [48] with the significant level 
                           
                              
                                 α
                                 =
                                 0.05
                              
                              ,
                           
                         in which null hypothesis states that all methods are equivalent. If such a null hypothesis is rejected, we utilize Nemenyi test [48] for further analysis of pairwise comparisons, where the performance of two methods is significantly different if the corresponding average ranks differ by at least the critical difference for 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.05
                           
                        .

In this sub-section, we investigate the eigenvalue distribution and effect for eight feature extraction methods on Scene. After the 294 eigenvalues from its training set are sorted in descending order, all eigenvalues from each method are shown in Fig. 1
                        
                        
                         (a) and (b), and the 10 largest ones in Fig. 1 (a0) and (b0). We observe that the eigenvalues decrease slowly for PCA, MLSI and DMLDA between 1 and 294 (the dimensions of features), quickly for MDDMp, MDDMf, CCA and MLDA ranging from 1 to 6 (the number of labels), which is consistent with the theoretical analysis in the above section.

For our MVMD, its eigenvalues decrease dramatically fast between 1 and 6, which is similar to that of MDDMp, whereas its curve decreases very slowly ranging from 7 to 294, which looks like that of PCA.

For a fixed eigenvalue threshold, e.g., 
                           
                              
                                 t
                                 =
                                 0.999
                              
                              ,
                           
                         as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) using circles, PCA, MLSI and DMLDA require 271, 276 and 294 eigenvalues, whereas MDDMp, MDDMf, CCA and MLDA need 5, 6, 6 and 5 ones. But our MVMD has 47 eigenvalues, which are greater than 6 slightly and less than 294 greatly.


                        Fig. 2
                        
                        
                         shows six measure curves as functions of the number of sorted eigenvalues. For the eigenvalue threshold 
                           
                              t
                              =
                              0.999
                           
                         indicated by the circles, on six measures, we observe that:

                           
                              (a)
                              MDDMp, PCA, MLSI and DMLDA do not obtain the optimal values themselves, in which MDDMp produces 5 projected features and the others select 271, 276 and 294 projected features respectively.

MDDMf, CCA and MLDA achieve the best results themselves with 6, 6 and 5 projected features respectively.

With 47 projected features, our MVMD obtains the stable and optimal measure values, which are prior to those from the other seven methods.

From the above analysis, it is observed that our MVMD improves the multi-label performance via increasing the number of projected features properly, which could be detected by the eigenvalue threshold very stably and conveniently.

In this sub-section, we compare our MVMD with seven existing methods: PCA, MDDMp, MDDMf, CCA, MLSI, MLDA and DMLDA. Additionally, NULL indicates that no feature extraction is applied. The experimental results for six measures are shown in Tables 3–8. For nine methods on each data set, their ranks are denoted by 1–9 in the brackets, and their best measure value is highlighted in boldface. The average rank of each method over eight data sets is listed in the last row.

According to the average ranks from Tables 3–8, our MVMD obtains the top rank on Hamming loss, accuracy, F1, precision and subset accuracy measures, and the second one on recall measure. The MDDMf achieves the first rank on recall, which implies that MDDMf results in more predicted relevant labels. In addition, we calculate the overall average ranks of all methods over six measures, and then sort nine methods as MVMD(1.66), MDDMf(2.67), MDDMp(3.72), PCA(4.38), CCA(4.96), MLSI(6.16), MLDA(6.37), NULL(7.52) and DMLDA(7.57), as shown in Fig. 3
                        . It is shown that our proposed MVMD performs the best among eight multi-label feature extraction methods.

Using Friedman test [48], we calculate FF
                        =14.95(Hamming loss), 14.49(accuracy), 13.92(F1), 16.03(precision), 5.20(recall) and 14.18(subset accuracy), whose values are greater than the critical value of 
                           
                              F
                              (
                              8
                              ,
                              56
                              )
                              =
                              3.02
                           
                         for 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.05
                           
                        . Therefore, on six measures, all nine methods have different performance statistically.

We apply Nemenyi test for further analysis of pairwise comparisons [48]. The performance of two methods is significantly different if the corresponding average ranks differ by at least the critical difference (CD = 4.25) for 
                           
                              α
                              =
                              0.05
                           
                        . This test is illustrated in Fig. 4
                        , where groups of methods that are not significantly different are connected.

In Fig. 4 (1), (2), (3) and (6) our MVMD is linked with PCA, MDDMp, MDDMf and CCA. Six methods, i.e., MVMD, MDDMf, MDDMp, PCA, CCA and MLDA are linked together in Fig. 4 (4). In Fig. 4 (5), all techniques but DMLDA are connected with our MVMD.

Finally, we compare the size of projected feature set and the computational time, where the latter is costed by feature extraction approaches only, as shown in Tables 9
                         and 10.

From Table 9, we can group eight methods into three groups: MLDA, MDDMp, MDDMf and CCA with a few projected features, our MVMD with a proper number of projected features, and PCA, MLSI and DMLDA with lots of projected features, which is consist with our theoretical analysis in the above section. Our MVMD slightly sacrifices the size of projected feature subset to improve the multi-label performance further.

Theoretically,
                        
                         the time complexity to solve an eigenvalue problem is O(D
                        3) to calculate all D eigenvalues. The time difference among feature extraction techniques mainly comes from matrix construction. According to the average time listed in the last row of Table 10 for feature extraction procedures only, our MVMD runs almost as fast as PCA, and faster than the other six algorithms. Additionally, MLSI is time consuming due to large-scale inverse matrix computation.

From these experimental results and analysis, as a whole, it is demonstrated that, via increasing several projected directions properly, our MVMD works the best, compared with seven existing multi-label feature extraction techniques, according to six indicative measures and computational costs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Principal component analysis (PCA) and multi-label dimensionality reduction via dependency maximization (MDDM) are two effective multi-label feature extraction techniques. The former is already associated with a least-squares formulation. In this paper, we derive a least-squares formulation for MDDM with orthonormal projection directions too. Then we combine such two least-squares formulae via a linear combination way and thus construct a novel multi-label feature extraction approach to maximize both feature variance and feature-label dependence, i.e., MVMD simply. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on eight benchmark data sets demonstrate that, with a proper number of projected features, our MVMD is a competitive candidate for multi-label feature extraction, compared with seven existing methods, according to six instance-based performance measures (Hamming loss, accuracy, F1, precision, recall and subset accuracy) and computational costs. In future work, we will solve MVMD through its least-squares problem directly.
